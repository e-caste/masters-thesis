00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.540
IAIN STEWART: --play
with each other.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.350
We did the standard model
as an effective field

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.780
theory, higher
dimension operators

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.220
in the standard model.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.950
And then we started talking
about taking the standard model

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.340
as a theory one and
removing things from it,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.380
in particular
constructing what's

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.590
called the weak Hamiltonian
by removing the top W, Z,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.260
and Higgs from the
standard model.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.670
And last time, we were focusing
on the anomalous dimensions

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.640
and things about
renormalization.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.790
So we had this equation
for the weak Hamiltonian

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.220
for a particular case
of b goes to c u bar d.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.900
That was the case
that we decided

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.660
to study rather than
the full Hamiltonian.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.130
So there was some pre-factor.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.680
We had two operators with Wilson
coefficients and operators.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.790
These are four-fermion
operators.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.040
And there was different bases.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.577
We could write them
in the bare form,

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:16.660
or we could write them in
renormalized coefficient

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.650
and renormalized operator.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.800
And then we could do it
either in the 1, 2 basis

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.970
or the plus minus basis.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.330
So the plus minus basis is
just linear combinations

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.050
of the 1, 2.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.000
If you're in the 1,
2 basis, then you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.300
have this mixing matrix.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.325
So it's a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:36.760
So if you're in the
plus minus basis,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.100
then at least, at
the lowest order,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.540
it's a simple product equation.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.690
So plus doesn't
interfere with minus.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.110
OK.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.730
So that's where we got to,
and we'll just continue today.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.390
So we have these anomalous
dimension equations

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.493
for the operators.

00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:02.660
We can also write down
anomalous dimension equations

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.770
for the Wilson coefficients.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.396
How do we do that?

00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:10.542
Well, the way that we do that
is we make use of the fact

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:14.060
that, if we look at the first
line here, there's no mu.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.173
So the Hamiltonian
is mu independent.

00:02:17.173 --> 00:02:19.340
That means that the mu
dependence of the coefficient

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.420
cancels the mu dependence
of the operator.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.458
And you can use that to
take an anomalous dimension

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.000
equation for the
operator and turn it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.729
into one for the coefficient.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.365
So last time, we
talked about the fact

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:43.990
that the normalization
of the operators

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.310
was equivalent
to-- you can think

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.330
about it two different ways.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.538
There's renormalization of
operators, renormalization

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:49.240
of coefficients.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.633
Likewise, you can think
of anomalous dimensions

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.050
is either running
the coefficients

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.160
or running the operators.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.320
So those are equivalent things.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.260
And the thing that
makes them equivalent

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.720
is just imposing that the
derivative with respect

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.310
to mu of the Hamiltonian is 0.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.890
So if I use my equation up
here for anomalous dimension

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.080
of the operator, I get, with my
sign convention, a minus sign

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.715
here.

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.560
Or I had a minus sign here.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.640
I had no minus sign here.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.010
These things are conventions.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.650
I picked some convention,
and I'll stick with it.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.235
So from this
equation, we basically

00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:43.610
have an equation that has to
be true for the coefficients

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.830
if we think of just
stripping off the operator.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.737
So we could write it this
way, just reading it off right

00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:10.820
from here, just putting
this guy on the other side

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.640
and then reading it off,
dropping the operator.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.800
Or we could write
it this way if we

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.630
wanted to write
it in a way that's

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.610
more similar to this
equation up here, where

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.780
you have the anomalous dimension
matrix times the coefficient.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.620
It's either from the
right or from the left,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.593
and it's just a
matter of transposing.

00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:29.510
So the anomalous dimension
for the coefficient

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.660
is determined from the
one, this one here.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.160
If you know it,
then you immediately

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.490
know the one for the
coefficient, which

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.040
shouldn't be surprising given
that we could think of the Z

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.820
factors as being related
to renormalization factors.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.970
Anomalous dimensions, therefore,
should also be related.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.030
OK, so we'll solve
this equation.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.080
It's a little bit
simpler to think about.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.538
Although we could
have equivalently

00:04:54.538 --> 00:04:56.687
solve the operator equation.

00:04:56.687 --> 00:04:58.020
So how do we solve the equation?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.300
Well, we go over to
our plus minus basis.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.850
So take the coefficient
of either C+ or C-.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.740
And the equation
that we need to solve

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.115
can be written as follows.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.750
It's a simple equation.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.790
And I can even take the C,
which is on the right-hand side,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.950
move it over to the left,
if I write log C here.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.560
Because the derivative of the
log is giving me a 1 over C.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.560
If I put it back over here,
it would just multiply.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.330
OK, so that's the analog.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.550
This equation here is the
analog of this equation

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.260
here for the operators, but
now for the coefficients.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.760
Obviously, if these are numbers,
there's no transpose to do.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.810
So you have to solve this
equation simultaneously

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.350
with another
differential equation.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.698
This is a coupled equation
because alpha also

00:06:02.698 --> 00:06:03.865
has a differential equation.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.350
So at lowest order, this is
the beta function equation.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.340
And so if we want to solve,
take into account this equation

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.610
and integrate this equation,
the simple trick for doing that

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.250
is to make a change of variable.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.040
So we use this equation here
to make a change of variable.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.350
This is a very useful
trick because it actually

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.360
works to whatever
order in the expansion

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.896
that you might want to work.

00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:49.780
So let me explain what the
trick is, and then I'll

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.480
explain why that is.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.890
So we're going to change
variables in this equation

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:54.880
from mu to alpha.

00:07:01.658 --> 00:07:03.950
You see we could think about
solving this equation here

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.820
by integrating, just move
this thing to the other side

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.230
and integrate.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.080
But we'd be integrating,
in mu, a function that's

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.910
a function of alpha of mu.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.985
So if we can switch
from mu to alpha,

00:07:16.985 --> 00:07:19.110
then we'll be just integrating
a function of alpha.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.770
And that's what we're going
to do using this equation.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.050
So if I write it in general,
that's this equality here.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.610
For any function of alpha,
I say that d mu over mu--

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.730
just rearranging this equation--
is d alpha over beta of alpha.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.940
So I can switch the
integration d mu over mu

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.040
to d alpha over beta of alpha.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.800
And that's exactly
what I want to do

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.650
if I want to move this
operator to the other side,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.082
this operation.

00:08:01.082 --> 00:08:03.040
If I work at lowest order
in the beta function,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.710
then that's just I just
plug in this result.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.180
So we can switch variables
from mu to alpha.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.360
And if I had high order terms
in this equation and high order

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.810
terms in this equation, I
could use the same trick.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.575
I just have other
integrals to do.

00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:20.450
And the integrals are
pretty straightforward,

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.260
so this is a useful
way of proceeding.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.760
OK.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.750
So what does that do?

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.770
So now, let's do that.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.764
Let's move this
over and integrate.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:41.400
Well, we'll do a definite
integral from mu w up to mu.

00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:49.300
So here, we just
have d log this.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.610
Integrate that-- just gives
log between the limits.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.010
And if I didn't change
variable, I would have that.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.950
But if I make the
change variable,

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.600
then it becomes a
very simple integral.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.890
And remember that
this guy here is also

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:46.150
just a number times alpha
that we worked out last time.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.590
So this is just d
alpha over alpha.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.410
And that's a simple
logarithmic integral.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.030
Yeah.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.530
AUDIENCE: I don't
know if it matter,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.340
but mu w should be
greater than mu, right?

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.380
IAIN STEWART: Mu w should
be greater than mu.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.040
That's right.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.957
AUDIENCE: OK, so you're
just writing integrals

00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:06.324
like that to avoid signs?

00:10:06.324 --> 00:10:07.596
OK.

00:10:07.596 --> 00:10:08.708
I have another question.

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:09.500
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.830
AUDIENCE: How do you know
that the anomalous dimensions,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.474
including the beta function,
are only functions of alpha S

00:10:15.474 --> 00:10:16.630
rather than [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.530
IAIN STEWART: Ah, yeah.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.750
So I'm sneaking that in here.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.580
So it follows from the
renormalization structure

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.070
of this effective field
theory that there's only

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.250
single logarithmic divergences.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.890
So in the standard model,
if you're at one loop,

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.500
you only have 1 over epsilon
poles for the renormalization.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.470
And you're renormalizing
the coupling.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.220
The same is true of
this effective theory.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.640
At one loop, you only have
1 over epsilon divergences.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.450
And that implies that
your anomalous dimensions

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.340
won't depend on anything
more complicated.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.180
We will discuss more
complicated cases in the future,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.740
as you know.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:00.080
But the structure of this
effective theory and its UV

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.460
structure, which I didn't go
into on a lot of detail about,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.510
implies that fact.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.010
Yeah.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.092
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.040
OK.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.860
So do the integral.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:19.120
There's some pre-factor,
which I'll call a+-.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.100
And then I get a
log, as I mentioned.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.620
And just for the
record, this a+-,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.020
if I put all the factors
together and put in what this

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:43.990
number is, these would be
some factors like this.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.350
And I've put in that Nc is 3.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.340
So this alpha at mu w
and this C+ of mu w,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.960
you should think of mu w as
the boundary condition scale.

00:12:02.202 --> 00:12:03.660
So this is a
differential equation.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.330
We needed a boundary
condition to solve it.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.220
And the boundary
condition is the value

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.195
of the coefficients
at the scale uw, which

00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:14.445
is supposed to be of order Mw.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.100
Typically, what
that means is you

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.110
could take a common
choice, which

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.020
would be just to take it equal.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.740
Or you could pick twice or half.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.220
And these are the most common
choices that people pick.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.490
So the way that you
should think of that,

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.060
this guy in the
denominator, is you

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.860
should think that he's really
a fixed order series in alpha

00:12:52.860 --> 00:13:02.970
of mu w, something that you
would calculate order by order

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.180
and perturbation theory.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.060
And you'd be determining
the boundary condition.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.420
We'll talk about how you would
do that a little later today.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.770
But for now, just think of it
as a series in alpha of mu w.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.500
And it doesn't have
any large logarithms.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.480
And as Elia said,
you want to think

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.040
of this mu as some small scale,
some scale that's less than uw

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.690
because you're
thinking of evolving

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.145
the operators to a scale
less than the scale

00:13:30.145 --> 00:13:31.770
where you integrated
out the particles.

00:13:34.322 --> 00:13:35.780
I'll draw that
picture in a second.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.470
So we can take the
exponential of that equation,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.220
and then we can write C of
mu is equal to something

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.638
that we've determined.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.090
Take the exponential.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.520
Move this guy to the other side.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.910
Remember the a+-
are just numbers.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.730
We can write the solution in
this way, where we determine

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.250
this guy by thinking about
doing a matching calculation

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.090
at the high scale.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.810
We determine it to be 1/2
already at the lowest order.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.100
So think about
sticking in 1/2 here.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.030
And then this factor
here is what you get

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.192
from the renormalization group.

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:03.900
And you can see from
this form right here

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.192
that you've summed up an
infinite number of logarithms.

00:15:06.192 --> 00:15:07.860
It's exponential of
a number times log.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:14.280
And if I were to expand that out
in alpha of some fixed scale,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.280
there would be an infinite
series in logarithms.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.810
OK.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.610
So what do we want to
pick this mu to be?

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:29.180
Well, we're thinking about the
process mu goes to c u bar d.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.700
If you think about
this process in nature,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.350
the scale in the initial state
here is the b has a mass.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.668
So you'd like to take this
scale here not at Mw, but down

00:15:39.668 --> 00:15:40.460
at the b core mass.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.350
So we want mu to be of order Mb.

00:15:55.776 --> 00:15:58.430
And then you have a large
hierarchy because this

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.280
is much less than Mw--

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.160
5 g of e-ish, 80 g of e.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:23.620
So our result here sums what are
called the leading logarithms,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.360
which is denoted by LL.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.960
And schematically, the
lowest order term was 1/2.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.130
And if we were to expand
higher order terms

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.380
and think about what
logarithms we're talking about,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.130
we're talking about
logarithms of Mw over Mb.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.810
And the series, if
we were to expand it,

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:53.195
would look like
this schematically

00:16:53.195 --> 00:16:58.100
without worrying about
the coefficients,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.330
an infinite series where each
term has one alpha and one log.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.480
So the counting
that you're doing

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.500
in this type of setup,
where we would think

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:25.020
of using this equation to
go down to the scale Mb,

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:30.845
is that you're counting
this parameter as order 1.

00:17:30.845 --> 00:17:32.220
And you're saying,
any time I see

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.388
a log of Mw over
Mb times an alpha,

00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:36.180
I'm not going to count
that as order alpha.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.010
I'm going to count
that as order 1.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.170
That's why I have to sum
up this infinite series.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.390
So the physical picture
of what we've said here

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.617
is the following.

00:17:54.395 --> 00:17:55.853
So the basic physical
picture would

00:17:55.853 --> 00:17:58.990
be that there's two
scales, Mw an Mb, which

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.220
are physical scales.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.590
You want to get rid
of the scale Mw.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.290
You do that by going over to
this electroweak Hamiltonian.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.850
But then you have
to renormalization

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.300
group evolve Hamiltonian down to
the scale where you want to do

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.300
physics, which is the scale Mb.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.890
And when you do that, there's
some choice in the matter.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.400
And we've been careful to
parameterize that choice.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.420
We said that you
pick a scale that's

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.943
of order Mw, which
we called mu w.

00:18:25.943 --> 00:18:27.610
And then we said, you
pick another scale

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.355
that's of order Mb,
which we called mu.

00:18:30.355 --> 00:18:32.230
And you actually do the
renormalization group

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.570
between these two.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:39.400
You could pick Mw and
mu equal exactly Mb.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.580
That would be another
simpler story.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.100
But it is actually
important that,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.960
once you go beyond
the lowest order,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.900
to keep track of the fact
that you have this freedom.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.240
And that's why I've
kept track over here.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.660
So what that means is
that, in terms of counting,

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:05.280
you've counted this,
but logs of mu or Mw

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.380
were counted as order 1.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.760
And then down here,
logs of mu over B

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.900
are counted as order 1 numbers.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:21.810
It could be 0, but 0 is
order 1, not enhanced

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.230
such that they would compensate
for a factor of alpha.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.810
And this is the renormalization
group evolution or the running

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.560
that sums up these logarithms
here, which are the large logs.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.940
And that's pretty simple.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.580
It just gave this factor.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.253
And that's pretty common
in QCD to get factors

00:19:45.253 --> 00:19:46.920
like that, alpha at
one scale over alpha

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.260
at another scale
raised to a power.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.780
That's a very common thing to
get from renormalization group

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.817
evolution.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.860
OK, any questions so far?

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.720
How many people have
done the calculation

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.480
of the anomalous dimension
for four-fermion operators

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.680
in some other course?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.870
It's a common problem.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:24.560
Nobody?

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.905
All right.

00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:27.530
That means you'll
see it on a homework.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.510
So let's come back
here and think

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.960
about what the general
structure of what we've done is.

00:20:55.937 --> 00:20:57.020
And I'll put back indices.

00:21:09.738 --> 00:21:12.030
So you can think about taking
the solution that we have

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:16.320
at the top of the board
here and generalizing it

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.937
to a form that would be
valid at higher orders.

00:21:18.937 --> 00:21:21.270
And basically, it says that
the coefficient at one scale

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.310
is connected to the
coefficient at another scale

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.350
times some evolution factor.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.850
In this case, the
evolution factor

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.010
is just the ratio of
these alphas to a power.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.140
It could be some more
complicated function

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.100
at higher orders.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.520
And it could even be a matrix.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.895
That's why I've
given it indices.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.420
So we can put our
results back together

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.520
using this higher order
form, so that they're

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.430
generally true,
into our Hamiltonian

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.035
and see what we've achieved.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.840
And let me call this scale
that I was calling mu a minute

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.440
ago mu b just to remind you
that it's a scale of order Mb.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.390
So previously, we had the
coefficient and the operator

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.247
at the same scale.

00:22:38.247 --> 00:22:40.580
But now, using this equation,
I can move the coefficient

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.510
to a different scale.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.140
And so let me think of
sticking this equation in.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.700
And then I have mu w.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.810
I've called mu equals mu b.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.860
So now, this is mu w mu b.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:57.890
So this here is the
coefficient Ci at mu b,

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.540
but I find it useful
to write it out.

00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:07.760
So the thing in square
brackets is Ci mu b,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.120
but I write it out using
the renormalization group

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.800
equation that way.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.560
And this tells you how
you're doing the calculation.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.250
This is a fixed
order calculation.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:26.330
This comes from
anomalous dimensions

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.940
and gives you the evolution.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.730
And then you have operators
involving the B quark

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:38.960
that you would calculate
matrix elements of at mu

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.330
b of order Mb.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.500
And there's no dependence at all
in those operators on the scale

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.270
Mw.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.338
All the Mw's are in
the pre-factors here.

00:23:49.338 --> 00:23:50.630
You've taken that into account.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.720
You've calculated it.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.180
OK, so that's how this
organizes the physics

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.030
of the different scales.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.117
So you could ask,
if I had this story,

00:24:03.117 --> 00:24:04.450
how would I go to higher orders?

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.730
And we will have some
discussion of what

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.400
goes on at higher orders because
there are some things that

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.912
happen at higher orders that
you don't see at leading order.

00:24:11.912 --> 00:24:13.870
And they're actually
important physical things,

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.147
so important things
to know about and keep

00:24:16.147 --> 00:24:18.230
track of if you ever want
to use things like this.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.040
So let's talk a little
bit about what it

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.270
takes to go to higher orders.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.550
So let's just first
think about what

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:39.990
it would look like if we
went to higher orders.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.680
Well, leading order was a series
that I could schematically say

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.500
is alpha times large logs.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.920
And I summed them all up, and
I called that leading log.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.750
When I go to higher
orders, I am going

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:57.315
to continue to get series, but
I got extra factors of alpha.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.490
So something that you call
Next to Leading Log, or NLL,

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.400
is the same type of thing, a
different series than that 1

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.970
times an extra factor of alpha.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.110
So it's down compared
to this by alpha S.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.160
And then you keep going.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.370
This is the general structure
of the renormalization group

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:29.690
improved perturbation theory.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.380
Just keep adding Ns and
keep adding alphas, always

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.250
summing up some series which
changes from order to order.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.960
And that summation
of that series

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.700
is determined by
determining higher order

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.710
anomalous dimensions.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:56.690
So this kind of thing is called
renormalization group improved

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.620
perturbation theory.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.490
Every time you take alpha S
and you take it at some scale,

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.680
you're already doing
renormalization group

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.120
improved perturbation theory.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.247
It's just that, once
you have theories

00:26:10.247 --> 00:26:12.830
that have other things that run
and have anomalous dimensions,

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.340
then it can be more complicated
than just simply picking alpha

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.380
S at the appropriate scale.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.870
Here, in this theory, we
have these coefficients.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:21.835
We have to run them.

00:26:21.835 --> 00:26:23.960
Then we have to pick them
at the appropriate scale.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.670
And that's what we're
doing by solving

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.750
these renormalization
group equations.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.250
OK.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.520
So what do we need to do?

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.410
We determined this.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.660
I showed you what you
needed to do to get that.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.210
What would we need to do to get
the next term in the series?

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.340
How much would we
have to compute?

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.930
Well, we just have to
go to one higher order

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.340
in the perturbation theory.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:27:00.290
So let's make a
little table of what

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.900
it takes to get leading
log, next leading log.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.350
Maybe we'll even
add one more term.

00:27:12.813 --> 00:27:14.480
So there's two parts
to the calculation.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.910
There's the boundary
condition, and then there's

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:23.150
the differential equation, which
is the anomalous dimension.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.480
At leading log, we had
tree level matching.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.480
We determined the C plus
and minus where 1/2.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.990
C1 and C2 were 1 and 0.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.980
And we just needed the one
loop anomalous dimension.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.090
And then we just keep
going in this pattern.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:44.330
So next leading log, we
need to match it one loop.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:49.220
And we would need the
two-loop anomalous dimension

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.050
and et cetera.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.647
So the order in which
you need the running

00:27:55.647 --> 00:27:57.980
is one higher order than what
you need for the matching.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.820
That's the rule.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.400
And given those
ingredients, we would

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.860
be able to determine exactly
these series here, OK?

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.012
So there's some things
that happen at this order

00:28:18.012 --> 00:28:19.970
that aren't really apparent
yet at leading log,

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.980
and so I want to talk a
little bit about that.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.590
Before we get there, let me
add one other little note.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.290
This operator O2, we didn't see
it when we thought originally

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:44.980
about matching.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.100
It had Wilson coefficient
that was 0 at tree level.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.410
So at leading order, you
could say that this Wilson

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.020
coefficient is 0.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.760
But at leading log, it's not 0.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.070
So I have these two different
types of perturbation theory.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.200
Just order by order
and alpha or doing

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.847
renormalization
group improvement,

00:29:11.847 --> 00:29:12.930
you get different results.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:21.120
And that's because you've
included some higher order

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.110
terms by using the
renormalization group improved

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.720
version.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.960
But you can argue, if alpha
times the large log is order 1,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.410
then this is the right type
of perturbation theory to do.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:45.030
So if you think about it as
a picture where this is mu,

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:51.720
this is Mw, this is Mb, then
you have two coefficients, C1

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.470
and C2.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:55.890
We call them C+ and C-,
but they're just related.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.200
And the results that we
derived at leading order

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:04.590
were that, for C1, it started
at 1 at the high scale,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.740
basically, if we
mu w equal to Mw.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.930
And it would evolve,
actually, this direction

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:14.820
if we put in all the signs that
came out of our calculations.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.360
And for C2, it starts at 0 here,
and then it evolves this way

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.248
to a negative value.

00:30:21.248 --> 00:30:22.212
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:42.330
So roughly putting
in some numbers,

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:46.470
the kind of thing that
we would get is this.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.860
So a coefficient which was 0 all
of a sudden becomes minus 0.3

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.320
and becomes something that
you have to keep track of.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.280
That's at leading log.

00:30:56.793 --> 00:30:58.460
Obviously, when you
go to higher orders,

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.755
those numbers will be
perturbatively improved.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.600
OK.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.510
So is the physical picture
here clear of what's happening

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.180
with these operators?

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.855
So what is the application?

00:31:14.855 --> 00:31:18.292
Since we spent all this
time deriving these results,

00:31:18.292 --> 00:31:20.000
we should have some
applications in mind.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.570
So for b to c u bar d, if you
ask about what process that

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:52.550
gives, well, one
process that it gives

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.285
is just a B to D pi transition.

00:31:56.285 --> 00:32:00.230
B bar is built over u bar b.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:04.220
And this guy is u bar c.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.050
And the pi is the u bar d.

00:32:08.783 --> 00:32:11.200
So we can think of the reason
we're studying this is maybe

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.880
we want to calculate B of D pi.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.850
So if we wanted to
calculate B of D pi,

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:20.650
we take matrix elements
involving our Hamiltonian

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.270
with a B [INAUDIBLE] in the
in state and a D pi in the out

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:23.770
state.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.670
And if we just use the
original Hamiltonian

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.740
that we wrote down with
the renormalization group

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.810
improvement, then
we would have that.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:43.760
That's with that renormalization
group improvement.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.450
So this is at mu equals Mw.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:47.890
And the problem
with this formula

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.990
is that this matrix
element has large logs.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.190
It depends on Mw.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.450
It also depends on Mb.

00:33:00.342 --> 00:33:02.050
And if it's something
we can't calculate,

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.420
then that's kind of bad news.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.170
In particular, having
large logs like that

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.087
would also make it hard
to calculate something

00:33:08.087 --> 00:33:09.140
like this on the lattice.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.030
So it's not just a--

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.290
It's really a problem.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.267
If you have multiple
scales tied together,

00:33:15.267 --> 00:33:16.850
it just makes the
calculations harder.

00:33:20.445 --> 00:33:22.320
It's also a problem for
dimensional analysis.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.700
Because if you have
large logs, that

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.900
means you've got large numbers.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.090
And something that you
thought was of a certain size

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.280
might be bigger or smaller.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.830
So what we do is, instead, we
work in the renormalization

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:39.630
group improved version where we
take this down at the scale Mb.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.580
So this guy includes the
renormalization group

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.160
evolution.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.690
We use our results over there.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.870
And then we've got the
operators at the scale Mb,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.070
and there's no large logs.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.600
OK, so you'd want to
calculate something

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.090
like this on the lattice
or some other way.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.250
There's other ways of doing it.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.930
And we'll talk about other
ways of doing it later on.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.630
But so far, we've
separated out the scale Mw

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.659
into this coefficient
that's evaluated

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:15.070
at the scale of mu equals Mb.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.230
OK.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.000
So the one way of
thinking about this

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.670
is, if you want to do
physics at the scale Mb,

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:37.989
the right couplings to use in
your theory are these ones.

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.030
Forget about what's going
on at the high scale.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.565
You have to determine
the low energy

00:34:41.565 --> 00:34:43.690
couplings that are appropriate
to the theory you're

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.739
dealing with.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.800
And those are the C's at Mb, OK?

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.880
All right.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.380
OK.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.990
So now, I want to come back
to this question of thinking

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.390
about the next leading log.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.850
And I'm going to do
that by going back

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:26.230
to our comparison of full
theory to effective theory.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.620
We'll do a comparison of
results in the full theory

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.120
and results in the
effective theory.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.230
And I'll show you how, by
making that comparison,

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:40.090
we can determine the ingredients
that we need for this one loop

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.652
matching here.

00:35:41.652 --> 00:35:43.210
So we'll focus on this.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.080
So we already renormalized
the effective theory.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.450
So we can compare the
renormalized effective theory

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.170
and full theory.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.080
And that's the right
way to proceed.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.070
So in our parlance of
theory one and theory two,

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.490
the effective theory
would be theory two.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.310
We have to think about the full
theory, which in our parlance

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.800
would be theory one,
the full theory being

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.800
the standard model here.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:28.390
We have to think about
renormalizing that theory.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.580
But in the standard
model, our calculation

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.795
involves conserved currents.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.350
These are just a weak currents.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.522
And so there's actually
no extra UV divergences

00:36:41.522 --> 00:36:42.730
associated to those currents.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.819
We just have coupling
renormalization.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.860
And one way of saying
this is that what happens

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.600
is that the vertex
in the wave function

00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:03.728
graphs, the UV
divergences cancel

00:37:03.728 --> 00:37:04.770
or the conserved current.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.170
So the result for
the full theory

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:18.170
will be some result that
is independent of having--

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.402
it doesn't have any
ultraviolet divergences.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.690
And like the effective
theory, where

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.815
you had to carry out a
renormalization of operators

00:37:28.815 --> 00:37:30.342
in that theory, for
the full theory,

00:37:30.342 --> 00:37:32.050
coupling renormalization
is all there is.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.750
So let's draw the
full theory graphs.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:51.470
Gluons should be green.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.880
Maybe my w should be pink.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:36.030
Six permutations--
and then there's also

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.682
wave function normalization.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:41.430
OK.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.472
So if you want to do the
full theory calculation,

00:38:43.472 --> 00:38:45.000
these are the
graphs you compute.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.070
It's triangles as
well as box integrals.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.074
It's actually a much
harder calculation

00:38:50.074 --> 00:38:51.580
than in the effective theory.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.910
And I'm not going to
do the calculation,

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.785
but I'll tell you what
the results look like.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.090
So let's start by
thinking about the logs.

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.850
And then we'll talk
about the constants that

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:15.975
are under the logs as well.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:26.100
So if we look at
this calculation,

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.390
it has the following form.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:56.810
So there's S1, which
was some spinners.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.443
We defined it in
an earlier lecture.

00:39:59.443 --> 00:40:00.860
There's something
involving a log,

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.260
and it has a p squared. p
squared was the off-shellness

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.790
associated to these guys.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:09.000
And we regulated the infrared
divergences with p squared.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.710
So p squared not equal to
0 regulates IR divergences.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:19.160
And there are IR divergences
in these diagrams.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.750
Even though I said
they are UV finite,

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.000
they're not finite
in the infrared.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.282
And that's what leads to
these logs of p squared.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.750
OK.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.250
Now, I didn't write everything.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.250
I only wrote the pieces
proportional to S1.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:42.390
There's pieces proportional
to the other spinner, S2.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:44.802
And there's mod log terms.

00:40:44.802 --> 00:40:46.260
And they're all
hiding in the dots.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:53.070
So let's compare this result
to a similar expression

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:58.020
in the effective
theory that we just

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.690
set the coefficients to the
values at the high scale.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.520
So then we have 1
for the coefficient

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.150
times the one-loop
matrix element of O1,

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.730
which we wrote down earlier.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:18.030
And it looks kind of similar to
this, but not exactly the same.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.400
It's very similar, but
not precisely the same.

00:41:38.476 --> 00:41:44.480
A similar statement applies
to these guys over here, OK?

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.940
So the difference is
really that, instead

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.027
of Mw squared in this
log, we have a mu squared.

00:41:49.027 --> 00:41:51.110
That's really the only
difference for these terms.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.000
With constant terms, the
non-logarithmic terms

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.470
here and here won't agree.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.360
And we'll talk about
those things in a minute.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.200
So what do we learn by thinking
about the physics of these two

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.130
equations?

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.980
Well, one comment is
the comment I already

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.240
said, that the effective theory
computation for this line

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.730
here is much, much
easier than this one.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.740
So one reason to use
effective field theory

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.590
is just that it makes
computations easier.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.422
And the reason it makes
computations easier

00:42:27.422 --> 00:42:28.880
is because you're
basically dealing

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.750
with one scale at a time.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.530
And whenever you have integrals
involving only one scale,

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.740
that's always much easier
than having multiple scales.

00:42:41.908 --> 00:42:44.450
But if you want to encode all
the physics of the full theory,

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.700
you'll still have to do that
calculation at some point

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.480
as well.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.030
Although you may be able to do
it in a simpler configuration

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.738
to get off the
information that you need.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.083
Furthermore, if you really
only cared about the logs,

00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:01.250
then all you really need
is the 1 over epsilon term.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:06.320
And that's even easier than
the full triangle diagrams.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.250
So to compute the
anomalous dimensions,

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:13.200
you just have to
keep the divergences.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.210
And you can throw away
all the finite pieces.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:18.568
And that's even easier.

00:43:18.568 --> 00:43:21.110
So you can organize things by
thinking about doing the easier

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.443
calculations first.

00:43:22.443 --> 00:43:23.360
That's what people do.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.818
They calculate
anomalous dimensions

00:43:24.818 --> 00:43:29.110
before they calculate matching
because it's just easier.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:31.610
And it's also the thing you
need for the leading log result.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.068
You don't need the matching at
one loop for the leading log

00:43:34.068 --> 00:43:36.440
result. So there's a
conservation of ease

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.370
and what you need.

00:43:41.795 --> 00:43:43.670
These two things play
nicely with each other.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:53.860
Second point-- in
the effective theory,

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:57.200
you're supposed to think
that Mw goes to infinity.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.540
And that's why this thing
doesn't know about Mw.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.810
So how could it
possibly get an Mw?

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.630
And so what happens is that
Mw gets replaced by the cut

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:05.680
off, which is mu here.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.080
Another point that we can
make about this-- if you

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.090
look at the logs
of minus p squared,

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.550
they're all the same
between the two equations.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:41.118
That's actually
important because what

00:44:41.118 --> 00:44:43.660
that means is that the infrared
structure of the two theories

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.160
agree.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.120
The logs of p squared are
the infrared divergences.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.642
They agree between the higher
theory and the lower theory.

00:44:51.642 --> 00:44:52.600
And they have to agree.

00:44:56.503 --> 00:44:58.420
What this tells you about
the effective theory

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.523
is that you're doing
something right.

00:45:01.523 --> 00:45:03.940
In particular, it tells you
that your effective theory has

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.148
the right degrees of freedom.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.642
That's almost trivial
in this example.

00:45:10.642 --> 00:45:12.850
What other degrees of freedom
could we possibly think

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:13.990
that would be missing?

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.660
But in more
complicated examples--

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.400
and we will deal with at
least one such example later

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.820
in the course--

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.510
it's not so trivial to see
that these things match up.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.880
And people have discovered
new degrees of freedom

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.860
by doing matching
computations like this.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.027
They said, oh, this is a
relevant degree of freedom.

00:45:35.027 --> 00:45:35.980
And it's needed.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.370
Because if I do a
one-loop calculation,

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.997
I need it to get the
infrared divergences right.

00:45:41.997 --> 00:45:44.330
So this can really teach you
about the effective theory,

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:46.780
doing a matching
computation, teach you

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.550
about the physics of
the effective theory.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.455
So if you made a mistake,
this would be a place

00:45:53.455 --> 00:45:54.580
where you'd catch yourself.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.670
Now, that you've analyzed
fully what the differences are,

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:10.870
you can subtract them.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.290
You take the difference of
the renormalized calculations.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.850
And that is what gives
you one-loop matching.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.770
Just like we compared
tree level calculations

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.500
to get tree level matching, we
compare one-loop calculations

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.770
to get one-loop matching.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:48.630
So [INAUDIBLE] we do that.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:53.580
At tree level, if we're just
looking at the S1 pieces,

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.760
we have these two terms.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.250
And then at one-loop--

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.120
let me use this notation.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.980
This is the full A.
So it has a tree level

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.150
piece and one-loop piece.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:10.400
Then we take the piece of
the C1 that's at one loop.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.520
And we take the matrix
element of the operator,

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.490
evaluate it order alpha.

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:29.660
And then there's C2 terms.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.590
Let me just put dots.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.692
OK, so there's two ways
that I can get an alpha.

00:47:40.692 --> 00:47:42.150
There's an order
alpha coefficient.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:45.210
That's what I want to know,
what you want to determine.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.120
And then there's an order
alpha matrix element.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.110
So by subtracting, putting
this guy on the left-hand side,

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:55.800
I get the value of C1 of 1.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.550
So we use this equation
to determine this.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.250
And the story would be similar
if I kept all the C2 terms.

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:07.260
So the matching,
i.e. the difference

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.620
of the full and effective
theory and calculations,

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.120
determines that
coefficient for you.

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.460
So the notation
here is that we'd

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:27.530
write the full coefficient as 1
plus C1 plus higher order terms

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.560
where this is order alpha.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.840
That's the notation I'm using.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.470
So let's do that for the logs.

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:38.460
It's pretty simple.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.030
These things here
are just cancel.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:43.200
And this one we can
just subtract them.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.040
The p squareds will cancel.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.220
And we'll get a log of my
squared over Mw squared.

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.910
So just focusing on those
terms that we have in S1--

00:49:27.595 --> 00:49:29.470
and rearranging the
equation in the way

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:33.730
I said and then plugging in
the values for the things that

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.630
don't cancel.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.460
So the terms that were
slightly different--

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.690
and dropping the S1.

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.316
CF is 4/3.

00:50:11.316 --> 00:50:13.489
It's Casimir of the fundamental.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.420
We see that, since we've
only kept the log terms, what

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.420
we find is the one-loop
correction in this guy that's

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.130
got a logarithm.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:30.510
but it'd also be a term here
that's a number times alpha.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:38.670
But we haven't kept
those terms in what

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.478
I've written on the board.

00:50:40.478 --> 00:50:42.270
So the way that you
should think about this

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:44.270
is that we've got these
Wilson coefficients that

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.560
depend on the scale Mw.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.240
And what the matching is doing,
it's taking the full theory.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.813
And it's dividing it into
large momentum pieces

00:50:54.813 --> 00:50:55.980
times small momentum pieces.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.660
So the large momentum
pieces are in C. Small

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:12.440
momentum pieces are in the
matrix element of the operator.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.330
And this statement, we see an
explicit realization of it.

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:21.830
The full theory knows about high
scale Mw's and the p squared.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:32.687
And we can write this
as a split like this.

00:51:32.687 --> 00:51:35.270
The effective theory knows about
p squared, doesn't know about

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.870
Mw squared.

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:37.820
The Wilson coefficient
knows about Mw squared,

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.350
doesn't know about p squared.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:41.267
The additional thing
that they both know about

00:51:41.267 --> 00:51:42.230
is the scale mu.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:44.000
And that's providing
a cutoff for where

00:51:44.000 --> 00:52:04.800
you split between large
momentum and small momentum

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.980
p squared was the small scale.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.353
Now, if you look
at this equation,

00:52:10.353 --> 00:52:11.520
you may wonder for a minute.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.380
Why is it additive?

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.170
Up here, I just said times.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.670
And then immediately
below times,

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:22.410
I wrote something that was a
sum, seemed a little weird.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:26.190
That's just because, if you take
something that includes the 1,

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:31.890
then the product becomes a sum.

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:34.890
So if I write it this way, I
can write it in product form

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:37.790
if I include the one tree level.

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.360
So it really is a product.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.880
It's just that, if you look
at the order alpha pieces,

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.920
it breaks into the sum
where we can nicely see how

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.750
things are combining together.

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.795
But really it has this
product structure,

00:52:53.795 --> 00:52:55.920
and there's non-trivial
relations between these two

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.440
series that make it
all work out even when

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.520
you go to higher orders.

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.250
So if I expand that
to order alpha,

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:03.750
look at the order
alpha coefficient.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:05.635
I get this equation back again.

00:53:05.635 --> 00:53:08.010
And this is how you would
think about it in product form.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:12.360
OK.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:16.560
So the other thing you see
here is that order by order

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.640
in our expansion, as we
kind of already stated,

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.070
the mu dependence between
these coefficients and these

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:26.010
operators is exactly cancelling
because the full theory here

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.810
didn't involve that mu.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.390
That's another little piece
of information that we get

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:37.110
or that we knew, but
we see explicitly

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:38.450
from looking at this.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:51.320
So I think, if I'm
counting right,

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.000
this is comment number five.

00:53:57.335 --> 00:53:58.210
Was there a question?

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:06.940
So not surprisingly,
the cut off dependence

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:10.960
cancels in the product
of C of mu O of mu

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.627
because the cut off
is what we introduced

00:54:13.627 --> 00:54:15.460
to split up the physics
in these two things.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:23.810
Now, if you look at that
in a little more detail,

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.390
it's only mu independent of the
order in perturbation theory

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:27.223
that you're working.

00:54:31.343 --> 00:54:34.690
If you've worked at a fixed
order in some expansion,

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:38.290
then you shouldn't be surprised
that everything you've derived

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:39.580
is only true at that order.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.550
So if you stopped
at one loop, then

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:50.440
it's mu independent
at order alpha S.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.390
What that technically
means is that terms that

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:55.480
are alpha S mu log mu cancel.

00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:00.610
The log mu here cancels, but
there's mu dependence also

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:01.540
here.

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.760
And that mu dependence
in the alpha

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.100
is something that would
be related to terms

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:10.970
that are alpha squared log mu.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:12.470
And that cancels
at higher order.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:18.410
So some of the mu
dependents cancel.

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.300
Some of the mu dependents
doesn't cancel.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.640
And people actually use the fact
that some of the mu dependence

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.680
doesn't cancel as getting a
handle on the higher order

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.180
terms.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:27.770
It's doing a kind of
theory uncertainty.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.810
If we just think
about the logarithms,

00:55:54.810 --> 00:56:00.090
then actually the one-loop
results in the full theory

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.299
has actually less information.

00:56:09.235 --> 00:56:11.610
And the reason is that, if
you wanted to get higher order

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:14.027
terms in this leading log
series that we talked about,

00:56:14.027 --> 00:56:16.110
if you wanted to derive
those from the full theory

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.410
point of view, you'd have to
do a two-loop computation.

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.590
So if you wanted to get alpha
squared log squared of Mw

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:34.060
squared over minus p
squared, then you'd

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:41.125
have to look at
diagrams, two gluons.

00:56:43.995 --> 00:56:45.370
On the full theory
point of view,

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:50.513
that's what you'd have to
do to find those terms.

00:56:50.513 --> 00:56:52.180
From the effective
theory point of view,

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.763
all you have to do
to find those terms

00:56:53.763 --> 00:56:56.380
is renormalize the
effective theory properly.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.420
And then you get those terms.

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.750
So we just needed the
one-loop anomalous dimension.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:14.660
So in that sense,
the effective theory,

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.640
because of the
renormalization properties

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.280
of the effective
theory, know something

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.550
that the full theory
doesn't know so easily.

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:24.290
And that kind of shows
you the advantage

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:27.710
of taking something that's
a constant, Mw squared,

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:29.132
and turning it into a scale.

00:57:29.132 --> 00:57:30.590
Because by turning
it into a scale,

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:32.798
you have the whole power of
the renormalization group

00:57:32.798 --> 00:57:34.820
at your disposal to
predict higher order

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:38.030
things, like the higher
order coefficients.

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:39.800
And that's one way
of phrasing what

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.163
the example is of
splitting scales

00:57:42.163 --> 00:57:43.580
and going to the
effective theory.

00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:53.750
So the final thing that
I want to talk about here

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:56.360
has to do with the fact that--

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.600
well, actually, there's two more
things I want to talk about,

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.340
but let me make the
final comment here.

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.920
So the final comment I
want to make in my list,

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.745
which is number seven, has
to do with scheme dependence.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.530
So scheme dependence
means that we

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:18.537
pick the renormalization
scheme MS bar.

00:58:18.537 --> 00:58:20.120
And we could have
done the calculation

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.438
in a different
renormalization scheme.

00:58:23.438 --> 00:58:25.355
And we should ask what
depends on that choice.

00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:31.490
You may know, if you've taken
a course on the beta function

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:34.660
or if you've taken QFD3,
that the beta function of QCD

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.800
is scheme independent
for the first two orders.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.680
The analog of that
statement here

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:45.920
is that the one-loop anomalous
dimension for our operators

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.328
is scheme independent.

00:58:50.674 --> 00:58:55.360
It doesn't depend on which mass
independent scheme you pick.

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.270
So in the class of mass
independence schemes,

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:00.535
the result is what we derived.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.600
We'll come back and study
that in a little more detail.

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:14.958
OK, so let's go back now
and establish some notation

00:59:14.958 --> 00:59:17.000
where we actually just
put the constants back in.

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.010
And again, I'm not
going to write numbers.

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.408
I'll just give them names.

00:59:24.408 --> 00:59:25.950
And we'll track what
happens to them.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:35.180
So let's think about the
full one-loop matching

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:39.780
and how we get the next
leading log result.

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.200
And really what I want to
focus on, or at least one thing

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.580
I want to focus on, is
the scheme dependence.

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.630
Because the coefficients, once
you get to next leading log,

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:52.940
are totally scheme dependent.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:54.920
So you can ask,
what physical sense

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.943
do they make if they're
scheme dependent?

00:59:57.943 --> 01:00:00.110
Well, it turns out that the
matrix elements are also

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.000
scheme dependent.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.760
And the anomalous dimensions
are scheme dependent.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.180
So basically, everything
is scheme dependent.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.940
And when we put it all
together, we get a scheme

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:25.965
independent result. So
you might think, well,

01:00:25.965 --> 01:00:27.590
if we can get scheme
dependent results,

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:30.050
we should just stop
because maybe we can't

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:32.030
understand what's going on.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:41.360
But C of mu times O of mu is
independent of the scheme.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.070
It's a physical observable.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:47.840
And physical
observables don't depend

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.940
on our definitions of things.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.090
Nature gets to decide, not us.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.400
So one way of
thinking about this

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.910
is that we already saw some
kind of scheme independence

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:11.060
in a statement that
C of mu times O of mu

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.260
is independent of mu.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.080
But there's even a deeper
scheme independence to it

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.890
that it's independent of whether
we chose MS bar or some others

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:21.440
scheme.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.910
So for the context
of this discussion,

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:27.560
I'm going to start dropping
all the matrix indices.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.540
And we're not going
to write i and j

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:33.470
just because I want to keep
things a little bit simple.

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:37.580
So we'll write that the
effective theory is simply

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.510
one coefficient times the
matrix of one operator.

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:54.050
So let's think about,
in that context, trying

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.570
to understand where all this
scheme dependence is floating

01:01:56.570 --> 01:02:05.500
around and how the
matching works.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.430
So we just do the same
thing we did before.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.970
I'm leaving off
some pre-factors,

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:18.310
leaving off the pre-factors.

01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:20.102
I don't have the write
the spinners anymore

01:02:20.102 --> 01:02:22.540
since there's only
one structure.

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:28.700
And let me introduce some
notation for the results.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.090
So we had this Mw squared
over p squared type term.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.140
And let me just focus on these
terms and not the terms that

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:39.290
just cancelled away.

01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:41.900
So let me focus on the
terms that are different.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.000
But now, I'm also going
to include the constants.

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.920
So the constants that we
get in the full theory

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.545
and the effective
theory are different.

01:03:07.545 --> 01:03:09.850
So I'll call one of them
A and the other one B.

01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:12.310
So I call the A the
full theory result

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.723
and the B the effective
theory result.

01:03:14.723 --> 01:03:16.390
So you should think
of this as a number,

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:21.280
like 3, just some
number, same thing here.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.830
But just to avoid
talking about numbers

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:26.500
and to track also where
the scheme dependence is--

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.240
like this 3 could
be 2 in one scheme

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.413
and this 4 could be 2 in one
scheme and 5 in another scheme.

01:03:33.413 --> 01:03:35.830
In order to keep track of that,
let me call it a variable.

01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:39.520
Let me call it B.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.310
So then the Wilson
coefficient is just

01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:42.635
we construct the difference.

01:03:42.635 --> 01:03:44.260
And then we'll have
an A minus B in it.

01:04:07.133 --> 01:04:09.300
So if you like what the
Wilson coefficient is doing,

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.400
it's compensating for the
fact that the effective theory

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.930
has the wrong value
for this constant.

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:13.680
It should be this.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.960
That's what the full
theory told you it was.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.730
So the effective theory
Wilson coefficient

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:22.740
has minus the effective
theory matrix element

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.620
result plus the
correct result. So this

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:29.842
is the thing that's correcting
the effective theory.

01:04:29.842 --> 01:04:31.050
So it has the right constant.

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:47.280
And if we just take
C at Mw, then it

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.107
would simply be equal to that.

01:04:51.107 --> 01:04:52.190
And the log would go away.

01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:11.180
So in order to do the
renormalization group

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.520
improved perturbation
theory at next leading log,

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.290
we also need to do a
two-loop computation.

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:22.235
We're not going to do the
two-loop consultation,

01:05:22.235 --> 01:05:24.110
but I'll tell you the
structure of the series

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:26.240
that you get if you
did that computation.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.940
So this equation is true.

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.420
Therefore, we can write the
anomalous dimension equation

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.922
again as log C.

01:05:37.922 --> 01:05:39.630
And the right-hand
side will be a series.

01:05:43.113 --> 01:05:45.030
And the structure of the
series that was there

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:48.690
is the 0-th order term.

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:50.640
And then there's some
higher order terms.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.770
And we need this guy,
the two-loop coefficient,

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:01.610
[INAUDIBLE] gamma 1.

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.870
Again, this is a coupled
differential equation.

01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:09.260
And we would solve it by
using the kind of thing

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.080
that we did before.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:17.540
So d mu over mu is d
alpha over beta of alpha.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.030
And we would write
down beta to one higher

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:24.410
order, which I do in my notes.

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:29.090
But it's the same idea is
I just expand it in alpha.

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:31.990
And I keep not just
the coefficient beta 0,

01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:33.615
but I also keep the
coefficient beta 1.

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:50.370
I want to kind of not focus
so much on the calculations,

01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:52.710
but more the results
and the implications

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:56.610
of the calculations.

01:06:56.610 --> 01:07:01.850
So do some renormalization
group evolution.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:07.658
You can write the all-order
solution as an integral,

01:07:07.658 --> 01:07:08.450
like we did before.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.410
And if I just keep it in terms
of these all-order objects,

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:23.760
then it's just the ratio, which
I expand that ratio in alpha.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.225
And if I want to do
it to second order,

01:07:26.225 --> 01:07:27.600
I don't just keep
the first time.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.558
I keep the second term.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.170
So the first term
was a 1 over alpha.

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:45.930
So we're going to keep the
order alpha to the 0 term.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.840
And if we use our notation
that we established before,

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.050
where we call this guy here,
we call the exponential

01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:09.020
of this guy u, so C of u C of
mu 0, of mu w mu of mu w mu.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.644
Then we can write the
solution of that guy

01:08:20.644 --> 01:08:24.830
as an exponential of an integral
of d alpha gamma over beta.

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.279
So some of the steps that we
were doing at one-loop, just

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.319
like the exponentiation,
the separation,

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:34.802
they just all go through.

01:08:34.802 --> 01:08:36.260
And the only thing
we do have to do

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.177
is evaluate this integral
at one higher order.

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:50.270
Let me take mu w equal to
Mw and then do the integral.

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:53.420
And what you get is
a result that we can

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.850
organize in the following way.

01:09:02.248 --> 01:09:04.040
Try to get my arguments
in the right order.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.060
In this particular case, the
next leading log solution

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.770
looks as follows.

01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:23.460
Our leading log solution is
obviously buried inside it.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:35.660
So we have this ratio of alphas,
something which is a number.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:39.700
And then there's
these extra factors

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.020
that depend on this then j.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.189
And I can write
the result this way

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:51.310
where j involves all the things
that are the higher order

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.170
ingredients.

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:55.480
So it involves the lowest order
anomalous dimension, but now

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.245
times beta 1.

01:09:57.245 --> 01:09:59.620
That's like taking the leading
order anomalous dimension,

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:02.500
but now running the coupling
with the second order term

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.980
as well.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.480
And then there's a term that
involves the second order

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.170
anomalous dimension.

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:14.930
So it encodes that information.

01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:17.380
So this is the U. We can
combine that together

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.810
with our equation for the
C over here, or this one.

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:24.300
So let me keep that one.

01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:47.910
So I take this equation,
multiply by that equation.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.476
That gives us C of mu.

01:10:52.194 --> 01:10:53.910
So I have to write
this lone more time.

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:12.500
And basically, I can group that
together with these other terms

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.870
that depend on an alpha of Mw.

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:28.240
OK.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.330
So j is the anomalous
dimension piece.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:33.010
A and B are the matching.

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:35.680
A minus B is the matching piece.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.710
And I can write the
result this way.

01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:43.590
So this is next
leading order matching,

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:48.470
which is A minus
B and next leading

01:11:48.470 --> 01:12:00.340
log running to get the full
next leading log result.

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.530
So this is the kind of
structure that you could get.

01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:03.970
That's what
renormalization group

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:05.803
improved perturbation
theory looks like when

01:12:05.803 --> 01:12:07.180
you go to higher orders.

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.758
You basically have logs.

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:10.300
But then the higher
order terms, when

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.940
you expand out this
integral, are just giving you

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.853
polynomials in alpha.

01:12:14.853 --> 01:12:16.270
So when you integrate
polynomials,

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:17.390
you get back polynomials.

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:19.070
So if you integrate
1, you get alpha.

01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:23.665
If you integrate alpha squared,
you get alpha cubed, et cetera.

01:12:23.665 --> 01:12:25.040
So you just get
back polynomials.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.420
And that's why you
can write it this way.

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.520
What are the terms
in this result

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.966
that are scheme dependent?

01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:40.630
I claim that beta 1 gamma 1--

01:12:44.454 --> 01:12:48.000
oh, why did I-- not beta 1, B1.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:59.850
B1 gamma 1 J, C, O, these
are all scheme dependent.

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:01.920
They depend on what
renormalization scheme

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.690
I use to define my
effective theory.

01:13:09.545 --> 01:13:10.920
And then there's
a list of things

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.230
that are scheme independent.

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:16.890
So beta 0 and beta 1
are scheme independent.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:20.153
I told you that gamma 0
is scheme independent.

01:13:20.153 --> 01:13:21.570
You could think
of that like, when

01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:24.237
you do the one-loop calculation,
the ultraviolet divergences are

01:13:24.237 --> 01:13:25.403
always going to be the same.

01:13:25.403 --> 01:13:26.370
You get 1 over epsilon.

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:28.662
And it's only the constant
that depends on your scheme.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.200
A1 is scheme independent.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.425
That's because A1 was the
full theory calculation.

01:13:36.425 --> 01:13:37.800
So how could it
possibly know how

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.930
we define the effective theory?

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:43.800
So that's scheme independent.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:51.417
And a non-trivial one is that
B1 plus J is scheme independent.

01:13:51.417 --> 01:13:54.000
So there's scheme dependence in
B1 and scheme dependence in J,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.220
but it cancels in exactly
the combination that's

01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:00.220
showing up in this result.

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:07.300
And as I mentioned, C times
O is scheme independent

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.798
because that's related
to observables.

01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:18.340
So I have a little proof
of that in my notes,

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.490
which, because of time,
I'm going to skip.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.493
But I encourage you, when I post
my notes through the website,

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.410
that you take a look at
where that comes from.

01:14:30.123 --> 01:14:31.540
So the only
non-trivial one really

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:38.012
is this B1 plus J being
scheme independent, OK?

01:14:38.012 --> 01:14:39.970
I have a little proof of
that in my notes here.

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:47.190
OK, so let's go
back to the equation

01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:50.520
at the top in the
middle there and see

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.810
what conclusions we can
draw once we believe this.

01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:58.650
So if B1 plus J is
scheme independent, then

01:14:58.650 --> 01:15:03.180
this thing that's showing up in
that term, A1 minus B minus J,

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:07.237
is scheme independent, as A was.

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:08.570
It was just a full theory thing.

01:15:12.982 --> 01:15:14.940
And there's a cancellation
of scheme dependence

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:19.170
between the one-loop
anomalous dimension.

01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:25.135
There's a cancellation
here between

01:15:25.135 --> 01:15:26.760
the two-loop anomalous
dimension, which

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.570
we called gamma 1, and the B1.

01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:32.610
That's where the scheme
dependence cancels.

01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:34.797
So the scheme you pick,
you have to be consistent.

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:35.880
You have to keep using it.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.005
If you do a matching
calculation or if someone else

01:15:38.005 --> 01:15:40.002
did a matching calculation,
you want to use it.

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:42.210
You better figure out what
scheme they're working in.

01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:43.800
Because if you start working
in a different scheme,

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.967
you're just making mistakes.

01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.700
So this is the statement
that the matching is scheme

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:54.580
dependent, the anomalous
dimension scheme dependent,

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:56.490
but there's a cancellation
between those two.

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.787
If we look at the gamma
0 over beta 0 term,

01:16:09.787 --> 01:16:10.870
that's scheme independent.

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:11.590
So that's good.

01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:16.215
If we look over here, J
was not scheme dependent.

01:16:16.215 --> 01:16:19.168
J is scheme dependent.

01:16:19.168 --> 01:16:20.710
So we still have to
worry about that.

01:16:35.181 --> 01:16:39.170
So leading log result
was scheme independent,

01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:46.080
but we still have
scheme dependence

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:57.310
of this factor 1 plus alpha of
mu J over 4 pi in our C of mu.

01:16:57.310 --> 01:17:01.920
And the thing that cancels
that scheme dependence

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.150
is the fact that the
Wilson coefficient alone

01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.890
is not a physical observable.

01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:08.985
It's really the Wilson
coefficient times the operator.

01:17:08.985 --> 01:17:10.360
And so there is
scheme dependence

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.834
in the matrix element
of the operator.

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:31.430
So a matrix element of the
operator at the scale mu

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:34.610
is scheme dependent.

01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:37.720
And this is at the lower
end of our integration.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.775
So this is the final
matrix element,

01:17:43.775 --> 01:17:45.400
like the matrix
element at the B scale.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.730
That's a scheme dependent thing.

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.480
So if you think of
these things as numbers

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.040
that you want to determine
from data, one way of thinking

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.630
about it, those
numbers are going

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:54.490
to depend on what
scheme you're using.

01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:56.650
If you extract some
numbers in one scheme

01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:58.400
and your friend does
it in another scheme,

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.560
you could get totally
different numbers.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.080
So you have to know what
scheme you're working in.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.538
And you have to
combine it together

01:18:03.538 --> 01:18:06.247
with the Wilson coefficient
in the same scheme.

01:18:06.247 --> 01:18:08.080
If you take some numbers
from the literature

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.788
and you don't know
what scheme they're in

01:18:09.788 --> 01:18:11.450
and you're working
at next leading log,

01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:13.280
you have a problem.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.950
You got to know
what the scheme is

01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:17.995
because you have to work in
the same scheme consistently.

01:18:17.995 --> 01:18:19.120
And that's the lesson here.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.270
If you really want to do
this whole program that I've

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.970
talked about, which is done in
this 250 page review article--

01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:33.790
and I'm not asking
you to read that.

01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:36.160
If you really want to
do this whole program,

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.480
there are some subtleties.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:43.270
And I should at least mention
them to you since maybe you'll

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:44.395
encounter the word someday.

01:18:57.270 --> 01:19:01.050
So we've sketched the physics
and the basic stuff that

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:02.590
would be involved
in the analysis,

01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:04.715
but we haven't written down
the full operator basis

01:19:04.715 --> 01:19:06.750
with the full set
of mixing and dozens

01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.820
and dozens of diagrams,
which people have done.

01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:15.730
Mostly what you should be
thinking of this is as a user.

01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:17.520
So I'm teaching you
the things that you

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.505
need to be able to
use results like that.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:20.880
In an effective
theory, if you're

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.422
using a higher order
result, you have

01:19:22.422 --> 01:19:25.060
to worry about scheme dependent.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.370
So what are the subtleties?

01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:28.530
Well, one of them is
that there's gamma 5s.

01:19:31.265 --> 01:19:34.200
This theory is chiral.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:37.076
And gamma 5 is inherently
four-dimensional.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.680
And you have to
worry about that.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.930
And you have to create
that carefully in dim reg.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.550
And when people originally
did these calculations,

01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:57.880
that caused some confusion.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.820
Be careful enough.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:03.850
Obviously, dim reg is a powerful
way of doing the calculation,

01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:06.513
but you do have to be
careful about gamma 5.

01:20:06.513 --> 01:20:07.930
And there's another
thing you have

01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:10.553
to be careful about in dim reg.

01:20:10.553 --> 01:20:12.970
And that's something that are
called evanescent operators.

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:20.430
You see, part of our
arguments, and originally

01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:22.430
when we were writing down
the basis of operators

01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:24.210
for our calculation,
were actually

01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:25.881
inherently four-dimensional.

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:32.280
When we wrote down
the operators,

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:40.920
we said we effectively used that
these Dirac structures, which

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:47.430
are 16 of them, we used
completeness over those 16.

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:51.090
And the problem is
that, in d dimensions,

01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:53.220
that's not a complete set.

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:09.130
And any opinions
that are outside that

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.900
set that are additional
operators that you

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:16.434
need in d dimensions are
called evanescent operators.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.120
So they involve
Dirac structures that

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:33.330
vanish as epsilon goes to 0,
but are technically needed

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:36.150
to get some calculations right.

01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:37.680
OK, so those are
two subtle things

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.610
to be aware of in
the full calculation.

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:43.448
And I think we'll
stop there for today.

01:21:43.448 --> 01:21:45.240
And we'll do something
different next time.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:51.460
So homework is due next Tuesday.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.160
And as I said in my
original handout,

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.230
you should talk to each
other about the homework.

01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:58.680
That's how you learn.

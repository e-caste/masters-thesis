BARTON ZWIEBACH: After
this long detour,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.190
you must think that
one is just trying

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.720
to avoid doing the real
computation, so here comes,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.050
the real computation.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.920
The real computation is
taking that right hand side

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.830
on the top of the blackboard
and trying to just calculate

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.960
this right hand side.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.230
So back to the calculation.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:40.530
The calculation dN/dt
is equal to this thing

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.635
over there, integral
dx i over h-bar.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:58.470
I'll still copy it here-- h
psi-star psi minus psi-star h

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.520
psi.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.020
OK.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.242
Well, let's do this.

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:24.670
This whole quantity is d-rho/dt,
and let's see how much it is.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.790
Well, you would have of the
following-- i over h-bar h

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.360
psi-star.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:43.420
Well, h in detail is over
there, so I'll put it here.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:52.870
Minus h squared over 2m d
second dx squared of psi-star.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.040
So I'm beginning h psi star--

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.485
that's from the first term in
the Hamiltonian-- times psi.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.400
And then from the other
term in the Hamiltonian

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:16.512
is the potential, so it would be
plus V of x and t psi-star psi.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.230
V of x and t times
psi-star times psi.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.810
This other term would
be minus psi-star h psi,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.560
so it's going to be opposite
sign to here, so plus h squared

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:48.140
over 2m psi-star d second
dx squared psi, and then

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.470
minus psi-star V of x and t psi.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.450
Here, there was a little
thing that I probably

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.960
should have said before
is that the potential is

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.880
real, that's why it didn't
get complex conjugated here.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:17.330
H psi would have a term V psi
and we just conjugate the psi.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.930
OK, this is not so bad.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.740
In particular, you see that
these two terms cancel.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.990
So that's neat.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.370
And now, this becomes
the following--

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:55.370
this d-rho/dt has become minus
ih over 2m d second psi-star dx

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:05.480
squared times psi minus psi-star
d second psi dx squared.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.980
OK.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.339
That's what d-rho/dt is and
that's the thing that should be

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.430
0 when you integrate--

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.840
it doesn't look like
anything equal to 0,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.820
and that was pretty
much to be expected.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.850
So what do we have
to do with this?

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.200
Well, we have to
simplify it more,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.550
and what could save us
is, and it's usually

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.070
the same thing that saves you
all the time when you want

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.530
to show an integral vanishes,
many times, what you show

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.870
is that it is a
total derivative.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.640
So remember, we're
computing here d-rho/dt,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.820
which is all this
thing circled here,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.630
and it's to be
integrated over x.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.980
So if I could show this is
a derivative with respect

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.060
to x, the total x
derivative, then the integral

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.400
would go to the
boundaries and I would

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.890
have a chance to make it 0.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.110
So what do we have?

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.420
That derivative is
indeed at boundaries,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:34.960
so d-rho/dt is equal to
minus i h-bar bar over 2m.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.350
And look, this can be
written as d/dx of something

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.660
and what is that something?

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:58.130
It's d psi-star dx times psi
minus psi-star d second psi--

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.930
no not d second--
d first psi dx.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.790
The nice thing that
happens here is

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.850
that if you act
with this d/dx, you

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.600
get the second derivative
terms that you had in there.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.400
But you also get derivatives
acting here on d psi

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.580
and here on d psi-star,
but those will cancel.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.630
So it's a very
lucky circumstance,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.670
it had better happen, but
this is a total derivative

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.530
with respect to x.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.340
And that's just
very a good deal.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.650
So we're going to
rewrite it a little more.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.190
I'll write it as
the following way--

00:06:50.190 --> 00:07:04.420
this whole factor is h over 2im,
that's with its sign, output

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.610
the d/dx outside--

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.470
I'll put an extra minus
sign, so I will flip

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.970
the order of these two terms--

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:24.460
psi-star d psi dx minus
psi d psi-star dx.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.870
OK.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.660
Well, in many ways,
the most difficult part

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.180
of the calculation
is over and it's now

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.300
a matter of giving
proper names to things.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.540
Why do I say that?

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.710
Because look, want to
see the finish line?

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.440
It's here.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:05.380
We've shown this whole integrand
is d/dx of that right hand

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.660
side.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.200
Therefore, when you
do the integral,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.920
you will have to go to the
boundary with that thing,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.330
so you just need to see what
happens to these quantities

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.920
as x goes to infinity.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.040
And as x goes to
infinity, we said

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.416
that psi must go to
0 from the beginning.

00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:32.720
And d psi dx must not blow
up, so if psi goes to 0

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.039
and d psi dx doesn't blow up,
this whole thing goes to 0

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:43.260
and dN/dt is equal
to 0 and you're done.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.700
So you're done
with the conditions

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.130
that we mention that
the wave function must

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.020
satisfy these conditions.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.460
But let's clean up this,
because we've actually

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.290
discovered an important
quantity over there that

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.350
is going to play a role.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:16.850
So here you see that you
have a complex number

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.170
minus its complex conjugate.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.530
So this is like z
minus z-star, which

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:32.520
is equal to 2i I times
the imaginary part of z.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.090
If you subtract from a complex
number its complex conjugate,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.910
you get the imaginary part only
survives, but it's twice of it.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:53.380
So from here, this whole thing
is 2i times the imaginary part

00:09:53.380 --> 00:10:00.350
of psi-star d psi dx.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:20.150
So d-rho/dt is equal
to minus d/dx of what?

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.800
Of 2i times the imaginary
part of that, cancels the 2i,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:34.490
you get h-bar over m imaginary
part of psi-star d psi dx.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:47.730
And this quantity is going to
be called the current density.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.300
So the current density, you
say, why the current density?

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.340
We'll see in a minute.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:07.690
But let's write it here because
it'll be very important.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:13.270
J of x and t is h-bar
over m imaginary part

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.900
of psi-star d psi dx.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.820
So if this is called
the current density,

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.710
you would have an equation
here d-rho/dt is equal to minus

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:54.350
dJ/dx d/dx of J dx, or d-rho/dt
plus dJ/dx is equal to 0.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.770
Now this is called
current conservation.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:09.040
You've seen it before
in electromagnetism

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.090
and we'll review it here
in a second as well.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.330
So look what has happened.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:31.780
You began with the introduction
of a charged density, which

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.320
was a probability density,
but you were led now

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.155
to the existence of a current.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.460
And you've seen that
in three dimensions,

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.590
more than in one dimension--

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.110
I think probably
in one dimension

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.930
it doesn't look that
familiar to you,

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:59.240
but let me make sure you will
recognize it in a few seconds.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.400
So think units here first.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.500
Units.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.940
What are the units
of the wave function?

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.820
Well, the wave function,
you integrate over x squared

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.080
and it gives you 1.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.220
So the integral of psi
squared dx is equal to 1,

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.040
so this has units of length,
this must have units of 1

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.425
over square root of length.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:41.590
And what are therefore the
units of psi-star d/dx psi,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.410
which is part of the
current formula ?

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.080
Well, 1 of the square
root of length--

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.500
1 over square root of length is
one over length and another 1

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.270
over length is 1
over length squared.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.720
OK.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.780
And then you have
h-bar, which has

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:05.660
units of mL squared over T.
Probably done that before

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.660
already.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:19.690
And therefore, h over m has
units of L squared over T.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:25.315
So the current has
units of h over m--

00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:31.070
the units of current
has units of h over m,

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.730
which is L squared over T--

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.250
times units of this whole
thing, which is 1 over L

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:44.920
squared, so at
the end, 1 over T.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.460
And this means just
probability per unit time.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.320
That's the units of current.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:58.620
Probability has no units, so
we're dealing probability,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.190
those are pure numbers, but this
is probability per unit time.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:12.640
So probability per unit time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.944
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:03.888
[RUSTLING]

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.804
[CLICKING]

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:10.690
SCOTT HUGHES: OK.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.160
So let's just dive in.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.580
And I'll just quickly recap
where we were last time.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.160
So what I did last
time was, we are now

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.290
beginning the
adventure, so to speak,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.730
of looking at how one examines--

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.140
how one finds and then studies
the properties of solutions

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.550
to the Einstein field equations.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.710
In other words, given
a particular source,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.423
what is the space-time
that emerges?

00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:37.840
What is the space-time that
is consistent with that source

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.562
of gravity in Einstein's
relativistic theory here?

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:43.270
So we begin-- we're
going to look at this

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.650
in a couple of different ways.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.110
And the first one
is where we're going

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.490
to-- what we do-- linearize
the Einstein equation.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.198
So we're going to
imagine that space-time

00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:53.770
is a small deviation from
the flat space-time that

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.930
contains no gravity.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.590
And we are going to expand
the Einstein field equations,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.720
discarding all terms that are
non-linear in the perturbation

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.710
away from flat space-time.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.410
So last time we did this, we
developed our field equations,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.480
we recast them in a
form that's particularly

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.840
convenient for making
solutions, and we

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.450
noted that the coordinate
degrees of freedom

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.610
can be thought of as a
kind of gauge freedom

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.690
that, in some ways,
it's very useful for us,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.780
because it allows us to write
the equations in a form that

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.820
is particularly
amenable to solving,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.500
but can also be a
little bit dangerous,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.420
because you can
sometimes wind up

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.630
with a solution whose
physical character is masked

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.720
by the nature of that gauge.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.580
I went through a
somewhat advanced topic

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.770
for the purposes of
8.962, and I do not

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.860
expect students to
follow this in detail.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.140
But it's good to at least
survey this and understand

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.307
what was going on with this.

00:01:51.307 --> 00:01:56.740
What I did was I decomposed the
perturbation to flat space-time

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.660
into irreducible
degrees of freedom.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.850
I sort of chose a
time coordinate.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.270
I then imagined the other
three coordinates in our space,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.740
and I looked at how,
having chosen time,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.259
the different degrees
of freedom decompose

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.440
in two scalars with respect
to coordinate rotations,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.540
vectors with respect to
coordinate rotations,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.010
and two-index
tensors with respect

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.370
to coordinate rotations.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.320
I then took those, particularly
the vectors and the tensors,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.230
and I further broke them up
into degrees of freedom that

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.660
are either divergence-free
vector fields or the gradients

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.390
of scalar fields.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.580
And in doing this,
what we found was

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.050
that the 10 degrees of freedom
that are specified-- excuse me,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.700
the 10 degrees of freedom that
are present in the perturbation

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.730
the space time,
can be broken down

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.130
into six functions that are
gauge-invariant plus four gauge

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.050
degrees of freedom.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.890
Applying a similar
decomposition to the source,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.610
we found that those six gauge
invariant degrees of freedom

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.900
are governed by four
Poisson type equations.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.870
And I will refer you
to the previous lecture

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.620
for exact definitions
of these things,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.620
but there is a
scalar field phi that

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.385
is related to the mean density
of energy in your space-time

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:24.010
and pressures in your
space-time-- sort

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.410
of isotropic stresses.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.500
This DTS is an additional
degree of freedom

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
that is defined in
that previous lecture.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.050
You find that a Poisson
equation for a scalar

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.330
field I called theta is directly
related to the energy density.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.450
There are two degrees
of freedom associated

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.960
with sort of off diagonal terms
in the metric-- the time-space

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.130
terms in the metric.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.980
And they are related
to the momentum flow.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.020
These are only two
degrees of freedom,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.910
because the psi is a
divergence-free field.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.430
And finally, what
we found is if you

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.940
take the spatial piece
of the space-time metric,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.460
you project out
the bits that are

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.080
transverse-- in other
words, it's divergence-free.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.860
We will come to a more physical
meaning of this a little bit

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.329
later in today's lecture.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.089
And you require that
this be traceless--

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:24.340
then those components of the
spatial space-time perturbation

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.340
are already gauge
invariant, and they're

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.050
related to sort of anisotropic
stresses in our source.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.100
They are governed
by a wave equation.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.940
And as such, these represent
a radiative degree of freedom.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.710
Because this is
[coughs] (excuse me!)--

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.640
because this is trace-free
and divergence-right,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.940
naively you would think that
this has six numbers in it.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.120
A symmetric 3 by 3 matrix is
how you would represent it.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.210
But because it is trace-free and
because it is divergenceless,

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.590
there are four constraints.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.400
And so those six independent
numbers are reduced to two.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.110
And as we'll see
in this lecture,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.990
those two degrees of freedom
correspond to the polarizations

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.210
of gravitational waves.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.780
Today's lecture is all about
understanding these guys.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.120
Given our kind of funny
schedule that we're on today,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.370
I got up early and have not
had time to take a shower,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.510
so I am wearing my LIGO hat.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.580
And what we're going
to be doing today

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.630
is the foundations of
how one calculates this

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.510
and why one builds an
observatory like LIGO

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.090
to measure these things.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.700
All right.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.950
So let me just write that out.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.195
So our goal for today--

00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:33.820
I should say our goal
for this lecture,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.610
because this is the
first of three lectures

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.693
I'm going to record today.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:49.310
Our goal is to understand
hij TT in terms of quantities

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:59.680
that we can observe
and also to understand

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.120
how to compute this field--

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:15.015
this hij TT given us source.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.960
So let's begin by just assuming.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.720
Let's begin by focusing
on how we can understand

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.342
what hij TT actually means--
how we can go and measure this.

00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:29.300
So what I'm going to do
is just we'll start out

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.290
by let's just hand
ourselves an hij TT

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.117
and study its properties.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:49.290
So what I'm going to do is begin
with a space-time perturbation

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.580
that has everything
except hij TT equal to 0.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:01.860
So this is something that has
phi equals 0, theta equals 0,

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.710
psi equal to 0.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.410
I am going to pick hij TT.

00:07:11.736 --> 00:07:14.885
If we have a form such
that it only depends--

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.180
it's a function
that depends only

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.670
on the combination T minus z.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.520
So this represents
something propagating--

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.340
as we see, it actually
describes radiation.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.440
in the z-direction.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:52.626
So this assumed form
can be represented

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:54.115
by the following matrix.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.810
So if you take a
look at this, I'm

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.547
going to justify a few
details of this later.

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:27.630
There's a few constraints.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.910
So it looks like I
have four numbers here.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:37.440
Because my space-time metric
is always symmetric under--

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.150
we'll just say symmetry--

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:51.000
under exchange of indices, h
xy is the same thing as h yx.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.790
So these two things
are the same.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:09:00.240
And from the requirement
that this construction be

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.530
trace-free--

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.500
so from the way I've
written this here,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:13.640
that tells me that h xx
plus hyy h yy must equal 0.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.110
So these two quantities on the
diagonal are not independent.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.250
They must be of opposite sign.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.400
So there are my two
degrees of freedom.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.250
Why have I set the
z part equal to 0?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.880
We'll look at that in a little
bit more detail a little later

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.580
in the lecture.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.205
But essentially, it
comes from the fact

00:09:35.205 --> 00:09:38.130
that I'm making it propagate
in the z-direction.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.100
What we're going
to see is that if--

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.310
whatever direction the
wave is propagating in,

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.530
my field has to be
orthogonal to it.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.350
And we'll prove that a little
bit more carefully later.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.740
So, for now let's just
take this as handed to us.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.620
We can see this is at least
consistent with the properties

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.450
I've written down
here, from the fact

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.360
that it depends
on T minus z, it's

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.350
not hard to show that this thing
will satisfy the wave equation.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.690
So we have a good source for
exploration in front of us--

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.340
excuse me-- a good
space-time for us

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.540
to explore the properties of.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.940
So let's begin by saying great.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.290
One of the most important
things we've learned how to do

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:30.010
is, given a space-time,
I can compute

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:34.420
how a freely falling body
moves in that space-time.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:40.690
So let's consider what happens
if I have freely falling bodies

00:10:40.690 --> 00:11:01.780
in a space-time, in a
space-time such that this--

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.467
in a space-time that is this--

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:07.050
so I am not saying
this very fluently.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.730
So this is what we want to do.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.272
We're going to consider freely
falling bodies in a space-time

00:11:16.272 --> 00:11:17.905
that involves this h mu nu.

00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:19.280
And the way I'm
going to do this,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.923
my first pass is
to sort of say, OK,

00:11:20.923 --> 00:11:23.090
I know all about the motion
of freely falling bodies

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.080
in space-time.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.280
They are geodesics.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.020
Geodesics describe such bodies.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:48.360
So let's go ahead and look
at the geodesic equation

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.900
for this setup.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.408
Now I wanted to--

00:11:51.408 --> 00:11:53.200
let's give ourselves
a couple of conditions

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.620
to try and understand this.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.580
Let's imagine that these
are-- we're initially

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.071
in a space-time that is
just flat space-time.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:12.039
So we're going to imagine
that h mu nu is 0 initially.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.290
And perhaps it then--

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.520
we're sort of imagining a
space-time in which there's

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.440
just you falling
freely in empty space.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.320
Absolutely nothing
going on here.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.670
And this h mu nu
field passes over you.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.247
A wave packet passes over
your freely falling particles.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.590
So h mu nu, not
equal 0, comes along,

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.554
and passes over your particles.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.270
I'm going to imagine that these
bodies are initially at rest.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.070
So when I'm in this regime
where h mu nu is equal to 0,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.290
these guys are just sitting
stationary with respect

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.515
to whoever is making
these measurements.

00:13:15.273 --> 00:13:16.440
So we're going to say great.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.660
I've got these bodies
sitting at rest in what

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.610
is initially empty space-time.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.540
A wave passes along.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.870
What happens to these bodies?

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.920
So if these guys are at
rest, then I know that,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.860
at initial times-- so let's
just say that this comes along,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.360
and it becomes h mu nu not
equal to 0 at some time--

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.040
what is defined as
the origin of time.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:51.100
So t equals 0 is when the
non-zero wave comes along.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.340
So my space-time is just eta
mu nu for all earlier times.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.920
My particles are sitting here
at rest at all earlier times,

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.290
then h mu nu comes along.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.320
So what we want to
do, then, is look

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.410
at how does this guy
behave at t equals 0.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:31.540
Now, initially, the only
component that will get picked

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.661
out of this is the 00 component.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.205
And, working to linear
order, I can write this.

00:14:49.878 --> 00:14:51.670
Just wanted to write
one more step in here.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:58.160
Let's say that this, I'm going
to write as eta alpha beta beta

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.748
00.

00:14:58.748 --> 00:15:00.290
Go back to your
earlier lecture, when

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.000
we defined the Christoffel
symbol to look up

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.125
the definition of this guy.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.100
So these are all
the only components

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.150
of the space-time that enter
into this Christoffel symbol.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.490
Every single one-- let's
go back and take a look

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.750
at the space-time that
we're looking down here.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:32.500
Notice this involves
beta 0, 0 beta, and 00.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.130
That is the space-time
parts, all of which are 0.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.530
The other space-time
parts, all of which are 0.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.140
And the time-time
part, which is 0.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.100
So the initial
acceleration is 0.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:53.550
That means du alpha
d tau is equal to 0.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.320
Which means that my particle
begins on a geodesic,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.510
and it stays on the geodesic.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.210
In these coordinates,
it does not move at all.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.030
This seems to suggest that
gravitational waves have

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.290
no effect.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.850
I have a small body here.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.780
Gravitational waves come along.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.943
It's unaccelerated.

00:16:43.898 --> 00:16:44.690
So what's this for?

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.620
Well, if you think about this
for a second, what you should

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.308
convince yourself is that
the calculation I just did,

00:16:54.308 --> 00:16:55.850
it's probably the
first one you would

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.225
think of doing
when you're trying

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.360
to ascertain how
does a body move

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.040
in a particular space-time.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.890
But, in some ways, it was kind
of a dumb calculation to do.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:12.750
So let's bear in mind,
what this is doing

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:17.339
is tell me the geodesic
equation describes motion

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.910
with respect to some
given coordinate system.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.110
Satisfying this
equation is just saying,

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.020
yup, you're
following a geodesic.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.400
And guess what?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.330
These are-- this radiation
is a form of gravity.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.990
Even if the body responds
to it, it is still

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.700
going to follow a geodesic.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.988
It's going to be in free fall.

00:17:55.988 --> 00:17:57.780
The gravitational field
may be a little bit

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.238
different from the
ones that you're

00:17:59.238 --> 00:18:02.220
more used to from your previous
experiences with gravity,

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.090
but it is still just following
the free fall trajectory

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.470
that gravity demands.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:22.920
So free fall in
these coordinates

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.099
means the body is remaining
fixed in these coordinates.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.620
This is one of the
most important lessons

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.550
in general relativity.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.340
When you ask a
statement that depends

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.100
on the coordinate system
you've written down,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.870
you have to understand
your coordinates.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.040
And I would submit
we don't really

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.680
understand the coordinates that
we wrote down here with this.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:19:02.970
These coordinates
essentially follows the body.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:08.470
Even if the body is
moving, they essentially

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.750
wiggle right along
with the body itself.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.420
So if you want to
understand what

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.480
the impact of gravitational
waves is on things,

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.680
you have to try to
formulate what you're

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.860
able to measure using
coordinate-independent language

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.440
as much as possible.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.840
At the very least,
you need to understand

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.185
your coordinate system a lot
better than I did in setting up

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.310
this calculation over here.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.500
So let's reframe the
way we do this analysis.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.750
Let's imagine-- so
one of the things

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.380
that we learned in
thinking about how

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.310
gravity works in general
relativity is I can always,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.210
if I'm just focusing on a single
body, a single point mass,

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.060
I can always go into
freely falling coordinates.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.910
And space-time is
essentially the space-time

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.810
of special relativity.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.530
I can find a representation
so that everything looks just

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.330
like special
relativity near there.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:35.490
Gravity is basically
completely thrown away,

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.830
at least as far as the
mathematical representation

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.600
is concerned.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.700
I'm in free fall.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.700
I don't really see much.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.840
If I wanted to see the impact of
these waves, what I need to do

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.370
is think about how things
behave over some finite region.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:56.850
I wanted to put together a setup
such that I have two bodies,

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.450
and the relative effect of
things between those two bodies

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.190
will allow me to see the
effect of space-time curvature

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.690
in action.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.660
So let's now--
with this in mind,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:21.624
let's consider two nearby bodies
that each follow geodesics.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:34.560
So body A is right here.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.570
And I'm going to
define body A as living

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.462
at the origin of my coordinates.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.230
And we've got a
body B over here.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:54.950
And we're going to say
that this guy is displaced

00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:04.640
from the origin by a small
amount, some epsilon, in what I

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.250
will call the x direction.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.100
And what I want to do is say,
OK, I've got these two guys.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.870
They are moving
through a space-time.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.112
Let's make this be the
space-time that we had just

00:22:15.112 --> 00:22:16.070
discussed a moment ago.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:24.950
So they are each moving on
geodesics of this space time.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.250
We know that if I set up my
coordinate system in the way

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.740
that I've done it
here, I am not going

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.050
to see any acceleration
on each of these bodies.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:40.070
Let's now try to focus on
some kind of a quantity that

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.210
tells me about the
separation between these two.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.733
I'm going to do
this in two ways.

00:22:44.733 --> 00:22:46.400
So the first thing
which I'm going to do

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:53.840
is say, let's imagine that I
am bouncing a light pulse back

00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:42.730
and forth between A and
B. What I'm going to do

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:48.820
is write the 4-momentum
associated with that light.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.340
So recall I can't really
define a 4-velocity for light

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.440
because proper time
is not defined.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:03.270
But I can introduce some
kind of an affine parameter

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:07.050
such that d by d lambda tells me
about motion on the world line

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.582
that this light follows.

00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:11.040
And this is just bouncing back
and forth between these two.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.430
So it moves in the x direction.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:23.950
Because this is light,
p dot T equals 0.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.540
So these components,
the 4-momentum

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.360
associated with the light,
the dt d lambda and the dx d

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.440
lambda, they are related
to each other like so.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.930
And look.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.190
The space-time metric,
the gauge-invariant piece

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:03.360
of the space-time, hxxtt,
it is appearing in here.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.470
So let's say, OK, what
I am interested now

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.050
is computing what--

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.680
suppose I'm sitting
at A, and I want

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.000
to compute the time,
according to A's clock,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.108
that it takes for a pulse of
light to travel from A to B.

00:25:21.108 --> 00:25:22.400
Maybe I'll make it bounce back.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.942
Maybe I want to know
how much time it

00:25:23.942 --> 00:25:30.510
takes for the light pulse to
go from A to B and back to A.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.540
So let's turn this into an
equation for the interval dt.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:42.540
So dt, I can do a little bit
of this trick called division.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:54.580
Here is-- question is,
did I do it correctly?

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.080
Yes.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.705
So I'm doing the old
physicist's trick.

00:25:56.705 --> 00:25:59.000
I'm just imagining that
an interval of time--

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.650
an interval of
affine parameter d

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.050
lambda, the amount of
dt that accumulates

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.000
as it moves to an interval dx.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.330
They are related by so.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.480
And, remember, I am assuming
that the perturbation

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.280
from space-time,
from flat space-time,

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.340
is small enough that I
can always linearize.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.790
So this can be--

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.493
I can take that square root
using the binomial expansion.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:38.690
So suppose I want to
integrate up the time it takes

00:26:38.690 --> 00:27:15.880
for the thing to go from A to
B, and then back from B to A.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.500
Well, this is going to be
given by integrating this guy's

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:27.270
motion from 0 to
epsilon, like so.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.530
And then integrating
it back again.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.360
My tt is in here.

00:27:44.475 --> 00:27:46.550
It's going to switch
direction when I do that,

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.258
so I'm going to flip
the sign on that dx.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:20.350
I'm leaving it
written in this form,

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:21.570
so you have to be a
little bit careful.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.740
You guys will play with
this a little bit more

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.880
on a problem set.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.420
Bear in mind that as I move
through x, the time argument

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.160
of these guys is changing.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.210
And so that's where there's
a little bit of work

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.340
that you'll explore
in a problem set.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.900
But I'm writing it in this
form so that we get some--

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.240
naively, you might think,
ah, I'll just flip the sign

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.410
and I'll combine these.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.743
In a certain limit, that is
indeed a good approximation.

00:28:42.743 --> 00:28:45.960
You got to be a little bit
more careful in general though.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.290
This is the time it
would take for light

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.910
to go from A to B and
back in the absence

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.780
of this gravitational
wave, this hxxtt.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.970
Notice there is an
inference on the time

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.120
of arrival of these pulses
that depends on hxxtt.

00:29:12.495 --> 00:29:19.660
Time of arrival of
the pulses depends

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:26.650
on this particular piece
of the space-time metric.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.440
One could imagine, if
you had a precise clock,

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.950
and you sat there and you timed
the arrival of these things--

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.110
let's say you sent a pulse
of light out-- bloop--

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.740
and you kept track of how long
it took with a very precise

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.578
clock, you could look for-- in
the absence of a gravitational

00:29:41.578 --> 00:29:43.870
wave, that would be, if you
imagine that your pulse was

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.550
sent out perfectly
periodically--

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:51.030
let's say every millisecond
or something like that,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.890
you sent out a little pulse--

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:57.780
if it arrives back and your
arrival pulses were just as

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.420
spaced by 1 millisecond,
you would say, great,

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.730
I am sitting in
empty space-time.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:09.980
But if you found that
their arrivals varied,

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.142
you would think, hmm, there's
something else going on here.

00:30:13.142 --> 00:30:14.850
Gravitational waves
is one of things that

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.210
could lead to that variation.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.760
So this, at least,
is kind of a proof--

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.330
this calculation I just did--

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.215
you guys are actually, on one
of the upcoming problems sets--

00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:28.215
I believe it's problem--

00:30:28.215 --> 00:30:31.050
I can't remember
if it's 7 or 8--

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.060
you do a little
analysis where you

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.990
will use this to understand
how a detector like LIGO

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.800
actually functions
to measure out

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.370
the effects due to a
gravitational wave on the arms

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.260
of a detector like this.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:52.110
Let me just do one more
way of understanding

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:56.610
how it is the gravitational wave
leaves an imprint on these two

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.145
separated particles.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.110
So when you look at that
first naive calculation I did,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.650
the fact that I got
no effect, I sort of

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.620
joked that we did
a dumb calculation.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.243
To be fair, it wasn't that dumb.

00:31:15.243 --> 00:31:17.910
What we're-- the first thing you
usually think of doing when you

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.410
want to understand the motion
of a body in space-time,

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.500
is you look at geodesics.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.390
Geodesics just tell me that this
guy's acceleration with respect

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.397
to the free fall frame is 0.

00:31:29.397 --> 00:31:31.230
And that's exactly what
we ended up getting.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.990
It's basically just saying, ah,
even in a gravitational wave,

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:37.080
my two bodies are
moving on geodesics.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.590
If I have two separate
bodies, like I

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.580
have in this calculation where
I just calculated the variation

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.610
in the time of arrival
of light pulses,

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.500
one of the tools
we've learned is

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.490
that I can have two geodesics,
two free fall trajectories that

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:55.720
deviate from one another.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:05.580
So let's look at the geodesic
deviation of the free fall

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.230
world lines of these two bodies.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.100
So I'm going to--

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.482
as I did when I did my
geodesic calculation,

00:32:25.482 --> 00:32:26.940
I'm going to take
them to initially

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.940
be close enough that they
have the same 4-velocity.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:47.280
And if you want to be careful
about counting orders here,

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.922
you can imagine, when the
gravitation wave comes along,

00:32:49.922 --> 00:32:52.380
that one or both of them might
pick up a correction of this

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.030
that's of order h.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.280
Depends on what kind of
coordinate system you pick up.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.450
But the key thing is that
they start out like this.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.120
The gravitational
waves may come along

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.975
and it will move them
around a little bit.

00:33:01.975 --> 00:33:03.600
But the amount it's
going to move them,

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.240
the amount of velocity that
they're going to pick up,

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.657
and the displacement
they're going

00:33:06.657 --> 00:33:09.177
to get from their initial
position if they're at rest,

00:33:09.177 --> 00:33:11.010
it can only be of order
of the h that you're

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.930
trying to measure there.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.530
So I'll remind you, the
equation of deviation,

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:28.150
equation of geodesic
deviation, it

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.725
defines a sort of proper
acceleration acting on--

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.710
whoops, that's a typo.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:44.510
It is the proper
acceleration on a vector xi

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.290
that defines, in a
precise geometric way,

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.030
the separation of two geodesics.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.500
And what it looks like
is the Riemann curvature

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:10.080
of your space-time contracted on
the 4-velocity of your bodies,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:15.239
and that separation vector xi.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:22.340
So, linearizing
everything, bearing in mind

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:31.330
that R will itself
be of order h,

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.870
and that any difference
between the proper time

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.500
along these things and
the coordinate time

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.860
of a particular clock is
also going to be of order h,

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.680
they are small enough that
this equation becomes--

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.110
Something that looks like this.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.950
Notice I'm only looking
at the spatial components

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.680
of the separation vector xi.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.777
And that's because,
since I'm working,

00:35:10.777 --> 00:35:12.610
since this is what my
4-velocity looks like,

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.710
I'm going to pick out the 00
components of these things.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.010
And, don't forget,
Riemann is antisymmetric

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:23.320
when I exchange either indices
1 and 2 or indices 3 and 4.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.830
And because of that, the
time-like component of this guy

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.870
is going to be an
uninteresting thing.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.510
I will just get that is
equal to the acceleration

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.190
of the time-like component is 0.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.470
So it doesn't really matter.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:45.810
So this is telling me that
the geodesic separation

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.880
of these two world lines is--

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.670
it's a second-order
equation in time,

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.310
and it's proportional to
the separation itself.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.514
We need to work out all
of these components.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.810
That is a fairly
straightforward exercise,

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.560
and I will just report
to you the results.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.660
A brief aside.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.210
If you want to sort of verify
the results I'm about to write

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.730
out here, you could go into--

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.220
you could look up the definition
of the Riemann tensor.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.670
Bear in mind that you are
doing things at linear orders.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:35.410
You can throw away the terms
of, like, connection times

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:35.910
connection.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.160
It's just derivatives of the
connection that are going

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.930
to matter at linear order.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:43.800
But, even so, it's a bit
of a grotty calculation.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.510
I am-- as I begin to reorganize
the problem sets associated

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.730
with this class
under the new system

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.250
that MIT is currently
operating on,

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.360
I will soon be releasing a
few Mathematica notebooks that

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.780
are very useful tools for
doing tedious calculations,

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:06.180
like computation of Riemann
curvature tensor components.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.550
So I will put a few of
those things up there.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.100
If you would like to
validate some of the things

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.670
that I am computing,
that is where you will

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.300
find a good way to test this.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:28.030
So, anyway, the non-zero
Riemann components.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:40.378
So at linear order,
you have R x0 x0.

00:37:40.378 --> 00:37:42.920
Bear in mind that, linear order,
you are raising and lowering

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.700
indices with the metric
of flat space-time.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.930
So that's the same
thing as this.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.750
And this turns out to
be minus 1/2 two time

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.570
derivatives of hxx.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.972
Y0 y0-- that's your
yo-yo component--

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:15.790
pretty much looks
exactly the same,

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.960
but it's two time
derivatives of the yy piece.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.080
Remember though-- I've
erased it a while ago--

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.590
there are some constraints
that we found due to the fact

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:29.370
that my original h mu nu has
to be-- its spatial piece has

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.440
to be traceless.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.160
In particular, we found
hyy was minus hxx.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:43.717
So I can remove that
additional function,

00:38:43.717 --> 00:38:45.300
and just leave things
in terms of hxx.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:39:04.240
And our final non-zero
component looks like this.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.290
All others are either 0
or related by a symmetry.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:26.290
So notice, although I've
written down three different

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.510
complements here,
there's really only two,

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.190
because the symmetry that's--

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.190
it's not a symmetry of
Riemann, but the symmetry

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:36.610
associated with the
trace-free nature of hijtt

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.780
made these two
equal to each other.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.523
So this and this are really
the only independent degrees

00:39:41.523 --> 00:39:42.190
of freedom here.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.820
All right.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.490
Let's plug this into the
equation of geodesic deviation,

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:19.745
this guy, and see what we get.

00:40:19.745 --> 00:40:23.680
And what we get is
an equation governing

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.260
the acceleration of the
x component of deviation.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:27.740
Here it is.

00:41:30.923 --> 00:41:32.340
Let's make a couple
of assumptions

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.600
and try to understand
what this is telling us.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.390
So what I'm going
to do is-- let's

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:41.370
assume this is-- the first
assumption is necessitated

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:48.103
by the idea that I can
do linearized gravity.

00:41:48.103 --> 00:41:50.520
So I'm going to assume that
these guys are all very small.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.180
And I will imagine
that my displacement

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:06.420
vectors have some piece which--

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.470
basically, it's time constant.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:09.315
It does not change.

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:24.560
And that there's a bit that will
be of order h that describes

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.530
how the separation
of my two bodies

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.803
responds to this incoming field.

00:42:31.803 --> 00:42:34.220
So what I'm going to do, when
you go and you plug this in,

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:46.490
assume that this guy is constant
in time, and this one varies.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.450
What I'm going to do is imagine
I don't just have two bodies.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.070
Imagine I have a ring of bodies.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:27.550
So suppose I have got
my coordinate axes here.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.480
Horizontal is x, vertical
on the board is y.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:39.155
And so imagine I have a
ring of bodies, like so.

00:43:39.155 --> 00:43:40.780
And let's consider
the following limit.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:46.720
Let's imagine that my
hxx is some function that

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:57.440
is sinusoidally varying
in time, and my hxy is 0.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.750
I just want to call that the--

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.500
as we saw, there's
really only two degrees

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.450
of freedom in this field.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:04.070
And in the way that
we formulated it,

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:07.737
it's going to encapsulated by
these two functions, xx and xy.

00:44:07.737 --> 00:44:08.820
So let's just look at one.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.320
Let's just look at the
influence of the hxx.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.040
So when you do this,
you essentially

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.940
have the second
derivative of xi x

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.290
looks like two derivatives of
your x field, your xx field

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.210
times xi x.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.270
And two derivatives,
your sort of acceleration

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:33.100
in the y direction, is
minus those two derivatives

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.030
of your field times xi y.

00:44:37.682 --> 00:44:39.140
So what this is
going to do, if you

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.420
think about the way this is
going to act on these things,

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.360
you're going to get a sinusoidal
acceleration associated

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.550
with the displacement of
this little sea of freely

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.330
falling bodies as the
gravitational wave comes along.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:58.370
And it's going to
do so in such a way

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:01.220
that the displacement
in the x direction

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.830
does the opposite of what the
displacement in the y direction

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:04.740
is doing.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:15.060
So as time passes, you'll
find that-- so, initially,

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.100
let's say it stretches along
x, but then squeezes along y.

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:30.070
Then it's a sinusoid, so,
a quarter of a cycle later,

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:33.070
it's back to being a circle.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:40.700
And, a quarter of a cycle
later, it stretches along y

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.760
and squeezes along x.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.760
Let's consider the limit
now where hxx is equal to 0,

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.770
and hxy is some sinusoid.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.630
So I start out with my circle.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.428
Look at your
equations over here.

00:46:30.428 --> 00:46:31.970
Think about what
they're going to do.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:36.460
Now we're going to find that the
change in x and the change in y

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.420
is correlated.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:45.540
So this guy stretches
it out into an ellipse

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.670
along a 45-degree line.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:55.170
A quarter of a cycle later,
it's back to being a circle.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:59.360
And a quarter of a cycle
later, it does the same thing

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.480
but with opposite sign.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:08.840
These two fields,
my hxx and my hxy,

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.830
are what we call the
fundamental polarizations

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:12.890
of a gravitational wave.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.980
Polarization states are
only defined with respect

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:26.610
to a particular set
of basis vectors.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.840
So if I make my basis
vectors be this x and y,

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.420
we call this one, for reasons
that I hope are obvious,

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.920
the plus polarization.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:45.300
The gravitational wave acts as
a tidal stretch and squeeze.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.620
Notice what's going on here.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.830
I stretch along this axis,
squeeze along this one.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.070
A quarter of a cycle later,
I squeeze along this one,

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.180
stretch along that one.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:05.890
So I get a tidal
stretch and squeeze,

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.410
where the main directions
along which the stretch

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.080
and squeeze are
happening is plus shaped

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.310
with respect to these axes.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:28.937
This one is known as
the cross polarization.

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:41.310
You also have a tidal
stretch and squeeze,

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:43.200
but the lines of
force in this case

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.870
are along axes that
have an X shape.

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.300
So at the level
of 8.962, this is

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.710
all we're going to say about the
way that these things act on--

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.380
how gravitational waves act
and what their observables are.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.980
And I deliberately chose
to wear my LIGO today,

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:38.110
because what LIGO does is
look for these tidal stretches

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.400
and squeezes.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.130
And the way it does
so-- so, obviously, it's

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.650
technologically
not really feasible

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:46.000
to set up a ring like this.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.533
But what we can do is sample
the ring here and here.

00:49:49.533 --> 00:49:50.950
Actually, it's a
little bit better

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.990
to do on the plus
polarization plot.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.790
So you make an
experimental setup that

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.825
samples the ring here and here.

00:50:02.825 --> 00:50:04.450
And if a gravitational
wave comes along

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:07.090
and it's lined up right,
you see, ah, look at that.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.130
I'm getting that
stretch and squeeze.

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:12.820
The way you actually measure
it out is essentially a timing

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.060
experiment, exactly like this
little calculation I did here.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.930
You bounce light
between mirrors,

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:25.390
and you very carefully time
the round-trip travel time

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:28.730
from one mirror to the other.

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:32.590
And what's particularly cool
is the experimental aspect

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.040
of this.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.900
So how does one measure
the time so precisely?

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.448
Well, you use a laser
beam as your clock.

00:50:41.448 --> 00:50:43.990
And what's beautiful about doing
that is the way that you can

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:45.940
actually sort of do the
metrology at the level

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.470
necessary to get the precision
to measure your hxx's in here

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:53.300
is by interference.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.510
So you can treat the
incoming laser beam

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.760
as defining your time
standard, and then

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.060
by interfering the light that
has traveled down the arm

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:05.090
and bounced back
with that laser beam,

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.620
basically the laws
of nature allow

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:10.840
you to automatically
check and see

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:15.010
whether there is a shift in
the time of arrival associated

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:18.310
with the action of the
gravitational wave.

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:21.860
So I imagine there will be
some questions about this.

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.987
There is a homework exercise
that allows you to sort of test

00:51:24.987 --> 00:51:27.070
drive some of these concepts
and allows you to see

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:29.990
how it is that LIGO works.

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:31.750
It really just sort
of touches the-- it

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:33.310
just scratches the
surface of what

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.430
an amazing experimental
feat it is.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:40.928
But it should give you a good
idea as to what goes into that.

00:51:40.928 --> 00:51:42.720
Now, there is an
important part to all this

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.210
that we've not talked about yet.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.660
I handed you hij.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.920
Really, I handed you h mu nu.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.580
The big thing that
we care about next

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:07.840
is, given a particular
source, how do I

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.060
compute this radiation field?

00:52:18.492 --> 00:52:21.900
So bearing in mind
that hijtt, this

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:25.380
is the gauge-invariant
radiative degree

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:31.810
of freedom in my space-time,
how do I compute this guy?

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:40.620
And what I'm going to
do is borrow sort of one

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.500
of the most important lessons of
that gauge-invariant formalism.

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:07.230
So we need to be cautious of
the fact that, in some gauges--

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:08.790
for example the
Lorentz gauge, which

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.571
is so convenient for solving
the Einstein equation--

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:30.100
components of the metric appear
to be radiative whether they

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:30.960
are or they aren't.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.440
This is a consequence
of our gauge.

00:53:50.320 --> 00:54:05.470
But we also know only hijtt
is radiation in all gauges.

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:11.950
So that was what the
previous lecture was about.

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:13.960
As I've emphasized, it was
a slightly advanced one.

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.970
I don't expect everyone
to follow all details.

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:19.690
But if you can sort of grok
these two main concepts,

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:23.120
you're ready to now exploit
this in the following way.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.925
What you do is,
step a, compute--

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:43.160
find some metric perturbation
in any convenient gauge

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.390
by any convenient method.

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:10.200
Once you have that,
extract hijtt.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:15.780
You're done.

00:55:33.857 --> 00:55:35.440
So that's what we're
going to do right

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:40.960
now in the last 20 or so minutes
of this recorded lecture.

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.750
So the way we're going
to do it is let's

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:13.420
take the linearized Einstein
equation in Lorentz gauge.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.650
As we showed in--

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:36.750
I believe it was
two lectures ago,

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:38.470
the Einstein field
equations in this case

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:40.840
reduce to a flat
space-time wave operator

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.520
on the trace-reversed
metric perturbation,

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.650
being up to a factor
of minus 16 pi

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:52.000
G of the stress-energy tensor.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.540
And this has an exact solution.

00:57:21.488 --> 00:57:25.200
So I'll remind you
of this notation.

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:34.050
So this is the field at time
t and spatial location x.

00:57:40.994 --> 00:57:43.060
x and t-- well, let's
write it like this.

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.385
t and x are my field point.

00:57:47.385 --> 00:57:48.760
That is where I
measure my field.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:59.300
x prime is my source point.

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.090
That is where I am looking
at my particular contribution

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:04.250
to the integral.

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:06.710
As we're doing this calculation,
there was a t prime,

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:09.440
but the radiative Green's
function turned that t prime

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.730
into this retarded time.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:13.790
So what we are seeing
is that the field at t

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:16.970
depends upon what's going
on at the source at t

00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:20.210
minus the interval of time
it takes for information

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:22.670
to propagate from x prime to x.

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.860
So what I'm going
to do is, first, I'm

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.640
going to introduce a
couple of approximations

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.130
that reflect the reality of
the conditions on which we

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:39.160
typically evaluate
this integral.

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.820
And then we're going to talk
about how to solve this thing,

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:47.140
and, given that we have now
solved it, how to project out

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.320
the gauge-invariant degrees
of freedom associated

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.530
with the radiation.

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:06.667
Whoops, pardon me.

00:59:06.667 --> 00:59:07.417
Let's put this up.

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.470
So first is I introduce
this approximation.

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:23.280
It's worth bearing in mind that
when you are calculating this,

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.458
x minus x prime, which is
kind of like the distance

00:59:25.458 --> 00:59:27.000
from a particular
point in the source

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.010
to where you're making
your measurement,

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:32.480
it is generally a lot larger
than the size of the source.

00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:48.040
So the kind of situation
we're thinking about

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.530
is, here we are, making our
measurements at some point x

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:52.030
here.

00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.220
Here's my source,
and here is a point x

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.100
prime inside the source.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.750
So the thing to bear
in mind is that,

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.410
for the kind of
calculations where that--

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:11.492
when one is actually doing
this, x minus x prime--

01:00:11.492 --> 01:00:13.450
well, if I think about
the kind of measurements

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:15.550
that LIGO is doing,
for example, that

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.200
is typically
hundreds of millions

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.380
to billions of light years.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.560
The size of the source
itself is of order tens

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.875
to hundreds of kilometers.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.480
Bit of a separation of length
scales there, you would say.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.320
So what I'm going to do is
approximate the solution

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:38.373
of that integral, and,
for pedantic sake,

01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:40.040
I'm going to use an
approximately equal.

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:47.490
What I'm going to do is
replace x minus x prime with r.

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:50.640
Let's just say that
this distance here

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.780
is effectively the same for
all points in the source.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.280
I can pull that out
of the integral.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.120
If you like, you
can refine this.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.155
There's a more
careful expansion.

01:01:16.155 --> 01:01:17.780
And if you've done
any electrodynamics,

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.155
you should be
familiar with this.

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:38.820
And it uses the fact that
1 over x minus x prime

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.350
can be expanded in
Legendre polynomials,

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:45.403
in a sum of Legendre
polynomials.

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.270
So if you do that, you
can introduce refinements

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.250
to what I'm about to
derive right here.

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.657
What this does, then, is it
defines a multipolar expansion.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.370
I am not going to do that.

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.520
I'm just going to look
at the very first term.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.950
And you can sort
of think of that

01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:31.560
as saying that I am just
doing the leading, the most

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.530
important multipole.

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:38.190
Additional multipoles beyond
that are certainly important,

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:41.580
and people who work in the field
of gravitational radiation,

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.670
we certainly do
not neglect them.

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:48.420
In fact, much of
my current research

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:54.360
is based on sort of high-order
calculations associated

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.560
with looking at behavior of
some of those multipoles.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.170
This will be fine for
initial pedagogical purposes.

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:06.470
Next, we're going to use the
fact that only the spatial--

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.970
whoops.

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.512
That's not supposed
to be an h tilde.

01:03:08.512 --> 01:03:10.162
My apologies.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:11.870
That's supposed to be
h bar, because this

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:13.018
is the trace-reverse thing.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.110
Weird times, folks.

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:23.910
Where was I at?

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:24.410
Yes.

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:28.390
So I am only going to care about
the spatial pieces of this.

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:30.790
You might protest, hey,
isn't it the spatial part

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:33.070
of the metric, not the
trace-reverse metric,

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:33.903
that matters?

01:03:33.903 --> 01:03:34.945
And you would be correct.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.860
If you do this carefully,
to be perfectly blunt,

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.610
you have to sort of
finish the calculation

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:45.642
before you can kind of justify
the step I'm about to make.

01:03:45.642 --> 01:03:48.100
And we're not going to have
time to do that very carefully,

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.590
but I'll make a
comment about it.

01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:53.170
For now, it suffices
to say we only care

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:54.670
about the spatial components.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.170
So I'm going to take my
alpha beta over to an ij.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.590
So I now have
something that involves

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:29.330
the integral of
the spatial pieces

01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:32.870
of the stress-energy
tensor over my source.

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.100
And now I'm going to take
advantage of an Easter egg

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:39.330
that was hidden in
an early problem set.

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.760
Back on problem
set 2, I asked you

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.230
to prove a result that I called
the tensor virial theorem.

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:55.900
One of the reasons why I
assigned that was that I knew I

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.353
was going to need
it in this lecture.

01:04:58.353 --> 01:04:59.770
And what the tensor
virial theorem

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:09.680
told us is that if
I integrate that,

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:16.867
this ends up being equivalent
to 1/2 two time derivatives.

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:33.500
It's equal to the integral
of two time derivatives--

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.000
excuse me.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.730
It's two time derivatives of
the integral of the 00 piece

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:38.280
of my stress-energy tensor.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.223
So it's the second moment
of that, xi prime, xj prime.

01:05:43.223 --> 01:05:45.890
This is great, because what I've
got in the left-hand side here,

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:47.554
that's exactly what
my integral is.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.260
Actually, you know what?

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.550
This is going to give
me a result that's

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.518
sufficiently clean.

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:55.310
I want a new board.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:23.000
So when that is done,
what I finally see

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.300
is that my hij,
trace reversed, is

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:34.550
2 G over r two time
derivatives of a tensor

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:37.550
that I will call Iij.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:52.680
This is what I get
when I integrate T 00,

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.250
two moments of T 00.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:07:02.000
This is called the quadrupole
moment of the source.

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:12.220
The asterisk is because,
as you guys will

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.050
see on one of the
problem sets, there's

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:16.413
a slight tweak that goes
in the exact definition

01:07:16.413 --> 01:07:17.830
of the quadrupole
moment which has

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:24.250
to do with the behavior
of the trace of Iij.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.710
I will just leave
this like so for now,

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:30.880
and leave you guys to explore
that on a problem set.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.110
So we're almost done.

01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:41.590
What I now need
to do is pull out

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:43.470
the transverse and
traceless piece of this.

01:08:00.133 --> 01:08:02.050
Let's consider the
transverse condition first.

01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:32.740
So, to do the
transverse condition,

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.615
I'm going to take
advantage of the fact that,

01:08:34.615 --> 01:08:50.620
far from the source, box
of h bar ij is equal to 0,

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.870
because I'm in a region where
the source is equal to 0

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:54.617
when I'm far away from it.

01:08:54.617 --> 01:08:56.200
This suggests that
what we ought to do

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.229
is expand our
solution plane waves.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:19.240
So what I can do is write h bar.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.880
And I'm going to choose
my indices carefully here,

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.830
call it jl.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:28.630
It's some amplitude that does
not depend on space or time,

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:37.510
e to the i omega t minus a
wave vector dotted with x.

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:41.950
So this amplitude may depend
on omega, may depend on k.

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:44.340
It does not depend on t or on x.

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.529
And the reason I changed
my indices from i and j

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:50.100
to j and l, and I did
not use the index k,

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.297
is just to avoid confusion
between square root of minus 1

01:09:53.297 --> 01:09:54.130
and the wave vector.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.052
To be absolutely careful,
this is a single mode.

01:10:01.052 --> 01:10:03.510
If you like, maybe you should
think about this as something

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:04.950
that I have--

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:07.933
I'm doing a sum or an
integral over omega and k

01:10:07.933 --> 01:10:09.600
in order to reconstruct
the whole thing.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.340
This is just a single Fourier
mode in the wave field.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:20.360
So if I want this
to be transverse,

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.890
that condition is that
the divergence of this guy

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.460
be equal to 0.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:34.890
But when I take the divergence
of this, this becomes--

01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:38.540
I pull down a factor of
minus i, and I pull down

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:41.870
the j-th component
of my wave vector k.

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:55.740
And I get my wave--

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.550
my Fourier term.

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:06.540
That can be thought of as--

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.580
so we can clear out
the factor of minus i.

01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:55.198
The transverse condition
boils down to saying that kj--

01:11:55.198 --> 01:11:55.698
whoops.

01:12:03.372 --> 01:12:04.080
No, that's right.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.800
That's right.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:10.450
kj contracted on the
wave field is equal to 0.

01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:13.420
In other words,
the wave field is

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:17.230
orthogonal to the wave vector.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.790
If you have studied
electrodynamics,

01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:36.800
this should be familiar to you.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.050
This is the same--

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:40.090
it's exactly the
same as the idea

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:42.130
that when I have an
electromagnetic wave,

01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:46.060
my E field and my B field are
orthogonal to the direction

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:49.210
of propagation.

01:12:49.210 --> 01:13:01.298
Let's define a unit vector n sub
j to be kj but just normalized.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.630
So my wave is propagating in the
direction of the unit vector n.

01:13:14.655 --> 01:13:16.530
Go back to another Easter
egg that was hidden

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:17.760
on an earlier problem set.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.470
You guys studied
projection tensors.

01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:41.250
If I introduce the
projection tensor Pij,

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:45.840
Pij will project
any spatial vector.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:53.190
It will project out the
components normal, orthogonal

01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:54.660
to the direction
of propagation n.

01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:28.870
You can in fact think of
Pij as defining the metric

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:32.350
for the subspace that
is orthogonal to n.

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:38.090
So imagine that your wave is
propagating in the n direction.

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:40.090
There's a plane being
carried along with it.

01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:43.690
The plane is orthogonal
to n, and Pij

01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:47.470
is the metric you use to
define spatial distances

01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:48.200
in that plane.

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:57.980
Using Pij, we can now make
my h trace-- excuse me.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:14:59.210
I can make it transverse.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.960
All I need to do--

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.380
I'll put one T on this
to denote Transverse.

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.690
Whoops.

01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:57.940
All I need to do is
project each of its indices

01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.770
within that tensor.

01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:01.210
So we're almost there.

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:04.435
It's transverse, but
not yet trace free.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.370
So if I take the
trace on this guy,

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:18.580
taking the trace on
this guy amounts to--

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:30.050
I am going to require
that this be equal to 0.

01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:37.810
Now, suppose I have some
tensor that is not trace free,

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.670
and I want to remove its trace.

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:55.500
I'm going to make this
a two-index tensor.

01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:05.497
So I'm not going to prove
the following result.

01:17:05.497 --> 01:17:06.955
You can easily
verify for yourself.

01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:29.850
The formula for doing so is that
aij trace free is aij minus 1

01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:41.410
over N akl gkl gij.

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:51.590
G is the metric that
describes the manifold

01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:52.730
in which this tensor lives.

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.571
N is its dimension.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:26.390
Now, for us, the tensor field
whose trace I want to remove

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.890
is hijT.

01:18:52.860 --> 01:19:00.150
So hij bar T is the field
whose trace I wish to remove.

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:06.830
This lives in the
two-dimensional manifold

01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:20.380
whose metric is the
projection tensor Pij.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.910
And we are working in a space
where raising and lowering

01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:24.910
indices, there's really
no important distinction

01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:26.050
between the two of
them, because we're

01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:27.258
working in linearized theory.

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:47.110
So I remove the trace by taking
this guy and subtracting off--

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.430
pardon me just one moment.

01:19:51.364 --> 01:19:52.342
Yes, sorry.

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.270
Subtracting off like so.

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.770
Pardon me.

01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:04.840
It should have a T on it.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.270
Plugging in my
various definitions,

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:24.620
this turns into hlk
Pli Pkj minus 1/2.

01:20:42.062 --> 01:20:44.270
So you might want to go and
check some algebra there,

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:45.000
but this is all--

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.760
I'm very confident in this.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.940
There's an overall
factor of h bar lk.

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.440
And the last thing
which I will note

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.080
is that, once I have
removed the trace,

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:00.350
this bar becomes meaningless.

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:03.715
It's trace free, so the trace
reversing of it has no action.

01:21:03.715 --> 01:21:05.840
Now, you should be a little
bit careful about that.

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.640
There's a few different
notions of trace

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.620
that went into this definition.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.650
Without proof, and just stating
that by being a little bit more

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.090
careful of some
of the definitions

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:17.990
we put down, the
difference between--

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:19.640
when you count this
up, you'll find

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.450
that you may be
making a small error,

01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:24.830
but it is on the order
of terms that are

01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:26.776
quadratic in the perturbation.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.520
Putting all these
pieces together,

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:41.030
we finally obtain our
transverse and traceless

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:42.395
metric perturbation.

01:21:55.273 --> 01:21:56.190
Which looks like this.

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:31.370
This is a result known
as the quadrupole formula

01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:32.450
for gravitational waves.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.630
This is-- so given--

01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:47.050
just take a stock
of the final result.

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:51.490
Suppose you have some
dynamic gravitating source.

01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:56.870
This is telling me, what I do is
I compute the quadrupole moment

01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:59.420
associated with that source.

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:02.840
I take two time derivatives.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.420
I hit it with this combination
of projection tensors, which

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.567
has to do-- that tells me
things about the geometry

01:23:07.567 --> 01:23:08.150
of the source.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.372
That's saying that my
source, the waves that

01:23:10.372 --> 01:23:12.830
come from the source propagate
along a particular direction

01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:13.790
to me.

01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:16.520
This picks out the
components that

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.960
are transverse with
respect to that direction

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:22.370
and are traceless, so that I
don't have any gauge degrees

01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:24.500
of freedom in what results.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.100
Multiply by twice Newton's
constant, divide by distance.

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.430
And this is a wave
field that our friends

01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:36.500
over in Building NW22 can now
measure pretty much every day.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.750
You're going to do a few
homework exercises associated

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:39.250
with.

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:46.320
One thing which is worth
commenting on before I move on

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:51.810
is, when you keep
factors of c in this,

01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:55.887
that G goes over to
G over c to the--

01:23:55.887 --> 01:23:56.470
wait a minute.

01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:58.342
Let me double-check that.

01:23:58.342 --> 01:24:00.850
Is it G over c to the
fourth or G over c squared?

01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:03.210
Anyhow, it's G divided
by c to some power.

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.390
Let's just say that it's
missing factors of c.

01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:14.180
I may comment on
that in some notes

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:16.980
that I will add to the board.

01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:18.980
And so that kind of tells
you that this is going

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:23.930
to be a really small quantity.

01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:26.570
Makes it very hard for
these things to be measured.

01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:29.530
Nonetheless, it turns out
even though they have--

01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.960
if you think about the impact
they have on the detector,

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.900
even though it's small, they
carry a tremendous amount

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.760
of energy.

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.590
I'm going to take a
break before I begin

01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:41.600
recording my next lecture.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.400
But the next lecture
is actually going

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.770
to lead us to an understanding
of a different version

01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:47.180
of the quadrupole formula.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.000
It's based on this, but it
describes the energy content

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.070
of gravitational waves.

01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:56.232
Both of these formulas go by
the name the quadrupole formula.

01:24:56.232 --> 01:24:59.720
It's a little bit confusing
sometimes if both are used.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.850
And you're going
to use both of them

01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:03.990
on upcoming homework
assignments.

01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.490
All right.

01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:07.270
So I will end this
recording here.

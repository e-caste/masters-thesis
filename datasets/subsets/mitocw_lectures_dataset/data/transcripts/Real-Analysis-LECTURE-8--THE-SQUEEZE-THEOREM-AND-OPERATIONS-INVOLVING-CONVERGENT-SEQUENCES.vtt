00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUES: So I'm
going to prove a few theorems

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
about limits, which will
allow us to compute limits,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:84%
or at least we can use to prove
that other non-trivial limits

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
exist using these
theorems, rather than using

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:90%
the definition directly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So this first theorem is the
easiest theorem in the world

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's simply just
restating the definition

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:90%
of convergence of a sequence.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to state it as
follows, so pretty short,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
that if I have a
sequence x sub n,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
then it converges to x if and
only if the sequence obtained

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:84%
by taking the absolute value
of x of n minus x equals 0,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
or the limit of
that sequence is 0.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:90%
So what is the proof?

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It follows just immediately
from the definition.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not even going
to write anything.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave it to you.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But the proof follows from the
definition and the simple fact

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
that x sub n minus
x in absolute value

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the absolute value
of the absolute value of x sub

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:90%
n minus x minus 0, OK.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So the definition says
for all epsilon positive,

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
you have to find an M so that
this is less than epsilon

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
for all m bigger than
or equal to capital M.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you found such a
capital M for this to be less

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
than epsilon, then
this will be less

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
than epsilon, which is saying
that this limit equals 0.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And then going the other
direction, it's the same thing.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
following directly

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
from the definition
and this simple fact.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, that was a very
silly fact about limits,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:84%
but a very useful
one in conjunction

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.742 align:middle line:84%
with the next theorem,
which is not so trivial,

00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:90%
which is the squeeze theorem.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And it says the following.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So let an, bn, and
xn be sequences such

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that the following
holds for all n

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.370 align:middle line:84%
natural numbers, a
sub n is less than

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
or equal x sub n is less
than or equal to b sub n.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And a sub n and b sub n
are convergent sequences.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And their limits
equal each other.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're given by
some number, call it x.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Then the conclusion
is that the limit as n

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of
x sub n equals x.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I write something like
this, you should also kind of--

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
there's half a sentence
before that that

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
goes with this saying, x of
n is a conversion sequence.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And its limit is equal to x.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's two statements
in one when I write that.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you just draw a
picture, the squeezed theorem

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be too surprising.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So this is a little discussion.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So here's x, the common
limit of a sub n and b sub n.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we can imagine that we're
trying to show the limit as n

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of
x sub n equals x.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So that means we have to find
for every epsilon a capital M

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
so that x sub n is
between x plus epsilon

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and x minus epsilon.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So if I go out a
little bit, I would

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:84%
hope I can find
a natural number,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
a capital M so that
x sub n minus x--

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.230 align:middle line:84%
or x sub n is in
this little interval.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.595 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I'm assuming that a
sub n and x sub n, if a sub n

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and b sub n are squeezing
x sub n, in other words x

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
sub n is between the two, and b
sub n is converging to x, then

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
for n bigger than or
equal to some integer M0,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.603 align:middle line:84%
all of the b sub n's
are in this interval.

00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, maybe they're not there.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they could be over here.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But the way I drew it is
just to the right of x.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And, likewise, since a
sub n is converging to x,

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
there exists some
other integer M sub 1

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.240 align:middle line:84%
so that if I look at a sub n,
it's also in this interval.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's over here.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's-- well, it can't
be to the right of b sub n

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
because that inequality up there
strictly implies that a sub n

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
is less than or
equal to b sub n.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's in this interval.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So then what would
that say if I look

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:84%
at n bigger than or equal to
n plus M1, M0 plus M1, then n

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than M0, this guy.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And n is bigger than
both and M1, this guy.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And therefore if
I look at x sub n,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.212 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
between these two.

00:06:40.212 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, it's
going to be in this interval.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
proof in a picture.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And now our goal is
just to write it down.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
picture of the proof.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you're actually trying
to guess why this would be true?

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the b sub
n's, you can imagine,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:90%
are getting very close to x.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.365 align:middle line:84%
The a sub n's are also
getting very close to x.

00:07:04.365 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:84%
x sub n is in between
the two, so it's

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
getting squeezed to
x, and thus the name.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we just need to
turn this into written word.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:90%
So we need to show--

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
we're going to show that
x sub n converges to x.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're-- all we have is
an epsilon delta proof.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Or we could use that theorem.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:84%
But let's go with an
epsilon delta proof.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not epsilon delta,
epsilon M. Epsilon delta proofs

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:90%
will come later.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And since b sub n
converges to x, there

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:84%
exist to M0 in natural numbers
such that for all n bigger

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to n sub 0, b sub
n minus x is less than epsilon

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:29.748 align:middle line:84%
in absolute value, which is
the same as saying-- well,

00:08:29.748 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's not the same.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But it implies that b sub n
is less than x plus epsilon.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Since a sub n's
converge to x as well,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
there exists a M sub
1, natural number,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
such that for all n
bigger than or equal M1,

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
a sub n minus x
in absolute value

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
is less than epsilon,
which implies

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
a sub n is between x minus
epsilon and x plus epsilon,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
but I'm only going to use
one of those inequalities.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to choose the
capital M for my sequence

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
x sub n, I'm trying to
show convergence to x.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So choose m to be m
sub-zero plus M sub 1.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could have chosen
it to be the maximum of the two.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.525 align:middle line:84%
But this works
just fine as well.

00:09:35.525 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Then if n is bigger
than or equal to m,

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
this implies n is bigger
than or equal to M0

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and M is bigger than
or equal to M1, which

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:84%
implies that both of
these inequalities

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:90%
here are valid for this n.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So then x minus epsilon is
less than a sub n, which

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:13.970 align:middle line:84%
by assumption, is less than
or equal to x sub n, which

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to b
sub n, which is less than x

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:90%
plus epsilon.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, these string
of inequalities,

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
therefore, tell us
that x minus epsilon

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:84%
is less than x sub
n is less than x

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
plus epsilon, which is
equivalent to saying

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of x, so then
minus x is less than epsilon.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.115 align:middle line:84%
And therefore x sub
n converges to x.

00:10:45.115 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.620 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So these two facts together give
us a very robust and short way

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:90%
to prove limits of sequences.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, let me
give you a simple one.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's show the limit as n goes
to infinity of n squared over n

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:90%
squared plus n plus 1 equals 1.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, this is
a very simple limit

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:90%
to use these theorems on.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But in practice,
you don't always

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
have just a simple
expression like this.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:02.772 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.772 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use these two
theorems in conjunction

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.647 align:middle line:84%
to prove some other
theorems here in a minute.

00:12:06.647 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But let's just see
it in action once.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Let me look at--

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
so this sequence
converges to 1 if and only

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
if the absolute value of the
difference converges to 0.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the absolute
value of the difference.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to-- now
just doing the algebra--

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.510 align:middle line:90%
this is equal to--

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and taking absolute
values gives me n plus 1

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:90%
over n squared plus n plus 1.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is less
than or equal to.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
This 1 is making things
bigger, so I can drop it.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is less than
or equal to n plus 1

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:90%
over n squared plus n.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, n squared plus n I can
factor into n times n plus 1.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So then that cancels with
this n plus 1 on top.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:90%
And I just get 1 over n.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So 0 is less than or equal
to n squared over n squared

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:84%
plus n plus 1 minus 1, which is
less than or equal to 1 over n.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, 1 over n we've shown
using epsilon delta proof--

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, epsilon M proof.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
We've shown 1 over
n converges to 0.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
So since 0 converges
to 0, the left side,

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and 1 over n converges
to 0, the right side,

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that implies by the
squeeze theorem,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
n squared over n squared plus
n plus 1 minus 1 converges

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:90%
to 0 by the squeeze theorem.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Which implies that
n squared over n

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:84%
squared plus n plus 1 converges
to 1 by that first theorem.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:84%
OK now you can imagine
that instead of having this

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
at your disposal, I asked
you to do an epsilon

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:84%
proof, an epsilon M
proof of this statement,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
then you would have taken
this and played with it

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
just like we did here
and gotten to 1 over n.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.278 align:middle line:84%
And therefore if this
is less than epsilon,

00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that would imply this
is less than epsilon.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So you would choose
capital M to be--

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
so that 1 over capital
M is less than epsilon.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But using these two theorems
saves us a little work

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.965 align:middle line:90%
and a little time.

00:15:06.965 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, so at the end
of the lecture last time,

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:84%
we discussed the
notion of subsequences.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And we showed that limiting--
limits and subsequences

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:84%
interact nicely, meaning if
I have a convergent sequence,

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:84%
then every subsequence
converges to the same thing.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So now a natural
question is, how

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
do limits interact with the
order of the real numbers?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
R has these two fundamental
properties about it,

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:90%
that it's--

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:84%
so first off, that it has the
least upper bound property,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.555 align:middle line:84%
and also that it's
an ordered field.

00:16:20.555 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So first natural
question is, how

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
does this definition of
limit convergence interact

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:90%
with the order?

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So the first theorem states, or
this term that kind of answers

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
this question is the following
is that limits respect order,

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So if xn, yn, are convergent
sequences and for all n,

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
xn is less than or
equal to yn, then

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:90%
what should be the conclusion?

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:90%
The limit as n goes to infinity.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So what I said a minute ago
as limits respect inequality.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.339 align:middle line:84%
Then I should be able to
take the limits of both sides

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:90%
and still have this inequality.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Then limit as n goes to infinity
is less than or equal to limit

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to
infinity of y sub n.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And a simple corollary
that follows from this

00:17:46.800 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:84%
is that if x sub n is
a convergent sequence,

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and for all n a natural number,
you have two numbers a and b,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:84%
such that a sub n is
less than or equal to--

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:84%
or a is less than or
equal to x sub n is

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal
to b, then this

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:84%
implies that the limit of x
sub n is also between a and b.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Let me say something
very brief about what

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:90%
this says and doesn't say.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:90%
So what does this not say?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:19:04.550 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.235 align:middle line:84%
You may lose a strict
inequality, meaning what?

00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It can be the case that x
sub n is less than y sub

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.860 align:middle line:84%
n for all of n, but
the limit of x sub n

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:90%
equals the limit of y sub n.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So simply having less than x
sub n less than y sub n does not

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:84%
imply the limit of x sub n is
less than the limit of y sub n.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.725 align:middle line:84%
All right, so what
do I mean by this?

00:19:30.725 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:46.078 align:middle line:84%
This does not imply that the
limit is less than y sub n.

00:19:46.078 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this point in
class, I would ask somebody

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:90%
to give me a counter example.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, I'm going
to take a bite of my cookie

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:90%
and let you think about that.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to take
a bite of my cookie.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
You could have just paused the
video and thought about it.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.130 align:middle line:84%
But then I wouldn't get
a bite of my cookie.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what's an example of two
sequences that satisfy this,

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:90%
but don't satisfy this?

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:84%
If x sub n equals 0 for all n,
and y sub n equals 1 over n,

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
then the x sub n is less
than y sub n for all n.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.242 align:middle line:90%
And what's the limit x sub n?

00:20:55.242 --> 00:20:56.075 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's just 0.

00:20:56.075 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And before the limit of
y sub n, that's just 0.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And these two things
equal each other.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:90%
This is not less than that, OK.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.145 align:middle line:84%
So just want to make
that small point.

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Could pop up as a small question
on one of the midterms--

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.695 align:middle line:84%
I should say the midterm--
and possibly the final.

00:21:23.695 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:32.286 align:middle line:90%
All right, so let's prove--

00:21:32.286 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:90%
[COUGHS] let's prove 1.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.335 align:middle line:90%
2 follows immediately from one.

00:21:37.335 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
For two, we simply
take, for example,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.210 align:middle line:84%
the upper inequality
x sub n is less

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to
b, we take y sub

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:90%
n to be the constant sequence b.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And for the other one, we
would take the bigger sequence

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
to be x sub n, and
the smaller sequence

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:90%
to be the constant sequence a.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So two follows immediately from
1, so we're just going to do 1.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't done a
proof by contradiction

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
in a while, so why not
do it by contradiction?

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, so the proof--

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:84%
let's label these
sequences so I don't

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
have to write limit as n goes to
infinity, and limit of x sub n,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and limit as n goes to
infinity of y sub n so much.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's call their
limits x and y.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:90%
And what do we want to show?

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:90%
x is less than or equal to y.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:90%
That's our goal.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.164 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to prove
this by contradiction.

00:22:50.164 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:84%
That is, let's assume
y is less than x,

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and arrive at a false
statement, which

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
contradicts our setting our
assumptions that we have.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Assume y is less than x.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me draw a
picture here to go along

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:90%
with what's going to happen.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So if y is less than
x, all of the y sub n's

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:84%
have to be near y if
I go far enough out.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And all the x sub n's
have to be near x as long

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:90%
as I go far enough out.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So that would
contradict eventually

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the x
sub ns are supposed

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to be less than or equal to the
y sub n's, if y is less than x.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And let's say I
go out, let's say,

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.790 align:middle line:84%
half the distance
between y and x.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:90%
So this is like the midpoint.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And all the y sub n's are here,
and all the x sub n's are here,

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and the y sub n's are here, then
I cannot have x sub n less than

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.470 align:middle line:84%
or equal to y sub n,
which is my assumption,

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:84%
which is the assumption
in my theorem.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe I should
have written this here.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.710 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's good to reiterate
what your assumptions are.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Suppose for all n, x sub n
is less than or-- y sub n.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And-- like that.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing we're
trying to show is this, OK.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So we assume the
negation of this

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and arrive at a contradiction
to the things we're assuming,

00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:00.915 align:middle line:90%
or just to general true facts.

00:25:00.915 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.223 align:middle line:84%
I had to add the word true on
the facts, because they're,

00:25:10.223 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:84%
like I said, at
some point there's

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:84%
alternative facts
flying around out there.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this picture, we're
going to turn this into a proof.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So since yn converges to y,
there exists a natural number

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:84%
M sub 0 such that for all
n bigger than or equal to M

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:50.527 align:middle line:84%
sub 0, y sub n minus y is
less than x minus y over 2.

00:25:50.527 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a positive
number, because we're

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:90%
assuming x is bigger than y.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:26:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the definition of limit,
given any positive number,

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I can find an integer
so that for all n bigger

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to that
integer, this thing

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:90%
is less than that small number.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.905 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just choosing
that small number

00:26:07.905 --> 00:26:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to be this very
special small number,

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:14.968 align:middle line:84%
because that's going to help
me arrive at a contradiction.

00:26:14.968 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Since xn converges to x,
there exist M1 natural number

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:84%
such that for all n bigger
than or equal to M1, x

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
sub n minus x is less
than the same thing.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is putting
into a precise form what

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I was saying that
all the x sub n's

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.870 align:middle line:90%
to be close to x eventually.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And all the y sub n's to
be close to y eventually.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And how eventually?

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually enough so
that I'm in these two disjoint

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.215 align:middle line:90%
intervals, OK.

00:26:59.215 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Let n be M sub 0 plus M sub 1.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Then n is bigger than
or equal to M sub 0.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And n is bigger than
or equal to M sub 1.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So both of these inequalities
are valid for this n

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:90%
and what does this mean?

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, then that
implies that y sub n--

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:84%
so let me tack on
one more inequality.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Just by removing the
absolute values and adding y,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:84%
this tells me y sub n is
less than x plus y over 2.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And this tells me x
sub n is less than--

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.520 align:middle line:90%
or the other way, sorry.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll just
write this down here.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:90%
So

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Then y sub n is less than
y plus x minus y over 2,

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
which equals x plus y
over 2, which equals

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:90%
x minus x minus y over 2.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is less than x sub
n by the second inequality.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.840 align:middle line:84%
So this follows from
the first inequality.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:84%
This follows from the
second inequality,

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.650 align:middle line:84%
which implies for
this specific n,

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:90%
y sub n is less than x sub n.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is a contradiction
to our assumption

00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that y sub n is bigger than
or equal to x sub n for all n.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So we had just found, based
on this assumption here,

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.628 align:middle line:84%
that we arrive at
a contradiction

00:29:09.628 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:90%
to our other assumptions.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.175 align:middle line:84%
And therefore this
must be false.

00:29:14.175 --> 00:29:26.380 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's how limits
interact with inequalities.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So if I have two
sequences, one bigger

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:40.570 align:middle line:84%
than the other, then the
limits respect that inequality.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
That has to deal with
the order part of R

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.550 align:middle line:90%
being an ordered field.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So what about the field part
of R being an ordered field?

00:29:47.090 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So how does limits interact
with algebraic operations?

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:84%
All right, quite
well, it turns out.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.815 align:middle line:90%
So let's in theorem.

00:30:22.815 --> 00:30:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So suppose I have two
convergence sequences,

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:42.090 align:middle line:84%
limit as n goes to infinity
of x sub n equals x,

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and limit as n goes
to infinity of y sub n

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:84%
equals y, then
several things hold.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:00.860 align:middle line:84%
The first is that, again,
you should kind of read this

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
as two statements written
in one, limit as n

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of
x sub n plus y sub n.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is a new
sequence that I formed

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:84%
by just taking the term-by-term
sum of these two things.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.960 align:middle line:84%
This sequence, this new
sequence is convergent.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And the limit equals the
sum of the limits, OK?

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:84%
The second is, for
all c in R, the limit

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity of
the new sequence obtained

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:43.780 align:middle line:84%
by taking every entry
of the sequence x sub n

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and multiplying it
by this fixed number

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:84%
c, the limit of that product
is the product of c and x.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So limits respect what one would
call scalar multiplication.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:90%


00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But we could be more
general than that.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
c you can think of
as just one example

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
of a convergent sequence,
just a constant sequence.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But, in general, we
have that the product

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.640 align:middle line:84%
of two convergent
sequences is convergent.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.895 align:middle line:84%
And the limit of the product
is the product of the limit.

00:32:23.895 --> 00:32:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And, finally, if we
have something for--

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.700 align:middle line:90%
write it over here--

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:84%
if we have something
for a product,

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps we have
something by quotient.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's as long as
we can divide things.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So if for all n, y sub
n does not equal 0,

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and the limit y does not equal
0, then limit of the quotient

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:07.160 align:middle line:84%
x sub n over y sub n is the
quotient of the limits, OK.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're going to
prove this first one using

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:54.630 align:middle line:84%
this scheme of using both this
simple theorem about limits

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.190 align:middle line:90%
and the squeeze theorem.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:02.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite simple.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So we just use the
triangle inequality.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:16.820 align:middle line:84%
By the triangle inequality, 0
is less than or equal to x sub n

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:22.190 align:middle line:90%
plus y sub n minus x plus .

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:25.155 align:middle line:84%
And x sub n minus
x, y sub n minus y.

00:34:25.155 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I use the
triangle inequality.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I get x sub n minus
x plus y sub n--

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:84%
oh-- you know
what, scratch that.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Because, in fact, I was
trying to be too clever

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.735 align:middle line:84%
and would have ended
up using the theorem

00:34:41.735 --> 00:34:42.610 align:middle line:90%
to prove the theorem.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:43.832 align:middle line:90%
So let's not do that.

00:34:43.832 --> 00:34:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It's never good to
use the theorem you're

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.540 align:middle line:84%
trying to prove to prove
the theorem that you're

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:90%
trying to prove.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to basics
and use the definition.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:90%


00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So since x sub n converges to
x, there exists a natural number

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
M such that for all n bigger
than or equal to M0, x

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.340 align:middle line:90%
sub n minus x--

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.610 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to be a n,
but it looks like a k--

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.530 align:middle line:90%
less than epsilon over 2.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Why the 2?

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.248 align:middle line:90%
Well, you'll see in a minute.

00:35:28.248 --> 00:35:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And similarly for
the sequence y,

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
there exist M1 natural
number such that

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:51.420 align:middle line:84%
for all n bigger than or
equal to M1, y sub n minus y

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon over 2.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So I have these
two integers, which

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
are given to me by the fact that
x sub n converges to x, y sub n

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:84%
converges to y, and the
definition of convergence.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I can always find
these two integers

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.210 align:middle line:90%
for any small tolerance.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm choosing
the tolerance to be

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:16.890 align:middle line:84%
epsilon over 2 for some reason,
which you'll see in a minute.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what is the
integer capital M

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.910 align:middle line:84%
that I choose for this epsilon
for the sequence x sub n plus y

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:23.480 align:middle line:90%
sub n?

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.252 align:middle line:90%


00:36:26.252 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose
M to be M0 plus M1.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And now I need to show that
this choice of M works.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And if n is bigger
than or equal to M,

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:44.370 align:middle line:84%
this implies that n is
bigger than or equal to M0.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And M is bigger
than or equal to M1.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So both of these inequalities
are valid for this n.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:02.242 align:middle line:84%
And therefore I get x sub n
plus y sub n minus x plus y.

00:37:02.242 --> 00:37:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And now I do what I was
going to do a minute ago when

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.533 align:middle line:84%
I was going to use the
theorem to prove a theorem.

00:37:06.533 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:84%
x sub n minus x, y sub n minus
y, I group those together.

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I used a
triangle inequality.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.315 align:middle line:84%
This is less than
or equal to x sub

00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:90%
n minus x plus y sub n minus y.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And now this is less
than epsilon over 2.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:84%
This is less than epsilon
over 2, so equals epsilon.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And now you can see
why I chose the 2.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to show
this was less than epsilon.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And I had control
over these two things.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And the sum of controls
gives me epsilon.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So I choose the control
to be epsilon over 2.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:47.650 align:middle line:84%
If I had three
sequences, then you

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:84%
could probably guess though
which is epsilon over 3.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Meaning if I had
sequences x sun n y sub n,

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and z sub n, and I
looked at sum x sub n

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:84%
plus y sub n plus z sub n,
I could show that converges

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:01.900 align:middle line:90%
to the sum of the limits.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And I would choose
these integers M sub 0,

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.573 align:middle line:84%
M sub 1, M sub 2, so that
I have epsilon over 3 here,

00:38:08.573 --> 00:38:09.865 align:middle line:90%
so that they sum up to epsilon.

00:38:09.865 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:30.892 align:middle line:84%
So now we prove 2, that for this
single scalar multiplication

00:38:30.892 --> 00:38:32.350 align:middle line:84%
if you like where
you just multiply

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.260 align:middle line:84%
each term by a single
number, the limit

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.020 align:middle line:90%
respects that multiplication.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Do an epsilon proof again.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:47.780 align:middle line:90%


00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Since x sub n converges to x--

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.300 align:middle line:84%
so now we're trying to
show that second limit--

00:38:53.300 --> 00:39:01.740 align:middle line:84%
there exists M sub
0, a natural number,

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:09.270 align:middle line:84%
such that for all n than
or equal to M sub 0,

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:17.550 align:middle line:84%
x sub n minus x is less than
epsilon over the absolute value

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:21.960 align:middle line:90%
of c plus 1, OK.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.912 align:middle line:84%
And now you have to
trust me, why that thing?

00:39:24.912 --> 00:39:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, you'll see.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:84%
It'll come out
just like this did.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So for the sequence
c times x sub n,

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
we'll choose M to be
just this M sub 0.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Then if n is bigger
than or equal to M,

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:48.020 align:middle line:84%
which is equal to M sub 0, this
implies this inequality holds.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And therefore c times x
sub n minus c times x.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.230 align:middle line:84%
This c pops out of
the absolute value

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and becomes the absolute value
of c times the absolute value

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.025 align:middle line:90%
of x sub n minus x.

00:40:01.025 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:90%


00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And which is less than-- so
I'm writing less than here.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But this thing is
less than that.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:19.570 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] is less than
c over c plus 1 epsilon.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, this quotient here, this
number over this number plus 1,

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:90%
is always less than 1.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So this positive number
which is less than 1

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.600 align:middle line:84%
or non-negative number
which is less than 1

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.630 align:middle line:84%
is going to be less than
1 times epsilon, which

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.350 align:middle line:90%
gives me epsilon.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're wondering
why didn't I choose--

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:54.900 align:middle line:84%
so this is just a little smidgen
of sophistication, not much,

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.550 align:middle line:90%
just a little.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't I choose
this so that it's

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.310 align:middle line:84%
epsilon over the
absolute value of c

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:05.870 align:middle line:84%
so that when I stick in
my inequality for this guy

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.090 align:middle line:90%
I just get epsilon?

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, what if c equals 0?

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm telling you to
choose capital M sub 0 so

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that the absolute value of x sub
n minus x is less than epsilon

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:90%
over 0.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Division by 0 is a no no.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But if we fudge it
a little by adding 1

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.300 align:middle line:84%
we get something that
still does the job.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It still gives me
some number which

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
is non-negative and less
than 1, which is enough, OK.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:41.760 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.737 align:middle line:84%
So let's prove that the
limit of the product

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:47.945 align:middle line:90%
is the product of the limits.

00:41:47.945 --> 00:41:54.700 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.388 align:middle line:84%
Since the sequence y
sub n converges to y,

00:41:57.388 --> 00:41:59.680 align:middle line:84%
it's a convergent sequence,
and therefore it's bounded.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:07.390 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:13.960 align:middle line:84%
That means that there exists
some non-negative real number

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:25.387 align:middle line:84%
b such that for all
natural numbers n,

00:42:25.387 --> 00:42:28.740 align:middle line:84%
y sub n is less than or
equal to b in absolute value.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:33.850 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Then I look at x sub n times y
sub n minus x times y and I add

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:48.410 align:middle line:90%
and subtract x times y sub n.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:52.390 align:middle line:90%
You can write this as plus.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And now I use the
triangle inequality

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:10.220 align:middle line:84%
that this is less than or equal
to x sub n minus x times y sub

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:17.630 align:middle line:84%
n plus y sub n minus y
times absolute value of x.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And y sub n is bounded
by b for all n.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is less
than or equal to--

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:33.365 align:middle line:84%
plus y sub n minus y times
the absolute value of x.

00:43:33.365 --> 00:43:36.122 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.122 --> 00:43:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me just state
the obvious that we

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
get 0 is less than or
equal to x sub n times y

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.080 align:middle line:90%
sub n minus x times y.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is less
than or equal to,

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:58.960 align:middle line:84%
as we've shown here, plus
x times y sub n minus y.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:04.670 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, the right-hand
side-- so the left side

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.920 align:middle line:84%
of this inequality
converges to 0.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The right side
also converges to 0

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.660 align:middle line:84%
because we've just
shown by 1 and 2.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.925 align:middle line:90%
By 2, this converges to 0.

00:44:16.925 --> 00:44:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And by that theorem, since xn
converges to x, this product

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.980 align:middle line:84%
here converges to 0.
b is a fixed number.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing for
this, that converges to 0.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And therefore by 2,
this sum converges to 0.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these two
arrows are by 2.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And this is by 1.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
summarize by 1 and 2

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.100 align:middle line:84%
the right-hand side
of this inequality,

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:07.960 align:middle line:84%
b times x sub n minus x plus an
absolute value of x times y sub

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.430 align:middle line:90%
n minus y.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:11.680 align:middle line:90%
This converges to 0.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.585 align:middle line:84%
Which by the squeeze
theorem implies that--

00:45:16.585 --> 00:45:22.190 align:middle line:90%


00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:26.940 align:middle line:90%
this is by squeeze theorem--

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:35.050 align:middle line:84%
which implies that x sub n times
y sub n converges to x times

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:37.323 align:middle line:90%
y by that first theorem.

00:45:37.323 --> 00:45:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going
to keep referring

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.657 align:middle line:90%
to that first theorem.

00:45:39.657 --> 00:45:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it's such
a simple fact, I'm

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.920 align:middle line:84%
just going to keep using
it without referencing it,

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.580 align:middle line:84%
namely that the sequence, a
sequence converges to x if

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and only if the absolute value
of this thing, this difference,

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.340 align:middle line:90%
converges to 0, OK.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:02.450 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that proves
the limit of the product

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.190 align:middle line:90%
is the product of the limits.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, for the
quotient we can use 3

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.090 align:middle line:84%
once we've proven it
for just 1 over y sub n.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:20.510 align:middle line:90%
So what do I mean?

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So now we're assuming the y sub
n is not equal to 0 for all n.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.080 align:middle line:90%
And y does not equal 0.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So if we prove this
statement that the limit as n

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:52.950 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of 1 over y
sub n equals 1 over y, then by 3

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:58.480 align:middle line:84%
implies that the limit
as n goes to infinity

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:04.510 align:middle line:84%
of x sub n over y sub
n equals x over y.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Because x sub n over y sub n
is just a product of x sub n

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.090 align:middle line:90%
and 1 over y sub n.

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to prove this
special case if you like.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:21.343 align:middle line:90%


00:47:21.343 --> 00:47:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're to do it
kind of the same way.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Now because we're
dividing by y sub n,

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.900 align:middle line:84%
so here we use that we had an
upper bound for the product

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.800 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But when we take 1 over y sub n
to get an upper bound of that,

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:41.170 align:middle line:84%
it means we need a
lower bound on y sub n,

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.630 align:middle line:84%
on the absolute
values of y sub n.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And we get that by our
assumption that the limit is

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:52.240 align:middle line:84%
non-zero for all n, and
so is the y sub n's.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:48:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So first thing we prove, or
let me write this as a claim,

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:06.000 align:middle line:84%
there exists a positive
number b, little b,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.890 align:middle line:84%
such that for all
natural numbers n,

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:13.256 align:middle line:84%
y sub n is bigger
than or equal to b.

00:48:13.256 --> 00:48:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And we know that a
sequence is bounded.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there's
always a capital B

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:23.080 align:middle line:84%
so that absolute value of y sub
n is less than or equal to b.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.700 align:middle line:84%
But for sequences that are
non-zero and converging

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to a non-zero limit, then you
can bound them away from 0.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of the
same proof that we

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:43.240 align:middle line:84%
gave for showing that a
convergent sequence is bounded

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.450 align:middle line:90%
above.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:48.740 align:middle line:90%
So let me draw a quick picture.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:52.238 align:middle line:84%
And let's assume that the
limit is positive just

00:48:52.238 --> 00:48:53.405 align:middle line:90%
for the sake of the picture.

00:48:53.405 --> 00:48:56.010 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is a little discussion
on why this is true.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:01.885 align:middle line:84%
And this picture
is going to look--

00:49:01.885 --> 00:49:03.260 align:middle line:84%
at least the
explanation is going

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:08.840 align:middle line:84%
to be kind of similar to
why a sequence is bounded.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And this one is why
is it bounded below.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume that
the limit y is positive.

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And let's say I go
out within distance,

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:26.920 align:middle line:84%
let's say, y over 2 so
that I'm still positive.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is y minus y
over 2, absolute value.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So in this picture
y is positive.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's just
equal to y over 2.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Then what can I say?

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That eventually all of the y sub
n's are here in this interval

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:50.960 align:middle line:90%
away from 0.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, their absolute
value is bounded by y over 2.

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
write it that way.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So all the y sub n's or n
bigger than or equal to some M,

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.580 align:middle line:84%
all have to lie in this interval
because they're converging to y

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.160 align:middle line:90%
and y is positive.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And therefore in absolute value,
they're all bounded above--

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.260 align:middle line:90%
below I mean-- by y over 2.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.560 align:middle line:84%
They're all at least
distance y over 2 to 0.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then all that's
left to handle are--

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:30.560 align:middle line:84%
maybe the finitely many
that are left, y sub 1,

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:38.190 align:middle line:84%
y sub 2, y sub m minus 1, that
are scattered on the real line

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:39.440 align:middle line:90%
but are non-zero.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going
to end up taking

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:45.242 align:middle line:84%
the minimum of this number
and the absolute value

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:45.950 align:middle line:90%
of these numbers.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:51:01.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So since the y sub n's converge
to y, and y does not equal 0,

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:24.270 align:middle line:84%
there exist an integer
M such that all n bigger

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.430 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to capital
M. So this picture

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.710 align:middle line:90%
was why this claim is true.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It was not the proof of
why this claim is true.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:32.640 align:middle line:84%
What I'm writing now
is the actual proof

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.440 align:middle line:90%
of why this claim is true--

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.660 align:middle line:84%
such that for all n bigger
than or equal to a capital

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:46.670 align:middle line:84%
M, y sub n minus y in absolute
value is less than y over 2.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So for this picture I
drew where y is positive.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.690 align:middle line:84%
That would have
just been y over 2.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But you have to use an absolute
value for the other case

00:51:54.410 --> 00:52:00.240 align:middle line:84%
that y is negative, because
this has to b a positive number.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Then for all n bigger
than or equal to M,

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.080 align:middle line:84%
this any inequality and
the triangle inequality

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.530 align:middle line:84%
gives me-- so if I look at
the absolute value of y,

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:21.560 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to the absolute
value of y minus y sub n plus y

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.310 align:middle line:90%
sub n.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And now I use a
triangle inequality,

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:32.480 align:middle line:84%
which is less than--
this is less than y

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.910 align:middle line:90%
over 2 plus y sub n.

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And I started off with
the absolute value of y .

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So when I subtract
that over, that

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:49.890 align:middle line:84%
tells me that absolute
value of y over 2

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:56.320 align:middle line:84%
is less than absolute
value of y sub n for all n

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:05.670 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or
equal to capital M.

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So then I let to b to be the
minimum of several numbers.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.830 align:middle line:84%
know I'm writing min,
but I should write inf.

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But so if you like, let me
write inf of y1, Ym minus 1,

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:37.010 align:middle line:90%
and y over 2.

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And by what you are
doing on the assignment,

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the
assignment 2, this inf

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.560 align:middle line:90%
always exists in a finite set.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a finite set
of positive numbers.

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore it's
infimum exists

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:90%
as one of these elements.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:56.870 align:middle line:84%
One of these M numbers
is the infimum.

00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:59.885 align:middle line:84%
And they're all positive, so
this is a positive number.

00:53:59.885 --> 00:54:06.400 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And so then simply how
this number is defined,

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:22.020 align:middle line:84%
it follows that for all n, y sub
n is bigger than or equal to b.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:28.160 align:middle line:90%


00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Because, again,
if n is between--

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.060 align:middle line:84%
little n is between 1
and capital M minus 1,

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.570 align:middle line:84%
then certainly that the
absolute value of that thing

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:43.680 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal to the
smaller of all of these, which

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.000 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to b.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And if n is bigger than
or equal to capital M,

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:51.220 align:middle line:84%
then we proved over
here that y sub n

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.800 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than the
absolute value of y

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.400 align:middle line:84%
over 2, which is bigger
than or equal to the minimum

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:02.480 align:middle line:84%
of these numbers and y
over 2, which equals b.

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.980 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that
proves the claim.

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:07.933 align:middle line:90%


00:55:07.933 --> 00:55:08.850 align:middle line:90%
That proves the claim.

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.642 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't proved
what we wanted to yet

00:55:10.642 --> 00:55:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that the limit as n goes to
infinity of 1 over y sub n

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.390 align:middle line:90%
equals 1 over y.

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But this follows
almost immediately

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:23.280 align:middle line:90%
from what we've done so far.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to use
the claim to prove it.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.830 align:middle line:90%
So we look at--

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:33.230 align:middle line:90%


00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:38.060 align:middle line:84%
compute that the 0 is
less than or equal to 1

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.573 align:middle line:90%
over y sub n minus 1 over y.

00:55:40.573 --> 00:55:41.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
show that this goes

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:46.540 align:middle line:90%
to 0 using those two theorems.

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And so by algebra
that's equal to--

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and using the absolute value,
this is 1 over y sub n minus y.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the absolute
value of y sub

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:05.055 align:middle line:84%
n minus y over absolute value
of y sub n absolute value of y.

00:56:05.055 --> 00:56:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Now y sub n is bigger
than or equal to b.

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than or equal
to 1 over b times y times

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:25.180 align:middle line:90%
y sub n minus y.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So just to summarize, we've
shown that 0 is less than 1

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:41.240 align:middle line:84%
over y sub n minus 1 over y
is less than 1 over b times

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.380 align:middle line:90%
1 over--

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:49.760 align:middle line:84%
b times the absolute value
of y times y sub n minus y.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, this goes to 0 because
it's just a constant sequence.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:57:01.900 align:middle line:84%
This converges to 0 because y
sub n minus y in absolute value

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.950 align:middle line:90%
goes to 0.

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:05.110 align:middle line:84%
This is just a fixed
number of times that.

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And by what we've proven for
2, this product converges to 0.

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So by the squeeze theorem, we
get that 1 over y sub n, this

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.375 align:middle line:90%
converges to 0, which implies--

00:57:26.375 --> 00:57:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So another big property
about the real numbers

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that we proved after
we stated the existence

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.290 align:middle line:84%
of the real numbers,
which remember was this

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:45.875 align:middle line:84%
is defined as this ordered
field with a least upper

00:57:45.875 --> 00:57:46.500 align:middle line:90%
bound property.

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:54.590 align:middle line:90%


00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:57.860 align:middle line:84%
We proved that the square root
of 2 exists as a real number.

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:01.890 align:middle line:90%


00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:03.980 align:middle line:84%
There was really
nothing special about 2.

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:08.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you could prove
that the square root of x

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.380 align:middle line:84%
exists as a real
number for any x that's

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.990 align:middle line:84%
a positive or
non-negative number.

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:16.520 align:middle line:90%


00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So the square root of a
real number is well defined.

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:22.738 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.738 --> 00:58:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Or the square root of
a non-negative number

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is well define and always
exists as a real number.

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:38.575 align:middle line:84%
So you can ask how does limits
interact with square roots?

00:58:38.575 --> 00:58:41.680 align:middle line:90%


00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And they interact just
as you think they should.

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.030 align:middle line:84%
If I have a sequence
so that for all n,

00:58:56.030 --> 00:59:02.460 align:middle line:84%
x sub n is bigger
than or equal to 0,

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's a convergent sequence,
converging to some number x,

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:14.890 align:middle line:84%
then the limit of the
square roots of these guys

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:21.050 align:middle line:84%
equals the square
root of the limit, OK.

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want you to just take
a second here and understand

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
meaningful statement.

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Because since the x sub n's are
all non-negative by a theorem

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.410 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:38.310 align:middle line:84%
let's see, did I
erase it already?

00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:46.070 align:middle line:84%
The one that had to deal
with limits and the order,

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.220 align:middle line:84%
so since the x sub n's
are all non-negative,

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that implies that
x is non-negative

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:51.730 align:middle line:84%
so that the square
root is meaningful.

00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:56.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, so first check
whenever somebody says

00:59:56.210 --> 01:00:00.980 align:middle line:84%
here's this theorem,
or this theorem is--

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.920 align:middle line:90%
I think this theorem is true--

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:09.060 align:middle line:84%
is to check to make sure
that a theorem is meaningful.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.160 align:middle line:90%


01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.680 align:middle line:90%
So let's prove this.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's two cases to
consider, x is equal to 0

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.810 align:middle line:90%
or x is non-zero.

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:21.935 align:middle line:90%
So let's do the first case.

01:00:21.935 --> 01:00:26.280 align:middle line:90%


01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.570 align:middle line:90%
So the limit is 0.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do this proof using
the definition of limits,

01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:37.073 align:middle line:84%
meaning the epsilon
M definition.

01:00:37.073 --> 01:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So we want to show that the
limit of the square root

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.700 align:middle line:90%
of x sub n equals 0.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:46.120 align:middle line:90%


01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And since x sub
n converges to 0,

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.690 align:middle line:84%
there exists
natural number n sub

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
0 such that if n is bigger
than or equal to M0,

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
then x sub n minus the
limit, which is just 0,

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and taking the absolute
value, which is just

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
x sub n, which is
equal to x sub n

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
because x sub n is non-negative,
is less than epsilon squared.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I can
always find, no matter

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
what is underneath my hand,
since x sub n converges to 0,

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I can find a natural number
so that that thing is less

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.567 align:middle line:90%
than what's underneath my hand.

01:01:38.567 --> 01:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I'm going to
have underneath my hand that's

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:43.192 align:middle line:84%
going to make things work
out for the square root

01:01:43.192 --> 01:01:46.200 align:middle line:90%
is epsilon squared, OK.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.230 align:middle line:90%


01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Choose M to be M sub 0.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to show this
M works for the sequence

01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:59.630 align:middle line:90%
square root of x sub n.

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And n bigger than or equal
to M. The square root

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
of x sub n minus 0,
which is just x sub n.

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's also-- so we didn't
strictly speaking prove this--

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
but it's not too hard to show
that square roots respect

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.750 align:middle line:90%
inequalities.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So x sub n is less
than epsilon squared.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So the square root
is less than epsilon

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.910 align:middle line:90%
squared, which equals epsilon.

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:43.570 align:middle line:90%


01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:50.055 align:middle line:84%
So the second case
is x not equal to 0.

01:02:50.055 --> 01:02:52.630 align:middle line:90%


01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And to do this case, we'll
use those two theorems again.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at square root of
x sub n minus square root of x.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:12.485 align:middle line:90%
Now, if I write this as--

01:03:12.485 --> 01:03:20.310 align:middle line:90%


01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and multiply top and
bottom by x sub n

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
plus square root of x,
square root of x sub n

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
plus square root of x,
which is a positive number.

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
It's fine to divide by it as
well, because x is non-zero.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So here not just
non-zero, it's positive.

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Because x has to
be non-negative.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the
product of something

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.805 align:middle line:84%
minus something else with
something plus something else.

01:03:46.805 --> 01:03:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So then that's going to be
the difference of the squares.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's equal to--

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
over-- and, again, these
are positive numbers

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
so that they come out
of the absolute value.

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is non-negative.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, it's only making
things bigger on the bottom

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and therefore things
smaller overall.

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is less
than or equal to--

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.875 align:middle line:84%
just if I replace this
by square root of x.

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:17.990 align:middle line:90%


01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:21.620 align:middle line:90%
So what did I prove?

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:32.860 align:middle line:90%


01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.750 align:middle line:90%
1 over square root of x--

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:37.780 align:middle line:90%


01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.380 align:middle line:90%
all right.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And so by assumption,
x sub n converges to x.

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:43.690 align:middle line:90%
So this goes to 0.

01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a fixed
number multiplied

01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:47.230 align:middle line:90%
by this thing going to 0.

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So by number 2
and the theorem we

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
proved before, this whole
product converges to 0.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So, and of course
this converges to 0.

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So this thing in the
middle must converge to 0

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:00.070 align:middle line:90%
by the squeeze theorem.

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:29.110 align:middle line:90%


01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:39.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's the square root.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:06:04.995 align:middle line:90%
And let me just remark that--

01:06:04.995 --> 01:06:08.320 align:middle line:90%


01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
so this number 3 up here,
that the limit of the product

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
is a product of the
limits, this thus

01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
implies that the limit of xn
squared converges to x squared.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So the square of
x sub n converges

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:23.560 align:middle line:90%
to the square of the limit.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And by induction, you can show
that the cube fourth power,

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:31.330 align:middle line:84%
fifth power of x sub n
converges to the fourth power,

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:32.530 align:middle line:90%
fifth power of x.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
you can also prove--

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.282 align:middle line:90%
so I'm not going to do this.

01:06:40.282 --> 01:06:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
force you to either.

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:45.023 align:middle line:84%
But just know these
as facts, that I

01:06:45.023 --> 01:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
don't have to just
take the square root,

01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I could take the k-th root.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.150 align:middle line:90%


01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And this statement still
is true that if x sub n is

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:58.320 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal to 0 for
all n, and I have a limit,

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
then the k-th root
of x sub n converges

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:02.580 align:middle line:90%
to the k-th root of x.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:08.340 align:middle line:90%


01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So the final theorem
we'll prove for today,

01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:22.440 align:middle line:84%
which will conclude our facts
about limits, is we have--

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've been
using this all along,

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
although I haven't made
special attention about it.

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.160 align:middle line:84%
The real numbers
there, this, again,

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
like I said, an ordered
field with a least upper

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.760 align:middle line:90%
bound property.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen how limits
interact with this structure

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:39.750 align:middle line:90%
of the real numbers.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But they also have a
distance associated

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.780 align:middle line:90%
to them, the absolute value.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
The distance from
two numbers a and b

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.440 align:middle line:84%
is the absolute
value of a minus b.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.650 align:middle line:90%


01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Or the distance
from a number to 0

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
is just the absolute
value of that number.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So one could ask,
how does the limit

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
interact with this
additional structure

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.410 align:middle line:90%
of the absolute value?

01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And so just like everything's
been good so far with limits,

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
it's the, same with the
absolute value namely

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.635 align:middle line:84%
that limits respect
absolute value.

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:21.970 align:middle line:90%


01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So if x sub n is
convergent sequence,

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
the limit x, then the
sequence of absolute values

01:08:52.410 --> 01:08:53.759 align:middle line:90%
is also a convergent sequence.

01:08:53.759 --> 01:09:06.210 align:middle line:90%


01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And the limit as n goes to
infinity of the absolute values

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
equals the absolute
value of the limit.

01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Now let me, again, let's try
to think a little more deeply

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.390 align:middle line:90%
about this real quick.

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
If I have a convergence
sequence and the absolute values

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:31.040 align:middle line:84%
converge, does
the converse hold?

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.229 align:middle line:84%
If the absolute values
converge, does this

01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
imply that the original
sequence converges?

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.407 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
is, of course, no.

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, not of course.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.323 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even give you a
minute to think about it.

01:09:41.323 --> 01:09:45.636 align:middle line:84%
But why is the
converse not true?

01:09:45.636 --> 01:09:46.844 align:middle line:90%
So let me make this a remark.

01:09:46.844 --> 01:09:58.600 align:middle line:90%


01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Converse is not true
because you could look at x

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.922 align:middle line:90%
sub n equals minus 1 to the n.

01:10:03.922 --> 01:10:06.480 align:middle line:90%


01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Then the absolute
values of these guys

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
converges, but the original
sequence does not converge.

01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:25.030 align:middle line:90%


01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is a one-way
street for convergence

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and the convergence of
the absolute values.

01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:44.350 align:middle line:90%


01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So before I prove
this theorem, let

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:53.983 align:middle line:84%
me just prove a quick
inequality which

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I think I said I was going
to put on the assignment,

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:57.858 align:middle line:84%
and then forgot to
put on the assignment.

01:10:57.858 --> 01:10:59.600 align:middle line:90%
But you should know it.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So this theorem is the
reverse triangle inequality

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.710 align:middle line:84%
which states for all a, b real
number, the absolute value

01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of the difference in
absolute values is less than

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the absolute
value of the difference.

01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the proof of this
reverse triangle inequality

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
just uses the original
triangle inequality.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So absolute value of a, this
is equal to the absolute value

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.320 align:middle line:90%
of a minus b plus b.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is less than or
equal to the absolute value

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
of a minus b plus
absolute value of b.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And thus the absolute value of
a minus the absolute value of b

01:11:55.970 --> 01:12:00.350 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
absolute value of a minus b.

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are just two
numbers, I mean two letters,

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:04.925 align:middle line:90%
reverse the letters.

01:12:04.925 --> 01:12:11.580 align:middle line:90%


01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
In this argument replace
a with b and b with a.

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So then I get b minus
the absolute value.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.290 align:middle line:84%
The absolute value of b
minus the absolute value of a

01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
absolute value of b minus a,

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.000 align:middle line:90%
which is the same as this.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.080 align:middle line:90%


01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And therefore-- let me
multiply through by minus 1,

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.430 align:middle line:90%
and that tells me--

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:47.650 align:middle line:90%


01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I have this is less than
or equal to the absolute value

01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:52.600 align:middle line:90%
of a minus b.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I also have it's
bigger than or equal

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to minus the absolute
value of a minus b.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.810 align:middle line:90%


01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And therefore the
absolute value of a minus

01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of b is less
than or equal to absolute value

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:11.370 align:middle line:90%
of a minus b.

01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:17.680 align:middle line:90%


01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So I it's taboo to write
on the very back board,

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to do it anyway.

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So that was the proof of the
reverse triangle inequality.

01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Here's the proof of
the theorem before it.

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
It just follows from the
reverse triangle inequality

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and that combination of those
two theorems over there.

01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:42.150 align:middle line:90%


01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
We have that the
absolute value of x sub n

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.090 align:middle line:90%
minus the absolute value of x.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
This is less than or equal
to, by the reverse triangle

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
inequality, the absolute
value of x sub n minus x.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.340 align:middle line:90%


01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is by the reverse
triangle inequality.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And by assumption,
this converges to 0

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:11.770 align:middle line:90%
as n goes to infinity.

01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:18.730 align:middle line:90%


01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So by the squeeze
theorem, this goes to 0.

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And therefore the absolute
value of x sub n converges

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:37.180 align:middle line:90%
to the absolute value of x.

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's it for that proof for
this lecture and for this week.

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:52.110 align:middle line:90%

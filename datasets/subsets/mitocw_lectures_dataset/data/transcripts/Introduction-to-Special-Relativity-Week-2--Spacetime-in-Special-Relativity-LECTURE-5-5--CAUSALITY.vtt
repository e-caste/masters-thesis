MARKUS KLUTE:
Welcome back to 8.20.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.150
In this section, we're going
to talk about cause and effect

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.780
and causality.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.900
And we do this with
an example which

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.020
talks about the good
guys and the bad guys.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.450
There's always good guys and
bad guys in the universe.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.910
In this example,
those two groups,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.380
they were fighting a war.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.430
And after some very
long and grueling time,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.759
they were able to
sign a peace treaty.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.270
So this happens in this
story at year number 0.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.240
So in year 0, a peace
treaty is signed.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.400
And the good guys, they
go back to their families.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.410
They go back home
to their planet.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.270
There's a spacecraft,
which is able to go

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.980
with a velocity of 0.6
times the speed of light.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.760
The bad guys.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.070
That's the bad guys.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.250
And so they develop a
faster-than-the-speed-of-light

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.560
spacecraft to follow
the good guys.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.890
And they succeed with the
development of the spacecraft

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.580
after four years.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.140
So they do.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.730
They follow the good guys.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.790
And in year number
5, the bad guys

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.210
attack and destroy
the good guys.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
The challenge for you now
is to explain the story

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.220
and answer the
following question.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.660
When and where does the attack
happen, from the good guys'

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.010
perspective?

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.550
And when did the bad guys
invent the spacecraft,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.620
from the good guys' perspective?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.390
You will see some surprising
results in this analysis.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.660
So please stop the video
and try to work this out.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.380
I recommend drawing a
space-time diagram in order

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.840
to get to a good picture of
what is actually happening here.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.000
If you do this, you find
the space-time diagram

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.140
here for the bad guys.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.846
So again, there's a number
of important events.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:57.970
In year number 0, the
peace treaty is signed.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.880
And then the good
guys, they start

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.190
traveling away at 0.6
times the speed of light.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.660
So what you see here is a
world line of the good guys.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.690
In year number 4, in
the reference frame

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.000
of the bad guys, they
developed a spacecraft,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.500
and they keep following
the good guys.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.910
And here in year number 5,
the attack actually happens.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.090
So if you analyze this
for the good guys,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.500
you find that the exposition,
the position of the attack,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.120
is in their spacecraft.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.250
So let's figure out whether
or not this is correct.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.260
You find gamma and
xB minus v times tB.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.810
If you put in the
numbers, you find,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.410
luckily, the exposition
is equal to 0.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.460
At what time did
this event happen?

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.480
Here, for the good guys, you
find gamma times tB minus v

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.010
over c xB.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.960
And again, if you
put the numbers in,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.960
the attack for the good guys
happens in year number 4.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.240
But then the question
is, when did the bad guys

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.150
invent the spacecraft
in the reference

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.230
frame of the good guys?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.910
And if you put in
the numbers, you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.010
find the invention actually
happens in year number 5.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.640
So the attack happens
before the spacecraft

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.000
is invented in the reference
frame of the good guys.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.080
And this clearly
violates causality.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.610
You cannot use a device which
is not invented yet unless you

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.350
travel faster than
the speed of light.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.240
You travel in time.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.740
All right.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.660
I find this a really
funny and geeky example.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.350
And the reason why this doesn't
work out, why it's geeky,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.560
is that they travel faster
than the speed of light.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.690
So let me conclude this
part of the section

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.120
here with a concept question.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.770
We have an event A,
and ask ourselves,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.470
can event A cause other events?

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.880
So event A might be the
invention of a spacecraft.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.370
Can event A cause event C,
event D, or more than one event,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.010
like B and C or B and D?

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.640
Note that the time access
here has units years

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.240
and the x-axis has
units light years.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.670
Again, stop your video here.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.990
Think about your answer.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.300
Maybe you draw in the
space-time diagram

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.030
in order to find the answer.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.060
And the answer, the correct
answer, is C. Only event C

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.470
can be caused, because
only C lies within what we

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.580
call the light cone of event A.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.970
In order to impact, in
order to cause an effect

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.030
on any other event,
the message needs

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.660
to be traveling
with speed smaller

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.530
than the speed of light.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.990
So that means that, in
order to reach event C,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.630
we can design a
spacecraft, or we

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.010
can send a light beam to this
event or in this direction.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.090
And then just wait a little
bit, in order to make any sort

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.930
of impact on event C. We cannot
travel faster than the speed

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.210
of light, which would be
necessary in order to reach

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.290
event D. And you can also
not go backwards in time,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.510
this message is, in
order to reach event D.

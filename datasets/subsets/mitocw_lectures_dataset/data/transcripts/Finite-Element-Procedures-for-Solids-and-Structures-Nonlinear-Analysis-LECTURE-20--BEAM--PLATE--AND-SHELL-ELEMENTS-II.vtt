00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.670
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.330
lecture on non-linear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.420
structures.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.740
In this lecture, I'd like to
continue with our discussion

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.570
of structural elements, and
in particular, I'd like to

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.670
concentrate our attention first
on the formulation of

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.980
beam elements.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.080
After that, I'd like to talk
more about the formulation of

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.730
shell elements, and then
show you applications.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.690
When we talk about beam
elements, we might think about

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.640
the usual Hermitian beam
elements, in which the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.850
transverse placements cubically
interpolated, and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.390
the longitudinal displacements
are linearly interpolated.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.250
This is an element that is
usually used in linear

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.310
analysis, and very
widely used--

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.260
you might have used it quite
a bit yourself--

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.490
and it is also very effective
in the analysis of linear

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.760
response of structures.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.030
However, in my discussion now,
I will talk about the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.970
isoparametric beam element,
and how we formulate the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.630
isoparametric beam element, in
other words, and how we apply

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.830
it in the analysis
of structures.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.190
So when I talk about the beam
element, I really mean this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.460
isoparametric beam element that
we are formulating in

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.300
this lecture.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.080
The isoparametric beam
formulation can be very

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.270
effective for the analysis of
curve themes, for the analysis

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.640
of geometrically nonlinear
problems, and for the analysis

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.120
of stiffened shell structures,
where we couple the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.660
isoparametric beam with the
isoparametrically formulated

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.450
shell elements.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.490
The formulation is quite
analogous to the formulation

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.150
of the isoparametric degenerate
shell elements that

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.590
we discussed in the previous
lecture, and so we can go a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.900
bit fast over the formulation
of the beam element here.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.640
I'm showing a typical
beam element,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.800
rectangular cross section.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.810
Here we show three nodes.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.350
Actually, the beam element can
be used with two nodes, three

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.950
nodes, or four nodes, as we will
discuss further later on.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.990
We notice that the depth off
the element is ak, the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.770
thickness of the
element is bk.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.451
And notice that at these nodes,
we measure certain

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.460
nodal point variables.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.710
and here I'm showing the nodal
point variables that we do

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.260
measure at the nodes.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.300
Three displacements, incremental
displacements, and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.260
three incremental rotations.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.880
Notice that the description of
the beam element follows much

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.860
the same as the geometric
description of the beam

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.510
element follows, much the same
way as we are dealing with the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.560
shell element.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.160
We introduce director vectors.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.710
Now we have two director
vectors.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.400
In the shell, of course,
we had only one

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.890
director vector per node.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.220
Now we have two.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.940
Here we show tvsk, the director
vector at time t into

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.940
the S-direction, corresponding
to node k.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.910
Notice here tvtk.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.870
The director vector at time t
corresponding to node k into

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.140
the t direction.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.820
this t means direction t that
t opting out means time t

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.600
Notice that corresponding to
this direction t here, we have

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.050
the t isoparametric
coordinate.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.250
And of course, this t
isoparametric coordinate also

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.580
runs into the thickness ak.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.990
Notice that corresponding to
bk, we have the s-direction

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.490
coordinate, and that s-direction
coordinate,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.860
s-isoparametric coordinate, runs
into the direction of the

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.393
director vector, tvsk.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.620
So these are the variables used
to describe the geometry

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.040
and the displacement of
the beam element.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.980
We start with the general
equation for the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.100
geometry at time t.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.780
Here we have txi.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.450
The coordinates of a material
particle within the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.580
element at time t--

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.370
and remember, these are the
coordinates measured in the

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.880
stationary coordinate system.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.610
And these coordinates are
obtained as shown on the

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.260
right-hand side.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.890
Let's have a close look
at what we see on

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.950
the right-hand side.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.940
We have the hk interpolation
function.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.660
This is the interpolation
function corresponding to the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.710
r-direction running through
the nodes of the element,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.470
along the mid-surface
of the element.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.290
And it's a one-dimensional
interpolation function, the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.290
same one that we used to see
for the truss element.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.160
These are the nodal point
coordinates at time t.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.920
We are summing over all the
nodal points, k from 1 to n,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.020
and n can be equal to 2, 3, or
4, as I mentioned earlier.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.280
Then we add to this term a term
that comes in because of

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.130
the sickness of the beam into
the t-direction, ak, thickness

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.610
off the beam into the
t-direction--

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.095
here is a t-coordinate.

00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:42.730
The isoparametric coordinates
going from minus 1 to plus 1.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.800
Here we have hk, same
interpolation function as

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.760
there, and here we have the
direction, cosines of the

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.970
director vector in the
t-direction at time t.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.950
A similar term, similar to this
one, is added for the

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.190
f-direction.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.080
s, the isoparametric coordinate,
running from minus

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.060
1 to plus 1, bk being the
thickness into the s-direction

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.240
at node k, hk, same
interpolation function that we

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.410
have seen up here already, and
these are the direction

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.720
cosines of the director vector
in the s-direction,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.410
corresponding to node
k at time t.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.510
This equation is very similar
to the equation that we used

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.960
in the shell element
formation.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.830
Of course, in the shell element
formulation, we

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.630
interpolated here in a
two-dimensional domain over

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.010
the shell mid-surface.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.980
Now we only run along the
neutral axis of the beam.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.330
And we had only one term in the
shell corresponding to the

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.970
director vector.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.160
There was only one direction,
namely, the one normal to the

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.720
mid-surface of the shell.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.040
Here we have two directions
to deal with.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.640
Since the displacements can
directly be obtained from the

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.840
geometry interpolation at time
t minus the geometry

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.730
interpolation at time 0,
of course this geometry

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.630
interpolation is obtained by
simply substituting in the

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.750
equation that we just looked
at for time t, the time 0.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.990
Since we obtain tui, as shown
here, this is the result.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.080
We simply apply our geometry
interpolation at time t, and

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.140
at time 0, subtract.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.950
This is what you get on
the right-hand side.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.220
Nodal point displacement from
time 0 to time t, measured in

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.370
the stationary global Cartesian
coordinate system.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:48.780
Here change in the director
vector cosines, or I should

00:07:48.780 --> 00:08:00.400
say, more precisely maybe, the
change in the cosine of the

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.520
angle director vector time 0,
director vector time t.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.320
Of course, remember here we
have direction cosines

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.710
corresponding to time t.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.280
Here we have direction cosines
corresponding to time 0.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.960
We subtract, and that
goes in here.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.030
Here, same kind of term,
but for direction s.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.460
Also the incremental
displacements are obtained

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.549
from this relationship here, and
if you apply the geometry

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.539
interpolation at time t plus
delta t and at time t, you

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.549
directly obtain this
right-hand side.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:46.340
These are the increment in the
direction cosine from time t

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.790
to time t plus delta t of the
director vector in the

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.850
t-direction.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.040
Similar here for the
s-direction.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.420
Of course, we are used very well
to deal with increment

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.750
and nodal point displacement,
but we cannot very well deal

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.850
with these quantities
here, vti and vsi.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.540
We want to deal with nodal
point rotation.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.600
And so what we do is, we express
this quantity and that

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.660
quantity in terms of nodal
point rotations, and that

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.820
those expressions are
given down here.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.000
These are the two expressions.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.840
You can simply multiply out, and
you would immediately see

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.560
that they indeed hold.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.800
With these geometry and
displacement interpolations

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.060
established, we can now
directly calculate or

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.720
establish the strain
displacement matrices

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.460
corresponding to the Cartesian
strain components, and then a

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.040
simple transformation, standard
transformation gives

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.460
us the strain displacement
matrices corresponding to the

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.550
eta zeta psi directions.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:59.520
Of course, these are the
directions with the components

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.330
of strains and stresses that we
need to deal with for the

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.830
beam formulation.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:09.040
Notice that zeta here is a
physical coordinate running

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.220
into the direction, so to say,
of the a thickness of the

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:19.460
beam, and zeta corresponds to
the t-isoparametric coordinate

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.350
that we just talked about.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.350
Psi here corresponds to the
s-isoparametric coordinate,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.190
and runs into the b width,
so to say, of the beam.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:34.640
Eta here corresponds to the
r-isoparametric coordinate.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.050
Of course, these zeta, eta, and
psi are actual physical

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.680
coordinates that we
are dealing with.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:49.570
We have to, of course, calculate
the tau psi eta, the

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.970
tau eta eta, and the tau vita
psi stress components and

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.770
corresponding strain components
for the beam

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.810
formulation.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.860
And the stress-strain law,
corresponding to these

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.260
components, is given here.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.140
Notice tau eta eta is obtained
by taking the Young's modulus

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.850
and multiplying the Young's
modulus by epsilon

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.050
eta eta, and so on.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.780
Notice here we have one share
component and another share

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.930
component corresponding to this
column and corresponding

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.620
to that column, and here we
have k factor, the share

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.980
correction factor, that we
already used from the shell

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.930
analysis formulation that
we discussed earlier.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:45.480
Notice that via the same
approach, we can also directly

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.430
obtain a beam element for

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.860
elastoplastic and creep analysis.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.180
In this particular case, of
course, the only stress

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.250
component that would be non-zero
again would be tau

00:11:55.250 --> 00:12:00.710
eta eta, tau eta zeta,
and tau eta psi.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:06.710
The approach here is very
similar to what we have

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.690
discussed earlier regarding the
shell element formation.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.700
There is one important point
in the beam element

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.330
formulation.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.910
Namely that with the kinematic
assumptions used so far for

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:25.270
the beam element, we do not
allow cross-sectional

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.650
out-of-plane displacement.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.930
We do not allow warping.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.220
Our interpolation does not
contain the effect of warping.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.450
In torsion or loading, however,
we know that warping

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.580
is very important, and for that
reason, we need to amend

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.970
our displacement assumptions
by two or more displacement

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.900
patterns, so to say.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.960
We allow these displacements to
take place in the element.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.950
u eta is equal to alpha
times psi beta.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.710
This is the exact warping
displacement for infinitely

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.900
narrow sections.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:05.460
And this term here, with beta
a constant, is the exact

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.440
warping displacement for
a square cross section.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.660
Now the actual section might
not be infinitely narrow,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:19.670
might not be square, but we can
easily test, and I will

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.060
show you just now an example
of that in fact, a

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.750
superposition of these functions
and the evaluation

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:32.310
of alpha and beta by static
condensation actually yields

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:37.080
good results, even for
cross-sections that are not

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.100
infinitely narrow, and that
are not exactly square.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.900
Let's look at an example,
linear elasticity.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.130
If we take a section and simply
put it into torsion

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.760
with b/a equal to 1, the
analytical value given by

00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:03.190
Timoshenko for this k constant
here in that formula is 0.141.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.080
And we obtain with
this formulation

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.850
exactly that same value.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.680
We need to get it, because we
have embedded the proper

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.710
interpolation for u eta into
our formulation, and then u

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.320
static condensation, of course,
to condense out these

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.100
two constants, alpha and beta,
that I just talked about.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:28.090
For b/a, a very large, very
narrow section, we also get

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.895
the exact result in our finite
element solution, the exact

00:14:31.895 --> 00:14:33.400
analytical result.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.550
In between, we have a small
arrow, an arrow that, however,

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.965
we believe is quite
acceptable.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:48.400
Let's look at one example that
I'd like to show you the

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.540
results of.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.270
You might be interested
in this example.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.010
Here we have a narrow ring.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.680
Here you have a plan view of
that ring with the dimensions

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.360
given, and Young's modulus and
Poisson's ratio given for that

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.370
ring, subject to these
bending moments.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.160
Of course, the twisting
capability or capacity of the

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.780
beam is of utmost importance
now, has to be properly

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.810
modelled under this
loading condition.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.120
The model that we use
to analyze the

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.700
problem is shown here.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.550
And you can see, at one side of
the ring, we have fixed it,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.210
and at the other side,
we prescribed a

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.400
rotation, see eta x.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.090
We use here four node
elements as shown.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.190
This analysis was actually
inspired by us looking around

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.240
in our office and seeing a
magnetic tape lying there.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.780
And if you look around, you
might have yourself a magnetic

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.660
tape there.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.610
And you pick up this little ring
from the magnetic tape.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.470
And here I'd like to just
demonstrate to you briefly

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.650
what we are doing.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.480
You see here, we have this ring,
much alike of what I've

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.260
shown you on the view graph.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.320
I'm fixing it on the one side,
and on my right hand now,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.910
these two fingers, I'm going
to put a rotation onto that

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.120
ring, and I'm going to turn
my fingers 180 degrees.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.760
So please watch closely.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.460
This is what I'm doing.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.060
I'm just turning my fingers
180 degrees.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.840
And by turning my fingers 180
degrees, if you watch very

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:39.010
closely, you can see that the
top of the ring does not touch

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.960
the bottom of the ring.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.720
There is actually a little gap
in between, of course, because

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.920
of the elasticity in the ring.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.490
So this is what I've tried to
do now on the computer.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.400
And what I'm particularly
interested to see is the

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.160
amount of moment required in my
right hand, so to say, to

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.180
be transmitted to the ring
in order to twist it.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:10.849
Well, here we have the results
for the computer solution.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:14.839
Notice here, we have a force
deflection, curve, rotation

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:19.109
here, up to 180 degrees.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.540
Moment plotted here
in pounds, inch.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.000
And you can see that there's
fairly linear behavior first,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.770
but then a highly non-linear
behavior as the rotation

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.270
becomes very large.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.690
Here we use the TL formulation
for the beam element.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.760
And once again, we rotated it
180 degrees, as I have shown

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.720
you with my little
experiment here.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:51.550
If you look at the beam, you see
a top view like that, and

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.540
the side view looks this way.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.610
I've pointed out that
top and bottom do

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.910
not touch each other.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.290
There's a little air
gap in between.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:07.000
I'd like to show you now another
solution regarding the

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.320
torsion in an analysis.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.080
And let me walk over to the
slides here, where I actually

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.610
have two slides regarding
that solution.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.170
The interesting part of this
problem is that we now, in

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.940
this particular analysis, are
using the same displacement

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.420
interpolation functions for
which I've shown you already--

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.530
two analyses in which the
material remained elastic.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.690
The same interpolation functions
are now also used to

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.570
analyze an elastoplastic
problem.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.160
And the problem is described
here, where we have now a

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.520
square section subjected
to a torque.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.950
The material data that Greenberg
used are given here.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:58.370
And in our analysis, we used
this material data, where the

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:02.550
yield stress and the
strain-hardening modulus are

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.780
matched to this stress-strain
law here.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.600
Now notice what is going to
happen is, we are increasing

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.870
this torque incrementally, and
we want to bring, of course,

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.800
this section into the
elastoplastic regime to see

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.070
how the section will
take the torque.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.890
On this slide now, we have
plotted the torque vertically

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:31.730
and the rotation horizontally,
both quantities with some

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.690
constants attached,
as you can see.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.610
And the Greenberg result and
the Adina result are indeed

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.750
very close.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.850
Please look at the reference
that is given in the study

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.540
guide if you're interested in
seeing and reading more about

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.810
this problem.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.120
Let me now walk back to the view
graph and continue with

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.040
the discussion of the material
relating to isoparametric

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.510
beams and shell elements.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.900
The next topic that I like to
talk to you about is the

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.240
actual use of these elements.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:11.180
Of course, the shell element
that I'm here talking about,

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:16.030
or that I will share some more
experiences with you upon, is

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.320
the shell element that I have
been already discussing in the

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.080
earlier lecture.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.810
So please refer back to that
lecture with respect to this

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.300
discussion.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.310
One interesting point is that
these elements can all be

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.340
programmed for use with
different numbers of nodes.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.320
For the beam, we can have two,
three, or four nodes, as

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.530
already mentioned earlier, and
for the shell, we could have

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.670
4, 8, 9, up to 16 nodes,
as I mentioned also

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.410
in the earlier lecture.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.770
The elements with these nodal
point configurations can be

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.670
employed for analysis of
moderately thick structures.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.240
Remember, shear deformations
are

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.920
approximately taken into account.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.830
However, if the sink of the
analysis of thin structures,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.700
then we have to be very careful,
and only certain

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.610
elements of the ones that
I just referred

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.240
to should be employed.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.190
For shells, we can only
recommend to use a 16-node

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.620
element with 4-by-4 Gauss
integration over the

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.730
mid-surface.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.570
This element is depicted here.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:28.260
1, 2, 3, 4, 4 times gives
us 16 nodes, and 4-by-4

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.540
integration indicated
by the blue crosses.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:37.870
For beams, we'd best use the
2-node beam element with

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.650
1-point integration along the
r-direction, or the 3-node

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.200
beam element with 2-point
integration along the

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.940
r-direction, all or with Gauss
integration, or the 4-node

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.890
beam element with 3-point Gauss
integration along the

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.680
r-direction.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.500
We have to ask, of course,
now, why is that so?

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:02.190
Well, the reason is that the
other elements become overly

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:08.570
and artificially stiff when we
use them to model thin and

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.400
curved structures.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.580
Two phenomena occur--

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.600
shear locking and membrane
locking.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.550
Most interesting phenomena.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.490
And I'd like to share with you
now some information regarding

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.950
these phenomena.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.570
The 2-, 3-, and 4-node beam
elements with 1-, 2-, and

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.960
3-point Gauss integration along
the beam axes do not

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.280
display these phenomena,
these shear- and

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.880
membrane-locking phenomena.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.280
But please notice, I'm using
1-, 2-, and 3-point Gauss

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.170
integration corresponding
to the 2-, 3-,

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.160
and 4-node beam element.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.250
The 16-node element with 4-by-4
integration, Gauss

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:50.400
integration, is also relatively
immune to shear and

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.990
membrane locking.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.920
However, we have to
be careful here.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.510
The element should not be
distorted for best predictive

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.250
capability.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.720
Let us study what this shear
locking phenomenon is.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.600
And to do so, let us look at a
2-noded beam, a very simple

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.190
beam, in just 2-dimensional
action.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.680
So we have one node here and
one node here, and the

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.710
defomations of the beam are
described by w1 and theta 1 at

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:24.170
this node, and w2 and theta
2 at this node.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.040
Notice the deformations of the
beam, of course, are given by

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.160
w, the transverse displacement,
and beta, the

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.860
section rotation.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.370
The transverse displacement and
section rotation, w and

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.880
beta, are interpolated linearly,
as shown here, via

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.790
the nodal point displacements
and rotations.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.870
Notice the linear interpolation,
of course, is

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.320
given here via this expression
and that expression, and

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.730
similarly here via this
expression and that

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.760
expression.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.430
Now there's one important point,
namely that w and beta

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:05.460
are independent quantities.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:10.140
If you are familiar, as
you probably are, with

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:15.655
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory,
you recognize that in

00:24:15.655 --> 00:24:18.620
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory,
they are not independent

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.190
quantities.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:25.430
In fact, beta is dw dr, or dw
dx, x being the physical

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.310
coordinate.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.650
Here in our formation,
isoparametric degenerate

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:37.210
element, we have that beta and
w, these two quantities, once

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:44.430
again, are independent and
linearly interpolated in this

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.330
particular beam element.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:53.190
Of course, these two quantities
are tied together

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:57.000
by the physics, and that is
by the shear deformation.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.230
So let's look at that next.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:05.010
Here we have that gamma shear
strain is equal to a del w del

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.150
x minus beta.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.750
And this is shown here
on the picture.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:15.500
Notice this is a neutral axis of
the beam, which originally

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.790
of course was horizontal.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:24.580
Here we have a vertical line
shown in green, and the

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.000
section rotation is shown
at the angle beta here.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.930
These are the material particles
shown in red that

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:37.090
were originally, of course, at
right angles to the neutral

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:42.300
axes, and that were originally
lying vertically up.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.280
In other words, this line here,
this red line was a

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.850
vertical line originally, and
was originally at right angles

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.430
to the neutral axis.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:55.090
That right angle is not
preserved because gamma is

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:59.040
there, and gamma is, in
general, a non-zero.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.610
This is here of course dw dx.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.320
So this picture here
shows what we are

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.390
calculating up here.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:14.900
And you can see that gamma
ties together w and beta,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.960
which are, however, by
themselves, interpolated

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.270
independently.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:25.390
Consider now the simple case of
a cantilever subjected to a

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.210
tip-bending moment.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.380
And we use one 2-node beam
element to model the

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.920
cantilever.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.780
Clearly at this end, the section
rotation is 0, and w1,

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.600
the transverse displacement
is also 0.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.750
So these are the bounded
conditions at this end of the

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.100
cantilever.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.720
And if we use these bounded
conditions and put them into

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.550
our general equation, we get
directly that beta is given as

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:56.380
shown here, and gamma is
given as shown here.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.520
Now look at this equation
carefully.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.880
We have a constant term and
a linear varying term.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.850
The exact solution to this
problem, analytical solution

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:16.550
to this problem, if we use
elementary beam theory, we

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.760
would immediately recognize that
the shear strain must be

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.940
0 for this element, or for
this beam situation.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.150
The shear strain should be 0.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:31.830
Now, if we look at this
carefully, we can see that

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:38.790
gamma can only be 0 if w2
is 0, and theta 2 is 0.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.610
But if theta 2 and w2 are 0,
rotation and transverse

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.705
displacement right here at this
end, then the beam would

00:27:46.705 --> 00:27:48.080
have not deflected.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.020
Of course, that is not
borne out in physics.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.520
We know that if we take a beam
and put a bending moment on

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.760
it, then we get a deflection
here and a

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.400
rotation at this end.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.440
So you can see already from this
equation here that there

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.800
will be some difficulty.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.250
There will be some difficulty
because gamma should be 0

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.880
physically, and this equation
tells us that gamma can't

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.010
really be exactly 0.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.630
Well, that is once more
summarized in

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.460
this sentence here--

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.590
clearly, gamma cannot be 0 at
all the points along the beam

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.840
unless theta 2 and
w2 are both 0.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.000
But then also beta would be 0,
and there would be no bending

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.050
of the beam.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.590
Let's look now at this point.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.060
Since for the beam, the bending
strain energy is

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.610
proportional to h cubed,
elementary beam theory again,

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.350
the shear strain energy
is proportional to h--

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.860
elementary beam theory--

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.720
we see immediately that any
arrow in the shear strains due

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.800
to the finite element
interpolation functions

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.270
becomes increasingly
more detrimental

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.800
is h becomes small.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.240
Why is that the case?

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.680
If h becomes small, then
this number becomes

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.510
very rapidly small.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.990
This number here become small,
but this one goes much faster

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.140
to us, very small, so to say.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.250
And if there's an error in the
shear strain energy, that

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.530
error, because of this
proportionality sign, is going

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.300
to be magnified relative to any
error that we would see

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:27.340
here, and it's going to be
detrimental in our solution.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.720
Let's look at an example.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.900
For the cantilever example, this
very simple example that

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.660
we just studied already a bit,
the shear strain energy should

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.510
be 0, and as h decreases, the
relative error in the shear

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:46.630
strain increases rapidly, and
in effect introduces an

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:52.270
artificial stiffness which
we identify as

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.100
locking of the model.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.230
This is the terminology that
is quite widely used now.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.050
We say that the model locks.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.280
Let's look at some results.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.420
In this table, we show the
results for h/L with L equal

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.400
to 100 for these three values.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.330
The analytical value for the
rotation at the end where the

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:16.500
bending moment is applied
is given here.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.380
Bernoulli beam theory.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.390
The finite element solution,
using, of course, exact

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.070
integration--

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.630
I always assume I should
maybe point that very

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.020
strongly still out.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.400
We assume that we use exact
integration of the K matrix.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:37.700
Meaning in this particular
case, we're using 2-point

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.370
Gauss integration along the
length of the beam.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:47.480
With that scheme then, we obtain
with a h/L being 0.5.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.310
Well, an error, but something
still reasonable.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.390
After all, we're only
using one element.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.130
Of course, we are pretty far
off, but still something

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.050
reasonable.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:06.070
But now notice, as you decrease
h, h/L, of course,

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.170
becomes much smaller.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.200
Theta analytical goes up.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.290
The beam basically
bends, is very

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.840
flexible as it gets thinner.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.580
And the finite element solution
also becomes more

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.930
flexible, gives us a more
flexible beam, but is much too

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.660
stiff when compared to the
analytical solution.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.810
Notice for orders of magnitudes
difference.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.100
If you plot it, this is
basically 0 compared to that

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.130
value, and that means
the beam locks.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:41.740
It doesn't really at all
bend anymore as h

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.720
becomes very thin.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.750
This behavior is, of course,
also observed when you take

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.970
more than 1 element
to model the beam.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:54.380
Here we show more elements than
just one, and notice that

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.590
each of these elements
should still carry a

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.150
constant bending moment.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.130
If it cannot do so, it develops,
in other words,

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.750
these furious shear strains.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.780
We are going to have a very
stiff model, even when we use

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.200
that many elements.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.600
Let's look at this particular
example close off.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:18.830
And here we have an example
beam, in other words,

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.650
cantilever beam, subjected
to the bending moment.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.190
l equals 10 meter.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.590
Square cross section,
height 0.1 meter.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.520
We use the 2-noded beam
elements to model this

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:36.070
cantilever, and we plot the tip
deflection as a function

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.390
of the number of elements.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.270
A most interesting graph.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:44.570
Look, here is the beam
theory solution.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:49.640
And here we plot the number
of elements--

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.850
here we talk about 400 elements,
because there's

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.900
times 10 to the 2 down here.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.950
400 elements at this point.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:03.540
600 elements, 800 elements,
200 elements.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.060
At this point we have
100 elements.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.160
The height of an element
is equal to the

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.750
length of the element.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:17.150
And at this point, we still
don't even get a good

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.900
approximation to the beam
theory solution.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.620
We need basically something like
400 to 500, 600 elements

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.870
to get close to the beam
theory solution.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.530
However, if we take a very large
number of elements, we

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.150
actually do converge, but we
need a lot of elements, as you

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.520
can see here.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.390
Of course, it is quite
impractical to use this kind

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:43.970
of 2-noded beam element to model
thin structures, then

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.080
beams. Once again, I must point
out that we use 2-point

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.430
Gauss integration into the
r-direction, and therefore,

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:56.410
we're dealing with the exact K
matrix corresponding to the

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:59.720
interpolation that we have
embedded into the element.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.690
In fact, if we look in this
regime down here, we find that

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:09.270
as shown on this view graph,
the solution really becomes

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:13.280
beta very slowly as the number
of elements is increased.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.840
Notice that the solution really
doesn't increase in

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:23.230
accuracy much at all as we go
from 10, 20, to 30 elements.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:27.790
A remedy for the 2-node beam
element is to only use 1-point

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.690
integration along
the beam axis.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:34.020
This then corresponds to
assuming a constant transverse

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.270
shear strain.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.030
However, by using 1-point
integration, we still

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.159
integrate the bending
strain exactly.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.929
Because remember, beta is
linear, del beta del x is

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:47.449
constant, and 1-point
integration will pick up that

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.010
term exactly.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:53.909
If we look at the results, now
once again, of this problem,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:57.610
cantilever problem, the
cantilever beam is subjected

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.760
to an end moment,
tip end moment.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.850
We find now which h/l, as shown
here, theta analytical,

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.480
shown here, and our finite
elements solution with just

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.680
one element, using one element,
of course now with

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.230
1-point integration in
r-direction, gives us

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.220
excellent results.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:22.010
In fact, the exact results,
as you can see here.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:26.440
The 3- and 4-note beam elements,
evaluated using 2-

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.840
and 3-point integration,
are similarly affected.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.540
In fact, they give us also the
exact results for this problem

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.820
that we've considered.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.100
We should note now that these
theme elements, based on what

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:44.250
one might reduced integration,
are actually reliable

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.510
elements, because they do not
possess any spurious zero

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.880
energy modes.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:57.440
They have, in other words, only
six zero energy modes

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.780
corresponding to the actual
physical rigid body mode that

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.470
the elements should contain,
should be able to represent,

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.550
in its three-dimensional
space.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:12.590
So they only have those six zero
eigenvalues in this 3D

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.450
analysis that they should have,
and no spurious zero

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.000
energy modes.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.610
The formulation can actually
be interpreted as a mixed

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:23.500
interpolation of displacements
and transferred shear strains.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:30.790
And this is really the key for
developing all the low-order

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.550
effective shell elements.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:37.170
I will get back to that in
just a little while.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.170
So far, we have talked
about shear locking.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.490
I mentioned earlier also that
there is a phenomenon of

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.710
membrane-locking.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.010
Membrane-locking means that in
addition to not exhibiting

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:54.130
erroneous shear strains, the
beam model must also not

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:59.350
contain erroneous mid-surface
membrane strains, particularly

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.460
when we analyze curved
structures.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.660
The beam elements that I just
mentioned, 2-noded beam with

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.040
1-point r-integration, 3-noded
beam with 2-point

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.190
r-integration, 4-noded beam with
3-point r-integration, do

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.690
also not membrane-lock.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:20.630
Let's consider here, once again,
a simple example--

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.730
a simple curve beam subjected
to a bending moment,

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:28.190
tip-bending moment, fixed
at the other end.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:33.380
Here is an angle alpha that
the beam spans out.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:39.390
The exactly integrated 3-noded
beam element, when curved,

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.690
does contain erroneous shear
strains and erroneous

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.430
mid-surface membrane strains.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.080
In other words, shear locks
and membrane locks.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.780
And that is shown in
this table here, at

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.940
least to some extent.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.860
What I can't show is how much
there is shear-locking and how

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.560
much there is membrane-locking.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.530
You would see that both effects
are very significant.

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:05.300
If you were to run, for example,
this beam element

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:10.440
with a computer program, using,
for this beam element,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.740
3-point integration into the r
direction and printing out the

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:20.040
stresses, print out all the
stress components and look at

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.850
the shear component and the
membrane components, in other

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.250
words, the normal stress
components,

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:26.730
along the neutral axes.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.390
If you do so, you would see that
they are very significant

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:32.760
shear stresses and very
significant membrane stresses,

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.050
which of course should be
0 for this problem.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:39.710
And these are, of course,
causing the locking effect.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:46.690
Here we have the results in
terms of just rotations, h/R

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:50.720
now, with R equal to 100, given
here, analytical value

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.070
given here, finite element
solutions, 3-node element with

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.760
3-point integration, you can
see we have a locking

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.110
phenomenon right here.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.900
Once again, how much there is
membrane, and how much shear

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.170
locking you would see by
actually running as a problem

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:07.890
and looking at the
shear stress and

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.050
the membrane stress.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:13.040
And the finite element
solution with 2-point

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.315
integration gives excellent
results.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.620
So this is, of course, the
element that we would be using

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.660
in engineering practice.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.660
Similarly, we can study
the use of the

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.470
4-node cubic beam element.

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:34.800
And here we find that for h/R,
these values, analytical value

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.280
once more listed here, we find
that the 4-node element with

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:43.850
4-point integration gives also
very good results, and the

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:48.320
3-point integration gives
also excellent results.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.580
So we note that the cubic beam
element performs well, even

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.750
when using full integration.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.220
It is not susceptible to
membrane and shear locking.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.610
But notice, we have our
third-point node exactly at

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.000
the third point of
the elements.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.290
Once we start shifting these
nodes, then we would also not

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.410
get as good results
as shown here.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.590
We would not get these good
results once you shift the

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:20.500
node at the third point away
from their physical third

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.960
point locations.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.800
Now, considering the analysis
of shells, the phenomenon of

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.700
shear and membrane locking
are also present, but the

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.380
difficulty lies in that this
simple reduced integration

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:39.250
approach that we're using for
the beam elements cannot be

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:43.940
directly applied, because the
resulting elements contain

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.040
spurious zero energy modes.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:52.590
For example, if you integrate
the 4-node shell element just

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:56.320
with 1-point integration,
contains 6 spurious zero

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.000
energy modes.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.780
In other words, it has
altogether 12 zero eigenvalues

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.600
where it should only have 6.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.320
The 6 of them are
spurious modes.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.070
And such spurious energy modes
can lead to very large errors

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:15.200
in the solution that, unless
we have a comparison with

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.560
accurate results, are not known,
and therefore, it can

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.580
be very dangerous to
use such elements.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.270
We want to have elements that
are reliable in general

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:31.300
applications, and these elements
should only contain

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.380
the actual physical rigid
body modes, no

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.430
spurious zero energy modes.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.870
And of course, should also
have high predictive

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.520
capability, not have any shear
or membrane locking.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.920
For this reason, we can only
recommend the 16-node shell

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.510
element with 4-by-4
Gauss integration.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.640
The cubic beam element result
that I just showed you

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.720
regarding the analysis of the
curve beam already indicated

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.410
that the cubic element
does quite well.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.550
In fact, that is also
borne out by the

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.260
16-node shell element.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:10.710
Using 4-by-4 Gauss integration
on the shell mid-surface, we

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:14.470
have an element that is
relatively immune to membrane

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.190
and shear locking, but I
mentioned already that the

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.320
element should not
be distorted.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.010
And if it's not distorted,
it performs best.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.130
I'd just like to share now
with you some thoughts

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:29.260
regarding development that
we have recently pursued.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:32.550
Namely, recently we have
developed elements based on

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.800
the mixed interpolation of
tensorial components.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.030
This sounds very complicated.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.240
Actually, if you look closely at
what we're doing, it is not

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.790
that complicated.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.920
The elements, however, do not
lock in shear or membrane

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.100
action, and also do not contain
any spurious zero

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:49.810
energy mode.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:54.040
And of course, that is the key
of success of an element.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:59.760
We will use later on in the
example solutions a 4-node

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.650
element that is based on this
mixed interpolation of

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.080
tensorial components.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:10.030
We call that element the MITC4,
Mixed Interpolation

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:15.150
Tensorial Component with 4 nodes
element, and I want to

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.470
discuss this element just
briefly with you now.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.480
We also have developed
an element that

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.890
we call MITC8 element.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:27.475
It's an 8-node element based
on mixed interpolation of

00:43:27.475 --> 00:43:28.770
tensorial components.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.530
A most interesting
development.

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.380
If you're interested in that
development, please refer to

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.710
the paper that is given, or that
is being referred to, in

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.440
the study guide.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.370
I'd like to discuss with you
now the MITC4 element, and

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.110
then show you example
solutions.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.200
However, we have, in order to be
able to do that, to change

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.550
now the reel, so let us just do
so, and then continue with

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:54.800
this discussion.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:03.240
So let us look then at the MITC4
element briefly, the

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.240
element that I mentioned before
we had the break.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:11.320
The element is described
using four nodes.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.200
We have the same isoparametric
coordinate system that we are

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.450
usually having.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:20.310
Notice here director vector,
same description as for the

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.160
shell element that we discussed

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.860
in the earlier lecture.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:29.510
Each node has 5 degrees of
freedom, 2 rotational degrees

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:30.530
of freedom, and 3

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.330
translational degrees of freedom.

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.755
Once again, the way we have
been discussing it in the

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:35.710
earlier lecture.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.660
We use the element for analysis
of plates and for the

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:42.440
analysis of moderately thick
shells, and also thin shells.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.950
And that is the important
point.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:47.410
This element is directly
applicable in a very effective

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.340
manner to thin shell analysis.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.310
The key step in the formulation
of the element is

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:57.560
to interpolate the geometry
and the displacement as

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.340
earlier described,
as we discussed

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.110
in the earlier lecture.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:04.640
But to interpret the transverse
shear strain tensor

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.040
components separately, and
these interpolations are

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.710
selected judiciously, to tie,
then, the intensities of these

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.600
components to the values
evaluated using the

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.030
displacement interpolations.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:23.370
Let's look at what I'm saying
here now pictorially.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:27.860
The strain tensor interpolation
that we are

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:36.100
using is shown here in blue
on the black element.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.960
These are the rt transfer
shear strain tensor

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.230
components.

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:44.390
This is one interpolation
function, and this is the

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.720
other interpolation function.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:53.240
Notice that if we look at the
r- and s-axes, the rt strain

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.100
tensor component is constant
in r, but varies

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.280
linearly with s.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.270
Here, too, constant in 4,
varying linearly with s.

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:08.670
Now it's these intensities, one
here and one there, that

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:14.820
we tie to the nodal point
displacements and rotations.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:19.720
Here for this intensity, we
use these nodal point

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.870
descriptions, and for this
intensity, we use these nodal

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:27.880
point descriptions, or nodal
point degrees of freedom.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.710
So if you recognize that these
are, it seems, unknown

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.570
quantities that enter into the
formulation since we're using

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.190
these two interpolations--

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.370
this one is an unknown quantity
that enters into the

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:44.100
formulation, that one is an
unknown quantity that enters

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.380
into the formulation--

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.940
if you recognize that, then you
have to ask yourself, what

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.810
do we do with these unknown
quantities?

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:54.580
Well, we eliminate these
unknown quantities by

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.860
expressing them in terms of
the nodal point degrees of

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:01.650
freedom, these two nodes here
and these two nodes.

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:08.020
And thus we eliminate these
tensor component intensities.

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:12.520
And in the K matrix and the F
vector, we end up having then

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.160
only the nodal point

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.770
displacement degrees of freedom.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.380
And that's the key part.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.620
For the ft transfer shear strain
tensor components, we

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.640
use these two interpolations.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.240
Now we notice that we have a
linear description in r and

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:33.690
constant in s for both of
these two components.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.460
We proceed, of course, to
eliminate this intensity and

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.350
that intensity in terms
of the nodal

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:42.630
point degrees of freedom.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:45.510
Same way as we are
proceeding here.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:50.130
This element, the MITC4 element,
has only 6 zero

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.690
eigenvalues, no spurious
zero energy modes.

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:57.760
It passes a patch test. And
this is a very important

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.290
point-- that the element process
the patch test. What

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.400
do we mean by the patch test?

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:08.190
Well, the idea in the patch
test is that any arbitrary

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.280
patch of elements should be
able to represent constant

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.860
stress conditions.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:19.100
Let's see how we perform that
patch test. Here we take an

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.460
arbitrary patch of elements.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:26.630
Some of the elements in that
patch of elements would be

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:28.580
geometrically distorted.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.150
And we subject this patch to
the minimum displacement

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.450
rotation boundary conditions
to eliminate the physical

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:38.590
rigid body molds, and then
constant boundary tractions

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.380
corresponding to the
constant stress

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.600
condition that is tested.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:51.440
These two items we apply to
the patch of elements, and

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.100
then we calculate
all nodal point

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.840
displacement and element stresses.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.510
The patch test is passed if
the calculated element

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:01.000
internal stresses
and nodal point

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
displacements are correct.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.460
In other words, let's
go through this

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.830
thought once again.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:08.660
What we're doing,
really, is we're

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.210
looking at this structure.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:15.670
In essence, we are taking out
of this big mesh of elements

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.960
in the structure a certain
set of elements.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.040
We call that set of elements
a patch of elements.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.320
We apply to this patch of
elements the minimum boundary

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.910
conditions to eliminate the
rigid body molds and traction

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:36.550
along the boundary that should
result in constant stress

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:37.800
conditions within
the elements.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:44.800
If in fact, our solution for
that patch of elements gives

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.330
us constant stress conditions
and nodal point displacement

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.320
that correspond to these
constant stress conditions,

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.870
then the patch test is passed.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:57.190
and this means that we would
have an element that

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:00.930
ultimately, as the mesh is made
finer and finer with that

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:04.430
element, the solution
will converge

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.450
to the correct solution.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:10.200
That's the patch test, and
the most important test,

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.670
particularly for shell elements,
when we have these

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:18.470
complications of various kinds
of interpolations in the

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:20.530
element formulation,
and so on.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:26.210
Well, here, schematically, I
show such patch of elements.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:31.070
x1-axis, x2-axes, flat
patch of elements.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:33.870
Notice the elements
not distorted,

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:35.570
not rectangular elements.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.750
We take certain material
properties,

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.380
assign a certain thickness.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.250
We make it a thin patch
of elements.

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:47.940
The plate that we're looking at
here is, in essence, thin.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:54.340
Notice thickness 0.01, width
10 in both directions.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:58.460
And so if the elements would
lock do to shear or membrane

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.350
locking, the way we discussed
earlier, we would certainly

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:05.000
see it by subjecting this patch
of elements to bending

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.640
moment boundary conditions.

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.580
The membrane test would
correspond to these stress

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.070
conditions.

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.760
The bending twisting test would
correspond to these

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.520
stress conditions.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:25.050
These are the externally applied
forces, tractions that

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:29.340
the patch of element is
subjected for bending twisting

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:33.880
tests, here for membrane
tests.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:41.700
And once again, we adjust the
rigid body modes from the

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.240
patch of elements by setting
the appropriate number of

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.520
degrees of freedom, nodal point
degrees of freedom,

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.720
equal to zero, and then subject
that patch of elements

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:59.670
to the tractions corresponding
to these stress conditions,

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.660
the six ones that I'm
showing here.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:06.740
And we measure the internal
stresses, and find whether

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.030
these internal stresses indeed
correspond to the constant

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:11.450
stress situation.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:15.770
Also, since only those nodal
point degrees of freedom have

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:19.810
been removed on the boundary
that take out the rigid body

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:23.910
modes, we should also see that
the other nodal point degrees

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:27.800
of freedom, of course, have
taken on the exact analytical

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.340
value corresponding to
the constant stress

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.850
condition that is tested.

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:36.150
This one, that one, that one,
or the other three here.

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:37.930
That's the patch test.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:43.390
Well, let us now to look at some
examples regarding the

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:45.830
elements that we have discussed
in the previous

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.590
lecture and this lecture.

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:51.200
And the first example that I
like to look at with you is

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.130
the analysis of a spherical
shell with a hole.

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:57.920
There's a hole here, and you
see the sphere here.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.720
Here's the backside
of the sphere,

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.160
shown by a dashed line.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:07.200
And this sphere is subjected to
concentrated forces, shown

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.730
by these arrows.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:11.780
Radius given here, thickness
given here, and the material

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:16.750
property of the sphere
given right there.

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:21.490
The first step is to select
director vectors.

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:24.890
We talked in the previous
lecture very heavily about the

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.580
fact that we use director
vectors, and we have to define

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.110
these director vectors.

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:31.430
The initial director vectors,
or the director vectors for

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.180
the initial configuration.

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.290
And we in fact, in this
particular case, can quite

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:39.700
easily generate the director
vectors for each node.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.970
The director vector for each
node, in this particular case,

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:46.550
is chosen to be parallel
to the radial vector.

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:52.010
So if we look, this is the skin
of the shell from the

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:56.110
midpoint out via the radial
vector, we would see the

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:59.840
director vector right here
in two dimensions, of

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.140
course, x and y.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.020
So we generate these
director vectors.

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:08.690
In ADINA, that can be
done automatically.

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:12.300
And then we would select the
boundary, displacement

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.520
boundary conditions.

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:21.730
If we look at what happens, for
example, in the zx phase,

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:25.120
using symmetry conditions, of
course we would only look at a

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.230
particular part of the shell.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.990
The part of the shell, in fact,
maybe I should show you

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:35.640
that one first, that we want
to look at is shown here.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.450
Notice here we have the part of
the shell that we analyze

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:41.100
because of symmetry
conditions.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.470
We have here a symmetry
boundary and

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:45.500
there a symmetry boundary.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:51.120
Notice that we have x, y, and z,
the coordinate system used

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:58.230
here, and that this part of the
shell really lies in the

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.690
part of the coordinate system
that we're looking at.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:08.920
In other words, zy, y here,
z up there, xz, x

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.530
here, z comes out there.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:15.930
So here we have y equal to 0 on
this face, and on this face

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:18.890
here, we have x equal to 0.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:21.760
And what I'd like to now talk
briefly about is about the

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.510
selection of the boundary
conditions

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.285
along these two faces.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:30.550
Well, these boundary conditions,
if we look at the

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:37.710
zx face, in other words, this
face here, we see on this view

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:41.520
graph here the x face--
here is the shell.

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.260
Here we would have our director
vector at time 0, and

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.640
at time t, that director vector
would have moved as

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.530
indicated by the red here.

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:58.910
Notice that with this movement,
the only rotation

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:03.400
that we can have is the
theta y rotation.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:08.000
And that is now shown on
the next view graph.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.110
Notice theta y here is free,
a free rotation.

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:16.180
Theta x must be 0.

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.100
Theta z must be 0.

00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:23.050
And of course uy must be 0,
because these are material

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.270
particles, and in particular
that one there is a material

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:28.390
particle on the zx phase.

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:30.390
So uy is 0.

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:32.970
uz and ux are have free.

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:34.810
The free degrees of freedom,
once again, uz,

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:38.940
ux, and theta y.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:47.060
Well, to impose, then, the
boundary condition, we would

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:51.270
proceed as shown for this
material particle along all

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:55.500
the nodes on this face, and
similarly, of course, on the

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:56.900
other face--

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.570
the face on the zy.

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.780
To prevent the rigid body
translations, we would also

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:11.960
have to take 1 degree of freedom
out, namely one z

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.450
degree of freedom out, one
displacement degree of freedom

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:17.780
corresponding to the
z-direction out.

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.960
And that then would basically
give us all the boundary

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:25.140
conditions that we have to
apply for this problem.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:29.640
So let's look at this view graph
here to show the mesh

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.890
that we are Using.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:38.550
And we show here that at this
node, we set uz equal to 0 to

00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:41.295
prevent the rigid body motion
into this direction.

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:51.690
The linear elastic analysis
results for this problem are

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:53.110
given here.

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:55.580
Notice displacement at
the point of load

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.340
application is 0.0936.

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.790
The analytical value
is shown here.

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:04.310
Pictorially, the original mesh
is shown in black, and the

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:08.720
deformed mesh is shown in red.

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.890
The important point of this
problem, and I'd like to go

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:16.720
back to it once more, is really
that when we look at

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:22.710
this mesh, that we define the
director vectors at each of

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:24.120
these nodes--

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.950
and that can be done
automatically, they can be

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:28.760
generated--

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.590
that at each all of these
internal nodes, we use 5

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:39.625
degrees of freedom, we have two
locally aligned alpha and

00:58:39.625 --> 00:58:42.945
beta degrees of freedom, the one
that I talked about in the

00:58:42.945 --> 00:58:46.360
earlier lecture, at each of
these internal nodes.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:50.500
I like to distinguish the
internal nodes here from the

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.380
boundary nodes.

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:57.460
On the boundary nodes, we of
course have also only 5

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:01.770
natural degrees of freedom, but
we assign now 6 degrees of

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:02.290
freedom there.

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:05.880
Meaning that the alpha and beta
degrees of freedom are

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:10.600
rotated into the three Cartesian
coordinate axes so

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:15.400
as to have three rotations at
each of these nodes on the

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.850
symmetry faces.

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:20.460
And then we can very easily
impose the symmetry boundary

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:23.230
condition that I just
talked about.

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:26.540
That's the important point
of this problem, really--

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:30.110
how we model the boundary
conditions, and what degrees

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:35.020
of freedom are assigned
to each of the nodes.

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:39.480
Well as a second example, I'd
like to consider with you the

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:44.720
analysis of an open box,
a 5-sided open box.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:51.370
Here we show the box upside
down, or open site down.

00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:54.640
The open side, in other
words, is down here.

00:59:54.640 --> 01:00:00.420
And the box lies on a rigid,
frictionless surface.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:04.400
On top here, we have pressure
applied to the face.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.200
The box is modelled using
shell elements.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:13.690
The point of this problem is to
discuss with you how we are

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:18.180
modelling this box using the
concept of director vectors, 5

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.460
degrees of freedom, 6 degrees of
freedom, that we discussed

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.710
in the earlier lecture.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:28.570
So what we need to do here is
choose initial director

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:32.970
vectors, choose 5 or 6 degrees
of freedom for each node, and

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.800
choose the appropriate
boundary conditions.

01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:41.760
The way we proceed there
is as follows.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.490
We recognize that we could deal
with director vectors at

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:52.580
every one of the nodes, but if
we do so, at a corner, you

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.550
would have no unique
director vectors.

01:00:56.550 --> 01:01:00.060
You could, of course, assign
there a mean normal.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:04.720
In other words, if you look
closely here, my hands show

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.740
the corner, and the pointer
shows the mean

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:12.960
normal at that corner.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.170
And that mean normal, mean in
quotes, would be the direction

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:17.740
of the director vector.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.250
Let me show it from
up like that.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:23.990
Here you have the right angle
between my hands, and you have

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.220
the pointer giving you
the director vector.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.880
That would be one possibility.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.030
However, if you use ADINA, then,
in this particular case,

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:35.350
it is more effective to not
input director vectors.

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:39.550
Because if you don't do so
with ADINA, then for each

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:43.790
node, ADINA will generate
automatically a mid-surface

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.570
normal vector.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:49.190
In other words, if no director
vector has input for a node,

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.620
then ADINA generates for each
element connected to the node

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.960
a nodal point mid-surface this
normal vector at that node

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.260
from the element geometry.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.290
Now, what does this mean?

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:05.090
It means that if you use this
option, there will then be as

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:09.020
many different nodal point
mid-surface normal vectors at

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.550
the node as there are elements
connected to the node.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:15.040
Now we will have to look at
this statement much more

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.490
closely for this particular
example.

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:22.170
In this particular case, using
the option of automatic

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:24.760
generation of element nodal
point mid-surface normal

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:30.650
vectors, we find that at a node
away from an edge, we

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:34.620
will end up with just one
mid-surface normal vector.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:39.860
Because see, this is a flat
surface, and the program will

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.470
calculate for this element and
that element and that element

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.440
and this element, corresponding
to that node,

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.830
the same normal vector.

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:50.870
And that is the normal
vector that the

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:52.630
program will then use.

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:57.160
However, if we look at an edge,
along an edge, and pick

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.540
a node there, then at this node,
there will be 1 normal

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.750
vector calculated for this
element and that element at

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:12.060
that node, shown by this red
arrow, and one normal vector

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.690
at this node calculated for this
element and that element,

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:18.690
shown by this red arrow.

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:22.210
Of course here, you would have
three normal vectors.

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:27.410
One on that phase, that
phase, and this phase.

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:32.340
Well, with these normal vectors,
then, given, you

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:37.090
recognize that there will be no
stiffness corresponding to

01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:41.720
the rotation about this vector,
because these elements

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.620
don't carry stiffness in this
rotational degree of freedom.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:49.150
We have to be careful with that,
and we have got to make

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:54.430
sure that we solve the problem
with this rotation, the

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:57.510
rotation corresponding to this
vector here or about this

01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.700
vector, being deleted
in the model.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:05.140
Whereas at this node here, we
assign 6 degrees of freedom to

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:10.850
the model, because the rotation
corresponding around

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:14.840
this vector will have stiffness,
around this vector

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.580
will have stiffness, and if you
think of a rotation in the

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:24.550
direction of that vector but
at this node, about this

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:26.710
direction, you will have
also stiffness.

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:30.120
So we need 6 degrees of freedom
being assigned at a

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.130
node that corresponds to
an edge or corner.

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:37.300
We have 5 degrees of freedom
to be assigned

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.780
to all other nodes.

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.880
This is once more
summarized here.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:49.530
5 degrees of freedom at all
the nodes inside a face.

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:53.230
6 degrees of freedom along
an edge, and of

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:56.620
course also at a corner.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:59.950
Let us look now overall at the
boundary conditions that we

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:02.620
have to assign to the box
in order to be able

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.540
to solve the problem.

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:07.540
Here we show now the
box open side up.

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:11.500
So this is really the side on
which the box is placed, but

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:15.460
we just switch the box around
so that we can more easily

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:18.290
look at what happens on
this boundary here.

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:24.960
Well, we have nodes that we
might call internal nodes

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.620
along here, nodes that
are not corner nodes.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:32.860
And these nodes would have the
following boundary condition.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:38.160
First of all, all the rotational
degrees of freedom

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.820
shown by this arrow,
this double arrow,

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.390
must have been deleted.

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:44.060
This I just discussed.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:46.660
It is due to the fact that
there is no stiffness

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:52.110
corresponding to this rotation
at that node, because all the

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:54.550
elements coming into that node
don't have stiffness

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:58.880
corresponding to this rotational
degree of freedom.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.320
This degree of freedom
is free.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.540
That one is free.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.230
This rotation is free.

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:04.870
That rotation is free.

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:07.120
This translation is
also deleted.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.120
That is due to the fact that the
box can't move vertically.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.280
It's placed on the
rigid surface.

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:20.930
If we look at a node that is a
corner node-- and let's pick a

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:21.920
more typical one.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.840
Here we have one.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.520
Then at this node, we only take
out, as you can see, the

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.790
z displacement degree
of freedom.

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:34.370
Because, once again,
the box lies on

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:35.860
the rigid flat surface.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.730
But notice that these
rotations, all three

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:41.400
rotations, are left free.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.750
They all carry stiffness the
way I already discussed it.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:49.790
Also these translations
are free.

01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:54.890
Typical corner node, another
typical corner node, the same

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:57.250
action as this corner node.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.820
Now here we see something
in addition.

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.960
We see that this degree of
freedom is taken out, the same

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.290
way as over there.

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:06.870
But we also see that
this degree of

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:08.200
freedom is taken out.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.550
This one is taken out in order
to prevent a rigid body

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:15.830
rotation about my
pointer here.

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:22.710
That's why we take
this one out.

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:27.260
And we take this one out and
that one out to also prevent

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:31.040
the rigid body rotation that I
just mentioned, and to prevent

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.840
the rigid body translation.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.550
See, this translation has to be
taken out as well, and that

01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:39.650
translation has to be taken out,
and this rotation has to

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:40.880
be taken out.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.710
I repeat, this translation,
that translation, and that

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:47.090
rotation, all of those
have to be taken out.

01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:50.490
And that is achieved by knocking
out this degree of

01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:54.220
freedom, that one,
and that one.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.500
So these are the boundary
conditions that we apply to

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:02.340
the nodes on the edges
that are lying

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:05.340
on the rigid surface.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:08.950
If we perform now a linear
elastic static analysis of the

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:12.010
box with a uniform pressure
applied to the top off the

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:19.529
box, using our 4-node MITC4
element, here is a typical

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:22.029
element shown, this is
[? the measure ?]

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:29.590
that we use, we find that the
deformations are magnified,

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:32.240
quite highly magnified,
looking like that.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.170
Very reasonable deformation.

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:38.189
We could not compare here
with any other solution.

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:40.390
But it's still a very
interesting demonstrative

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:46.700
example, because of the way we
are dealing with the director

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.600
vectors, which actually
we don't define.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.180
We let the program generate

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.090
mid-surface nodal point vectors.

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:56.819
And because we could discuss the
use of the shell element

01:08:56.819 --> 01:09:00.450
degrees of freedom, freedom is
the imposition of boundary

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:02.510
conditions, and other aspects.

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:04.450
This, then, brings me to the
end of what I wanted to

01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:07.979
discuss this you related to the
view graph, and I'd like

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:11.240
to now share some further
experiences with you that I

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.819
documented on the slides.

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:17.850
So let me walk over here and let
us discuss the information

01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:19.899
that is even on the slides.

01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:25.380
The first slide here relates
to the analysis of a simply

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:29.540
supported plate under
uniform pressure.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:33.040
This plate is modelled
as shown here.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.710
We only model 1/4 of the plate
because of symmetry

01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:37.740
conditions.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:44.310
And as you can see here, n is
equal to 2 for 4 elements.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:48.270
We analyze this plate and
we calculate the center

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:52.670
displacement, which means the
displacement at that point,

01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:55.230
and compare that center
displacement to

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:57.640
the analytical solution.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.400
Notice that in this particular
case, l/H is equal to 1000, so

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.370
it's a very thin plate.

01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:09.690
And certainly we would get very
bad results if we had a

01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:12.640
shear locking phenomenon in the
element that we're using.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.670
As I pointed out earlier, the
MITC4 element does not have

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.730
any shear locking.

01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:22.940
And as you can see now here, as
we increase N, as shown in

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:27.320
this axes, we get excellent
convergence behavior to the

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.720
analytical solution.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.610
Now the next slide shows
the analysis of a

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:34.240
very similar plate.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.270
Again, a square plate, l/H
still being 1,000.

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:41.310
Simply supported plate.

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:46.360
But now the plate is subjected
to a concentrated load.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:51.720
And in this particular case,
we see the solution results

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.520
obtained with the MITC4 element
as a function of N--

01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:01.510
same number N that I referred
to in the earlier slide.

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:05.060
We see that we get also very
good convergence behavior in

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.010
this particular case.

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:09.700
Not quite as good as for the
uniformly distributed pressure

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:14.580
case, but still very
good as well here.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:21.690
The next slide shows the plate
now clamped at its edges.

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:23.990
Not any more simply supported.

01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:28.810
l/H still 1,000, so still
a very thin plate.

01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:31.340
And here we once again
calculate the center

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:34.190
displacement as a function
of N, the

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.130
number of elements used.

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:39.430
Remember, N equal 1
means 4 elements.

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:43.440
Remember N equals 4
means 16 elements.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.180
Once again, we see excellent
convergence behavior to the

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.250
exact analytical solution.

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:54.420
And finally, this was a case
for uniform pressure.

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.890
Now we look at the case for a
concentrated load applied at

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:58.840
the center.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.250
And here we see this convergence
behavior.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.650
Of course, this is quite a
complicated, difficult problem

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:07.440
to analyze, because of the
concentrated load and the

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.680
clamp boundary conditions.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.200
Here in this analysis, we used
nice square elements.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.100
A very important consideration
in a practical analysis is to

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.610
identify how well an
element performs

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.410
when it becomes distorted.

01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:32.110
And the next slides now relates
to that question.

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:37.100
Here we now model 1/4 of the
plate using mesh 1, shown

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.400
here, and using mesh
2, shown here.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.670
Notice the elements that we're
now using in these analyses is

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:47.490
still the MITC4 element.

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:50.490
Each of these elements is an
MITC4 element, but it's a

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:51.610
distorted element.

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:56.190
And our objective is really to
identify what displacement

01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:59.660
predictions we obtain at the
center, at point c of the

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:05.250
plate, when the plate is subject
to uniform pressure,

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:08.320
and the plate is also
simply supported.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.650
And what displacement
predictions do we obtain for

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:14.870
these two measures at
these two points?

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:19.930
How much do they deteriorate
when compared to the usage of

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:21.480
nice square elements?

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.310
Well, the displacement
predictions are given here.

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:27.910
Finite element over Kirchhoff
theory results.

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:33.830
Mesh 1, 0.93, mesh 2, 1.01.

01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:36.240
Notice mesh 2 has
just 1% error.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.870
Mesh 1 has 7% error.

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:42.040
But with mesh 1, we have a very
coarse mesh, and highly

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.712
distorted elements.

01:13:43.712 --> 01:13:47.280
It's of course also of interest
to see what moment

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.770
predictions one obtains, and
here we compare the finite

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:55.160
element moment versus the
Kirchhoff moment at point c.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:01.800
And you can see 15% error for
mesh 1, 2% error for mesh 2.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.030
Actually also very good
results for moment

01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:06.460
prediction, as well.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:09.950
I should also emphasize, please,
that l/H is equal to

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:14.810
1,000, so we are still talking
about this very thin plate.

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:18.440
The next slide now shows how
the element behaves in the

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.550
analysis of a skew plate.

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:24.270
It's also now a distorted
element mesh, or rather, the

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:28.590
elements used in the meshing
of this plate are distorted

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:31.590
elements, but they're a little
bit more regular distorted.

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:34.170
In fact, they are parallelogram
elements.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:38.400
Notice, please, that this is a
top view, so we are seeing a

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.810
plan view of the plate.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:42.060
And--

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:01.450
SPEAKER: Pick up lecture
20, tape B, slide

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:05.950
20-7, time code 20:33:18.

01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:07.200
Take one.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.300
PROFESSOR: The next analysis
that I like to consider now is

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.050
the analysis of the
skew plate.

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:25.590
Here we show a top view of the
skew plate with an angle of

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:27.030
skew of 30 degrees.

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:29.120
So it's a highly skewed plate.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.180
And this is the kind of
mesh we want to use.

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:36.340
Here we show the 4-by-4 mesh
of MITC4 elements.

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:39.150
Notice the elements are
distorted, but sort of

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:41.370
regularly distorted, because
they are having a

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.720
parallelogram shape.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.780
The boundary conditions on the
plate are simply supported

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.030
boundary conditions, which I
should point out are modelled

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:55.580
using the isoparametric
degenerate plate elements,

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:58.550
shell elements, that
we talked about.

01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:01.790
These boundary conditions are
modelled by simply setting

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:05.550
only the transverse displacement
at the nodes, on

01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.480
the boundary equal to 0.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.840
In other words, the
displacements corresponding to

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:15.250
the z-axis, pointing out of the
slide, are set equal to 0,

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:20.010
but the rotations on the
boundary nodes are left free.

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:23.010
This is a very interesting
point, most interesting point.

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:27.600
And if you like to read up on
it, please refer to the

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.010
reference that is given
in the study guide

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.400
related to this slide.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.760
Well, we use these kinds of
meshes to analyze the plate.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.500
Notice the material data
are given here.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.640
The thickness of the plate
is given here.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:48.770
B is equal to 1, so we have a
thickness with ratio of 1/100.

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.510
It's a fairly thin plate.

01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:55.780
And we are considering uniform
pressure applied to the plate.

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:59.680
The next slide now shows
analysis results.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:05.470
4-by-4 mesh, 8-by-8, 16-by-16,
32-by-32 meshes were used.

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:10.040
We compare our finite element
solution at the point C, the

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.150
midpoint of the plate,
versus the Morley

01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:15.780
solution at that point.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:20.580
And you can see that we really
have obtained very nice

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:24.060
conversions to the
Morley solution.

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:28.060
Notice here, we're looking
at the principal moments,

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:31.310
actually the maximum and the
minimum moments, at that

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:35.410
midpoint of the plate again,
point C, and we're comparing

01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:37.380
finite element solutions
with Morley solutions.

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.610
And here once again, quite
good convergence for the

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:42.910
moment, as well.

01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:48.720
Now in this analysis, we use the
kind of mesh, this 4-by-4

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.920
mesh, that we had on
the previous slide.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.920
And one can ask, of course, is
that a good mesh to use?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.330
Well, we deliberately wanted
to use this mesh in this

01:17:57.330 --> 01:18:00.020
analysis to test the capability
of the element.

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.660
Of course, one could use
a different mesh.

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:05.110
And on the next slide now, I'm
showing the results obtained

01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:09.010
by using just four elements,
a 2-by-2 mesh, to

01:18:09.010 --> 01:18:11.220
model 1/4 of the plate.

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:14.630
And you can see, with this
2-by-2 mesh, we get already

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:18.550
excellent predictions of the
displacement at the point C.

01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:20.980
This is where point
C is, once again.

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:24.400
Excellent prediction of the
displacement at point C when

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.460
compared with Morley solution.

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:30.700
The moment is quite poorly
predicted, still.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:33.830
The two moments that
I defined earlier.

01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:37.780
If we go to a finer mesh, 4-by-4
mesh, the moments, of

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.750
course, are much better, and
so is the displacement

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:42.160
prediction.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.240
But the displacement prediction
was already goods,

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:47.000
so there is not that much
of an improvement.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.880
But in general, one can say,
this here, certainly for

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.010
displacement predictions, is a
much better mesh to use than

01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:57.970
the earlier meshes that
we used for the

01:18:57.970 --> 01:18:59.710
earlier table results.

01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:03.050
Now I'd like to look at another
problem, the analysis

01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:08.020
of a cantilever subjected to
an end-bending moment, and

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:10.520
undergoing very large
displacement.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.600
Here are the data given
corresponding to the

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.200
cantilever, an elastic
structure that

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.230
we're looking at.

01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:23.390
And we will be measuring v, phi,
and u, and u, v, and phi

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:25.730
would take on large values.

01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:28.920
In fact, we will actually
normalize u and v to the

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.740
length of the cantilever.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:35.830
The next slide now shows
the results obtained.

01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:41.440
v/l, u/l, and phi over
2 pi as a function

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.020
of the moment applied.

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:46.440
We're using here moment
parameter, but of course, the

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.340
moment increases along this
axis, and here we are plotting

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:54.110
u/l, v/l, and phi over 2 pi.

01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:58.730
Notice that even for very large
displacement, v/l being

01:19:58.730 --> 01:20:04.510
0.7, with 1 cubic element, cubic
in the direction of the

01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:08.790
cantilever, excellent results.

01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:11.740
This is, in other words, the use
of the cubic element, in

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.920
general the 16-node
shell element, for

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.520
these types of analyses.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.060
And it shows that the 16-node
shell element is

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.750
really quite effective.

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:25.100
The next slide now shows
how we would

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.050
apply the MITC4 element.

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:30.440
Here we use just two elements
to model the cantilever,

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.680
bending moment applied
here, clamped

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.380
boundary conditions here.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:39.810
And you can see that here we
are plotting u/l, w/l, phi

01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:43.350
over 2 pi, as before, moment
parameter along here.

01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:45.550
And you can see that we're
getting really excellent

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:50.360
results just with 2 elements for
w/l 0.6, or certainly up

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.570
0.5, very close to the
analytical solution.

01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:58.560
The analytical solution is
given by the solid line.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.430
The next slide now shows the
result obtained using three

01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:06.330
MITC4 elements to model
the same cantilever.

01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:10.470
Notice these are now the nodes
that we also have used when

01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:13.860
using the cubic element
in our first result.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.120
And note this excellent
comparison with the analytical

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.750
solution for u/l, w/l,
and phi over 2 pi.

01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:24.770
Very large displacement under
very large displacement

01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:26.910
conditions.

01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:32.880
The next slide now shows the
analysis of an I-section

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.590
clamped at this end
and subjected to a

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.330
torque at this end.

01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:40.590
This is actually quite a
complicated problem if you

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:44.450
think deeper about the problem
and recognize that you have

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:49.010
torsional conditions, restrained
warping here,

01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.710
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:55.490
torsion here, then of course you
have bending in the beam,

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:56.700
et cetera, et cetera.

01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:00.190
It's not a very easy
problem if you look

01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:01.780
deeply into the problem.

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:06.020
And we wanted to obtain some
relatively good prediction for

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.520
this structural response when
the structure goes into the

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.200
elastoplastic regime.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.640
Here we have the material data
used in the analysis.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:21.040
You can see perfectly plastic
conditions by using tangent

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.620
material modulus equal to 0.

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:30.210
The slide here now shows one
model that we use, namely the

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:37.770
use of altogether 9
isoparametric cubic elements.

01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:40.900
These are rectangular
elements.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.950
Notice this is 1 isoparametric
element.

01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:48.310
This is the mid-surface or the
neutral axis of that one

01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:51.990
isoparametric cubic rectangular
section element.

01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:55.280
We are modeling the whole
I-beam by assembling the

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.150
I-beam using 9 such elements.

01:22:58.150 --> 01:23:02.590
Of course we discussed earlier
that these elements contain

01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:04.950
the proper warping conditions.

01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:09.600
We have supplemented our
isoparametric interpolation by

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.660
warping functions, and those
now of course will be

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.840
activated in picking up the
torsional response, or

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.150
modelling the torsional
response.

01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:20.610
This is a free end, that's
the fixed end.

01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:23.570
This was one model that we used,
and in addition, we used

01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:26.320
another model, which
is shown here--

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.770
a model of shell elements,
9-node shell

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:32.200
elements, 9 such elements.

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.460
Of course, a better response
would have been obtained by

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:38.880
using the 16-node element, but
that of course would have been

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.820
a more expensive analysis.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:45.600
So in this particular case, we
wanted to test this model

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.500
versus the isoparametric beam
model that I just showed you.

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:53.360
Notice one interesting point,
how we are modelling this

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.170
connection here.

01:23:55.170 --> 01:23:59.030
You see a blown-up
figure of it.

01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:04.610
At this point node c, we have
just 5 degrees of freedom.

01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:09.260
No rotational stiffness about
this vector here.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.310
So that is not a degree
of freedom.

01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:15.060
Here we have 6 degrees of
freedom, 3 translational

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.610
degrees of freedom and 3
rotational degrees of freedom.

01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:20.670
Here we have 5 degrees
of freedom.

01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:24.200
No degree of freedom, no
stiffness corresponding to the

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:27.440
rotation about this
vector here.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.170
That's one of the important
points that we discussed

01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:31.580
earlier already.

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.860
Well, to proceed with the
analysis, we actually use the

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:37.940
longitudinal element dimensions
shown here.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.890
Notice that we use a shorter
element at the fixed end than

01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:46.160
here at the free end, because we
anticipate heavy plasticity

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.070
here that we wanted to model
quite accurately.

01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:53.480
Once again, the torque is
applied here, and theta x is

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.410
measured here.

01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:59.170
And on the next slide now, we
show the variation of the

01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:03.470
torque as a function of
the theta x [? rate ?]

01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:04.760
rotation.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.580
Notice here you have the isobeam
model solution, and

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:10.190
here you have the shell
model solution.

01:25:10.190 --> 01:25:13.840
We compare our results with
a sand heap solution and a

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.730
Merchant's upper
bound solution.

01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:17.500
These are simplified analytical

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.530
solutions to this problem.

01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:25.590
Our results here are somewhat
close, but not very close.

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:28.440
Of course, one could make a
much deeper study of this

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.600
problem, a very interesting
problem.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.790
But the way we now already have
concluded our study and

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:36.660
the way I show you the results,
see, I think it's

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:39.900
already quite valuable, because
we have learned a bit

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:44.640
regarding the modeling of
this type of problem.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.380
Well, the next slide now shows
a final problem for which I

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.810
wanted to show you some
solution results.

01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:56.310
Here we have a cylindrical
shell supported on rigid

01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:59.910
diaphragms at the end,
and the shell is

01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:01.930
subjected to uniform pressure.

01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:06.000
We measure here wB, the
displacement at that

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.840
particular point B. The data
corresponding to the shell are

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.500
given here.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.310
Notice that we model the shell
as an elastic, perfectly

01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:22.070
plastic material, and notice
that in the shell, we modeled

01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:25.790
only this part of the shell,
this quarter part of the

01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:29.540
shell, using a 9-by-9
uniform mesh of the

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.950
4-node MITC4 element.

01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:38.500
The results are now given
on the slide shown here.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:43.130
Pressure applied plotted along
this axis, wB plotted along

01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:46.950
this axis, and this is a
non-linear solution response

01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:51.445
we have obtained using the MITC4
element, and we compare

01:26:51.445 --> 01:26:54.940
our solution with the solution
given by Krakeland.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:57.360
I might point out that in this
analysis, we used our

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.750
automatic load-stepping scheme
that we discussed when we

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.970
talked about the solution of the
non-linear finite element

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.480
equations in an earlier
lecture.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.050
Very good comparison
up to this point

01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:11.590
with Krakeland's solution.

01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:14.830
We did not go much further
than that solution given,

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:16.910
because we could not
compare with any

01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:19.250
other solution anyway.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:22.510
Well, this brings me now to the
end of what I wanted to

01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:25.720
discuss with you regarding
shell elements.

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.570
Of course, please remember
there is a lot more

01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:32.340
information that we could have
discussed and that we could

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:36.920
have studied together, but we
only have two lectures, and

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.820
this is the information that I
wanted to share with you in

01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:40.820
these two lectures.

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:43.410
I hope you enjoyed it.

01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:47.190
Please also refer to the papers
that are given as

01:27:47.190 --> 01:27:49.830
references for these two
lectures, particularly for the

01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:53.250
slides, where you will find much
more information, many

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:56.530
more details regarding this
material that we discussed.

01:27:56.530 --> 01:27:57.840
Thank you very much for
your attention.

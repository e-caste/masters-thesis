00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:10.200
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.560
In this section, we want to
study the decay of a particle,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.990
in this case, the
decay of a pion.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.820
The pion is a particle
which consists

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.550
of quarks and antiquarks, which
are bound together by gluons.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.880
They're part of a
family of particles

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.590
which are called mesons.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.180
And they can be
charged and neutral.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.285
So we have positively-charged,
negatively-charged, and neutral

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:31.410
pions.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.930
In this example, we
look at a neutral pion

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.390
decay and the specific
decay into an electron

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.250
and a positron.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.760
Mostly, neutral pions and
decay into a pair of photons.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.540
But we study this effect
here because it's more fun.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.950
The lifetime or the
mean lifetime over pi 0

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.150
is 8 times 10 to the
minus 17 seconds.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.020
So when we produce neutral
pions in our detector,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.760
they immediately
decay, as I said,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.150
mostly into a pair of photons.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.850
That we discovered in the 1940s.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.060
So let's get to it.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.400
So the mass of a pion--

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.640
of neutral pion is 135 MeV.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.900
So it's much heavier than
an electron, which is 500--

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.175
has a mass of 511 KeV.

00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:21.675
So we're looking
at this decay here.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.670
We have a pion a rest into
an electron and a positron.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.850
And so the charge for you
now is to find the gamma

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.130
factor of the electron
or the positron

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.740
or, [? with ?] that, the
velocity of those particles

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.770
and the decay of a pion at rest.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.530
So again, as usual,
stop the video,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.550
and try to work this out.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.690
And again, what we want to do is
just write down the four-vector

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.980
of the particles involved.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.080
We start with the
pion, which has

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.330
an energy of the pion
mass times c square.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.220
And it's at rest in
this example here,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.890
which means that
the momentum is 0.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.750
And so then the
outgoing particles

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.780
are the electron and
positron with their energy

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.310
and their momentum.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.780
And then just from
this first line

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.199
here from the energy
relation, you can--

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.840
by knowing that the mass of
the electron and a positron

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.680
are the same, by knowing
that the gamma factor is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.050
the same that comes out of
the momentum relation here,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.030
that they have
the same velocity,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.740
you can just simply
find gamma as

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.370
equal to the pion mass divided
by 2 times the electron mass.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.030
And that is about 132.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.570
So again, we studied
the decay of a pion.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.210
And as a general
example of the decay

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.450
of a particle into
two new particles,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.610
we used the energy
momentum relation.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.280
We make sure use of the
[? effect, ?] in this case,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.260
that we are in the
rest frame of the pion.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.640
And then we are able to get
to the velocity or the gamma

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.900
factor of the
outgoing particles.

00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:23.700
GARY GENSLER: So we're
going to come back again

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.710
today to blockchain economics.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.250
A lot of what we're going to
talk about today while again

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.240
anchored in the
readings will also

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.220
be relevant as we
now turn to after Sip

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.640
week to act three where
we're going through use cases

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.130
but also hopefully relevant as
you're starting to think, OK,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.130
what about this final
project and so forth

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.350
and what do we need to do?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.570
Five or six of the groups
have come in either

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.050
as an individual person or teams
of three or four have come in

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.330
and bounced ideas off of me.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.186
So I want to thank all of
the groups that have come in,

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:04.769
because you've helped
me also organize

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.070
some of my talking
points for today

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.330
as to what we're going through.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.900
And those of you
who haven't come in,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.520
feel free to set things
up if you find it helpful.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.390
It's not mandatory.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.370
But you can also
thank the six groups

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.290
that have come in,
because now I'm

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.410
trying to anticipate
your questions as well

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.850
along the way.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.970
So, the overview of course our
reading and study questions

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.770
will come through.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.290
There was the letter
to Jamie Dimon.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.000
So we're going to dive
into that one a little bit.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.340
I found it interesting when
I read it about a year ago.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.370
And then I thought, why not
throw it into to the mix here?

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.200
The McKinsey report,
which, again, I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.920
found this to be true for years.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.620
It's not just this
class that you

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.830
can find some consultant that's
put a generalized paper out,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.652
it does sort of
just skim the tops,

00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:06.360
but you're getting a
sense of how they're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.970
trying to gin up business.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.962
Their business model is to
write some of these reports.

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:13.920
And some of you are going
to go into consulting

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.990
and maybe even write these
reports at some point in time.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.470
But it's often a good way
to see what I'll call it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.890
just a survey, a
topical survey in how

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.600
folks think about things.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.760
Quickly a little bit
on potential use cases.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.970
In the heart of
today's discussion

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.710
and kind of the
heart for thinking

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.940
about the final projects
is how to really assess

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.660
the costs and benefits of
any potential use case.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.100
So I'll skip through
the study questions.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.830
But these are the key.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.200
I didn't see anybody go
in the discussion board.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.890
I looked.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.690
Did you see anything there?

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.560
No.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.430
we did set it up.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.740
But what are the
potential benefits,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.910
and how do you assess
the cost of trusts?

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.950
And that is going to be true
in every single project you

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.460
look at.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.300
If you take anything
from this class,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.240
it's this core critical
reasoning of like--

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.490
and hopefully after
the Roubini paper

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.540
last Tuesday, we're going
to come out of the doldrums

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.880
and we're going to pull back
out of the minimalist side

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.842
and get more in the middle.

00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:28.050
I might not get Alin lean
out of the minimalist side,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.750
I don't know.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.870
But it's interesting.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.480
Some groups come in and I find
the three or four people that

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.920
are sitting there I ask.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.810
In and even amongst
the group, there's

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.550
somebody who's a maximalist and
somebody who's a minimalist.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.770
So I think we're being
successful that we're not

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.765
going to come out all
in the same place.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.780
So, of course, since we're
going to talk about the reading,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.170
let's jumped through, a
letter to Jamie Dimon.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.920
Anybody want to tell me what
you took from that letter?

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.810
AUDIENCE: I really
loved this article.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.290
It is my favorite
reading so far.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.105
GARY GENSLER: Oh my
gosh, 12 classes.

00:04:06.105 --> 00:04:06.605
All right.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.250
AUDIENCE: So I though
that he really great

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.940
job of stripping some of the
hyperbole, both the maximalist

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.890
and the minimalist hyperbole
surrounding this out

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.000
of it to lean on
really what it is

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.590
and a very good explanation
of how it works.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.610
And then also, the
note of caution

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.347
to see if these are the
dimensions around which--

00:04:29.347 --> 00:04:30.930
you should wait til
you put a word in,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.780
but these are the
reasons why there's

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.007
potentially big implications.

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:35.840
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.923
And he wants to add to it.

00:04:36.923 --> 00:04:39.910
I'm going to hold-- there
was a hand before Alin?

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.897
I actually was going to
say something similar.

00:04:42.897 --> 00:04:48.240
But I thought he highlighted a
lot the trade-off between trust

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.820
and the decentralized
properties of blockchain

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.180
versus the cost you
must be willing to pay.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.170
GARY GENSLER: And remind
me your first name.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.980
AUDIENCE: Leonardo.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.938
GARY GENSLER: Leonardo.

00:05:01.938 --> 00:05:02.460
All right.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.960
AUDIENCE: I agree
with both of them.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.015
Also, very good
writing and style.

00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:10.140
One thing that I didn't
like is that at some point,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.330
he raised the
question, well, who

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.500
needs censorship resistance?

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.417
Because it seems like
this is the only benefit

00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:17.140
of these decentralized
applications.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.973
And he didn't answer
that question actually.

00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:20.807
He just gave two
vague broad answers,

00:05:20.807 --> 00:05:22.140
but didn't answer that question.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.940
So I think that's a
really good question.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.320
Who needs this stuff, anyway?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.370
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.440
Censorship resistance.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.250
We're going to come back to it.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.010
Stephanie.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.490
So actually, I thought
censorship resistance was also

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.532
one of the more interesting
parts of this letter.

00:05:34.532 --> 00:05:37.560
Because to me, when you read
through what they highlighted

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.790
that Jamie Dimon had
said, one of the things

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.950
was people who use Bitcoin
or Blockchain are criminals.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.990
And I didn't find that his
focus on censorship resistance

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.090
really rebutted Jamie
Dimon's argument.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.660
GARY GENSLER: So--

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.210
Sean.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.890
AUDIENCE: Oh, I think that
censorship resistance is really

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.320
interested in a way that
now I actually almost feel

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.350
why we spend so much time and
energy on trying to understand

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.630
public policy or
why is public policy

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.161
such a big thing in response
to decentralized apps.

00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:14.470
I think this is a key question.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.040
GARY GENSLER: So I think of--

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.645
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to--
well, I definitely agree.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.020
Because that was one of Dimon's
points, that, well, yeah,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.285
if you're a criminal,
this could be useful.

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:25.660
And then he talked
about how it's

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.035
worse than a lot of aspects
except censorship resistance.

00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:30.030
But I think the
analogy he used was

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.973
the rise in encrypted messaging
that has just become--

00:06:33.973 --> 00:06:35.556
it wasn't really
predictable that that

00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:38.050
would be such a big thing,
but now that's gotten

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.980
use cases in the world.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.680
GARY GENSLER: So it
seems like people really

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.110
like the writing,
not just the style

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.795
but that it took on and
had a balanced approach.

00:06:49.795 --> 00:06:51.420
But you're highlighting,
wait a minute,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.000
he ends with
censorship resistance,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.830
but then doesn't
take it the next way.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.515
Like, what does that mean?

00:06:57.515 --> 00:06:58.890
And so I think
we're going to try

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.650
to tease that out a little
bit, but I think of it

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.910
as in two ways.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.980
It's the individual.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.310
Any one of us could be
blocked from doing something.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.240
We could not get a
service, we could not

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.340
be allowed to take credit if
somebody is allocating credit.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.330
Think about Uber.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.770
If Uber were censoring, we
can't get a ride any longer.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.620
How many of us rate
everybody a five when

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.960
we ride our Ubers
because we think,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.270
well, maybe they'll pick me up.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.280
If I rated everybody a three,
maybe they'll censor me.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.430
I don't know, but maybe you all
give more legitimate feedback.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.305
I just hit five.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.200
So it's the
individual censorship,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.770
but I think of it as
a second thing also,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.360
is barriers to entry, a
commercial more broad market

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.010
barrier.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.090
And that in some ways,
the blockchain technology

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:03.030
might allow to build something
where incumbents already

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.320
have barriers to entry.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.670
They might have used public
policy to get the barriers,

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.170
by the way.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.930
They might have regulatory
barriers as well.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.660
But more specifically,
he did define--

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.400
it was kind of
interesting-- crypto assets.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.208
And he was one that--

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:23.250
I'm trying to remember
the gentleman who wrote it

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.540
because it was on Chain.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.920
It was the head of Chain.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.470
What's that?

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.550
AUDIENCE: Adam Ludwin.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.480
GARY GENSLER: Adam Ludwin.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.110
But he too said, let's not
use the word cryptocurrency.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.120
Let's use the word
crypto assets.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.710
They enable a
decentralized application.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.390
And that was a key thing he was
trying to say to Jamie Dimon.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.850
It depends on how
much you believe

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.380
in decentralized applications.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.030
If you don't see a value in
decentralized applications,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.420
Ludwin, said, all
right, I get it,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.940
I'll agree with you, Mr. Dimon.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.830
But there is a benefit for
decentralized applications

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.170
and a mechanism to
allocate resources

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.910
to a specific organization.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:12.960
So some incentive way, some
way to allocate resources.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.720
I would say this.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.530
We've studied money
a lot this semester,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:22.180
the medium of exchange, unit
of a cat, store of value.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.840
But it's also possible that
these crypto assets have

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.830
some other benefit, that they're
not really truly competing

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.330
with the US dollar or
competing with the Euro,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.760
but maybe they're competing
with-- who's my friend who's

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.970
the gamer over here?

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.002
Skins, yeah.

00:09:39.002 --> 00:09:39.960
What's your name again?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.590
AUDIENCE: Mike.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.382
GARY GENSLER: Mike.

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:44.130
I'm going to be always
looking to my right for the--

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.840
but it could be an
incentive and be competing

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.570
with skins, in a sense.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.590
And so I took that,
that, Mr. Dimon,

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.930
don't think of it only
versus the Euro or the Dollar

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.635
because maybe you're right.

00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:02.010
But it could have
something to do

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.760
with decentralized applications.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.592
Kelly.

00:10:06.592 --> 00:10:10.060
AUDIENCE: To add to that,
Bitcoin is capitalism still.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.182
He should love it.

00:10:11.182 --> 00:10:12.640
GARY GENSLER: That
you should still

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.030
love Bitcoin and capitalism,
and that the banks

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.440
aren't going away.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.010
They will probably
still have banks.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.260
AUDIENCE: It is incredible
that he didn't use the word

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.240
blockchain till the very
end to asterisk and say,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.020
you'll notice I
don't use blockchain,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.987
and I thought kind of a genius
way to separate [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:31.820
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.750
I'm not as genius as him
because the whole course

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.666
is called Blockchain and Money.

00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:38.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.530
Oh, well.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.002
So what are decentralized
applications, at least

00:10:44.002 --> 00:10:44.710
in this write-up?

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.550
Anybody?

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.100
Kelly?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.828
AUDIENCE: Basically, it just
says it allows you [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:54.828 --> 00:10:57.170
but without the trust part.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.146
GARY GENSLER: So you don't need
a centralized trusted party.

00:11:01.146 --> 00:11:05.080
That's what in the 1990s so many
people tried and failed with,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.580
in a sense.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.020
And the internet became this
way, in a decentralized way,

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.030
to distribute packets
of information,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.190
even though there is
centralization on the internet

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.450
as well, as we discussed
Tuesday and so forth.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.740
But this decentralized
application-- so

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.690
in this context, he
was using it broader

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.830
than just something
built on top of Ethereum

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.030
through smart contracts.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.630
Because he even said Bitcoin
was a decentralized application.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.640
So he was using it in
the broader context,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.430
not in what some people
would call dapps.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.170
But a new model for creating
financing operating software.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.320
And this is what Christian
Catalini wrote about as well,

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.290
that it might be that there's
a new way to finance a software

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.850
development.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.250
Maybe raise some money
for the file sharing

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.230
before you have
the file sharing.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.200
Might be an incentive
system as well.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.690
And then he talked about
two structural trade-offs

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.310
from the design.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:14.870
Now, this blockchain design
has a lot of complexity.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.640
It has a lot of additional
cost, whether it's mining costs

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.240
for proof of work
or some other cost

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.100
to basically secure the data.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.370
And so there has
to be a trade-off.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.790
And what can pull you out of
the minimalist end of this

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.823
is whether there's
some benefits as well.

00:12:33.823 --> 00:12:35.240
And we're going
to chat about that

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.600
in five or 10 minutes again.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.380
And then the
censorship resistance.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.890
These are my words, not his.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.430
I really do think it's
the individual censorship,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.100
but also, what I'll
broadly call the market.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.610
Are there barriers to entry
in the current system that

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:57.290
are, in essence, censoring
economic activity broadly,

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.520
not individually?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.450
And I think, though, that
was not how he defined

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.620
it-- and I agree with Alin.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.828
It would have been great if
he had written a few more

00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:07.940
paragraphs or another page.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.160
But I think it's not
just the individual,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.610
it's some barriers to entry
for whole market structures.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.580
And often, centralized
institutions,

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.750
because they have such
a networking effect,

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.580
it's hard to break in
when somebody is basically

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:33.010
the hub of a hub and spokes
network for almost anything.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.490
How do you topple Facebook
at this point in time?

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:43.950
Because it can censor other
market activity, as an example.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.570
So then we had the
McKinsey report.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:51.390
Anything that people took
from yet one more survey paper

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.080
that you've had?

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.630
Akira?

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.980
It's just because I can see
your name on the board there.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:06.340
AUDIENCE: From [INAUDIBLE],, I
found the use case [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.840
use case to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.870
And one thing I
found interesting

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.860
is the switching costs.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.980
Because the incumbent
financial institutions

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:24.726
have to think about not only the
benefit of the cost reduction,

00:14:24.726 --> 00:14:27.882
but also, we have to think about
[INAUDIBLE] costs, existing

00:14:27.882 --> 00:14:32.375
infrastructure, a lot of
the affect on the people

00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:33.250
watching [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.590
GARY GENSLER: So Akira's
raised a very important thing

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.700
about switching costs.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.580
And we wrote about this, even
though I'm not detailing it

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.350
again, in the joint paper that
Simon, Johnson, and Nihon,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.650
and Michael, and
Joan, and I wrote.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.070
Now, this the last time--

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.415
it's the third time you had to
come back and supposedly read

00:14:52.415 --> 00:14:54.040
a little bit more of
the Geneva Report.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.270
But we talked there about
the switching cost as well.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.320
And by the way,
to Alin's question

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.930
from Tuesday about
interoperability,

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.730
a lot of switching costs
relate to interoperability.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.860
If you're an
institution and you're

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.400
thinking about putting in
place some blockchain solution,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.440
permissioned or permissionless,
but how does it communicate

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.790
with the existing network?

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.710
If the Australian
stock exchange is

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.460
putting in a new back end
clearing and settlement system

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.930
on a blockchain--

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.900
and they are and they're
using digital asset holding--

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.100
they have to think about,
well, all of our customers

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.340
are currently communicating
with a legacy database system.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.180
And now we're creating
a blockchain system.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.400
How does that communicate?

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.120
How does the old system
literally move information over

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.660
into the new system?

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:53.830
And all of those from
a business perspective

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.420
are a question of how do
you operate or interoperate

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:03.410
with the legacy system
and all the network.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.470
Because any blockchain
solution that you're

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.660
going to come up
with is likely to be

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.710
replacing some other economic
activity, and likely,

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.380
you're not going to try to
replace the entire network.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.695
You're going to be surgical.

00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:18.695
You're going to decide--

00:16:21.247 --> 00:16:22.830
I'm not trying to
give anything, Eric,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.150
but can I say what you
all are talking about it

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.300
in your final project?

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.070
You have intellectual
property, so I don't

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.180
know if you wanted to share it.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.440
But do you want to say what--

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.330
AUDIENCE: Could you
elaborate a little more?

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.450
In the point we were
discussing, I was kind of lost.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.890
GARY GENSLER: Well,
so Eric's group--

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:45.290
and Brotish, and
Catalina, and Ross--

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.160
are talking about maybe doing
a permissioned blockchain

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.280
application for credit reports.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.350
Not credit reports for
the commercial side,

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.240
but consumer credit.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.880
Basically, an-- uh-oh, Alf.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.100
Are you competing with them?

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.610
Did I just--

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:03.590
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:04.660
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.160
All right.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.950
Maybe you are, so I
shouldn't say much more.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:08.950
No, it's all right.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.295
But I won't say anything more.

00:17:12.295 --> 00:17:14.520
AUDIENCE: Maybe it would
be interesting to point out

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.069
the fundamental--

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.440
or one of the interesting
things that comes up

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.810
from the discussion of
the topic we're engaging

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:27.839
is how to approach a
blockchain solution

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:33.255
from an entrepreneurial
perspective.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.107
Going back to the letter to--

00:17:40.107 --> 00:17:41.190
GARY GENSLER: Jamie Dimon.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.590
AUDIENCE: To Jamie
Dimon reading,

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.840
we're trying to get
rid of intermediaries

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.990
or getting economic rents with
that differing kind of paradigm

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:58.240
that justifies the costs of
using a blockchain approach

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.650
to promote [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.270
But from an entrepreneurial
point of view,

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:08.680
you would end up trying to get
some benefit from that kind

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.490
of implementation.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.190
So you don't want to
replace intermediaries

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.360
with another intermediary.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.020
So you would have to be
really creative in terms

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.460
of how to come up with really
lowering costs and gaining

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.360
some profits in the process.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.350
GARY GENSLER: So Eric's
raising that if you're just

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.470
replacing one intermediary
with another intermediary,

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.690
will you be successful
as an entrepreneur?

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.710
Yes, if you're providing a
better service or a lower cost

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.590
structure, lower economic rents.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:43.190
So I wouldn't doubt yourself.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.340
I would say, we might
be able to do it.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.470
In your use case--
and apologies,

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.670
maybe it's multiple use--

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.070
maybe it's two or three
groups thinking about it.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.310
There's a lot of market power
right now, and thus a lot

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.490
of economic rents, but a lot of
market power and economic rents

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.320
and credit reporting.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.370
Equifax, First Union, and
others earn a certain fees

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.760
for all of those FICA scores.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.010
In the US, we use this.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.480
If you're getting
a job, somebody

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.500
runs a credit report on you.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.830
If you're buying an automobile
and taking out an auto loan.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.760
It feels like each
of us probably

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.900
have a credit report pulled
on us multiple times a year.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.140
Sometimes we don't even know it.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.360
But back to interoperability
and switching

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.100
costs, just to pull
it all together.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.830
How could you convince the
commercial banks to use--

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.020
I'll call it Eric's
project, it's

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.940
four people, but how could you
convince all the banks to use

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.380
their project and how about
all the auto dealerships

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.010
on the other side who right
now are very comfortable using

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.750
First Union?

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.480
Everybody's probably
paying a little bit extra.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.330
And there's a fat market
power, economic rents.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.260
And so that's part of
the switching costs

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.750
that Akira mentioned.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.960
And to the
interoperability, I believe

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.840
they'll be more
successful if they

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.150
don't try to completely
change how data flows,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.150
that at some point
you need to know

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.180
that you can't be
successful by biting off

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.530
too much all at once.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.997
I'm sorry, Catalina.

00:20:28.997 --> 00:20:31.080
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say that, precisely, that

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.590
is one of the
forms of blockchain

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.780
he raised in the paper.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.255
And it's not changing one
intermediary for another.

00:20:39.255 --> 00:20:41.130
Financially, what they
say is that he's going

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.490
to be more successful for--

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.825
blockchain's going to be more
successful in the permissioned

00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:49.740
than in the permissionless
because the incumbents are more

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.680
willing to work on
the permissioned

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.423
than with the permissionless.

00:20:54.423 --> 00:20:55.840
GARY GENSLER: In
essence, Catalina

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.210
is saying you might be
more successful not trying

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.390
to disrupt the entire
community, whatever

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.750
that community in some
ecosystem, some business

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.650
community, and do
it in a permissioned

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:11.700
versus permissionless.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.190
But we're going to play
with that a little longer.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.960
Kelly.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.160
AUDIENCE: I feel like they
addressed the timeline of where

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.440
the strategic value is.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.420
For example, they
said, currently

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.260
the best way to reap the
benefits from blockchain

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.450
are to focus on
this, this, and this.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.930
And then they say, however,
feasibility at scale, they say,

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.067
is probably three
to five years away,

00:21:33.067 --> 00:21:34.400
exactly what you've been saying.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:34.900
So--

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.410
GARY GENSLER: Oh, my god.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.120
We could both be wrong.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.650
All right.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.535
Jack.

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:44.410
AUDIENCE: Something else
I found interesting.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.590
There's a lot of talk right now
about robotics and supply chain

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.770
using blockchain.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.472
And the McKinsey report
kind of touched on that.

00:21:51.472 --> 00:21:52.930
No matter how secure
the blockchain

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.250
is, when you start involving
actual real products

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.160
and assets, it could be
completely corrupted,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.920
even if the blockchain folds.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.753
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:22:02.753 --> 00:22:04.180
And also, it's interesting--

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.330
I think, Jack, if I can
pick further on that.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.220
When you have something
on the blockchain,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.280
even if it arguably
should be there,

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.900
it's a property
right and so forth,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:19.510
but it's an off-chain asset,
it's not just a digital asset,

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.180
and secured and verified
on a blockchain.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.410
But in supply chain, it's often
an off-chain asset, and often

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.240
a physical asset.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.757
Then there's
additional challenges.

00:22:30.757 --> 00:22:32.840
I think there's some really
interesting use cases,

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.610
but it's a little bit
of a different place.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.180
James.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.305
And then I'm going to-- no?

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.960
So McKinsey defines
a blockchain.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.450
And they point out
it doesn't have

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:51.440
to necessarily disintermediate
to generate value.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.890
I thought that was an
interesting intuition.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.310
Don't always think that
you have to disintermediate

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.150
to generate value.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.942
They might be right or
they might be wrong.

00:23:00.942 --> 00:23:03.170
But you might
actually still end up

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.660
with something that's kind of--

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.245
as-- did Catalina say it?

00:23:09.245 --> 00:23:10.620
I can't remember
now who said it,

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.310
but they also said
they gave a timescale.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.620
A short term value
might be predominantly--

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.360
Kelly did, sorry-- three
to five years away.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.600
How to capture value.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.550
Be pragmatic and
skeptical, but you

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.458
need to go down to
a granular level.

00:23:30.458 --> 00:23:32.000
And that's also what
I'm going to ask

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.460
you to do in the
final paper, is really

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.640
to challenge yourself,
challenge your group

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.400
to go down to the granular
level and say, wait,

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.040
what transactions
are we actually going

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.990
to change the flow?

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.050
What ledger system
might we shift?

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.750
And even though it's
the back office--

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.640
and to some people,
you might say, oh,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.280
my god, that's kind of the
boring side of business.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.200
But that's really what
blockchain is about.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.920
It's a database and ledger
management system also.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.130
And to be successful,
you have to get down

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.960
to that granular level
and figure it out

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.820
in terms of whatever
that current ecosystem is

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.715
or the regulatory system.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.390
They said it's particularly
valuable in low trust

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.070
environments.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.380
And that could be
where currently we

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.040
can't trade directly and you've
created a new way to do peer

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.150
to peer, or where
there's not currently

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.150
a central intermediary.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.290
You can go right at it.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.260
You could be like this
bold group that says,

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.940
I want to take on Transunion,
I want to take on Equifax.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.110
That's something which is a
central intermediary right now.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.880
But it is correct, we're
not really trading directly.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:01.790
It's not like when I walk into
the auto shop or to buy a car

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.280
and I'm going to take a loan
out that I can transact.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.470
They want to validate that I
can pay back that darn loan.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:10.880
Yes?

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.220
AUDIENCE: Just two points,
particularly the fact where

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.075
your--

00:25:15.075 --> 00:25:16.810
well, you can't
trade directly now,

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.780
but there's a lot
of trade happening

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.310
where you don't have
an intermediary,

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.825
but some sort of
intermediary would help.

00:25:23.825 --> 00:25:26.723
I couldn't help but think
of ag markets in very--

00:25:26.723 --> 00:25:28.765
GARY GENSLER: You're saying
ag, like agriculture?

00:25:28.765 --> 00:25:32.780
AUDIENCE: Agriculture markets in
very remote parts of the world,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.740
where actually being networked.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.320
And precisely, there's no trust.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.210
That kind of environment exists.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:44.190
So a good use case for
that, extreme remote parts

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.640
of the world where internet
is there, but not necessarily

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.087
financial institutions or
regulatory environments.

00:25:50.087 --> 00:25:50.920
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.310
And there are many parts,
particularly in the third world

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.870
that are still unbanked.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:59.040
I've said this statistic before,
but the World Bank report

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.310
on banking in 2017, half
of sub-Saharan African

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.650
was still unbanked.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.280
But half of that half
has mobile phones.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.400
So it's just-- those gaps might
change, but then it will move.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.400
Yes, they might have
a banking account,

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.280
but it would be not
something they can really

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.970
do with agriculture.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.765
So two opportunities--
and I'm going

00:26:26.765 --> 00:26:28.690
to come to the
question-- is like,

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.180
do you go head-on against
a central intermediary

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.220
and use this technology
to do it better?

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.658
[PHONE RINGING]

00:26:34.658 --> 00:26:35.200
Look at that.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.310
I should turn this off.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.400
Head-on against a
central intermediary?

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.020
Or some market structure
that has no really core

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:52.420
intermediary, but you can
build a better trustless

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.700
peer to peer network?

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] that's

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.390
when it comes to
private permission.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:04.290
Architectural blockchain,
it's highly likely

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.630
to be more scalable.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.480
Why is that?

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.510
GARY GENSLER: Highly likely
to be more scalable, yes.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:16.600
So permissioned blockchains,
they've made a trade-off.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.570
So Nakamoto's paper comes out.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.970
For a few years, people
don't really notice it.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.830
But then it starts
to get some lift

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:31.030
and folks are looking
at it in 2013 to 2015.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.120
And the financial industry
starts to think about this

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.928
and says, this actually
is pretty interesting.

00:27:37.928 --> 00:27:39.470
We're not sure what
it's going to do,

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.960
but we're pretty interested.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.870
And they get attracted to
it because it might be a way

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.050
to move data around, it might
be able to literally lower

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.720
the costs of the back office.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.220
Many banks keeping the
same set of records--

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.910
I have an equity
trading business,

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.430
you have an equity
trading business.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.880
We both have to confirm
and correct those records.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.050
But we keep full databases.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.410
What they found
attractive was real.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.320
But then remember,
Bitcoin can only

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.560
do seven transactions a second.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:22.610
So all of those challenges of
scalability, privacy, security

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.350
led them to think
about, was there

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.380
a way that we could
literally toss

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.490
some of the technical
things over the side?

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.100
And most of them thought, we
don't need a native token.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.260
We don't need an
incentive structure.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.490
And if we limit the number
of nodes in the network,

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.650
we can increase
scalability and we

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.740
can get rid of proof of work.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:53.940
So my narrative
might not matter,

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.440
but it's important
to understand it.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.800
The permissionless thing comes
along, and then they say,

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.850
it's not scalable.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.140
What can we toss overboard
and make it scalable?

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.910
And what they tossed overboard--

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.410
they didn't even feel they
needed the native token,

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:12.270
and they tossed overboard
proof of work, consensus,

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.070
and had a club deal.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.920
In the Australian
stock exchange example,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.990
they might only have
two or three nodes.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.090
But in some of these,
there's 15 or 20.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.640
So why is it more scalable?

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:30.290
Fewer nodes and much more
efficient consensus mechanisms.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.630
But the trade-off is
you better damn well

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.300
trust now those 15 or 20 nodes.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.400
And when we talk
about 51% attacks,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.270
you could revise a whole
permissioned blockchain

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:46.480
if those 15 parties wanted to.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.340
Now, some people say, well, you
could just do a hash function.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.040
Remember that whole hashing.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.280
You could do a hash function of
a whole permissioned blockchain

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.650
once a day, once a
week, once an hour

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.400
and store it somewhere else.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.620
In fact, you could store the
hash of all of that on Bitcoin.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.570
You could use a
ledger like Bitcoin

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.360
and just store it there.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.385
So there's some feedback loops.

00:30:10.385 --> 00:30:11.010
Does that help?

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.800
Give you a sense?

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.920
AUDIENCE: I was also just
going to build on that.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.790
So the power of a
permissioned blockchain

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:22.450
is that, unlike Ethereum or
Bitcoin, it's not public.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.055
So there is no public ledger.

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:26.530
You can make it public,
but it's permissioned, not

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.400
permissionless.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.490
Because you need to have trusted
entities in this network.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.670
So this can also
be, you could say,

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:39.670
a feature, not a bug
when it comes to scaling.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.780
Because essentially,
you control the scale.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.570
So you control these nodes.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.060
And then like
mentioned, these nodes

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.120
are only relevant
because they are

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.600
trusted pieces of this puzzle.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.450
Yeah.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.760
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.680
I think it's easier
to get scale,

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.780
but there is not a
large enough market

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.080
to actually make
it scale or make

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.990
it reach to the critical mass.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:15.220
GARY GENSLER: So are you
worried that there's not

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.660
enough to get to
the critical mass?

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.510
Now, I'm not sure--

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:27.620
so a permissionless blockchain
and a permissioned blockchain

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.380
both can be open
to public users.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:36.350
You can have millions of people
use a permissioned blockchain,

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:41.290
but only 15 have the right
to amend the records.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.490
So one might think
of who has a right

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:46.760
to read it, who has a
right to write on it.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.950
Read, write.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:54.560
But also, absent even that,
it might provide a service,

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.920
like file sharing
or some service.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.870
There might even be
a third list of who

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.670
has a right to use the service.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.070
Now, usually to use a
service, you actually

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.180
have to read the data.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:10.057
But you could partition and say,
how much can be read as well.

00:32:10.057 --> 00:32:11.640
Yes, and remind me
of your first name.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:11.950
I'm sorry.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:12.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:13.190
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.815
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.570
I really appreciate
your perspective

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.213
from how you
envision [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:22.213 --> 00:32:23.130
permissioned projects.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.630
GARY GENSLER: The
pathway, you said?

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in
terms of its relationship with

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.640
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:35.040
Do you think it
would pave the way

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.350
towards the true
decentralization eventually?

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:45.680
Or you were just [INAUDIBLE]
Or you would just

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.240
become irrelevant just as the
intranet compared to internet.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.660
GARY GENSLER: So [INAUDIBLE]
question is unanswerable,

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.860
but I'll try to give my opinion
in 2018, and then we'll see.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:03.120
And it's being recorded,
so we'll see how I'll do.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.910
But the question
really is, what's

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.760
the relationship for
permissioned and permissionless

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.680
blockchains?

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.080
And what is it going
to be longer term?

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.790
I think today in 2018, because
of the scalability issues

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.040
and some of the
privacy and security

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.440
issues, the dominant place
that the investment will

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.350
be is on the permissioned
side, especially

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.710
with what's called enterprise
applications, the banks,

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.600
the large institutions.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.580
There's not enough scalability
because 1,000 users a day

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.940
or 1,500 users a
day on the big apps

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.100
right now on the Ethereum
network, that's just not

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:50.390
enough beyond gaming sites
and some small hobbyist type

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.990
things, like CryptoKitties.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.390
It's fun, it's
interesting, but it's not

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.111
truly scalable to 7 billion
people living around the globe.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.270
But I wouldn't-- and I've
said this to some IBM folks.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:13.000
And they have 1,000 people at
IBM in the hyper ledger team.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.400
Anybody who is a
blockchain minimalist--

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.002
you haven't heard this number?

00:34:17.002 --> 00:34:18.556
AUDIENCE: I've heard 2,500.

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:19.389
GARY GENSLER: 2,500?

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.889
All right.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:22.000
So it's more than I thought.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.260
So 1,000 to 2,500.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.260
I knew it was more than 1,000.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.969
IBM is throwing a
lot of money there.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:32.820
Now, they might be doing
that to protect their risk.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.150
They might be investing even
if all those 1,000 people

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.850
ultimately produce nothing.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:43.050
But I think that five years from
now or seven years from now,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.670
the gap will close.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:48.219
I think that permissionless
systems will always

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:52.270
have a lot of challenge about
governance, collective action.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.300
How you have collective
action is not just

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.800
a matter of technical and
coding and smart scientist

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.995
at MIT and elsewhere.

00:35:02.995 --> 00:35:04.870
I think that's going to
still be a challenge,

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.080
and there will be trade-offs.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.240
So it might be
that they coexist,

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.820
but I think the gap will close.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.150
And you said, well, will it
be like the intranet went away

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.410
and the internet was there.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.870
There are some people
that believe that.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.820
And that might be--

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.930
I'm probably not there.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.000
I'm probably not
all the way there.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.790
But I think when
the gap closes, some

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.940
of these permissioned systems
will not be as necessary.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.800
Zero knowledge
proofs, other ways

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.190
that come along that
make it more usable.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.352
Yes, Zann.

00:35:36.352 --> 00:35:37.560
AUDIENCE: Totally understood.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.370
I'm a little bit skeptical on
the permissioned blockchains.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.900
One of the--

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.280
GARY GENSLER: Are
you skeptical--

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.660
if I can interrupt you--

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.150
and thus it moves you over
to traditional databases?

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.270
Or skeptical and you're moved
over to permissionless open?

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.420
So I don't know, which
way is it pushing you?

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.920
AUDIENCE: Depending
on the use case.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.510
For enterprises, I think
traditional databases

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.230
for the enterprise use case.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.790
Reading here, this
line killed me.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.970
It said, "Accenture developed
immutable blockchain

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.890
in which the content
of individual blocks

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.440
can be modified."

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.040
It's a ridiculous statement
considering the definition

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.680
of blockchain is anti--

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.310
this is the antithesis
of basically--

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.143
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:22.110
So Accenture created an
immutable blockchain that

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:27.300
isn't immutable, is what you're
saying, it can be amended.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.290
So it's a backdoor I can change.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:35.700
And yet, the economics of it
is that a lot of times, people

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.830
do want a backdoor.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.580
And the challenges-- and these
are the weaknesses as well,

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.800
as Nouriel Roubini says.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.140
Why would you create a
system where if you forget

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.840
your private key,
lose your private key,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.110
or the cave collapses-- that
you're hiding the private key

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.960
in a cave and maybe it floods--

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.340
that you've lost your assets?

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.548
Wouldn't you want a backdoor?

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.120
But I respect-- you would say
this isn't even a blockchain.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.670
I'm trying to teach this
class in a little bit

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:12.690
neutral between permissionless
and permissioned blockchains.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:14.640
But you need
something to get out

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.723
of the traditional databases.

00:37:16.723 --> 00:37:19.140
And I've chosen, at least for
purposes of this class, that

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.120
means you've got to
have an append-only log,

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.430
you have to have time stamping.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.690
So the basis of multiple
people writing to the ledger,

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.480
even if it's only three or five.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.105
But these are not
well-defined vocabulary terms.

00:37:35.105 --> 00:37:35.605
Alin.

00:37:35.605 --> 00:37:37.605
AUDIENCE: This is why we
should stop using them.

00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:39.810
And this is a
perfect opportunity

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.930
to actually talk about
append-only ledgers

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.430
because that's
actually meaningful--

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.555
a meaningful notion that's
been studied in computer

00:37:45.555 --> 00:37:46.830
science for decades.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.630
Or consensus
algorithms, which is

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.640
another meaningful notion
studied in computer

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.870
science for decades.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:56.550
And consensus algorithms on
append-only ledgers, sometimes

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.633
referred to colloquially
as blockchain,

00:37:58.633 --> 00:38:01.050
and then we would know what
are we actually talking about.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.203
If we--

00:38:02.203 --> 00:38:03.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.790
GARY GENSLER: Well,
I will try to help.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.370
But we're only 80 people,
and there is a lot

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.960
of people using these terms.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.150
And when you go outside
of this class or even

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.900
when you read an open
letter to Jamie Dimon--

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:23.580
of the somewhere between 25
and 50 readings you had so far

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.760
this semester, they've
used the word blockchain

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.720
in multiple ways.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.040
I'm agreeing with you.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.500
You're just asking me not to
ever use the word blockchain

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.000
again?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.677
GARY GENSLER: Oh, my god.

00:38:34.677 --> 00:38:36.510
And he's sitting in the
center of the class.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.210
Let's keep going.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.280
So we're going to study these.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.750
This is just this list
that we've talked about.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.580
But in Act Three, we're going
to come to it after SIP week

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:51.150
and start to go through
venture capital payment systems

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.670
and so forth.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.420
It might be some of
what you're picking up

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.630
for the final projects.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:02.677
But here-- and I stress the
word, potential use cases.

00:39:02.677 --> 00:39:03.510
Will these all work?

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.640
Will they be places?

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:10.210
In the non-financial space,
supply chain management

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.480
I put on this list, but
it's kind of financial

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.500
and I wanted to include it.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.510
Digital identity is both within
finance and outside of finance.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.210
Property and asset registries--
you can call it finance,

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:24.810
but I'm not going to
dig into that a lot

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:26.370
in the rest of the semester.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:30.690
Medical records, internet
of things, and so forth.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.250
This isn't going
to be exhaustive.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:38.520
If you come on Tuesday, October
30, to the Bitcoin blockchain

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.600
dinner that Simon
Johnson sponsors,

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.080
we'll have somebody doing
election and voting.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.520
So there's a lot of other
interesting applications.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.130
I tend to be a little
doubtful about the voting

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:53.640
because I think official sector
and governments want something

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.520
so centralized in that.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:01.470
But maybe it will be
more decentralized.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:04.350
Maybe it's append-only
without a consensus.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.980
McKinsey, they broke it
down into six buckets.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:15.230
They had the record keeping
and the transaction-based.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.820
And a lot of these are
the similar buckets.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.060
It's just to give a
spur to all of it.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:29.080
So accessing costs and benefits.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.960
So we've talked about
what are the benefits.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.140
These are the questions
that I would be saying.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.110
And some of this was
in the Geneva Report,

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:38.340
but rather than
trying to tease it out

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:46.920
of all of the discussion, here
I would lay out four big buckets

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:51.690
as to how I think about this and
how I might get your feedback.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.700
If you see other
ways to look at this,

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.990
I want to learn from
you all as well.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.280
And when I say four,
this is the first bucket.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.910
Basically, what are the benefits
of using this technology?

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:08.400
Whether it's this idea about
consumer credit or some of you

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.880
have had ideas about
government procurement

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:18.300
or payments, wherever you
are, what is the true benefit?

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.730
You've got to find a pain point.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.530
Every entrepreneur always has
to find a pain point, something

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:27.180
that you can be solving it
for a group of stakeholders.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.200
And who are the stakeholders
you're solving something for?

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.820
Or if you're a company, is
it an internal pain point?

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.160
Pain point is some
constraint to making

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.950
more profits, more revenues.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.500
Or it's a friction,
it's a cost and you

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.780
want to get rid of a cost.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.500
But what is the pain point
for providing a good service

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.120
or making more money?

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.250
How can you capture the value?

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.560
As an entrepreneur,
if you do something

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.230
for eleemosynary
purposes, meaning

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.360
you don't care
about making money,

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.070
I applaud that, that's terrific.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:08.490
You can even hand that in
for your final project.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:12.420
But I'm assuming that you're
going to be thinking like me,

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.550
how do you capture value?

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:18.150
Not only do something, but
also capture that value

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.110
and get a little of somebody
else's economic rents

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.330
if possible.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.518
Thirdly, what are the
competition doing?

00:42:26.518 --> 00:42:27.810
What are the competitors doing?

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.060
Even if they're using
traditional databases,

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:36.580
how are they addressing the
same pain point in anything

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.760
you're doing?

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.030
And why is blockchain
technology--

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.960
or, as Alin would
wish me to say,

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.510
why are append-only longs
and consensus protocols--

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:47.860
what is the answer?

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.640
What is it about append-only
logs with their time

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.480
stamping, with their
final settlement,

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:59.470
the finality of that
settlement, what about that?

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:04.330
Or even a full consensus
protocol and a native currency.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.150
So I'd add a third thing because
permissionless would also

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:10.480
have an incentive system
in a native currency.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.330
So what is it about append-only
logs, consensus protocol,

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.430
and a native currency?

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:17.260
How am I doing?

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.177
AUDIENCE: I love this.

00:43:18.177 --> 00:43:19.510
GARY GENSLER: You love it, yeah.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.094
AUDIENCE: Talk like
this all the time.

00:43:21.094 --> 00:43:22.042
Don't forget it.

00:43:22.042 --> 00:43:24.840
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.028
Oh, my god.

00:43:26.028 --> 00:43:27.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.020
Oh, I need this.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.920
But that's the core.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.790
And I talk about it
being the final project,

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:40.330
but this is going on right
now. $28 billion dollars

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.120
has been raised in
initial coin offerings

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.520
and a few extra billion,
3 or 4 other billion

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.550
has been raised by direct
venture capital in this world,

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:52.090
but call it $30 billion.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:56.020
It's not fully mature,
but it's maturing,

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.840
and a lot of venture capitalists
are saying, wait a minute,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.200
wait a minute, we're
past the hype stage.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.330
What pain point are
you trying to address?

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.010
How are you creating value?

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.360
What are the competitions doing?

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:13.330
And why do you need append-only
logs, consensus protocols,

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.797
and possibly native tokens?

00:44:15.797 --> 00:44:18.130
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
follow-up on that point about

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:18.755
the Accenture--

00:44:18.755 --> 00:44:20.463
GARY GENSLER: You're
not going to tell me

00:44:20.463 --> 00:44:21.640
how to define something?

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.245
All right, Kelly.

00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:27.612
AUDIENCE: The Accenture thing
he was talking about from the--

00:44:27.612 --> 00:44:29.810
GARY GENSLER: It's
immutable but amendable.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:30.550
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.380
So we ask ourselves
the question--

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.602
that seems a little bit--

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.020
it defeats the purpose, right?

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:44.090
So I then ask myself, what value
is being created by doing that?

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:50.840
If it's not necessarily
for their customers,

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.863
where is the
internal value lying?

00:44:53.863 --> 00:44:56.030
GARY GENSLER: I don't know
what the application was.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:45:07.240
But I think that in every
application that we find,

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.580
not just in blockchain
but in other applications,

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.900
you have to ask absolute
final settlement.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.690
If you can never amend it,
if it is truly immutable,

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.810
what cost does that also make?

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:25.880
I assume that in
this application

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.650
that was too great
a cost for them

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:29.960
and they wanted
a backdoor, a way

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.160
to amend that which was
supposed to be immutable.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.020
Again, I don't know
that application.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.430
But that is one of the--

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.410
I think it's a
feature of blockchain.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.390
But it's both a
feature and, to some,

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:45.160
a bug that you cannot
amend something.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.210
It says that one
of the benefits was

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:51.160
that it allowed different
entities involved

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.630
to draw on the same record.

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.480
So yeah, of course, I can
see where that's valuable.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.708
But then it also
begs the question,

00:45:57.708 --> 00:45:59.500
if you want to change
it, then why not just

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.170
use a traditional database?

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:05.450
GARY GENSLER: Vitalik
Buterin in 2016

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:11.950
helped when an organization
called DAO, the DAO--

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:15.430
is it Decentralized
Autonomous Organization?

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.570
Thank you for those who--

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.780
it was one of the largest at
the time initial coin offerings.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:24.490
It raised about $160 US million.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:29.330
And very quickly, right
in the smart contract--

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:31.240
it wasn't in the
base Ethereum layer,

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.970
but I believe it was in
the smart contract on top,

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:37.900
somebody saw what has
later been called a bug.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.820
I don't know if
it's truly a bug.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.730
It was programmed
in, in a sense,

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:45.790
but there was a way that they
could see how to get in there.

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.630
And they took about a
third of the tokens,

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.550
so the equivalent of
about $50 million.

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.110
But the way the
programming worked,

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:57.340
there was about two weeks before
it actually was truly final.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:01.780
It was something in the code
also, and that wasn't a bug.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:06.130
And the whole Ethereum
community was debating it.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:10.130
And Vitalik Buterin said,
no, we can't let this happen.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.880
So in a sense,
they big footed it.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.130
They almost did what Essentia.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:16.900
Now, he might say,
no, actually, it

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:22.000
was right at the 11th
hour and 59th minute

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.340
because there was this
10-day or two-week period.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.570
But they basically, Vitalik
Buterin even did kind of what

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:30.492
Essentia did at that moment.

00:47:30.492 --> 00:47:32.034
AUDIENCE: They forked
it then, right?

00:47:34.587 --> 00:47:35.920
GARY GENSLER: I don't even know.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.160
Was it a technical fork
because of how they did it?

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.232
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:41.690
GARY GENSLER: Right
at that moment.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.372
AUDIENCE: Ethereum classic
still has the DAO--

00:47:44.372 --> 00:47:46.510
GARY GENSLER: The
stolen $50 million

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.200
or whatever, the
number of tokens.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.590
So that led to the fork.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:56.280
The majority of the
community went with Vitalik

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:00.000
rather than what
the fork happened.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.320
So how immutable is immutable
if there's a broad consensus?

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.440
Now that's the
backdoor, in a sense.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.690
Second-- was there another hand?

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:13.200
I'm sorry, Brodish.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.220
AUDIENCE: I think
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.340
GARY GENSLER: To address
Kelly's and Zann's.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.117
AUDIENCE: And the
word blockchain.

00:48:21.117 --> 00:48:22.700
GARY GENSLER: And
the word blockchain.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.660
All right.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.300
AUDIENCE: So I think when people
are talking about blockchain

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.460
as a term, they're
essentially referring

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.060
to a set of potential
benefits of this technology.

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.530
And some of them can be relevant
for a particular use case.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:36.405
Some of them might
[INAUDIBLE],, some of them

00:48:36.405 --> 00:48:40.260
might actually [INAUDIBLE]
for that particular use case.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.530
So the way it can
be thought of is

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:45.670
that we have an umbrella term
which talks about referring

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:46.940
potential benefits.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.740
We take what is
[? referred ?] from that.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.430
It could be append-only, it
could be not append-only,

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:53.510
it could be consensus,
it could be permission,

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:54.740
permissionless, whatever.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.690
And then we cannot calibrate
with them and create a solution

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:00.950
which is applicable for the
particular use case that I want

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.110
to look at.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.810
That is why even if
it is not immutable,

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.940
it is still a potential
use of blockchain,

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.530
from my understanding.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:12.730
Because we are bringing up some
of the benefits of the umbrella

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:13.730
term.

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:19.430
GARY GENSLER: I
think you're correct,

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:23.420
but I'm not going to go all
the way to where you are.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.420
I think you're correct
that, broadly speaking,

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:31.280
many people are using
this term to promote

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:34.130
their own innovation, the
innovation of their colleagues,

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.050
and so forth.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:39.120
And yet, some want a
backdoor, like Essentia,

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.680
and make it less immutable.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.220
And so all of a sudden,
if it has a big backdoor

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.990
and you can amend, is it really
an append-only log any longer?

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:52.850
What I do want to say is, in
this class, I am going to say,

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.770
anything you're working
on for your final paper,

00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:00.430
it has to be at least a
permissioned or permissionless

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.120
system.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.010
Thus it has to have a--

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.114
what's that?

00:50:04.114 --> 00:50:04.990
AUDIENCE: Not mine.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.530
GARY GENSLER: Not yours?

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:06.680
But you're going to get there.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.230
You're going to
get there, Brodish.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.950
You're going to get there.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:16.720
Since I told you earlier
in the day, get to yes.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:22.150
But if it's a
traditional database,

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:26.020
I'm saying stretch your minds,
try to figure out something.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.910
Even if it's got a
little bit of risk

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:32.230
into it as to how you get
to using append-only logs,

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:36.040
and even in a permissioned
closed loose private consensus,

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.660
but some consensus.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.720
Think about whether
you use a token that

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.720
gets the permissionless.

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.220
Uh-oh.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.310
Eric's going to plead his case.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:48.497
AUDIENCE: I'm just going to try
to completely reconcile this.

00:50:48.497 --> 00:50:50.330
GARY GENSLER: And then
I need to keep going.

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:53.697
Those two apparently
divergent points--

00:50:53.697 --> 00:50:55.280
GARY GENSLER: Right,
Brotish and Alin.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:55.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:58.630
AUDIENCE: I actually
agree with Brotish.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:59.860
AUDIENCE: The point is that--

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.085
GARY GENSLER: That he
might agree with him.

00:51:02.085 --> 00:51:03.460
AUDIENCE: I'm
still in the middle

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.780
because from a technical
standpoint, it's true.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.770
You have append-only log
in a consensus mechanism

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:16.300
that make up the
original use case that

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.693
brought the term blockchain.

00:51:18.693 --> 00:51:20.610
GARY GENSLER: Plus a
native token in that one.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:21.756
AUDIENCE: Yeah, of course.

00:51:21.756 --> 00:51:25.330
[INAUDIBLE] But to the
point, though, what

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:29.410
happens if you want to
change or amend the log?

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:31.000
Then is that really
a blockchain?

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.860
That's exactly the reason
why the term [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.560
later technologies came up.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.570
Because to a certain
purist extent,

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:47.980
it's not an append-only
log because you're actually

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:52.830
updating it from a
purist definition.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.090
That makes sense, of course.

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:58.870
But then the nature of
a distributed database

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:03.640
that's not located
in an intranet

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:09.000
that governs the updates and
whatever changes you make it,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.185
it's the reason that make up
these ledger technologies that

00:52:14.185 --> 00:52:16.750
are blockchain
inspired, if you may.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:23.560
So it's OK, you can say
if you amend the log,

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.830
then it's not blockchain.

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:28.420
Right, but it's DLT, and the
DLT is blockchain inspired.

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.078
So we can keep everything
in the neighborhood.

00:52:32.078 --> 00:52:34.120
GARY GENSLER: We're going
to keep this discussion

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.170
and debate going.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:37.660
And we're probably
not all that far off.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.370
It's not about
vocabulary, it's also

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:44.050
about I'm trying to spur you all
to get to yes, even if you're

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.550
a minimalist.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:49.360
Think about some project that
uses the essence of this,

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.790
and not just inspired.

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:56.275
So then what are the specifics
of this append-only log

00:52:56.275 --> 00:53:01.930
and consensus use case
or blockchain use case?

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:04.970
So what cost of
verification or networking

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:07.060
are you actually reducing?

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.522
Back to Catalini's work
about verification cost

00:53:10.522 --> 00:53:12.730
and networking costs that
we talked about on Tuesday.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:16.210
What is that cost you're
actually reducing?

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:18.640
Which transactions
need to be recorded?

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.800
What accounts or
transactions, you might say,

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.070
need to be recorded on this log?

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.260
What stakeholders need
to be able to write?

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.760
If there's only one stakeholder
that needs to update something,

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.860
I'm not really entirely
sure that you'd

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:36.280
be in this distributed
decentralized place.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:41.610
So I list these questions
that weren't directly

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.620
in the readings, but
I list these questions

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:48.030
to say this is a way to start
to get your mind around where

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:52.230
this technology,
however we label it,

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.210
this technology can help.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.630
In essence, does it lower cost
of verification and networking?

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:58.878
And if so, which ones?

00:53:58.878 --> 00:54:00.420
Which ones are you
trying to address?

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:03.360
Which ones are you trying
to dig and basically create

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.280
value for your startup?

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.640
What transactions or accounts
are you trying to record?

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.010
Transactions, like
changing property rights

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:15.340
or moving around birth
records or land records

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.810
or supply chain.

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:18.640
But where's that?

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.150
Which stakeholders actually need
to write to this distributed

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.337
ledger?

00:54:23.337 --> 00:54:24.670
Because if it's only one party--

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:29.230
I'm still trying to get my head
around why the Australian Stock

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:31.556
Exchange really
needs it, but OK.

00:54:31.556 --> 00:54:35.920
What is it that
multiple parties need

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:41.710
to write to this shared
collective state of what

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:43.150
is there?

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:46.210
And then the last one is
also terribly important,

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:49.180
is, what's the customer
user interface?

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:53.710
And a lot of challenges
are basically like,

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.240
currently we're not
in a place where

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.090
a lot of blockchain
applications are distributed,

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.800
applications have great
customer user interfaces.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:05.950
But that as well.

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:08.050
Then what are the cost
of the transitions?

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:10.512
Akira mentioned this
from the Geneva Report

00:55:10.512 --> 00:55:11.470
and the other readings.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:13.900
But what are the
costs and challenges?

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.840
Well, of course, we still
have a bunch of scalability

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.950
and performance issues.

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:21.040
We have the privacy
issues and coordination.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.620
I'm not trying to hold us
all to that, by the way,

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.560
for your final projects.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.380
If we're not going to get to
scalability for five or seven

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.120
years, I'm not
going to say, well,

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.600
then you all have to write
about permissioned systems.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.290
No.

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:41.080
I'm OK if you say,
well, this is a pilot

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.610
and somebody else
is going to solve

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:47.020
through layer two or
zk-SNARKs or something,

00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:49.730
these other things.

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:52.390
But I'd like you to
at least identify

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.620
what are the issues
of scalability,

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:57.910
performance, privacy, security,
those issues that might

00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:00.650
hold your implementation out.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:02.470
Can a permissioned
blockchain adequately

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:06.000
addresses whatever
the use case is?

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.910
And how can you actually
jump start broad adoption?

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:12.820
That's your network challenges.

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.340
How, when you start Uber,
can you get a lot of people

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.750
to use your Uber app?

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:21.280
But in this case, if I can
use that consumer credit--

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:25.270
I thought the consumer credit
idea was really a neat one.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:28.060
Maybe it could go right at the
heart of a lot of market power.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.525
But now, how do you get
all the auto dealers,

00:56:30.525 --> 00:56:31.900
how do you get
all the employers,

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.410
how do you get the
banks to actually say,

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:40.990
I want to get rid of First
Union and I want the Blockchain

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:45.170
and Money final project team's--

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:48.920
and by the way, just replacing
one central monopolist

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.770
with another central monopolist,
a lot of commercial banks

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:54.367
aren't terribly
excited about that.

00:56:54.367 --> 00:56:56.450
Maybe you're going to have
to give some ownership.

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:58.700
Maybe you'll have to give
50% of your ownership

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.940
to the 20 banks that
are now a part of this.

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.940
There are other ways to
build incentive systems.

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.700
Maybe you put a
native token in there

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.150
and you give them
the native token.

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:13.520
So there may be
other incentive ways

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:16.730
to beat the current monopolist.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.250
But having been around
commercial banks

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:29.042
for a long time, they
really are looking for ways

00:57:29.042 --> 00:57:32.400
to replace their aggregators
and their back office,

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:37.250
whether it's clearing,
settlement, exchanges, credit

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:38.580
agencies.

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.000
But they are deeply
understanding--

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.630
because they are pretty
ambitious and very

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:46.970
good at making money
as well, they deeply

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:50.330
understand that every idea
that's pitched to them

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:53.660
is somebody who
currently is small

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:57.920
but wants to get big
and gain market power.

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.350
So they're also always
thinking about how

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:04.610
to ensure that there's
a check to slow down

00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:08.040
your startup from gaining
market power 5, 10,

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.080
and 15 years from now.

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.810
They don't want you to be
the next Clearinghouse,

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:15.740
like the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange or Intercontinental

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.250
Exchange.

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:20.960
They don't want you to be the
next central node of market

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.070
power.

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:23.840
So you might share
some of that with them,

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:27.370
or you might find
an incentive system.

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.450
And then what are the net?

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:34.130
So key questions for companies
designing blockchains.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:38.090
This is something from MIT's
own Sloan Management Review.

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:39.950
It was not a required
reading, but I

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:42.290
thought it was a nice
little way to do it.

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:43.442
What are you trying to do?

00:58:43.442 --> 00:58:44.900
Are you trying to
record something?

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.567
Track something?

00:58:45.567 --> 00:58:46.430
Verify something?

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:47.390
Aggregate something?

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:51.050
This was in the Fall MIT Review.

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:53.070
What value do you
want to capture?

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:55.070
Literally, here's a
list of the things

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:56.970
you might want to capture.

00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:58.310
Is it about contracts?

00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:59.870
Is it about permissioned?

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:04.850
What is the value we're trying
to capture and for whom?

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:08.100
Obviously, is it for suppliers
or customers and so forth?

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:11.750
So it's another slice by
thoughtful people, MIT.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:18.410
That's a link to the reading
if you do want to read it.

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:22.540
It was a well-written
five page article.

00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:26.180
I even held back on one reading.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:30.973
So the benefits of blockchain--
we reviewed this last Tuesday,

00:59:30.973 --> 00:59:32.640
so I'm not going to
go through it again.

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.970
But again, as you're
thinking about this

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.090
and thinking about which
use cases and so forth,

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:39.250
think of these costs
of verification.

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:42.440
Which of these are you
really trying to hit?

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.610
Or is it networking?

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.190
And I changed the
networking a little bit,

00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:51.580
but a token incentive system,
which could be like the skins,

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.770
rewards, and affinity,
identity could help

00:59:53.770 --> 00:59:56.680
you start it up or operate it.

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.250
Or it could be
like CryptoKitties,

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:02.710
where it's like a collectible.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.600
So that's another
way that you have

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.250
token economics floating in.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.210
So this you've seen.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.860
I've flipped it
around, but basically,

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.600
do you use a
traditional database?

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.790
Do you think about a
private blockchain?

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:22.280
Do you think about
a public blockchain?

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.980
If you're over here, I really
ask you, Brodish, you've

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.490
got to get to yes.

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:29.933
You've got to get to here.

01:00:29.933 --> 01:00:31.600
You wouldn't want me
to just be teaching

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.390
a traditional database, how do
you build something in Sloan,

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:35.110
right?

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:36.910
This is blockchained money.

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:41.230
Or as Alin wants me to relabel
it, append-only logs, consensus

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:42.971
protocols, and money.

01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:43.893
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:43.893 --> 01:00:45.280
AUDIENCE: And a native currency.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.240
GARY GENSLER: And
a native currency.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.010
But how many of
you would sign up?

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:49.615
Would you recommend
that I list it

01:00:49.615 --> 01:00:52.982
in the course catalog that
way for next September?

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.220
AUDIENCE: No.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.540
GARY GENSLER: Really?

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.310
No, not really.

01:00:57.310 --> 01:00:58.000
All right.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.640
But if you want to really
juice, get to here.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.280
Put an append-only log
in there and some even

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.610
private permissioned system.

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:11.800
Or be bold.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.720
Try to get all the way to there.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.150
Don't stay there, please.

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.650
All right.

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:18.460
I've made my point.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:19.917
James.

01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:20.500
Where are you?

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.110
Are you there or there?

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:24.491
AUDIENCE: I think I'm in the
middle, private blockchain.

01:01:24.491 --> 01:01:25.574
GARY GENSLER: Ah, come on.

01:01:25.574 --> 01:01:26.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:27.970
GARY GENSLER: All right.

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:30.810
Good.

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:35.030
Yeah, but they're going
to get at least to there.

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:38.222
They're not staying there,
they want to get a good grade.

01:01:38.222 --> 01:01:40.530
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.260
No, no.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.670
Really, this is going to be fun.

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:44.020
Listen, I get it.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.273
It's not just like any
Sloan class, where you

01:01:46.273 --> 01:01:47.440
have a final and everything.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.000
I've given you a hard test.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.850
There's $30 billion chasing
around to try to find uses.

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:56.680
There's thousands-- 2,500 at IBM
or whatever-- there's thousands

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.880
of people trying to do this.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.500
And there's no really true
market-wide applications

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.330
right now.

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:09.100
But that's the nature of what
we're doing here together.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.080
And I'm not asking
that somebody actually

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.720
be able to go raise money
and actually start it.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.350
You don't have to code
it, except for you, Alin.

01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:19.670
But you don't have to
actually code this thing.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:24.340
But I'm really looking
for your business savvy,

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:28.150
and it's more about
critical reasoning skills.

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:32.530
And these four or five
pages, pull it off of Canvas

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:34.960
and think about it,
think about how it fits

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.500
in with your projects or not.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.440
Yes?

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.570
AUDIENCE: Given that-- well,
the question in previous slides

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:44.590
are helpful.

01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:48.820
But I still find it's hard to
decide whether we should really

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.900
use blockchain
database [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.310
traditional database.

01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:58.820
So is there a non-technical
model or framework that we can

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.040
[INAUDIBLE] between those two?

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.100
GARY GENSLER: I think of it--

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:10.720
I apologize if to go back to
the slides, so I'll try not to.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.470
But I think about it
as, are you moving

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.760
around something of value?

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.590
Do you need multiple
people to be

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:25.020
able to help in that network?

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.160
Because it's peer to peer.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.350
If it were the 80 or
90 of us in this room,

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:30.540
you might be just
there right now,

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.850
that there's a benefit
of that peer to peer

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:35.100
movement of something of value.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.500
Or frankly, even back
to this, if there's

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.760
a lot of economic rents.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.910
If there's market power
in this, if there's

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:50.650
big market power and somebody
is just collecting lots,

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.710
that might be your opportunity
because this is the technology

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:55.780
that can get you there.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.990
And you might say,
well, I don't absolutely

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:02.950
have to have an append-only
consensus native currency

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:07.680
type of technology, but it's
how I get to peer to peer.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.200
So it might be
that that's the way

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.660
that I'm going to
disrupt the party

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.640
with the big economic rents.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.580
Like the letter to
Jamie Dimon, if there's

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.628
a bunch of things
about censorship risk.

01:04:18.628 --> 01:04:21.170
And again, I don't know what
use cases you're thinking about.

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:23.770
But I think if
you don't have one

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:27.910
of these six, the
verification costs,

01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:32.290
it's unlikely you need an
append-only log and consensus

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:34.030
in the whole mechanism.

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:37.630
But I think if you do have
something here, hopefully not

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:40.760
just economic rents
but market power,

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.930
this might be the way you
get underneath it, by having

01:04:43.930 --> 01:04:47.410
a decentralized peer
to peer approach.

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:49.090
So if that helps.

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:53.500
And it could be something that
has no central authority right

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.140
now, no central intermediary,
and it's just how

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.910
to jump start something.

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:59.440
I think in that
circumstance, it's

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.320
more likely you
need a native token.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.370
I think if you're trying
to jump start a network--

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.970
and there's a lot of
collective action reasons

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:10.470
that will still face you.

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:12.630
Some of our colleagues,
Andy Lippman

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:15.780
and others over at the Media
Lab, spent a lot of time

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:18.420
a year, year and a half ago
on a medical records approach

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:22.017
with Beth Israel
Hospital locally here.

01:05:22.017 --> 01:05:23.850
And if Andy were here,
he'd say, but I still

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:25.830
have the collective
action issues.

01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:27.330
How do I get a
bunch of hospitals

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:29.250
and a bunch of
doctors and how do I

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:33.000
get all that collective
action to work together

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.780
to use one database
system, if you wish?

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.090
So I think to get over that
collective action issue,

01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:41.340
you start getting into,
well, this native token

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.596
might be an interesting
way to do that.

01:05:43.596 --> 01:05:44.820
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:48.720
It seemed that Uber satisfied
the things you just mentioned.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720
GARY GENSLER: They did.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:49.990
They did.

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.300
But would they have
done it differently

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.950
if they started in
a different era?

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.550
I don't know.

01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:01.370
It's remarkable that they
took on and just completely

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:05.830
transformed the ride
share business, the taxi

01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:08.890
business, if you wish.

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:11.278
But I'm pretty
confident of this,

01:06:11.278 --> 01:06:12.820
there will be
something that we don't

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:17.530
envision right now that really
transforms the next thing.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:19.682
As my brother said
when he said, it

01:06:19.682 --> 01:06:21.140
might be five and
10 years from now

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.930
and you won't even expect it.

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:26.570
Who would have thought
the internet in the 1990s

01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:30.720
was going to go straight and
transform the taxi business?

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.490
Nobody in the New
York Taxi business

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:36.020
would have envisioned that,
which was one of the things

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.850
that he mentioned.

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:43.360
So why use blockchain
versus traditional database?

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.560
We did that.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.600
I know, you got it got, Brodish?

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.730
Right there?

01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:48.230
OK.

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:50.900
No, I'm having some fun.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:54.850
So the trade-offs we've talked
about, so these are costs.

01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:56.740
This is the cost
of centralization

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.750
versus decentralization.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.340
We've looked at
this slide before.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.520
I think this was an
earlier question.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.590
Over time, I think
what's going to happen

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:11.610
is these graphs might
have different slopes.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:15.180
So it's just like, OK,
what if the slopes change?

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.600
I think that the cost
of decentralization

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.270
are going to come down.

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:27.990
But that's more my
forecasting prognostication.

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:30.720
And then you'll have
more applications

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.660
that feel more comfortable
over using something

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.340
around this space.

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:38.060
Now, I could be wrong and
it could go the other way.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.200
Just saying.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.550
And this would be more of
the minimalist side and says,

01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:44.487
well, you can address some
of those centralization costs

01:07:44.487 --> 01:07:45.820
and it comes down the other way.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.000
So it's just a
visual way to think

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.468
about what will happen
over time with innovation.

01:07:51.468 --> 01:07:53.010
But I think innovation
will pull down

01:07:53.010 --> 01:08:02.300
the slope towards that from
where we are today because

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.670
of the newer technology,
this decentralized

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:08.070
how can we do this.

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:11.850
And I think there will be
more opportunities around it.

01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:12.350
All right.

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:16.130
So on the 30th, we're
going to be talking

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.620
about basically our first area.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.092
We're going to talk
about payments.

01:08:22.092 --> 01:08:23.800
We're going to talk
a lot about payments.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.380
I'm going to take two days
to talk about payments.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:29.710
So we're going to lay
out a lot about what's

01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:33.700
going on in finance outside of
append-only logs and consensus

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.840
protocols and blockchain.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.029
But we're going to have
fun because what we all

01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:40.810
live together.

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.852
And some of you actually
live in these countries.

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:47.290
But whether it's Alipay,
[INAUDIBLE],, and M-Pesa, so

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.810
all these initiatives.

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:55.120
And then how could maybe
blockchain fit into it?

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.020
In terms of the use cases,
these are all those use cases

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:05.290
that we're going to be doing
from October 30 to December 6.

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:08.560
But this gives you a sense,
what I call Act Three.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.359
And we're going to
really be trying

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:14.300
to challenge each other about--

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.420
some weeks, I'm going
to give you a heads up,

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.040
it's going to be a little thin.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.630
I'm going to be
looking for who's

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:22.008
got really good use cases.

01:09:22.008 --> 01:09:24.050
If you have something to
bring into the classroom

01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:26.510
that you're saying,
hey, this reading

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:29.120
list I put together
in late August--

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.250
and by November, it
might be that there's

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.729
somebody that's actually
moved something further.

01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:35.899
So don't be bashful.

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:38.060
Shoot it into me in time
and I'll distribute it

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.740
to the whole class.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:44.479
But in a couple of places,
digital ID, for instance,

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.970
I thought it was thin.

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:50.600
There's the Estonia case,
but it's not really--

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.310
not sure it's a blockchain.

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:58.280
I'm admitting in
advance, some of these

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.810
are a little thin
but still good.

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:05.330
And the readings for the 30th--

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.040
the Federal Reserve
Payment Study really

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.510
shows a bunch of information.

01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:11.893
And you have to read the words,
just look at the few charts.

01:10:11.893 --> 01:10:13.310
But it's going to
give you trends.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:17.180
You're going to really see some
interesting trends in there.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.450
What the best mobile apps are,
and the global payment report,

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:22.640
and things like that.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.450
Any questions on any of that?

01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:28.220
And then what did we talk about?

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.710
Blockchain technology
can address costs

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:33.980
through verification
and networking.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:38.730
The potential use cases--
the devil is in the detail.

01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:41.510
It's true in most
things in life,

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:44.930
but it really is these
natty little details

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.760
about what transactions,
who am I going

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.900
to try to disintermediate, where
am I going to create value,

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:55.100
why use a permissioned
or permissionless

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.060
blockchain rather than
a traditional database,

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:02.750
and really get some value.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:06.380
I think you really have
to address this question,

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:08.600
but I think there's
potential there.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.660
Or why a public blockchain
versus a private?

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:15.110
Is a token going to help
you jump start something?

01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:17.290
And remember, there's two
different types of tokens.

01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:20.070
There's the broad
currency type token.

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.900
That might be Bitcoin, and they
might have won the whole thing,

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.873
or it'll be somebody else, or
there might be two or three.

01:11:25.873 --> 01:11:28.165
I personally don't think
there'll be hundreds of those.

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:32.790
But then there might
be, in essence,

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:37.000
use case-specific tokens.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.550
Right now we have 1,600,
and most will fail.

01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:45.540
So that's it.

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.274
Any other queries or anything?

01:11:49.274 --> 01:11:50.650
Yeah?

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:56.930
AUDIENCE: Once all the bitcoins
are mined in 2040 or 2030--

01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:59.310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:00.880
AUDIENCE: 2040.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:05.280
GARY GENSLER: But by 2040, it's
a very slow inflation curve.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.890
It's probably a
slow inflation curve

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.810
in the middle of the 2030s.

01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:10.430
AUDIENCE: The
incentives, if there

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:14.240
will continue to be
incentives for node operators

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.540
to continue operating
benevolently, if there's

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.530
no further incentives--

01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:24.020
GARY GENSLER: So the question
is, what happens in 20--

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.300
when there's very
few mining rewards?

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:30.590
And the answer is--

01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:31.730
I'm going to have some
fun with you here.

01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:33.313
I'm going to show
you one other thing.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.340
The answer is, yes,
because it's fees.

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:45.860
And the fees in the system--

01:12:49.878 --> 01:12:51.070
I apologize.

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:54.640
It's just one thing that I
want to show you that's fun.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.900
The fees in the system--

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:08.680
so right now you can have
fees, if you remember how

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.290
there are fees in the system.

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:15.280
And instead of having
mining rewards,

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.890
right now there are
very small fees.

01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:20.500
So for every transaction
you put into Bitcoin,

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.190
you can actually say,
instead of taking at exactly

01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:25.890
that the inputs
equal the outputs,

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:30.910
you have inputs greater than the
outputs, and the net is fees.

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:45.640
And what is the case
there is that in 2030

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.010
or something like
that, I think the fees

01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:50.770
will continue to increase,
I think, if this takes off.

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:53.500
The question is,
does it take off?

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.470
So I just had some fun because
this day is an important day

01:13:56.470 --> 01:14:00.070
for me since you met him.

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:04.616
So whom is whom?

01:14:04.616 --> 01:14:07.352
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.390
I sent this picture
to Rob this morning

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:14.237
because today is our birthday.

01:14:14.237 --> 01:14:17.111
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

01:14:18.798 --> 01:14:20.590
AUDIENCE: (SINGING)
Happy birthday to you--

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:21.850
GARY GENSLER: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:22.784
That's all right.

01:14:22.784 --> 01:14:25.840
AUDIENCE: (SINGING)
Happy birthday to you.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.500
GARY GENSLER: No, no, no, no.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:31.000
AUDIENCE: (SINGING) Happy
birthday, dear Gary.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.594
Happy birthday to you.

01:14:35.594 --> 01:14:37.482
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:38.335 --> 01:14:40.806
GARY GENSLER: So who's who?

01:14:40.806 --> 01:14:42.590
AUDIENCE: You're in the white.

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:46.430
GARY GENSLER: White in
striped shirt or not?

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:47.213
OK.

01:14:47.213 --> 01:14:48.575
AUDIENCE: Solid.

01:14:48.575 --> 01:14:49.565
AUDIENCE: Your stripes.

01:14:49.565 --> 01:14:50.565
GARY GENSLER: All right.

01:14:50.565 --> 01:14:54.040
How many striped shirters?

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:54.730
All right.

01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:55.230
All right.

01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:57.820
How many solid shirters?

01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:58.930
Wow.

01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:01.180
So I sent it to
Rob this morning,

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.680
and I sent it to
my three daughters,

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.972
and I sent it to my girlfriend.

01:15:03.972 --> 01:15:06.130
I said, who is this?

01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:07.640
It's split view there, too.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.490
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:13.970
I went with striped shirt,
but Rob said he doesn't know.

01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:15.850
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.640
We were three years old there.

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:26.120
So that's just a
goof around with you.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:26.620
All right.

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:28.620
Thank you all.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.690
We are now considering the
motion of a rigid body.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.360
And we'd like to talk about
kinetic energy of rotation

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.280
and properties of
that rigid body.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.640
Let's consider a
rigid body, and let's

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.440
say that our rigid body is
rotating about an axis passing

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.810
through a point S.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.660
If we look overhead
at our rigid body,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.490
then what we're going to do is
introduce a coordinate system.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.220
So this is our overhead view.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.940
And suppose that we have a
small element of our rigid body

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.300
here, which I'm going
to write as delta m j.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.170
And that's a distance
r j from the center.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.320
Our rigid body has
an angle theta.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.170
And what we'd like to do is
describe a coordinate system,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.600
r hat, theta hat, and k
hat pointing like that.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.310
Now, with this rigid
body that's rotating,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.660
we describe the angular
velocity as the rate

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.230
that the angle is changing
with respect to k hat.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.570
And so we can draw
the vector omega,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.910
and this establishes
our coordinate system

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.640
for our rigid body and a small
element of mass, delta m j.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.220
Now, what we'd
like to consider is

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.810
what does this mass element do?

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.360
Imagine that it's over there.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.310
Because every point
in the rigid body

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.330
has the same angular
velocity, this object

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.030
is going in a circle with
angular velocity omega.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.060
Recall that omega is
perpendicular to the plane

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.050
of motion.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.780
But the object itself
has a velocity,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.700
which I'm going to write v j.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.200
And that velocity vector, v j,
is in the tangential direction.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.009
And it's related to the z
component of our angular

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.560
velocity by the
following relationship--

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.979
it's how far we are
from the center point,

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.180
S, times the z component
of the angular velocity.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.310
And it's pointing in the
tangential direction.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.760
So remember that omega z
is equal to d theta dt.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.070
And this describes
our coordinate system

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.690
for the rigid body.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.917
Now what we'd like to discuss
is the kinetic energy.

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:17.000
And the way we're going
to consider kinetic energy

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.240
is, we're going to sum up
the rotational kinetic energy

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.340
of every single mass element.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.710
So we begin by writing
k j rotational.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.000
And we know that that is just
1/2 times the mass element

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.520
times the velocity of
that element squared.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.380
Now we can use our relationship
for the tangential velocity

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.110
element related to
the angular velocity.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:50.630
And we have 1/2 delta m j r j
squared times omega z squared.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.485
Now keep in mind that omega z is
the same for every single mass

00:02:54.485 --> 00:02:57.470
element, but the distance
of the mass elements

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.690
are all different by r j.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.500
So the total rotational
kinetic energy

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.870
is the sum over j
from 1 to n of, let's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.540
put the 1/2 outside, times
delta m j r j squared.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.430
Now again, recall that every
element has the same omega z.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.350
So I can write parentheses
omega z squared.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.150
And that's our rotational
kinetic energy.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.720
So what we want to do
now is look at the limit

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.270
as our delta m j becomes
very small, because we

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.070
have a continuous body.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.220
And we'll write a
definition, which

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.590
is going to be the
moment of inertia passing

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.400
through this point, S, about
the axis passing through S

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.660
is equal to the limit
as delta m j goes to 0

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.740
or n goes to infinity of this
sum-- delta m j r j squared,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.900
j goes from 1 to n.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.350
Now because this is a limit
for the continuous body,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.700
we'll define it as the
integral over the body

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.580
of a small mass element dm.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.260
That's a distance r squared.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.670
Now here, what is
the meaning of the r?

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.860
For our continuous body
here, if we call this dm

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.790
and we define the distance
from S to the body r-- and now

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.500
I'm going to just put a
little notation in here.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.630
It's the distance from S, the
axis we're calculating about,

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.700
to where the body is dm.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.520
So I'll write S dm.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.700
This is what we call
the moment of inertia

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.620
of a continuous body.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.230
Now again, what's very
important to realize--

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.300
it's a moment about
a particular axis.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:05:01.790
So this is about an axis
passing perpendicular

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:11.750
to the plane of rotation
and through S, point S.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.220
So it's an axis that's
passing perpendicular

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.400
to the plane of rotation
passing through the point S.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.070
And this is what we call the
moment of inertia of a body.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.290
Now, we'll see that the moment
can be expressed in terms

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.950
of other physical quantities.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.930
As the course
develops, you'll see

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.300
two or three more
fundamental relations

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.620
for moment of inertia.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.560
But what we'd like to do now
is summarize our results--

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.380
that the kinetic energy of
rotation is 1/2 for rotation

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.830
about this axis, I'm just to
indicate passing through S,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.890
of I s times omega z squared.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.950
Now keep in mind, because
omega z is a component,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.890
it can be positive,
0, or negative.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.930
But the square is always a
positive definite quantity.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.630
And that's our kinetic
energy of rotation.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.610
Let's contrast that with our
translational kinetic energy.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.800
And we remember there that
was 1/2 times the total mass

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.540
of the object
times v squared cm,

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.520
where we're looking
at all of the objects

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.110
at the center of mass.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.190
And this is the total
mass of the object.

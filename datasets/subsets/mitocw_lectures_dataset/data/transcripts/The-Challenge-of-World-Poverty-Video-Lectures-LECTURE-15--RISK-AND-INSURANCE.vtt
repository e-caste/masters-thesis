00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.960
PROFESSOR: I think at the
beginning of the semester we

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.750
have kind of sketched
out the broad plan.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.900
And the broad plan was to move
kind of progressively from

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.890
what are fundamentally
individual decision making

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.060
problems to thinking about more
problems of the market.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.860
And we're going to try and do
insurance, which is obviously

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.265
something to do with markets.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.095
So here is by way
of background.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.190
You probably remember a few
years ago the world economy

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.440
was in crisis.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.230
It may still be in one.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.430
But now we're told it's not.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.320
So this is a quote from the
president of the World Bank.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.280
He's trying to make the case
that the crisis in 2008, 2009

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.225
was going to be a particular
crisis for the world's poor.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.690
And that's not implausible.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.790
You might imagine that if you
are that much closer to

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.110
survival, you have fewer
resources, then anything that

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.590
goes wrong is likely
to hurt you more.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.515
So that's not an implausible
idea.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.680
I spent a couple of days with a
New York Times reporter, the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.800
New York Times bureau chief
in India, in the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.700
pursuit of this story.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.460
So I was going for something
else, and she

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.840
came along with me.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.160
And she was looking for
people who had--

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.390
this was a part of rural India,
a very poor part of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.440
rural India.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.910
And her whole idea was that
she's going to go there and,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.280
like Zoellick, she was wondering
how these people in

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.400
the villages who go to the
city to work as maybe

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.320
laborers, how they
would be affected

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.440
by this global crisis.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.370
This is the New York Times.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.380
So she wanted to link up what's
happening in poor parts

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.210
in rural India with what's
happening in New York.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.870
So that made perfect sense.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.970
And the problem was that nobody
seemed to know there

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.220
was a crisis.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.140
So she would go and ask people,
so have you heard

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.640
about this?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.870
There's a crisis in the world.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.360
Is that affecting your
job prospects?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.450
And one striking fact was this
was in a part of rural India

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.860
that's pretty backward.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.670
The areas we were were mostly
conservative, mostly families.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.610
A lot of the migrants
had come home for a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.780
bustling religious festival.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.050
So a lot of the migrants
were there.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.324
We could talk to them.

00:03:58.324 --> 00:04:02.671
And to the man, literally to
the man, they said, no.

00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:03.600
What crisis?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.740
There are jobs for anybody
who wants a job.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.020
So we went to the train station
for migrants coming

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.920
back from having lost their
jobs in the cities.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.430
In fact, we found tons of
migrants who were leaving for

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.120
the city on the train.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.986
So basically the story never
got written, and New York

00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:27.410
Times never had this story
because there was never

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.810
anything to be found.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.980
And it was kind of striking how
disjointed these two world

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.810
views were.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.980
Now, that doesn't mean--

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.850
I think it was clear that if you
looked at the data, there

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.670
were people who were
losing jobs.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.590
Some construction projects
had been shut down.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.690
There were certainly some
jobs being lost.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.740
I think the real reason why
this didn't show up in

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:08.190
people's kind of intellectual
map as a very big deal is not

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.290
because some bad things
were not happening.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.130
But it's more that they're used
to having jobs being lost

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.810
and having to find jobs and
things like that as a normal

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.010
part of their life.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.440
In other words, the amount of
risk that they normally bear

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:33.860
is so large relative to our
perception of risk--

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.650
I'll show you some numbers in a
bit-- our perception of risk

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.370
that this was seen as, you
know, normal turnover.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.510
Certainly some jobs were
being-- but you

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.020
find another the job.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.290
And the basic difference came
from, I think, their

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.780
calibration or what is
unreasonable amount of risk.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.270
Our colleague, Rob Townsend who
is an expert on Thailand,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.170
studied the Thai economic
crisis of 1998.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.250
So this was a big deal
in Thailand.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.800
I mean, there was like the Thai
baht I think halved or

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.670
more than half.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.170
I mean, it just grew.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.570
And the whole economy--

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.970
several banks came close
to failing and had

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.860
to be bailed out.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.620
All kinds of bad things
happened.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.460
Rob Howard doesn't
study the banks.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.130
He studies the people
who live in poorer

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.080
parts of northern Thailand.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.170
And he has a panel of
people now for more

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.670
than, I think, 12 years.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.890
But he had a long time he had
been following these people,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:50.870
15 years something.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.080
He's been following the people
for a very long time,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.540
families, and looking at
the economic outcomes.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.010
So every few months, they go
back to the same families and

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.150
measure a bunch of stuff.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.800
And the same families
are maintained

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.140
for a very long time.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.320
It's a unique data
set that he has.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.290
Now, one advantage of that data
set is you can look at

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.440
what happens in the crisis year
relative to what happens

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.420
in other years.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.710
You have a data set of
the same families

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.850
for a very long time.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.290
Just descriptively you may just
ask what changed in the

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.550
crisis year?

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.210
And I think his number, which
he presented this at a

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.810
conference before he came to
MIT-- and I had to be the

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.810
commentator--

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:43.160
the number, in a sense, it
was almost unbelievable

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.370
to think about it.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.230
So he found that 2% of the
variation in their income was

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.200
attributable to the crises.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.455
The 2% of the variation of
income in these families--

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.730
so if you look at a family, his
income varies every year,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.910
every six months.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.590
So you can just look at the
total variation in income.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.610
And then you can attribute
a particular part

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.160
of that to the crisis.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.170
What was extra in a crisis?

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.980
And I think his calculation
was about 2%

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.365
more for the crisis.

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:24.000
The reason I make that point
is not to say that the poor

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.370
are very, very well off, but
the opposite, that their

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:36.669
normal exposure to risk is so
high that this additional

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.390
piece that come from global
crises is an extremely small

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.289
part of it.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.870
I think the way to think about
it is that there's a ton of

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.330
risk that any poor person
bears all the time.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.290
And then there's some stuff that
happens which we think

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.410
are important like what's
happening in New York and the

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.520
important for MIT.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.740
MIT, as soon as the crisis
hit, the first thing that

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.580
happened is that we used to get
free lunch on Mondays and

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.090
Tuesdays and that
was shut down.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.310
So it was very important.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.720
We got some risk from that.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.090
But if you think of these
people, they're not getting

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.820
any free lunches in any case.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.895
And so the amount of uncertainty
that they deal

00:09:19.895 --> 00:09:27.710
with on a day to day basis
dwarfs any uncertainty that

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:36.390
might come from specific
episodes like the Thai banking

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.410
crisis of 1998.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.360
Do you have question?

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.382
Somebody had their hand
up for a moment.

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:45.189
AUDIENCE: Do we have
evidence from other

00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:46.340
places besides Thailand?

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.147
Because, I guess, popularly
speaking, a lot of people talk

00:09:48.147 --> 00:09:52.256
about the loss decades in Latin
America and how bad that

00:09:52.256 --> 00:09:55.707
was, you know, for people's
ability to generate

00:09:55.707 --> 00:09:56.693
livelihoods.

00:09:56.693 --> 00:10:01.130
So I'm just wondering if we
really have a lot of evidence

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.100
that this is really a
broad phenomenon.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.400
PROFESSOR: So I think
there are two parts

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.100
to what you're saying.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.820
Both are important.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.430
One is do we have evidence
from other countries?

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.470
Second is part of the reason
why this population is

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.840
different is that Thailand
is a lot less

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.930
urbanized than Mexico.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:33.370
So many more people in Thailand
operate in the

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.660
traditional underdeveloped
economic mode, which is that

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.110
they are self employed,
they have a farm,

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.360
something like that.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.540
So let me give you a different
example, which is maybe even

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.500
more revealing.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.930
This is taking me a little
further [INAUDIBLE], but it's

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.170
interesting.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.150
So there's a study by one of
our ex students of what

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.490
happened in the Indonesian
crisis of 1998, which happened

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.980
for the same reason.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.850
And there the Indonesian rupiah
devalued by a factor of

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.510
three, which is a huge amount
of devaluation.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.310
So something really
big happened to

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.060
the Indonesian economy.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:28.940
So turns out that the real
incomes of anybody in

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.630
Indonesia who was mainly a rice
farmer went up during

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.500
this crisis.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.960
The reason is that suddenly the

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.645
currency devalued massively.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.740
What happens when the currency
devalues and you're in rice?

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.720
Well, rice is a trade-in good.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.240
Its price goes up relative
to non trade-in goods.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.400
So your hair cut prices don't
go up, but rice prices go up

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.720
because rice is traded.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.130
So these rice farmers actually
were better off in the

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.920
Indonesian crisis than
they were before.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.050
He then looks at, well,
how do they react?

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:12.340
And the thing he's looking at
is people attending Koranic

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.070
reading classes as well
as the outcomes.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.540
And the basic reason he's
interested in them is he

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.780
thinks that this is a social
support mechanism.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.450
Who start attending Koranic
reading classes?

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.410
It's the people who are
not rice farmers.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.860
It's the government employees,
teachers, anybody who has a

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.910
fixed income.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.360
They are the ones who lost.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.530
And then the people who were
farmers, they actually were

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.310
better off.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.630
And they were actually less
likely to attend Koranic

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.620
classes during the crisis.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.400
So in other words, again, a
lot of people in a country

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.740
like Thailand or Indonesia are
basically farming dependent.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.820
And those people have very
different risk patterns from

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.280
the urban employees.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.940
Latin America is
very different.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.180
Latin America is massively
richer also then Indonesia,

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.430
for example.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.140
Peru is three times richer than
Indonesia, per capita

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.810
income, at least in
dollar terms.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:20.000
It's also much more urbanized
with a labor force.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.370
So I'm sure the lost
decade happened.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:26.070
I'm sure that a lot of urban
workers in each of these

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.690
countries gets hurt.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.550
The main point I'm trying to
make here is that there's also

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.460
a whole bunch of people in these
countries who bear a

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.840
huge amount of risk even when
there is nothing happening in

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.120
the world economy.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:47.510
And those are people who are
farmers, who are laborers in

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:57.170
construction, people who
sometimes get a job helping

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.320
out in farms, these kind of
people, landless laborers or

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.140
different kinds.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.610
These people have a very
different risk pattern than

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:10.860
the urban workers who tend to be
the people who are directly

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.050
hurt by big global shocks.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.410
So there was not that there
were people not hurt, it's

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.560
just there were, for many of
the people that [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.090
Rob Townsend was studying, all
kinds of stuff were happening

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.530
in their lives.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.870
These were all farmers.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.420
And lots of them were--

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.420
all kinds of stuff were
happening in their life, many

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.550
of them very bad.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.580
And this was just a small
piece of that big story.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.510
That's the point that I think
is worth emphasizing is that

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.930
there's just much diversity,
and there's so much risk.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.360
So basically what are
the sources of risk?

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.410
I think the biggest single risk
is just being a farmer.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.730
If you're a farmer, you'll
face huge amount of risk.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:00.230
What do you face risk from?

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.170
What's a main source of risk?

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.150
AUDIENCE: Bad harvests.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.790
PROFESSOR: Bad harvests.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.315
How do you get bad harvests?

00:15:07.315 --> 00:15:08.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
rainfall.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:12.640
PROFESSOR: Rainfall, bugs,
you know, locusts.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.060
If you're a farmer, you're used
to dealing with a huge

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.870
amount of risk.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:25.380
I mean, by our standards of the
kind of risk that tenures

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.010
professors face--
of course, maybe

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:31.750
that's an extreme example.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.900
They have a huge amount
of year to year

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.530
variation in income.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:47.200
Even those who don't have
a farm, most of

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.930
them are casual labours.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.500
The poor in most countries,
in poor

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.650
countries, are casual laborers.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.620
Casual laborers meaning they
don't have a contract.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.610
They have a daily job.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:06.650
The typical way you get a job
is in a city you stand at a

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:13.150
street corner and somebody who
needs someone to move boxes

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.150
comes and picks up 50 people
and takes them somewhere.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.770
So it's extraordinarily casual,
meaning at a given

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.510
day, you may not get a job.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:28.990
And many of these people are not
employed more than 15, 16

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.840
days a month.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.320
So this is a very,
very common fact.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.340
And there's lots of
uncertainty there.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.350
Some days, some months you maybe
get unlucky and you just

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.240
got there late or something,
and then

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.250
you missed your chance.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.410
So the amount of uncertainty
that you have if you are kind

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.390
of a casual laborer in a
developing country is huge

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.190
because its the uncertainty of
in any given day you have a

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.315
probability of, let's say,
three out of four

00:16:57.315 --> 00:16:58.770
of getting a job.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.070
And the other days you don't.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.770
And so if you look at daily
income, daily income is

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.280
extraordinarily variable for
most of these people.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.849
And it's just mechanically
almost.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.250
Somebody shows up at that street
corner and, you know,

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.700
they ask you to get on the truck
and go with him, and he

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.480
needs 10 people today
rather than 15.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.770
You don't get a job.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.810
So this is just a core level of
risk in this life, which is

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.990
very different from thinking
about the kind of risk we

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.480
think about most of
the time in a more

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.590
developed country context.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.110
There's no social protection.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.310
The other side of that is
there's no social protection

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.630
or almost no social
protection.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:52.950
So one way to think
about this is--

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.856
this is wage volatility.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.730
This is how much your
wages vary.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.690
And this is not day
to day variation.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:13.770
This is year to year variation
across a set of countries.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.390
This is real wages.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.770
So the poorest country
is Myanmar.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:26.840
And basically you can plot
a line and that line has

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.800
essentially--

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:36.910
if you increase raw GDP by
one, you halve the risk,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.160
something like that.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.370
So this is conditional
on getting a job.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.460
I said the big part of the
uncertainty is you

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.630
just don't get a job.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.890
But then the real wages are
extremely unstable as well.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.170
Part of the reason they're
unstable comes from this other

00:18:55.170 --> 00:19:00.300
fact, which is this.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.740
This is food prices.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:07.540
And if you spend 60% of your
income on food, food prices

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.000
matter a huge amount.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.550
One big piece of risk that
people have been facing is

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.640
just what's happening
to food prices.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.990
So food prices have gone--

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:25.120
as you can see, 2007,
they peaked.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.430
The dollar food index
went up to 200.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.660
It came down to 140 then went
up, bounced around, and has

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.910
been climbing since.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:51.870
So that's a 60% change in the
food price in a year--

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.396
not 60.

00:19:52.396 --> 00:19:53.860
Sorry.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.940
It's a change from 140 to 200.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.620
So that's a change of 30%.

00:20:00.693 --> 00:20:11.950
And if you spend 60% of your
income on food then that's of

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.720
the order of, like,
losing 20% of your

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.360
income in a given year.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.610
So just food price variation
will itself have consequence.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.310
Now, wages probably adjust,
so that's probably an

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.610
overestimate of that.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.780
But still, you can see one major
source of uncertainty

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.410
comes from just the fact the
food prices go up massively

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.120
sometimes and come down.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.910
With up and down it's
risk that you see.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.400
There's also a trend which is
worrying in general is the

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.950
food prices seem to be going
up systematically over the

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.210
last some years.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.580
What is a bit misleading about
that trend is that food prices

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.450
had fallen for the previous
35 years or something.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.860
Food prices had fallen.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.760
So since 1970 to 2005, food
prices had basically

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.000
systematically fallen
slightly, and then

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.700
it's been going up.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.920
So this is a bit misleading,
this picture.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.960
But still, there's lots
of uncertainty.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.020
The thing I want to emphasize
here is not levels but

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.020
uncertainty.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.030
Food prices bounce
around a lot.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.790
If you're poor, that's a very
big piece of your income.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:39.970
So just to think about this
analytically, risk also

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.630
matters very much depending on
where you are, for example, in

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.340
your production cycle.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:52.800
So a reason why risk is
amplified is when--

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.823
the fact that you get hit by
a shock then effects your

00:22:00.823 --> 00:22:04.120
ability to productive, which
then affects your income,

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.370
which then affects your
ability to be

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.510
productive, et cetera.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.900
So there is potentially a
vicious cycle that can be set

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.220
off by a shock.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.770
When would that happen?

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.455
Well, we have introduced
this idea of an

00:22:19.455 --> 00:22:22.830
S-shape production function.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.460
Have we read [? Ebutina's ?]

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.710
story?

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.220
What's the story?

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.526
AUDIENCE: It's about a woman
who used to own a small

00:22:42.526 --> 00:22:46.334
business with her husband in
which they had a kind of

00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:51.634
garment manufacturing company,
which they had a bad contract

00:22:51.634 --> 00:22:54.094
which caused them
to go bankrupt.

00:22:54.094 --> 00:22:56.062
And that led to a divorce.

00:22:56.062 --> 00:23:00.490
They tried to restart the
company before divorcing.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.887
They restarted the company with
limited funds and bought

00:23:02.887 --> 00:23:04.782
a bunch of shorts that
they packaged and

00:23:04.782 --> 00:23:05.995
were going to sell.

00:23:05.995 --> 00:23:09.390
But that fell through,
led to a divorce.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.785
The woman has the children
living with her parents, and

00:23:12.785 --> 00:23:16.190
they're just in absolute
poverty now.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.670
So the thing to emphasize there
in that story is that

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.400
this particular kind of shock
she faced was a contract

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.630
enforcement shock.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.950
She had two shocks, both of
which where basically--

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:34.780
so the first one was someone
she had basically sold on

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:41.240
credit defaulted and therefore
didn't pay back the money.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.900
And she had taken a loan
to finance that.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.140
So that kind of put
her into trouble.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:53.260
Then she got an order to supply
shorts to, I think, a

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.370
retail store.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.750
And then they defaulted
on that.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.020
They refused to take
the shorts.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:04.960
So when we met her, she had
a huge pile of shorts.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.120
They were sitting inside her
house surrounded by a pile of

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:16.760
shorts, like, a lot of shorts,
12,000 shorts or something.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.850
So she lost a whole bunch of
money on that as well.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.410
The point is that what is also
striking about her story is

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.820
this dynamic.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.545
So what this picture does--

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:40.540
so it's like that
S-shaped curve.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:45.190
S is maybe an exaggeration.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.500
That's a mapping from
your wealth today

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.010
to your wealth tomorrow.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.650
So that tells you given today's
wealth what tomorrow's

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.580
wealth would be.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.300
So let's take that as given.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:16.790
And now the main point of
drawing it that way is that if

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.070
you think of what's happening
around the point, P--

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.210
look around the point, P. Think
of a part that starts

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:30.226
just above P. Where's
that part going?

00:25:30.226 --> 00:25:31.723
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:31.723 --> 00:25:33.220
PROFESSOR: Explain.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.790
AUDIENCE: To the second
intersection up there.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.400
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.860
Any part that start to the right
of P, you can see that--

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.190
like the one example that's
drawn, the way to analyze this

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:49.170
is to think you start with
a particular wealth.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.980
That generates that
wealth tomorrow.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.040
That wealth is the same.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.810
So tomorrow's wealth then
becomes today's wealth.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.600
The way you do that is you map
that to the 45 degree line,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.890
and you look at wealth
that will be.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:09.210
And that sequence is just going
up to the point where

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.460
the second intersection is.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.630
Who doesn't understand
this picture?

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.760
I'll explain again because
we'll come

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.079
back to this picture.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.290
OK.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.040
I'll assume that you're
comfortable with this picture.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.440
I'm not surprised,
but just in case.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.225
And then what's key is that if
you're the other side of P,

00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:44.160
you're going the other way.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.980
So if you're close to P and you
get hit by a shock, your

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.670
wealth goes down by
a small amount.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.470
That's not where it stops.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.310
Your wealth goes up by a small
amount, you go up a long way.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.210
Your wealth goes down by
a small amount, you

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.420
go down a long way.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.650
So there's a natural
amplification.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.240
If the production technology
looks like that, then there's

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.120
a natural amplification
of a shock.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.770
A small shock turns into
a big shock here.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.140
That's the point of
that picture.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.090
So now it's very difficult for
her to get out because

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:34.690
basically she's never generating
enough surplus to

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:40.030
make the investment she needs
to get the next period's

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.180
output to be high enough.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.840
So she's always, like, cutting
back and cutting back and

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.040
cutting back.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.950
So, in other words, not only
is there a lot of risk,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.360
there's a lot of technologies
in the world which

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.850
amplify that risk.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:58.510
So we already talked
about another

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.470
aspect of it last time.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.720
What was that?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.920
Another aspect of risk, kind of
an amplification of risk.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.560
What happens?

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.280
It's not quite an
amplification.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.840
We talked about what happens
during drought.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.090
Who was here?

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.775
AUDIENCE: During droughts the
girl's more likely to be

00:28:23.775 --> 00:28:25.280
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.160
PROFESSOR: Allowed to die.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.690
PROFESSOR: You were going
to say allowed to die?

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.050
Are you looking for that word?

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.440
PROFESSOR: It's an
awkward word.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.280
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:44.600
So another aspect of this risk
is that you sometimes respond

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.520
to it in drastic ways.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:51.480
So one of the drastic ways
you might respond is by--

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.110
why are you trying to do that?

00:28:53.110 --> 00:29:02.880
Because you know that
essentially if you have two

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.680
children, you can't feed either
of them, both of them

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:14.855
are going to starve and be hurt,
the long run, health

00:29:14.855 --> 00:29:15.780
will be hurt.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.315
So you kind of switch your
money to one of them.

00:29:19.315 --> 00:29:24.570
And that's another way in which
you sort of maybe create

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:25.650
a long term problem.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:29.660
Maybe one of those children
doesn't die, but she starves

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:34.300
and grows up as someone who has
a handicap all her life.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.960
So you amplify lots of shocks
by taking these extreme

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.990
decisions under these
conditions.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.940
So this is just saying
that when you think

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.500
that you can't really--

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.110
so balancing risk is difficult
if you don't

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.030
have a lot of money.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.280
It's not surprising.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.120
Moreover, here's an
interesting fact.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.500
So this means stress, right?

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:18.330
It doesn't just mean that
something happens to me.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.926
I also worry about it.

00:30:27.655 --> 00:30:29.905
It would be amazing if you
didn't worry about the fact

00:30:29.905 --> 00:30:32.550
that, you know, tomorrow you
might have to starve one of

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.800
your children.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.240
So risk means worry.

00:30:43.355 --> 00:30:47.400
Now, it turns out that when you
worry, your body actually

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.680
acts in a particular way.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.930
It generates cortisols.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:05.750
Cortisols are a body's kind of
defense mechanism to keep it

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:08.340
going under situations
of stress.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:12.660
They are actually a natural
response of the body to a

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.080
situation of risk.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.690
It's probably, in a sense, a
good reaction from the point

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.970
of view of certain types
of survival.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.210
But there's a lot of lab
experiments where basically

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.720
what they do is they
stress people out.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.920
So I think the one that--

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:40.220
there's a bunch of them with
Princeton students, who are

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.070
not exactly the world's
poorest.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.560
But the way these experiments
go is

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.920
they give you an endowment.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.970
And then they take away some
of that endowment.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.650
And somehow people get stressed
out when you do that.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.300
Even if, obviously, you're
a Princeton student.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.920
It's not that you're going
to run out of food.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.870
There's plenty of food
in the dining halls.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:12.830
And your lifetime income is
unlikely to be affected by the

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.810
fact that you lost $5
in this experiment.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.870
But people get stressed out when
you put them into these

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.110
situations.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:25.090
And then the experiment is to
make them play games, sort of,

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.130
like, problem solving games.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:31.240
And you get a massive reduction
in their problem

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.470
solving ability.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:33.620
Maybe they're not
MIT students.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.150
Maybe they're just not
as good at it.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:41.270
But still you see that they do
really badly when you put them

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.100
under stress, so, like, little
bit of stress, some fake

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.510
stress, basically.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.020
They were going to get $10
and instead they end

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.520
up with $2 or something.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.690
And that kind of stress already
makes them take really

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.580
bad decisions.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.050
You might imagine if you
had real stress.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:01.690
Your child could starve.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.660
Your mother could die.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.860
You could lose your job.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.850
You're not going to be
taking a lot of good

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.466
decisions under that.

00:33:11.466 --> 00:33:12.432
Yep?

00:33:12.432 --> 00:33:15.330
AUDIENCE: In the experiment
was the endowment or money

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.201
related at all to the outcome
of the games?

00:33:17.201 --> 00:33:19.890
Or was it just like they
were [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:20.480
PROFESSOR: No.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.070
These are separate.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.930
So the games were the games.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:29.090
But before the games, you
created some general

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:30.650
unpleasantness for them.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:35.120
They thought they would get A
but they get B or something.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.000
One of the rules of experiments
is you can't make

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
people worse off.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.530
So these people were
not made--

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.450
they were first given some
money, and then some of that

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.930
money was somehow taken
away from them.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.430
So this was like somehow even
that got them so stressed out

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.530
that they started playing
games badly.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:52.970
Melissa.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:54.613
AUDIENCE: How do you know that
it's not just that they're

00:33:54.613 --> 00:33:56.421
like, oh, this is a
stupid experiment?

00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:58.146
If I do well, they're just
going to take it

00:33:58.146 --> 00:33:58.886
away from me again.

00:33:58.886 --> 00:34:00.365
So I'm not going to
make any effort.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.040
PROFESSOR: How do I know?

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.290
Because I think they believed
the experimenters.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.620
I don't think that they
thought that--

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.870
so they were told from the
beginning that when you join

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:21.949
this experiment there will be
some uncertainty that's going

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:24.790
to be created for you.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:29.190
So the experiment was done
relatively carefully to avoid

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.840
the possibility that
they think this

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.050
is just a mad world.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:37.320
I think most experimenters worry
about that, which is you

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.590
come and tell me first that
we'll do this to you, and then

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.150
I'm going to do that to you.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:42.949
You start worrying.

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:46.880
But then there's a nice field
experiment actually in Kenya

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.170
which is measuring cortisol
levels across people when they

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.719
receive, I think,
some microcredit

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.380
or some other program.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.300
I haven't seen the results
from it yet.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.590
But I've heard the results are
again very similar, that

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.800
you're going to get
people under

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.200
stress take bad decisions.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.300
So the advantage of doing it in
the field is that they're

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.540
getting real help with
their stress.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.920
And when they get the real help
with their risk, they

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.880
actually take better
decisions.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.800
It's less artificial.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:31.120
But I think this fact is quite
crucial in understanding a lot

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.666
of decision making among poor
people because they are under

00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:36.240
a huge amount of stress.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:40.055
And then we're expecting them to
maximize utility over, you

00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:43.810
know, the rest of their lives
and figure out which financial

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:47.000
investment to make and, you
know, how to educate their

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.900
children and all of these
decisions and

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.510
get all of them right.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.600
You might imagine that one of
the things that happens when

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.200
you're under a lot of
stress is you get

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.810
these decisions wrong.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.520
And if you get the decisions
wrong that obviously has long

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.070
term consequences for your
life-- so one other sense in

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:09.030
which risk affects you is by
making you take bad decisions.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.794
Yeah.

00:36:10.794 --> 00:36:13.478
AUDIENCE: But isn't it often the
case that for the poor the

00:36:13.478 --> 00:36:17.382
options are in many cases very
limited and, for example, if

00:36:17.382 --> 00:36:21.336
plant harvest fails, a lot of
people will just move to other

00:36:21.336 --> 00:36:24.580
areas or do labor?

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.075
And they also have few
sources of credits.

00:36:27.075 --> 00:36:30.797
So if the crop fails, then this
will at least give people

00:36:30.797 --> 00:36:31.775
[INAUDIBLE] credit.

00:36:31.775 --> 00:36:36.176
So does decision making actually
understress actual

00:36:36.176 --> 00:36:41.790
figure very highly in decision
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.160
PROFESSOR: I think the
answer is yes.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.810
I mean, I think at the beginning
of the semester we

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:49.610
looked at, for example,
just consumption

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:50.890
decisions of the poor.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.590
What we saw there was that
they were spending large

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.850
amounts of money on things that
they didn't need to buy.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.620
So that's a very
simple example.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.560
Taking their child
to be immunized.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.380
Should I take him today or
take him in a month?

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.460
And if I don't do it today, if
I'm fully forward looking,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.830
rational, I might decide, look,
I might as will do it

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.910
today because I'll never
do it in the future.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:21.440
But if I'm subject to making bad
decisions, I might easily

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.000
make a decision on that.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.810
Should I spend the effort
and the money to

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.310
purify my water or not?

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.570
I can miscalculate on that.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.920
I could think the
risk is smaller

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.240
than it is, for example.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.870
Actually, I would almost put
it the other way around.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.230
I think we who live in--

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.350
rich people have most of
the decisions taken

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.280
out of their hands.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.790
For example, I don't remember
taking any savings decision.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.810
Mostly my saving decisions
are taken by MIT.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.040
And then there's some plan which
I'm supposed to join.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.700
I joined that plan when I
joined MIT, and I've not

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.870
changed anything.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.580
I don't have to plan
my retirement.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:12.560
I don't have any risk mostly.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.500
Unless I do something really
awful, I don't lose my job.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.900
So I never take many decisions
on, like, should I go look for

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.190
a job there or there?

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.670
I just come to my office
and I'm done.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:31.600
I don't have the choice of not
immunizing my children because

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.050
to the extent that I want them
to go to school, the school

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.360
basically enforces that.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.840
You can't get your children
to school

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.110
without immunizing them.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.630
Most decisions of this
class are taken out.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:45.360
I don't know [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.410
water supply.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.460
I turn on the water,
it's clean.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.750
I absolutely don't have to
take that decision on.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.400
Should I purify this water
before I give it

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.640
to my son or not?

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.510
It's a decision I don't
have to take.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.790
Why?

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.990
Because the water's
infrastructure cleans before

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.175
it reaches me.

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:07.650
I get clean water, so I don't
have to worry about that.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.160
I don't have to worry about
whether or not my house can be

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:15.630
made out of things which can
catch fire because before the

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.380
house can be built an,
inspector comes

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.740
and checks it out.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.890
And I'm not allowed to build a
house that can catch fire.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:28.260
So there's so many respects in
which I don't have any choices

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.210
given to me.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.530
But if you're poor,
you actually

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:31.950
have a thousand choices.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:36.422
I mean, I actually think there
are too many choices you have

00:39:36.422 --> 00:39:37.720
to make if you are poor.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.400
I mean, think of water.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.460
Every day you have to decide
should I clean

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.010
the water or not?

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:47.230
That's a difficult choice to
make on any given day.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.860
Yes, someone else
had a-- yeah.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.270
AUDIENCE: So how much of that,
though, can you attribute to

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.210
bad decision making affected
by cortisol?

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.640
And how much of it is because of
a basic misunderstanding of

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.070
economics and utility and
the future return on

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.470
something like that?

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.640
PROFESSOR: We don't know
the answer to that.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.180
It's a very good question.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.640
One day we'll know the
answer to that.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.340
Like, this whole cortisol stuff,
we've only figured this

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.290
out in the last two
or three years.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:22.680
We're just beginning to get into
these kinds of questions

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.350
in a scientific way.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.170
Maybe in 15 years we'll know the
answer to that question.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.460
Right now this is one thing that
I think is very, very,

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.800
very recent, this understanding,
this connection

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.970
with cortisol and decision
making and then the fact that

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.640
cortisol is related to risk.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.760
This whole thing
is very recent.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.340
So I don't know the
answer to it.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.860
It's a perfectly
good question.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.420
I just don't know.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.440
PROFESSOR: Now, obviously
people don't take risks

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.850
sitting down.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.900
They do stuff about it.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:23.695
So one thing you can do
is you can borrow.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.480
You can go and say, look, I
don't have any money today.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.160
The truck didn't pick me up.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.390
Why don't you give
me some money?

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.180
And certainly people do that.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.020
We'll see that it's pretty
limited and very expensive.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.770
So the alternative is to save.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.020
So you can borrow.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.950
You can save.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.210
We'll come to insurance later.

00:41:52.745 --> 00:41:57.100
But mostly most people, they
do one of a fairly limited

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.350
number of things.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:15.310
Now, savings is a pretty
good way to deal with--

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.360
so imagine that you face a lot
of risk and you can't borrow.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:32.060
Your decision rule more or less
should be the following.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.710
The optimal decision rule--

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.870
whether people can
figure this out.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.670
It took a Princeton economist
and a computer to

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:43.930
figure this one out.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.410
So maybe people can't
figure it out.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.860
But let's say they can.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:50.170
Then their decision rule
should be to consume

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.940
everything when your income is
low, everything you have.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.620
And then as soon as your income
crosses a certain

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:01.210
threshold you should save the
rest and you should build up a

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:05.800
stock for those days when
things go wrong.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:11.480
Problem is that if you get two
or three bad years in a row,

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.350
this doesn't protect
you at all.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.810
And the next picture kind of
shows that a little bit.

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.100
So this is a simulation.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.880
This is nobody real.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:28.000
This is a simulation of what
happens when you have income,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.250
consumption, and assets.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:36.080
So income is bouncing around.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:43.780
When income is high, you're
accumulating assets.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.480
Then at some point, when income
is low for a few years,

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.960
your assets keep getting
run down.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.260
Some point it hits zero.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.120
Then if you're lucky and income
goes up right then,

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.420
then you keep going up.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.280
Then your assets go up
and you keep saving.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.070
You're fine.

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:05.520
But sometimes you can see that,
like in the middle,

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:10.440
there is this place where income
goes down sharply, and

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.380
it goes down like there's
several periods for which it's

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:21.920
gone down, that sharp kind
of knife, you know,

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.250
right in the middle.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.420
And you can see that what's
happened there is your assets

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.550
have hit zero.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.220
And because your assets have hit
zero, there's no way you

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:38.050
can just pull down your assets
and protect your consumption.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:39.500
There's nothing you
can do about it.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.600
And that's when you see
consumption really dropping.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.340
So most of the time you see
consumption is a lot flatter

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.590
than income.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.030
And that's what people
find in the data.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.670
Consumption, in general, is very
flat relative to income.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.940
But there are periods
when it plunges.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.080
So if you get two or three bad
shocks then it really hurts.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.290
One bad shock you can deal with
but two or three and you

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:06.450
run out of all assets.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.400
And then suddenly your
consumption drops massively.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:14.200
So you protect your consumption
for a few periods.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.420
But then if your shock continues
then suddenly you

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.230
get into starvation.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.650
So that picture is actually
roughly what you find in the

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:31.920
data, that people, at least two
years in a row, maybe they

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.930
just make it.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.000
Their consumption
doesn't fall.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.130
The third year, if the rain
again falls then they go into

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:39.810
starvation.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:43.520
So that's a pattern that you see
a lot, and that's exactly

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.510
what you'd expect.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:49.240
People should try to protect
their consumption until they

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:55.100
can by, you know, running down
assets and expect that next

00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:00.410
time income will recover.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.840
But income doesn't recover after
several times then you

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.090
get hit very badly.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.400
And that's sort of what we
find also in the data.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.210
This is a pattern we also
see in the data.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:14.280
Another thing you can do
is try to work more.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.470
And everybody does that.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:33.450
You know, let's say there's a
drought and you can't farm.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.950
You go and start
to sell labor.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:41.250
Problem is when it's a drought,
it's a drought for

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.310
everybody else.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:44.510
Everybody's selling labor.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.760
What happens to wages?

00:46:48.894 --> 00:46:51.560
AUDIENCE: Well, they're
much cheaper.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.320
PROFESSOR: So wages
keep going down.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:58.850
So in particular it could very
well be that in a drought

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:03.290
everybody ends up trying to work
so much and wages go down

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:08.160
so much that that amplifies
rather than reduces the risk

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.680
because everybody
tries to work.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:17.400
So I'm going to try and go and
try and get work assuming that

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.070
everybody else is not working.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.780
But when I try to go to
get work, everybody

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:22.810
else does as well.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.900
That drives down wages to the
point where it could even be

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.130
that it does nothing
to protect me.

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:31.740
I just end up working more and
earning the same amount I

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.210
would have earned otherwise.

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:36.900
So this is something
that is this real?

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:41.040
So there's a paper
by [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.680
who basically looks at this.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.210
And what she does is she adds
another wrinkle to it.

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:53.820
So she says, well, how much
you're going to do go out and

00:47:53.820 --> 00:48:00.360
look for a job versus sort
of [? desave ?]?

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.110
Depends on whether you have
a bank account or not.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.240
So if you have money in your
bank account, you're less

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.600
likely to go out and find an
extra job and more likely to

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.200
live off your bank account or at
least partly live off your

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.130
bank account.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:16.770
So you're going to be less
desperate to find work.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.980
That's going to drive
wages down less.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:24.100
So what she does is she looks
at what happens to wages in

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.780
drought years versus non drought
years in areas which

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.850
have good banking services
versus areas which don't have

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.280
good banking services.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.890
So this is data from India.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:40.070
And she's comparing areas
which have good banking

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:43.230
services versus areas that don't
have such good banking

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:48.150
services and looking at the
effect of that on wages in

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:50.000
drought years versus
non drought years.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.140
So in drought years wages
are going to be lower.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:49:08.480
She's asking are wages that much
lower in areas where the

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.670
banking services are worse?

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:15.620
Or alternately, are wages
relatively less likely to fall

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:20.450
in a drought year where banking
services are better?

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:23.010
Do you see the motivation
for that?

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:27.485
So that's the next table.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:45.675
So when crop yield goes up,
which is basically rainfall--

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:52.320
so this is always with district
fixed effect.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.370
So we're comparing the same
district over time, the wage

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:59.840
in the same district over time
over this period 1956 to '87.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:06.160
Over these 31 years we are
comparing the same district in

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.600
a drought year and a
non drought year.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.420
Banking is something that
improved over time.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:20.860
So, in particular, if you look
in the last column, banking is

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:23.950
also something that's
changing over time.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:28.480
And she's controlling
for that.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.950
And then she's asking is it
the case that where the

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:41.640
banking is better, the effect of
a good yield in increasing

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.610
wages is smaller?

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.660
That's the same question as
the affect of bad yield in

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.360
decreasing wages is also
going to be smaller.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:59.120
The effect of yield on wages,
is it smaller in districts

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:06.580
which have better banking
services?

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:13.330
And that negative in crop
yield interactive with

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:18.060
banking, that negative role in
the middle says that, yes, the

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:24.190
effect of yield on wages is
smaller where banking is

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.480
better, as you'd expect.

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.730
People are less desperate.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:33.130
They can go to the bank instead
of, you know, working.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:35.220
And, therefore, the
fallen wages is

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.470
smaller in those places.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.540
We talked about saving.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.240
We talked about borrowing.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.890
There's a third thing
you could do.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:48.260
Or we talked about saving.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.240
We talked about borrowing.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.430
We talked about working.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:52.492
There's a fourth thing
we could do.

00:51:52.492 --> 00:51:54.810
Oops.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.060
That was dangerous.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:06.900
The fourth thing you could do is
you could try to do things

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.150
to avoid risk.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:15.675
So what's an example of doing
something to avoid risk?

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:32.900
AUDIENCE: Maybe diversify
where you're investing.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.000
PROFESSOR: Diversify where
you're investing.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.790
Give me an example.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.430
That sounds right but
general principle.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:42.202
Give me an example of what
you mean by diversify.

00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:44.990
AUDIENCE: Maybe, for example,
if you're a farmer, you have

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:47.614
to [INAUDIBLE] of crops maybe.

00:52:47.614 --> 00:52:48.598
So that if some fail--

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:49.090
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:56.370
So one example would be imagine
there's two crops,

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:57.640
sugar cane and wheat.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.880
Sugar cane is much
more profitable.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:07.090
But wheat and sugar cane are
subject to independent risk.

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:12.330
So when sugar cane dries up,
that doesn't affect wheat.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.200
And when wheat dries up, that
doesn't affect sugar cane.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.790
Different things affect them.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:21.015
Then by having a little bit of
sugar cane and a little bit of

00:53:21.015 --> 00:53:23.740
wheat, you have less risk.

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.210
But, of course, you're
paying in income.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:29.130
You'll be taking less income
because sugar cane is more

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.050
productive.

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:34.340
So one thing people do
is they diversify.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:38.790
Like a very interesting paper
from many years ago showing

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:41.630
they diversified in many,
many complex ways.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:44.880
One thing that was very
interesting is you'll find

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:51.280
that in many countries,
actually, you'll find that the

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.450
plots people crop are
not adjacent.

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:58.090
And that seems to
make no sense.

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:04.230
Why would I farm over here for
the morning, walk three

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:07.610
kilometers over there and
farm in the afternoon?

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:10.400
That doesn't seem to make any
sense unless you think that

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.160
there are something like
micro climates.

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.810
So it might rain here when
it's not raining there.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:21.520
Maybe when a bug attacks here,
it doesn't attack over there.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.135
So even though you're growing
the same crop, you grow it

00:54:24.135 --> 00:54:27.810
over several plots and the
plots are not contiguous.

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:34.030
You walk from plot to plot to
avoid having exactly being in

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.690
the same place.

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:37.120
Because if you're in the same
place then the same rainfall

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.760
patterns, the same bugs,
you're subject to them.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.790
If you had multiple plots in
different places, you can

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:44.860
avoid that.

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:47.530
Now, that's of course wasteful
because you're spending a lot

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:49.680
of time walking, and you should
have been spending that

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.120
time farming.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.910
But at least you reduce risk.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:55:01.030
So the general principle is that
you do many, many things

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:06.110
to, like, diversify, have many
crops, many plots, many jobs.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:16.220
There's a study of how many
professions a family can have.

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:20.360
And I think the maximum number
in the study was 27.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.900
They were doing 27
different things.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:29.090
They were small things like
going to the pond and

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:31.825
harvesting muscles.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.710
You do that in the morning.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:39.375
Then you go and collect
the firewood for sale.

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:47.690
Then your son goes and takes the
cow to the field, and your

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.850
daughter feeds the chicken.

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.360
So you had to add up all
those little things.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.800
But they were doing 27 different
professions.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.010
I think was the number
if I remember right.

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:03.840
But that's basically sort of
an extreme version of this,

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.310
avoiding risk by doing a little
bit of many, many,

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:07.560
many, many, many things.

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.930
That's good.

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.260
It allows you to avoid risk.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:28.840
But it's bad because you end up
doing things which are not

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.120
particularly productive.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.590
You don't do the sugar cane even
though sugar cane is much

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.180
more productive than wheat.

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:38.480
So you lose money, and
that keeps you poor.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:44.050
So it's estimated that it
does not weather risk.

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:48.200
And so if you didn't change your
crop mix to deal with the

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.600
risk, you would make
30% more money.

00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:58.570
So that's big.

00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:00.790
Basically the stuff that
you're doing to protect

00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:03.210
against the risk is reducing
your income by 30%.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:10.940
Another thing that it does is
that because you're doing so

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:12.910
many things, you don't--

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:15.610
we [? are not ?] good
at any one of them.

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:18.740
One way to get good at a
profession is by working very

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.620
hard at it, learning the job.

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:27.080
So a lot of these people, for
example, they don't want to go

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:31.310
to the city and become a full
time worker in the city.

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:31.700
Why?

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.600
Because they think they'll
lose their job.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:37.120
And when they lose their job, if
they still have the farm at

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.080
home, they can come back
to the farm and get

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.500
a living from that.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.250
But if that means that
your job in the city

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:47.840
is a temporary job.

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.860
If I'm hiring someone temporary,
I have no incentive

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:56.030
to give that person
any skills.

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:58.750
I know he's going to
be gone in a month.

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.930
So nobody gets start
any skills.

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:01.230
Why?

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:03.030
Because they're all temporary
laborers.

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:04.500
But why are they temporary
laborers?

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:09.810
Because they don't want to put
all their money into this one

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:13.180
basket, all the eggs into this
one basket because they think

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:17.320
that suppose I lose that job,
what's going to happen?

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.610
I might as will keep
my foot in farming.

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:21.130
And so they keep their
foot in farming.

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:24.610
They keep their foot
in the city.

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:27.370
They keep their foot in
farming sugar cane.

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:31.870
They keep their foot
in farming wheat.

00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:33.570
They do many, many
different things.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:35.710
That means they don't get good
at anything, and they don't

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:37.503
take advantage of what
they're good at.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:49.950
So one other thing
you could do is

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:53.220
actually offer insurance.

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:57.000
To all of these strategies
the logical

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.250
alternative is insurance.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:04.280
What is insurance?

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.050
What would be weather
insurance?

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.380
What's an insurance?

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:15.970
Yeah?

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:18.703
AUDIENCE: The idea for the
insurance is to gather up a

00:59:18.703 --> 00:59:21.685
large group of people with
different specific exposures

00:59:21.685 --> 00:59:25.080
to a certain risk and then
to pool that risk.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:28.306
So you pay marginally in the
event that something happens,

00:59:28.306 --> 00:59:28.940
and then you get a
reimbursement.

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.125
PROFESSOR: What does the
contract look like?

00:59:30.125 --> 00:59:31.400
I am asking a simple question.

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.386
You're right.

00:59:32.386 --> 00:59:34.358
AUDIENCE: You pay an
annual premium.

00:59:34.358 --> 00:59:37.810
And then if something happens,
you get reimbursed for it.

00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:38.470
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:44.680
So if the weather is really bad,
you give me $1,000, and I

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:48.285
pay $50 in a normal
year or something.

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:52.262
You want to say something?

00:59:52.262 --> 00:59:54.246
AUDIENCE: I mean, another
alternative to private

00:59:54.246 --> 00:59:55.734
insurance would be
to have some form

00:59:55.734 --> 00:59:57.222
of government insurance.

00:59:57.222 --> 01:00:00.297
So I was thinking when you were
talking about this that

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:02.678
are a lot of historically sort
of much more seemingly

01:00:02.678 --> 01:00:06.398
primitive societies who did a
better job of sort of dealing

01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:09.622
with these issues, like, say,
like, the Incas or even, like,

01:00:09.622 --> 01:00:11.606
the Mycenaeans or something.

01:00:11.606 --> 01:00:15.670
And what seems to be different
is that they had kind of

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:17.633
somewhat strong functioning
central states that

01:00:17.633 --> 01:00:18.575
redistributed across.

01:00:18.575 --> 01:00:21.872
People like the Incas didn't
even have money or sort of

01:00:21.872 --> 01:00:24.510
markets in the modern sense that
we've talked about, yet

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:27.930
they had this sort of
sophisticated system of

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:32.571
redistribution and, like,
collection of agricultural

01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:35.710
products to, I guess, feed
the military but

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:36.440
also to smooth risk.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:36.760
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.550
So we'll talk a little bit about
that in the end, which

01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:41.560
is you're talking about,
I think, something very

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:47.540
important which is what would
public policy look like here?

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:50.495
You would want some way
to insure people.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.250
But right now I'm asking
a narrow question.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:06.380
If I was facing risk and there
was an insurance market, I

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.960
could buy insurance, right?

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.000
If I'm worried about risk and
I'm doing all kinds of

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.400
inefficient things to avoid
risk, I could deal with it by

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.400
just saying, look, you know, I'm
going to buy insurance on

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:18.720
the weather.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.630
And when the weather's bad,
I'm going to get money.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:30.860
So here's a weather insurance
product in Ghana.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:36.040
This was offered at different
prices to different people.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.490
And the striking fact here is
when you offer at a price of

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:43.380
zero, people are willing to
take it, not entirely

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.270
surprisingly.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:54.560
However, as the price goes up
to an actually fair price--

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.150
what is an actually fair
price, if I can

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:58.271
say the word correctly?

01:01:58.271 --> 01:01:59.213
Yeah?

01:01:59.213 --> 01:02:01.568
AUDIENCE: It's the amount
it actually costs, like,

01:02:01.568 --> 01:02:05.336
aggregate to get to an expected
value of zero.

01:02:05.336 --> 01:02:05.820
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.940
So the amount I pay you in
expectation is equal to the

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.610
amount you pay.

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:14.330
That's actually fair price.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.420
You can see that some
people buy above the

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:17.860
actually fair price.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.444
Why is that?

01:02:20.444 --> 01:02:22.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.880
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.600
PROFESSOR: Because they're
risk adverse.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.520
So you're really willing
to pay the market.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.610
Economic theory would say you
should be willing to pay more

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:33.310
than the actually fair price.

01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:33.560
Why?

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.890
Because the actually fair price
says on average you

01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:39.750
break even.

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.440
But risk hurts you a lot.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.750
So you don't want to break
even on average.

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:47.980
You're willing to pay extra
money to get rid of the bad

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.380
things that happen when--

01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:56.375
risk hurts you more
than just--

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.430
it's not just that sometimes
you get more,

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:03.960
sometimes you get less.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.460
The fact that sometimes you get
less is worrying you, is

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.340
making you do bad things
that are inefficient.

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.840
So you should be willing to
pay more than the actually

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.185
fair price to get insurance
because that's the whole idea

01:03:15.185 --> 01:03:17.730
of insurance.

01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:23.930
Car insurance is almost hugely
not fair if you look at the

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:25.550
car insurance we have the US.

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:26.630
Why do we have that?

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:30.560
Because we want to be covered
against the possibility that

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.020
sometimes people will
sue us for a

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:35.070
million dollars in damages.

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:39.530
And so we are willing to pay a
lot more than what's fair.

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:42.520
So these people, they're
not willing to pay.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.050
At the fair price, 30%
willing to take it.

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:51.660
And you have to really go down
to about the price of one,

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.480
that's 1/9 of the fair price,
to get people to take it.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.030
So people don't seem
to want insurance.

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:01.110
So if everything I said
so far was true, why

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:04.200
don't they want insurance?

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.610
I said they did all these
inefficient things

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.040
to deal with risk.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.160
Isn't that immediately
telling us that

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.410
they should want insurance?

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.810
Yes?

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.060
No?

01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:32.380
And, in fact, when they take
insurance, good things happen.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:42.990
So this picture, what it shows,
this is spending on--

01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:45.700
total chemical spending
is an odd title.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.110
I didn't put it there.

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:50.970
But it's total spending on
chemical fertilizer.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.560
So how much fertilizer
do you buy?

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:59.520
Well, when you get insurance,
you buy about, you know, a

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.850
little bit more than
in control.

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:03.750
So some people were
offered insurance.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.000
Some people were
offered credit.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.730
Some people were offered both.

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:12.810
And you see the sum gains
in investment.

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:14.810
People under invest
when they get--

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:22.230
so relative to getting
just the loan,

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:23.640
insurance really helps.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:28.130
So when you get a loan, you
don't want the loan if it

01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:31.210
doesn't come with insurance
because you worry that you

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:32.510
can't repay the loan.

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:34.100
So you don't actually
gain much.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.430
So if you're offered the
loan, you gain nothing.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:40.580
But when you're offered loan
and insurance then your

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.370
investment goes up by
about almost 50%.

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:46.520
So you really invest a lot more
in fertilizer when you

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.340
get insurance and credit
together relative to getting

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.940
just credit.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.840
So that says that that
affects your income.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.030
This says that this affects
your welfare.

01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:02.810
When you get insurance and
credit, you are actually about

01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:06.610
half as likely to have
somebody in your

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:09.570
family miss a meal.

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:11.280
That's an extreme
form of risk.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.320
You're just starving because
you don't have money.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.455
That halves when you
offer insurance.

01:06:16.455 --> 01:06:18.930
So insurance is very good for
these people, whether or not

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:21.410
they want it.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:23.440
Insurance seems to be
increasing output

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.400
and reducing risk.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:27.876
AUDIENCE: Wait.

01:06:27.876 --> 01:06:28.828
Can you go back to that slide?

01:06:28.828 --> 01:06:29.304
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:06:29.304 --> 01:06:30.256
AUDIENCE: I don't understand.

01:06:30.256 --> 01:06:33.270
So the both is if they get
insurance and the loan?

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:36.168
[? PROFESSOR: Bought ?]
and credit.

01:06:36.168 --> 01:06:38.824
AUDIENCE: And so then the
percentage of people missing

01:06:38.824 --> 01:06:41.000
meals of that goes down
dramatically?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:41.590
PROFESSOR: Dramatically, yeah.

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:44.680
AUDIENCE: But what is it that if
they have just insurance or

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.710
just capital, it looks like it
increases over the control?

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.230
PROFESSOR: It doesn't
really increase.

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:55.015
Like, as you can see, you need
both for it to work.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.710
So why aren't they insured?

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:10.380
And there are two versions
of this question.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.430
One is why aren't they buying
insurance in the market?

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.230
And the other is why aren't
they buying--

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:18.770
if they don't buy insurance,
they can still do something

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:25.060
else, which is one way to get
insurance is for all of us to

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.730
just pool together.

01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:28.180
The government doesn't
have to do anything.

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.610
The market doesn't have
to do anything.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:30.790
We all live in the
same village.

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:35.630
We can all get together, and
we can all adopt the rule

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:42.200
which says that if any of us
loses 50% of their income,

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.940
we'll all pay them
1% of our income.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:50.310
We could adopt that
rule, right?

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:55.020
And that would insure everybody
because there's,

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.870
like, 50 of us in this room.

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:05.635
If I lose 50% of income, all
of you give me 1% of your

01:08:05.635 --> 01:08:08.100
incomes and I'm OK.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:11.150
So you can ensure me.

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:12.080
We don't need a market
to do it.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.440
We can just do it at the
community level.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.350
limitation of that is the fact
that you're diversifying

01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:23.110
across a larger geographical
area or presumable, like, a

01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.970
bad weather condition.

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:24.970
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:27.300
But we should at
least do that.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:31.550
The fact is that people seem to
have limited insurance even

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:32.972
from their friends.

01:08:32.972 --> 01:08:35.097
AUDIENCE: But couldn't that
potentially open you up to

01:08:35.097 --> 01:08:37.149
huge exposure as
an individual?

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:38.399
PROFESSOR: Why?

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.720
AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess if
everybody gets equally then

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.092
even if you have a really bad
year-- but if everybody has a

01:08:45.092 --> 01:08:46.590
bad year then you wouldn't
require it.

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.359
PROFESSOR: You can adopt a
rule which basically says

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:54.399
let's take an average income
of everybody and then those

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:58.000
who get more than average in
that given year give a little

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.770
bit to the ones who get
less than average.

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.950
You can always do that.

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:03.920
So in substance it's a puzzle.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.210
Why don't they buy it
from the market?

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:09.574
Why don't they buy it
from each other?

01:09:09.574 --> 01:09:14.689
And there's been a lot
of hype in this area.

01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:17.569
Like, Forbes Magazine had this
issue where they said the

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:23.080
"insurance for the poor is an
unpenetrated natural market."

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.590
And a lot of microfinance
institutions have been talking

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:30.529
about the next microcredit
revolution is micro insurance.

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:33.029
So they're going to provide
insurance to people.

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:36.069
But in fact we don't see very
much insurance being supplied

01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:37.374
or demanded.

01:09:37.374 --> 01:09:43.069
Now, insurance is difficult
for a variety of reasons.

01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:44.815
Does anybody know what
moral hazard is?

01:09:48.968 --> 01:09:49.449
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:49.449 --> 01:09:53.841
Moral hazard is just
the concept that--

01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:55.829
I guess it could be best

01:09:55.829 --> 01:09:58.314
illustrated through the example.

01:09:58.314 --> 01:10:00.550
There was a huge [INAUDIBLE]
about moral hazard about

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:03.182
bailing out the banks because
it could encourage banking

01:10:03.182 --> 01:10:06.014
institutions in the future to
act more recklessly because

01:10:06.014 --> 01:10:07.550
there's this implicit guarantee
it could backstop

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:09.250
because it happened
once before.

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:09.675
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:10:09.675 --> 01:10:12.130
So one problem with
insurance--

01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.950
but this doesn't explain why
people don't want it.

01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:19.580
It just explains why it
could be expensive.

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.660
You know, if I offer insurance
to you and I say that I'll

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:26.870
take care of you whenever your
income falls, your incentive

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:28.910
to stay home goes up a lot.

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:30.650
That's moral hazard.

01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:31.900
What's adverse selection?

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:40.190
AUDIENCE: You're only drawing
those with high risk.

01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:41.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:45.800
The other worry is that you tend
to draw in the people.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:51.630
So if I offer people the option
of, you know, whenever

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:54.100
your income falls, I'll
take care of you.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.710
I might only get the people who
they know their income is

01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:00.400
going to fall come and
join that scheme.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.410
That's adverse selection.

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:02.760
So we have both of those.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.890
And there's outright fraud
because people might claim

01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:08.770
their income has fallen
but in fact their

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:11.470
income hasn't fallen.

01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:12.480
How do I measure that?

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.620
So it's expensive to deliver.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.130
That's a given.

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:22.980
But nevertheless,
the reason why--

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.600
but you would imagine that at
least some forms of insurance

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.600
should exist.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.020
One is catastrophic
health insurance.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:33.720
Like, you were in a
traffic accident.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.990
Nobody gets into a traffic
accident on purpose, very

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:39.460
little moral hazard.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:42.190
Why isn't there insurance
for that at least?

01:11:42.190 --> 01:11:46.100
Another one is weather
insurance.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.750
I don't control the weather.

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:51.400
So there's no moral hazard
or adverse selection.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.560
I don't control the weather.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.540
The weather is what it is.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:59.680
So if you say that, why don't
we get lots of market for

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.940
rainfall insurance?

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:10.540
When the rainfall is below some
cut off, I pay you money

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.790
otherwise you pay me money.

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:17.790
So we would at least expect to
see these kinds of insurances.

01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:20.130
It's difficult to have, like,
more complex insurance.

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:21.940
Maybe there's some fraud
or something.

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.990
But this kind of insurance,
why don't we see more

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:25.240
of it in the world?

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.650
So this is a sort of where we're
beginning to understand.

01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:44.350
So there was this huge hype,
like, five years ago,

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:48.120
everybody in the world was
talking about how the next

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.210
revolution in micro insurance.

01:12:50.210 --> 01:12:52.980
And then that revolution
kind of never happened.

01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.540
In fact, it was kind
of, if you like--

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.650
we worked with a micro finance

01:12:59.650 --> 01:13:01.350
organization to offer insurance.

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:07.540
And after about a year, they
basically said, look, you

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.230
guys, we can't do this.

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:11.950
We're losing clients every day
because they were forcing

01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:13.740
their clients to
buy insurance.

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:17.830
The way you avoid adverse
selection is by forcing

01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:19.100
people to buy it.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.560
You don't want people to have
choice otherwise only the sick

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.280
people will buy health
insurance.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.440
They're forcing all
their clients

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.690
to buy health insurance.

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:30.370
As a result, all their clients
were deserting them.

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:32.670
So they basically canceled
the program.

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:35.840
So nobody seems to
want insurance.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:41.090
Now, I don't think people
have fully understood

01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:42.330
what's going on there.

01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:43.670
I certainly don't.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:46.040
I mean, I think part
of it is people

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.690
don't understand insurance.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:52.420
So part of the problem is
that people think, well,

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.810
I'm giving you money.

01:13:53.810 --> 01:14:00.050
And if I don't use this service,
you should give me

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.780
the money back.

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:05.260
So the idea that I'm giving
you something--

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:09.470
see, for most of us, the bizarre
thing about insurance

01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:12.010
is it's a product that
you really don't

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.640
want to use, right?

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.930
Insurance is one thing.

01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:18.670
But you want to buy
it but not use it.

01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:21.230
I'm happy when I don't get
sick and, therefore, I'm

01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:24.980
really happy when I paid for it
and I didn't get anything.

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:27.980
Psychologically, it's an odd
product in that sense.

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.110
It's a product that you're
happiest when

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:31.660
you don't use it.

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:32.890
So that's one problem clearly.

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:33.930
It's a bizarre product.

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:37.030
It's one unique kind
of product.

01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:41.090
Usually we're happy when we
get what we paid for.

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:45.020
Here, you're happy when you
don't get what you paid for.

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.700
And that makes it difficult.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:50.060
Second thing, I think,
is they don't trust

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.240
the insurance company.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.130
And there's some evidence that
when the insurance company has

01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:59.950
come through an NGO which people
know and like, they're

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:01.910
more willing to buy it.

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:06.600
So there's some trust
element there.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.440
But I think there's
something else

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.340
that I think is difficult.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:16.635
So think of catastrophic
health insurance.

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:30.090
And if I was offering
catastrophic health insurance,

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:32.580
our theory was very simple.

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.215
Nobody gets a heart
attack on purpose.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.790
Nobody gets cancer on purpose.

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:40.680
So let's just insure
those things.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.570
That was OK.

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:47.300
The theory seemed to work.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:52.150
The problem is people also
die from other things.

01:15:52.150 --> 01:16:04.810
Like, the stomach hurts and
then they probably got an

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.486
infection and died.

01:16:06.486 --> 01:16:09.600
That's not covered by the
insurance because, you know,

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.330
in general it's only particular

01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:15.030
conditions that are covered.

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:18.890
People don't understand why one
thing that is covered and

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:20.380
another thing isn't.

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:22.880
And if you explain that, well,
there's more moral hazard in

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.720
this one than that one then
that's too hard to explain.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.170
So, basically, insurance
products, out of the necessity

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.100
of protecting the insurance
organization from adverse

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:36.620
selection and moral hazard,
tend to be incomplete.

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.480
They cover only a
few conditions.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.010
People don't understand
those conditions.

01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:42.570
So there was this big fight
with this [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:44.220
we worked with.

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.650
They got into this big fight
with a group of women who were

01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:51.270
very upset because one of their
friend's husband died.

01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:52.700
He died at home.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.260
He suddenly got sick and died.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:01.380
When he got sick, she went
to the local doctor.

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:05.440
And the local doctor recommended
a whole bunch of

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.970
medication, expensive medication
which was useless

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:11.710
because the doctor,
I think, was bad.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.500
The insurance company
said this was

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.420
not a covered condition.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:21.860
We can't pay for it because it
was not covered in fact.

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:24.100
The insurance company in this
particular case said we will

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.600
only cover conditions that
require hospitalization, and

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.170
we'll only pay if you have
been hospitalized.

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:32.360
That's a very good way to
check whether people are

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.560
making up conditions or not.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.700
So they had imposed this
hospitalization condition,

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.170
which was to protect them.

01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:42.680
But then these people said,
look, her husband died.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.070
How could it be worse?

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:45.060
You have to pay.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.090
So it was a big fight.

01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:47.880
The insurance company
refused to pay.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.900
As a result, all of them
quit [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:55.620
So just the nature of the
product is difficult.

01:17:55.620 --> 01:18:00.490
That's one final psychological
element which I think is also

01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:04.860
difficult, which is catastrophic
insurance is

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.535
particularly a product
that makes you--

01:18:07.535 --> 01:18:10.260
you value it when you think
about your own death or

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:12.680
something or something
really bad.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.020
People don't like thinking
about those things.

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:18.160
So it's very hard to get people
to be rational about

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.290
buying a product that involves
contemplating really awful

01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:22.820
things happening to you.

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:27.890
So a lot of people are both, I
think, maybe they are a little

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:32.230
bit superstitious about it.

01:18:32.230 --> 01:18:35.930
So they don't really like taking
on this risk, thinking

01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:38.190
about these states of awful
things happening.

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:41.180
So if you're going to insure us
to insure awful things like

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:44.030
when the crop completely dries
up, that's not what people

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:45.420
want to think about.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.100
So that's another reason why.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.900
But in general, we don't fully
understand why people aren't

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:50.920
buying these products.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.160
But they aren't buying them.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.750
So if there's no question,
I'll stop here.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:59.000
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.590
In the last example
of the previous clip,

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.240
we have observed that the
initial state of where

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.740
the Markov chain starts can
matter, and that in some cases,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.660
the influence of
the initial state

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.030
never vanishes in the long run.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.560
So when we wanted to calculate
the probability of ending up

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.200
in state one, knowing that
you started in state one,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.430
give you that probability, and
if you started in state three,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.510
you had another long
term probability.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.940
And in case you were
started in state two,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.260
then you were equally likely
to end up being in state one

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.930
or in state three.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.660
We have said that this
was due to the fact

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.020
that some states
are not accessible

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.070
from some other states.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.500
Our goal here is to make
such a statement more

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.200
precise and formal.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.819
In order to do so, we will
classify the states of a Markov

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:10.030
chain in a transition diagram
into two types, recurrent

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.700
and transient.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.380
A state is said to be
recurrent if starting

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.740
from that state, no
matter where you go,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.530
there is always a
path to come back.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.050
A state is said to be transient
if it is not recurrent.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.210
It means that starting
from that state,

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.600
there is at least one
place where you can go,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.660
and then there will be
no paths back to it.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.200
For example, starting from state
eight, no matter where you go,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.170
there is always a
path back to eight.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.300
So eight will be said
to be a recurrent state.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.370
For the same reason,
seven will also

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.030
be a recurrent state,
as well as six.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.890
Now, what about five?

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.788
From five, the only
state where you can go to

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:16.800
is five itself, so five
is also a recurrent state.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.480
Let us look now at a
state like state four.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.320
From four, there
is the possibility

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.720
of a path going
through two, then one,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.360
and then going to
five, from which

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.870
there is no path back to four.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.670
So four cannot be
a recurrent state.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.350
It is then called
a transient state.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.820
For the same reason,
starting from three,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.620
there is the possibility that
after doing many transitions

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.120
around here, eventually, you
will end up being in either two

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.460
and then go to six, or you
will eventually be in one

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.870
and then go to five.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.090
And from five or from six, there
will be no path back to three,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.450
so three is also
a transient state.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.840
And it is clear that
for the same reason,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.750
one will be a transient
state, and two will also

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.550
be a transient state.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.740
Now, if a state is transient,
like three, four, one, or two,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.600
it means that it will be visited
only a finite number of times.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.860
And in the long
run, the probability

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.990
of being in a transient
state will converge to zero.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.660
The recurrent states
of a Markov chain

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.620
can be grouped in
different classes.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.400
Here, in this example,
we have two such classes.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:10.760
Here, this is one class, and
here you have another class.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.970
What is so special
about these classes?

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.800
Well, within one class,
for example, in this class,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.790
all recurrent states
have a way to communicate

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.290
between each other, but
there is no communication

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.262
between recurrent states
of different classes.

00:04:34.262 --> 00:04:38.080
From that recurrent
state here, you

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.000
have no communication with
that recurrent state here.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.920
No communication in
the sense that there

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.110
is no path joining that
state to that state

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.300
or that state to that state.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.650
The existence of more than
one class of recurrent states,

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.330
like in this example,
in a Markov chain,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.540
will be the telling
sign that initial states

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.230
will matter in that chain.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.970
It's pretty clear here that
if your Markov chain starts

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.290
in state five, you will never
end up in state six, seven,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.870
or eight, and if you
start in one of the states

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.410
six, seven, eight, you will
never end up in state five.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.270
So depending on
where you started,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.159
the long range probability of
being eventually in state six

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.390
will not be the same.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
PROFESSOR: Let me
demonstrate now

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.140
with plain doing the
integral that, really,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.000
the shape of this wave is
moving with that velocity.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.510
So in order to do
that, I basically

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.510
have to do the integral.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.760
And of course, if it's a general
integral, I cannot do it.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.870
So I have to figure out
enough about the integral.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.460
So here it is.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.729
We have psi of x and t.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:41.670
It's integral dk phi of k e
to the ikx minus omega of kt.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.530
OK.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.350
It's useful for us to look
at this wave at time equals 0

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.560
so that we later compare it
with the result of the integral.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:08.030
So phi psi at time equals 0 is
just dk phi of k e to the ikx.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.210
Only thing you know is that
phi has peaked around k0.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.910
You don't know more than that.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.020
But that's psi of x
and time equals 0.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.490
Let's look at it later.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.350
So we have this thing here.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.900
And I cannot do the
integral unless I do some

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.430
approximations.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.480
And I will approximate omega.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.370
Omega of k, since we're anyway
going to integrate around k0,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.020
let's do a Taylor series.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.580
It's omega of k0 plus k
minus k0, the derivative

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.795
of omega with respect to k at k0
plus order k minus k0 squared.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.382
So let's--

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.610
do this here.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.480
So if I've expanded
omega as a function of k,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.880
which is the only
reasonable thing to do.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.110
k's near k0 are the only
ones that contribute.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.550
So omega of k may be
an arbitrary function,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.040
but it has a Taylor expansion.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.160
And certainly, you've
noted that you get back

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.100
derivative that somehow
is part of the answer,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.520
so that's certainly a bonus.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.310
So now we have to plug
this into the integral.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.340
And this requires a
little bit of vision

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.820
because it suddenly seems
it's going to get very messy.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.330
But if you look at
it for a few seconds,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.930
you can see what's going on.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:02.810
So psi of x and t, so far,
dk phi of k e to the ikx.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.550
So far so good.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.280
I'll split the exponential so
as to have this thing separate.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.790
Let's do this. e to the minus i.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.910
I should put omega of k times t.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.780
So I'll begin.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.230
Omega of k0 times t.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.900
That's the first factor.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.800
e to the minus i,
the second factor.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.500
k--

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.370
k d omega dk.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.990
k0 times t.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.780
And the third factor is
this one with the k0.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.972
e to the minus-- it
should be e to the plus.

00:03:49.972 --> 00:03:56.286
i k not d omega dk.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.890
k0 t.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.900
Plus order--

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.490
higher up.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.946
So e to the negligible--

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.100
negligible until you
need to figure out

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.140
distortion of wave patterns.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.360
We're going to see
the wave pattern move.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.070
If you want to see
the distortion,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.620
you have to keep
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.390
We'll do that in
a week from now.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.020
This is the integral.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.340
And then, you probably
need to think a second.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.880
And you say, look.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.590
There's lots of things making it
look like a difficult integral,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.640
but it's not as
difficult as it looks.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.485
First, I would
say, this factor--

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.650
doesn't depend on k.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.080
It's omega evaluated at k0.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.210
So this factor is
just confusing.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.780
It's not-- doesn't
belong in the integral.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.170
This factor, too.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.820
k0 is not a function of k.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.890
d omega dk evaluated at
k0 is not a function of k.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.350
So this is not really
in the integral.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.150
This is negligible.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.910
This is in the integral
because it has a k.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.230
And this is in the integral.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.310
So let me put here, e to
the minus i omega of k0 t

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.140
e to the minus--

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.370
to the plus i k0 d omega dk--

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.610
at k0 t.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.740
Looks messy.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.890
Not bad.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.240
dk.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.525
And now I can put phi of k.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:58.190
e to the i k x minus
these two exponentials,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:05.630
d omega dk at k0 times t.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.820
And I ignore this.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.060
So far so good.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:21.530
For this kind of wave, we
already get a very nice result

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.535
because look at this thing.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.190
This quantity can be written
in terms of the wave function

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.670
at time equals 0.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.920
It's of the same
form at 5k integrated

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.550
with ik and some
number that you call x,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.150
which has been changed to this.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.320
So to bring in this and to
make it a little clearer--

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.770
and many times it's useful.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.680
If you have a
complex number, it's

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.510
a little hard to see the bump.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.199
Because maybe the bump
is in the real part

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.490
and not in the imaginary
part, or in the imaginary part

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.140
and not in the real part.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:12.470
So take the absolute value,
psi of x and t, absolute value.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.100
And now you say, ah, that's why.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.350
This is a pure phase.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.160
The absolute value of
a pure phase is that.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.140
So it's just the absolute value
of this one quantity, which

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:41.015
is the absolute value of psi at
x minus d omega dk k0 t comma

00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:41.515
0.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.375
So look what you've proven.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.310
The wave function-- the
norm of the wave function--

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.720
or the wave.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.910
The new norm of the
wave at any time t

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.930
looks like the
wave looked at time

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.280
equals 0 but just
displaced a distance.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:15.640
If there was a peak at x
equals 0, at time equals 0.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:22.790
If at time equals 0, psi had a
peak when x is equal to zero,

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.460
it will have a peak--

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.010
This function, which is the
wave function at time equals 0,

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.220
will have a peak when this
thing is 0, the argument.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.169
And that corresponds to x
equals to d omega dk times t,

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:46.300
showing again that the wave has
moved to the right by d omega

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.020
dk times t.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.890
So I've given two
presentations, basically,

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.180
of this very important
result about wave packets

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.930
that we need to understand.

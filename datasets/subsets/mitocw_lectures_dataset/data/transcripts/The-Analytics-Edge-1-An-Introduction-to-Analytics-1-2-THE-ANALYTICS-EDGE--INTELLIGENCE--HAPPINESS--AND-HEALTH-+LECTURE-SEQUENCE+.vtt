00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.090
Welcome to 15.071x,
The Analytics Edge.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.620
In this first lecture, we'll
discuss how analytics redefines

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.340
the meaning of intelligence,
how it can contribute

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
to your personal
happiness and health.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.770
Data is transforming
business, social interactions,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.680
and the future of our society.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.650
The amount of electronic data
that exists in the world today

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.600
is a phenomenal 2.7
zettabytes, which

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.630
is equal to the storage
required for more than 200

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.290
billion high-definition movies.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.700
Not only the amount of
data is extremely high,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.860
but it increases at
exponential rates.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.830
Our ability to effectively
process this data

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.440
is also increasing very rapidly.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.350
As an example, decoding
the human genome

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.460
originally took 10
years to process.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.600
Now it can be achieved
in just one week.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.670
Analytics is increasingly
important in the world today,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.710
and this influence is
expected to increase.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.340
McKinsey estimates that
there is a shortage

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.789
of 140,000 to 190,000 people
with deep analytical skills

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.080
to fill the demand of jobs
in the United States by 2018.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.320
IBM has changed its business
focus over the last 100 years

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.880
very successfully from
typewriters to mainframes

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.560
to personal computers
to consulting, and now

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.980
to analytics.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.530
It has invested over
$20 billion since 2005

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.030
to grow its analytics business.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.930
Companies will invest
more than $120 billion

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.530
by 2015 on analytics, hardware,
software, and services.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.580
Analytics is becoming
increasingly critical

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.370
in almost every industry,
from health care,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.280
to media, to sports, to finance,
to government, and many others.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.070
Let us give a
definition of analytics

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.750
so we make it as
concrete as possible.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.740
We define analytics to be
the science of using data

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.329
to build models that lead
to better decisions, that

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.810
add value to individuals, to
companies, to institutions.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.910
Note that there are four
ingredients-- data, models,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.720
decisions, and value.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.940
And all four are needed
in this definition.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.460
What are the key
messages of this class?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.350
First, analytics provides
a competitive edge

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.680
to individuals and companies.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.620
Analytics are often critical
to the success of a company.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.810
And they provide often the
decisive essential technology.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.410
Our teaching methodology is to
teach you analytics techniques

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.260
through real-world
examples and real data.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.120
And our overarching goal is to
convince you of the analytics

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.680
edge and inspire
you to use analytics

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.790
in your career and your life.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.210
The teaching team comes
from the Operations Research

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.000
Center at MIT and the
Sloan School of Management.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.190
I am Dimitris Bertsimas.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.460
I have received my Ph.D.
from MIT from 1985 to 1988.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.710
And I have been
with the MIT faculty

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.730
at the Sloan School of
Management since 1988.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.110
Currently, I'm the co-director
of the Operations Research

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.840
Center.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.079
My career is centered
in analytics.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.200
And I believe that analytics
can change the world.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.650
The other instructor of this
class is Allison O'Hair.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.540
Allison received her Ph.D. from
the Operations Research Center

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.890
at MIT in 2013.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.370
Allison and I have
worked together

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.160
in the area of health
care analytics,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.360
and are working at the moment
with our colleague Bill

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.010
Pulleyblank on an
analytics textbook.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.510
The teaching
assistants in the class

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.329
are Iain Dunning, Angie King,
Velibor Misic, John Silberholz,

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.440
and Nataly Youssef, all Ph.D.
students at the Operations

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.290
Research Center at MIT.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.940
To give you a sense of the
breadth of applications

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.440
in this class, we'll
cover the story

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.250
of IBM Watson, the computer
that beat the best human players

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.880
in Jeopardy!, the company
eHarmony, the Framingham Heart

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.890
Study, and D2Hawkeye,
a company that I have

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.490
been involved for
almost a decade.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.170
Other examples include
the story of Moneyball,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.670
how analytics can help predict
the Supreme Court decisions,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.630
the role analytics have
played in predicting

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.950
the outcomes of the US
presidential elections, how

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.760
analytics can utilize
effectively data from Twitter,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.720
Netflix, airline revenue
management, radiation

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.470
therapy, sports scheduling,
and many others.

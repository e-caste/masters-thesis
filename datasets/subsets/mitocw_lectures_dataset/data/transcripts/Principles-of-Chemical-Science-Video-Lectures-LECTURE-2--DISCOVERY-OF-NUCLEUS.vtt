00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Great.
Well, let's get going.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Last time we ended up by
discovering the electron.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We discovered the fact that the
atom was not the most basic

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
constituent of matter.
But in 1911 there was another

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
discovery concerning the atom,
and this is by Ernest

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Rutherford in England.
And what Rutherford was

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
interested in doing was studying
the emission from the newly

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
discovered radioactive elements
such as radium.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And so he borrowed,
or he got, from Marie Curie,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
some radium bromide.
And radium bromide was known to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
emit something called alpha
particles.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And they didn't really know
what these alpha particles were.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now, they did know that the
alpha particles were heavy,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
they were charged and that they
were pretty energetic.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That is what was known.
Of course, today we know these

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
alpha particles to be nothing
other than helium with two

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
electrons removed from the
helium, helium double plus.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Rutherford is in the lab and
has this radium bromide,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
alpha particles being emitted
and has some kind of detector

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
out here to detect those alpha
particles.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And he measures a rate at which
the alpha particles touch his

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
detector.
And it is about 132,000 alpha

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
particles per minute.
That's nice.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Then what he does is takes a
piece of gold foil and puts it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in between the radium bromide
emitter and the detector.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And that gold foil is actually
really very thin.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It is 2x10^-5 inches.
Two orders of magnitude thinner

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
than the diameter of your hair.
I often wonder how he handled

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that, but he did it.
He put it in the middle here

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and then went to count the count
rate as a result of putting this

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
foil there, and the count rate
is 132,000 alpha particles per

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
minute.
It didn't seem like that gold

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
foil did anything.
The alpha particles were just

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
going right through to the
detector.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It didn't even seem to matter
that there was that gold foil.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The post-doc that was working
on it, Geiger,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of the Geiger Counter,
was actually disappointed.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Gee, that is a boring
experiment.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But Geiger was even a little
bit more unhappy because he had

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
this undergraduate hanging
around the lab,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
this undergraduate named
Marsden.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And Marsden was really
enthusiastic about doing

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
something in the lab.
He really wanted to do

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
something.
And Geiger, you know,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
what am I going to do with this
kid?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Geiger goes to Rutherford,
look, this kid really wants to

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
do something.
What should I have him do?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And Rutherford said,
well, what you should have him

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
do is take this detector and
have him build it so that it can

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
be swung around.
So that it can be positioned

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
here.
So that we can check to see

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
whether or not any of these
alpha particles are

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
backscattered,
scattered back into the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
direction from which they came.
And Geiger went away and

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
thought, good,
this is something to give the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
undergraduate.
This is a ridiculous

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
experiment.
We know all the particles are

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
going right through the
detector.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Okay.
But Marsden was real happy.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
He gets to build this detector.
He swings it around and gets

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Geiger there to do the first
experiment.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
He puts the radium bromide and
they listen and hear tick,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Geiger says,
"Oh, it must just be

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
background.
Let me do a control experiment.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Let me take the gold foil out
of here so that all the

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
particles have to be going in
this direction."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They take the gold foil out of
there and listen,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and they hear nothing.
They put the gold foil back and

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
they hear tick,
tick, tick, tick,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
tick, tick.
And they put a platinum foil in

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
there and they hear tick,
tick, tick, tick,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
tick, tick.
Whatever metal they put in

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
there, there were some particles
coming off.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And they got Rutherford down in
the lab.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Rutherford looks them over
their shoulder.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
They do this again and again.
Hey, it is real.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It is real.
And what is coming off?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Well, the count rate is about
20 particles per minute.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Not large but not zero.
And the probability here of

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
this backscattering is simply
the number of particles

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
backscattered,
which is 20,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
over the total number of
particles, or actually the count

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
rate that the particles
backscattered over the total

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
incident count rate.
That is 2x10^-4.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
That is not zero.
Wow.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Rutherford was excited.
Rutherford later wrote,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
"It was quite the most
incredible event that has ever

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
happened to me in my life.
It was almost as incredible as

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
if you fired a 15 inch shell at
a piece of tissue paper and it

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
came back and hit you." What was
the interpretation?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
The interpretation was the gold
atoms that make up this foil,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
they must be mostly empty.
Now, they knew that those atoms

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
had some electrons in it because
the electron had already been

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
discovered.
But these alpha particles seem

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to be going right through those
gold atoms, for the most part.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The atom, which he knew to be a
diameter of about 10^-10 meters,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
most of that atom must be empty
was the conclusion.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But occasionally these helium
double plus ions,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
these alpha particles,
hit something massive.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And that something massive then
scatters those helium ions into

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
the direction from which they
came.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And since that probability is
small, well, the size of this

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
massive part has to be really
pretty small.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And from knowing the
probabilities and knowing

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
roughly what the diameter of the
atoms were and how many layers

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
of atoms he had,
he was able to back out of

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
those experiments a diameter for
this massive part of 10^-14

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
meters.
And he called this massive part

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the nucleus.
He called it the nucleus in

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
analogy to the nucleus of a
living cell.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
The heavy part,
the dense part in a living

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
cell-- that is where the name
"nucleus" comes from.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Now, Rutherford also realized
that this nucleus here has to be

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
positively charged.
He knew about electrons and

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
knew the atoms then were
neutral, and so he reasoned this

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
nucleus had to be positively
charged.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And then he did a bunch more
experiments, more sophisticated

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
experiments in which he actually
measured here the angular

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
distribution of the helium ion
scattered from the nucleus.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And from those very detailed
measurements of the angular

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
distribution,
he was able to back out the

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
fact that this nucleus,
the charge on it was actually

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
plus Z times e.
Z is the atomic number.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
e is the unit charge.
He did a bunch of different

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
metals and was able to establish
that the nucleus had a charge of

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
plus Z times e.
His model is that there is a

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
very dense center,
10^-14 meters.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
This diameter of the nucleus is
something that every MIT

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
undergraduate should know.
And he realized that then the

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
electrons have to fill out the
rest of this volume.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
That was his interpretation
from these results.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And think about Marsden,
what a great UROP experiment.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
He discovered the nucleus.
Isn't that great?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Marsden had a long and
successful career as a scientist

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
also after that.
Now, I should also tell you

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that this backscattering
experiment is really the essence

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of how a quark was discovered.
Quark are the fundamental

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
elementary particles in protons
and neutrons.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Essentially,
they took a high energy

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
particle, scattered it through
the proton or the neutron,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and it backscatters.
And, in that way,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
they discovered the quark and
measured the diameter of the

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
quark.
And this was done by a couple

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
of my colleagues in the Physics
Department.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Jerry Friedman and Henry
Kendall, who has since passed

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
away.
Jerry Friedman is still around.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
He loves to talk to
undergraduates,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and many of you will get that
opportunity.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Now it is time for us to do our
own Rutherford backscattering

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
experiment.
Yeah.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
[APPLAUSE]
Here is our gold lattice.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
These Styrofoam balls are the
gold nuclei.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
The space around them are the
electrons.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
These things in the center here
are just the posts on this

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
frame.
[LAUGHTER] This is a piece of

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
equipment from my lab that I
pressed into service,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and so I couldn't cut these
posts away because I would have

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
trouble taking my manipulator
out of my machine at a later

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
time.
So they are just there.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
But this is our one monolayer
of gold nuclei.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And so what are we going to do?
Well, what we are going to do

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
is try to measure the diameter
of these Styrofoam balls in the

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
same way that Rutherford did.
And so we are going to need

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000
some alpha particles.
What are we going to use for an

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
alpha particle?
Well, we have some ping-pong

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
balls for alpha particles.
Let's do that.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
We have 287 alpha particles,
or ping-pong balls,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and we are going to measure the
probability of backscattering.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
The probability of
backscattering will be the

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
number that actually backscatter
divided by the number that we

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
throw, or the total number.
That is what we are going to

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
measure.
But now I have to take this

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
probability and I have to relate
it to the diameter of these

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
nuclei.
How am I going to do that?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Well, that probability is going
to be equal to the total surface

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
area of the crystal here.
I have already measured the

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
total area.
I know that the total area is

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
2,148 square inches.
That is in the denominator,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000
but now the numerator is simply
the total area of the nuclei.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The total area of the nuclei is
the area of one nucleus,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
A sub i,
summed over the total number of

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
nuclei, which I have already
counted as 119.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And so the total area is
times the cross-sectional area

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
here of any one of these nuclei.
And that is pi d squared over 4.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I can solve that equation,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
for the diameter,
in terms of the probability.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And when I solve that equation,
d is equal to 4.79 times the

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
probability to the one-half
power.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
What we are going to do is
measure this probability by

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
throwing the ping-pong balls and
calculating and determining how

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
many backscatter.
And then we are going to use

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
that to get this diameter of the
nuclei.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The same experiment that was
done to actually measure the

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
diameter of the nucleus.
Now you are going to do this

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
experiment.
Every one of you are going to

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
get a ping-pong ball from the
TAs.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
TAs, why don't you give out the
ping-pong balls,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and then I will give you some
instructions.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
All right.
The pi d squared over 4

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is the cross-sectional
area in terms of the diameter of

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
these balls.
I just wrote it in terms of d

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
instead of r.
Yes?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
That is correct.
Good point.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
That balls that we are throwing
actually have size compared to

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
in the case of the Rutherford
backscattering experiment where

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
the projectile was almost a
point compared to the size of

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
the nucleus.
In our experiment,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
you are quite right,
our balls are about the

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
diameter there.
And so, if we were doing a more

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
exact experiment,
we would do a little different

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
calculation.
We would take into

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
consideration the size of the
actual ball that we were

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
throwing.
But we are not going to do

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
that.
Because we are not throwing

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that many balls,
we don't really have the

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
statistics to do a more exacting
kind of calculation.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But you are quite right.
Yes?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Well, he didn't know.
Although, he knew the fact that

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
it was backscattering,
that it had to be much,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
much less massive than the
nucleus.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I think that he also measured
the energy of the backscattered

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
particle.
And from that,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
you can back out the fact that
it is much less massive than the

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
nucleus.
There are a few other details,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
you are quite right,
that I have left out in this

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
discussion that he had to know
in order to get this number.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Here is the thing.
You have to aim your alpha

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
particles at this lattice.
And then you have to watch your

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
ball.
[LAUGHTER] You have to watch to

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
see if it scatters back at you,
because at the end I am going

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
to ask you if your ball
backscattered.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And we need an accurate count.
Now, if you hit one of these

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
things and it backscatters,
that doesn't count.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Only if it hits the Styrofoam
ball does it count.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
If it hits the Styrofoam ball
and goes through,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
that doesn't count.
It literally has to backscatter

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
at you.
Was there a question over here?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
If you miss you miss.
[LAUGHTER] Now,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I do invite you to come a
little closer so that you can at

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
least hit the crystal.
Yes?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
That is correct.
Well, you have got a defect.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
These are a little bit lighter.
Oh, you have some more here.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Oh, okay.
You can have a regular one.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Anybody need one yet?
I have a couple.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Oh, all right.
You need one?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Because I need them all thrown.
Did you have a question?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
What is the mean free path?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
That I am going to have to give
you an expression for at some

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
other time, but there is
certainly a decay pathway.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I have another ball here.
Now, are you ready?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000
You can come down closer,
but now I have one piece of

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
advice for you.
That is, only fools aim for

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.000
their chemistry professor.
[LAUGHTER] Go to it.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Did you throw your balls?
You missed the crystal.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
All right.
Has our supply of alpha

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
particles been exhausted?
All done?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
All right.
[APPLAUSE] Now comes the big

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
test.
How many of you had an alpha

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:33.000
particle that backscattered?
Let's keep your hand high

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
because I have to count
accurately.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
In this section I see one.
Two?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Cheater.
No.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
eight, nine,
ten, eleven,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
twelve, thirteen.
Did I get everybody?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I got everybody?
13?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Right, not deflection.
If it hit and went through,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
that does not count.
It has to come back at you.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Yes.
[LAUGHTER] That is right.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
All right.
Does anybody want to change

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
their count?
13 balls?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I am sorry?
If it just hit it and moved but

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
did not backscatter,
it does not count.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
The nuclei will move.
They will move,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
certainly, because there is a
momentum transfer.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Well, not quite like that.
No.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
We have 13 balls that
backscattered?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Okay.
Let's see what we got.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000
The probability,
here, then, is 13 over 287.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
That probability is equal to

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:29.000
If I now that this probability
and plug it into here,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:40.000
what we are going to get is a
diameter of 1.0 inches.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And the diameter on the average
of those particles is about 0.85

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
inches.
You did a really pretty good

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
job.
You got the diameter of the

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
nucleus.
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
That is great.
And that is the way the nuclear

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
diameter was,
in fact, measured and

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
discovered.
But now we have the problem

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
that the scientists had in 1912,
and that is what is the

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
structure of the atom?
We now know it has a nucleus.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
It has an electron.
How do they hang together?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Where are they in the atom?
We are going to talk about the

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
classical description here of
the atom.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
And the first question that we
have to ask is,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
what is the force that keeps
the electron and the nucleus

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
together?
What are the four fundamental

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
forces?
Gravity is one.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And that is the strongest or
the weakest?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Weakest.
Gravity.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Next stronger force?
Electromagnetic.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I will just abbreviate it EM.
Next stronger force?

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Weak force.
And the next?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Strong.
Weak and strong are

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
intranuclear forces.
They are operable between the

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
protons, the neutrons and the
other elementary particles that

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
make up the nucleus.
It does not have a lot of

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
effect, the weak and the strong
force, on chemistry,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
except for beta emission for
the radioactive elements.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Gravity actually does have no
known chemical significance to

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
chemistry.
And so all of chemistry is tied

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
up here in the electromagnetic
force, which I am,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
at the moment,
going to simplify and just call

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
the Coulomb force.
Now, we know how to describe

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
the Coulomb force between
charged particles.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
We know what expression to
write down.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Let's do that.
If we have the nucleus,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
which is positively charged,
and the electron here,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
which is negatively charged,
and they are at some distance r

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
between each other,
the expression that describes

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
how that force of interaction
changes with distance,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
this Coulomb's force law,
it is just the magnitude of the

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
charge of the electron times the
magnitude of the charge on the

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
nucleus over 4 pi epsilon nought
times r squared.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
I am going to just treat the
force as a scalar,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
just for simplicity purposes
here.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Epsilon nought is the
permittivity of vacuum.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
It is a factor in there for
unit conversation.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
r, then, is the distance
between the electron and the

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
nucleus.
What does this say?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Well, this says that when r
goes to infinity,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
what is the force?
Zero.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
The particles are infinitely
far apart.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
There is no force between them.
In this case,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
an attractive force between
them.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
When r is equal to zero,
what is the force?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Infinite.
And anywhere in between,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
that force is described by this
one over r squared

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
dependence.
You can see that as the

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
particles come closer and closer
together, the force between them

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
gets larger and larger.
The closer they get,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
the larger the force,
the more they want to be

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
together.
This expression is just telling

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
me, if I held one particle and
the other particle in my hand,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
and I held them at some
distance from each other --

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
That expression is just telling
me the force with which I have

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
to kind of exert to keep them
apart.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
But now, if I let them go,
you know what is going to

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
happen.
They are going to come

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
together.
They are going to want to come

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
together because of that force.
And what is not in this

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
expression?
What is not in that expression

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
is any information about how
those particles move under

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
influence of that force.
Nowhere in this expression is

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
there an r of t,
how that distance changes with

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
time.
And so what we need to describe

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
that is a force law.
And in 1911,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
the force law that seemed to
describe the motion of all

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
bodies, including astronomical
ones, of course,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
the equation of motion that
described how bodies move are

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Newton's equations of motion.
And, in particular,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
F equals ma.
And, of course,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
I can write that acceleration
as a time derivative of the

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
velocity, dv over dt.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
And that velocity,
of course, itself is a change

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
in the position with respect to
time.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
This is m, the second
derivative of r with respect to

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
time.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
If I know the force that is
operation, which is this,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
I can take this and plug it in
here, and I am going to have a

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
differential equation.
And that differential equation

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
is going to allow me to solve
for what r is as a function of

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
time, the distance between the
two particles.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
And it is going to allow me to
solve for that distance in a way

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
that we call deterministic,
exactly.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
In other words,
if I know where the particles

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
are to start with,
using this equation of motion,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
this force law,
I can tell you where those

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
particles are going to be for
all future time exactly.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
It is deterministic,
the classical mechanical

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
approach.
Now, in order to solve this

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
differential equation,
I am going to have to develop a

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
model for the atom.
All differential equations,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
for the most part,
describing physical processes

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
are going to need a model.
They are going to need some

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
boundary conditions or initial
conditions.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
And the model,
of course, that came to mind

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
for the atom,
is one in which the nucleus is

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
in the center.
And the electron moves around

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
that nucleus with uniform
circular motion and with a fixed

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
radius.
We are going to call that fixed

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
radius r star.
It is a planetary model.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
That seems like a good guess
for the structure of the atom.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Now, if you have a particle
undergoing uniform circular

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
motion at some well-defined
radius here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
That particle is being
constantly accelerated.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
And I can write that
acceleration a as the linear

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
velocity squared over that
radius of its orbit.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
It is being
accelerated because the velocity

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
vector.
The direction is changing,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
so there is a constant
acceleration.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Now, this expression,
for many of you,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
I pulled out of the air.
Some of you have seen it

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
before.
It is an 8.01 topic.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
You are going to see it this
semester, but later on and in

00:00:08.010 --> 00:32:15.000
You are not responsible for

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
this right now here,
but you will recall later on

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
this semester that you have seen
it here in 5.112.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
But, if this is the
acceleration,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
I can take this expression for
the acceleration and plug it

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
into here.
Plug in my operating force law.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
And, in so doing,
I am going to get --

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
-- e squared over 4 pi epsilon
nought r star squared.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
That is the F.
Mass times the acceleration,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
m times v squared over r star.
That is my equation of motion

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
particular to this problem of a
planetary model.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
And now I can solve that for v
squared, the linear velocity of

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
that electron going around the
nucleus.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
That comes out to be e squared
over 4 pi epsilon nought m r

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
star.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Now, the reason I wanted to
calculate the velocity squared

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
here is because I want to
calculate kinetic energy.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
And that is easy to do.
Kinetic energy,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I will call K,
is one-half m times v squared.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
If I plug in
the v squared right in there,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
I get one-half e squared over 4
pi epsilon nought r star.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:10.000
So far, everything looks okay.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
We have a planetary model.
Coulomb's law is operable.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
We know the acceleration.
We just calculated the kinetic

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
energy of this electron going
around the nucleus.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000
What I want to do now is I want
to know the total energy of the

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
system.
I just calculated the kinetic

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
energy of the system,
but I want to know the total

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
energy of the system.
And the total energy of the

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
system, I am going to call this
capital E, total energy,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
is the kinetic energy plus the
potential energy.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And I want the total energy of
the system for two reasons.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
One is I want to show you that
the system is bound,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
that the total energy is going
to be negative,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
that it is lower than the total
energy when the electron and the

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
nucleus are separated.
I want to show you that within

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
this classical model,
the electron and the nucleus do

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
look bound.
To do that, I need to show you

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
the total energy is negative.
To do that, I need to calculate

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
the potential energy.
That is what I want to do.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Secondly, I want to get an
expression for the total energy.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Because, using that expression,
I am going to show you how this

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
classical mechanics fails.
How Newton's equations of

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
motion won't work to describe
this problem.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Now, I have run out of time.
I will do that on Monday,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
but that is where we are going.
All right.

00:36:04.892 --> 00:36:07.000
See you on Monday.

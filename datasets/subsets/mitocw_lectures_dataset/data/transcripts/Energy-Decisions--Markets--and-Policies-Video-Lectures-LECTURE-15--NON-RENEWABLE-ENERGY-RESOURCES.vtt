00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.090
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So today,
we're going to talk about

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.850
non-renewable sources--

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.340
boring, dull, fossil stuff.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.530
The main reason for
talking about this stuff

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.780
is it's really important.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.660
It's about 92% of
US primary energy.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.410
And if you look global, and you
look just at marketed energy,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.660
forgetting gathered
wood and related stuff,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.080
it's also about 92%.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.090
And this is an EIA
graph that basically

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.390
shows the evolution of primary
energy supply from 1850

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.910
to 2000 or 2010.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.750
The point of this graph
is it changes slowly.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.420
1850 is all wood
and a little coal.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.930
Coal gets big, coal shrinks,
coal's still important.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.890
Oil's nothing, oil gets very
big, hasn't shrunk much.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.710
And renewables--
with a good glass,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.380
you can kind of
see them up here.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010
So these things change slowly.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.690
Fossil markets are important.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.000
They will continue
to be important.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.070
What I'm going to do
is a little bit theory,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.950
because you have to hear
about Hotelling when

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.400
we talk about non-renewable
natural resources,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.720
and then talk about why
Hotelling doesn't quite work,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.960
but why the key
insight holds, and then

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.540
just go through some markets.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.540
So I'll start natural gas today.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.540
I'm going to finish
it up on Wednesday,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.150
Wednesday, I want to have
a discussion basically

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.220
on fracking, and its related
technologies and implications.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.400
If you look at the readings,
there are some pros, some cons,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.930
some neutral.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.610
It is probably the
biggest energy development

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.800
in my lifetime, and it has lots
of pluses and minuses, which

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.590
I hope we can explore a
bit, which we won't resolve.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.450
They'll be resolved
in your lifetimes,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.228
but this is a big deal, not
just in the US where I'll focus,

00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:31.770
but globally.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.590
So the Hotelling decision,
the Hotelling theory,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.360
is pretty straightforward.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.700
You imagine you have 1,000
barrels of oil in the ground.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.690
You have a valve.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.210
You can pump it out whenever
you choose to pump it out.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.720
It costs you $30 a
barrel to pump it out.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.140
And you can produce
it whenever you want.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.050
The price of oil
today is $80 a barrel.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.640
If you know the future,
this theory says,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.040
how do you decide
when to produce?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.037
Brendan.

00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:10.985
AUDIENCE: You just
choose the days

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.907
when the oil prices are
the highest per barrel.

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:16.178
I mean, the oil per barrel
price is the highest.

00:03:16.178 --> 00:03:18.220
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
want to discount, maybe?

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.635
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you might

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:24.520
want to maximize
discounted net revenue.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.160
Marginal cost is the
same, by assumption.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.440
So yeah, you'd want
to maximize that.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.430
So you choose a time T or a
set of T's, if they're are all

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.150
equivalent, and pump it out.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.570
Is that clear?

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.310
That's sort of how you decide.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.320
You've got a choice of time now.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.788
So you look period by period.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.080
You say, when is the good time?

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.550
You'd pump it out then.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.570
Now, the interesting
question is,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.100
suppose the whole
world looks like this.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.610
Suppose everybody's got an
oil well exactly like yours.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.590
What has to happen
to the price of oil?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.410
Kirsten, want to take a shot?

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.010
What's the price
of oil have to do?

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.160
AUDIENCE: It has to
respond to demand.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.050
If all the oil wells
are exactly the same,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.876
then you're assuming
that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:17.709
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, I'm sitting here.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.067
I have 1,000 barrels
in the ground.

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:22.900
Everybody's got 1,000
barrels in the ground.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.890
There are a lot of us,
so it's competitive.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.660
And I have perfect foresight.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.490
I can see where the
price of oil is going.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.290
So if that market with
all of us with wells

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.680
like that and a known
demand curve, let's say,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.690
is going to be in equilibrium,
what has to happen to price?

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.480
OK, let me push
you a little bit.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.530
Suppose the price today--

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:57.050
suppose it's two periods,
and call that thing up there

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.720
"discounted net price."

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.690
Suppose discounted net
price today is higher than

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.130
discounted net price tomorrow.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.470
When do I produce?

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.305
AUDIENCE: Today.

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:07.430
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Today.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.320
And if we're
identical and we all

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.810
produce today, what
happens to today's price?

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.730
AUDIENCE: Goes down.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.440
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Goes down,
so it probably isn't going

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.180
to be higher than tomorrow's.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.240
Suppose it's lower
than tomorrow's.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.110
What do we all do?

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.318
AUDIENCE: Wait till tomorrow.

00:05:22.318 --> 00:05:24.027
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
And if we all wait--

00:05:24.027 --> 00:05:25.200
AUDIENCE: Then it goes down.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.700
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
If we all wait,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.750
then today's price goes up,
because nobody's producing.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.080
If it's equal to
tomorrow's, then we sort of

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.500
don't care when we produce.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.560
And it kind of can be
in equilibrium then,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.728
if it's equal.

00:05:40.728 --> 00:05:42.770
But if it's not equal, it
can't be an equilibrium

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.950
between the two days.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.330
Everybody see that?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.500
If the discounted net price
is different in two periods,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.800
it can't be in equilibrium,
because either you'll

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.810
switch out of one or you'll
switch into the other,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.150
and that'll upset the price.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.780
So if today's price is low,
if I expect the price to rise

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.050
rapidly, I won't produce.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.790
Neither will anybody else.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.700
Today's price won't be
low if nobody's producing.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.770
That's not an equilibrium.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.520
If today's price is high
relative to my expectations

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.350
tomorrow, I'm going to produce.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.980
And if we all produce,
it can't stay high.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.240
The only way you can
have an equilibrium

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.730
is if this quantity,
price minus marginal cost,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.680
rises at the rate of interest.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.190
If that rises at the
rate of interest,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.050
then I don't care
when I produce.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.120
Basically the other way to
think about it, that I think

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.310
maybe is the most
useful, is I've

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.040
got a choice between leaving
the oil in the ground

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.980
and leaving my
money in the bank,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.950
hypothetically getting
interest rate R. Sorry,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.830
I have a choice between
leaving the oil in the ground

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.590
and getting whatever I get based
on the future price of oil,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.590
or pumping the oil out and
putting the money in the bank.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.980
So I can either invest
in oil or in the bank.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.470
And unless those two are equal,
I won't be in equilibrium.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.860
And the mechanism I went
through with Kirsten

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:36.000
is if you're out of equilibrium,
if this equality doesn't hold

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.290
for all t, then we will, all
of us in a competitive market,

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.340
make changes in production
decisions that move you

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.920
in the direction of equilibrium.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:57.050
So if tomorrow's price is
low relative to today's, we

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.760
produce today, which
lowers today's prices,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.330
so that can't be an equilibrium.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.680
If today's price is low
relative to tomorrow,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.860
we all wait, which
raises today's price.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.510
Only if that equality
holds do we not

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.835
have an incentive, all of us, to
shift production dramatically.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.570
So it's investing.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.490
It's leaving it in the
oil versus leaving it

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.530
in the ground versus
putting it in the bank.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.765
If those two aren't
equal, you readjust.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:37.340
Is that pretty
straightforward at this stage?

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.909
OK, one thing that's
interesting about this story

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.789
is you'll notice that price
is above marginal cost

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.740
everywhere, even though
by assumption it's

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.820
a competitive market.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.780
How can that be?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:58.290
Well, that's because
when you produce today,

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.780
you incur not only the
marginal production costs,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.350
but you incur an
opportunity cost.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.500
With only 1,000 barrels,
if I produce today,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.080
I lose the chance of producing
that barrel in the future.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.600
So part of the cost
of producing today

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.660
is that opportunity cost, which
is why the equilibrium has

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.980
price above marginal cost.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.650
If price is equal to
marginal cost at all times,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.110
nobody's going to produce.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.140
Why would I produce today, given
that prices might be better

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.370
tomorrow, blah, blah, blah?

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:39.210
So that's the basic
Hotelling story--

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.280
that under competitive
conditions,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.810
price rises at the
rate of interest.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.370
This is the usual
picture with time.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.980
Price minus marginal
cost rises at the rate

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.610
of interest or simply enough--

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.280
with the given
demand curve, you're

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.110
basically running
up the demand curve

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.150
until you run out
of whatever it is.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.570
And this has quantity on the
axis and this time on the axis,

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.380
so that you can't go immediately
from one to the other,

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.960
but you see the point.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.610
And for simple cases, you
can just write it out.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.787
You can solve the equations.

00:10:16.787 --> 00:10:18.370
So under these
assumptions, it doesn't

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.078
matter when you produce
the oil if you're

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.720
a competitor, because
all these have

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.920
the same discounted net revenue.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.360
And if a monopoly has all the
oil and you're a competitor,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.160
you might want to
produce now because what

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.710
the monopolist will do
will have marginal revenue

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.480
minus marginal cost rise
at the interest rate.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.980
And if that doesn't make sense
to you, don't worry about it.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.000
We're not coming back to it.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.040
So you may want
to produce today.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.070
Now, this is a
really nice theory.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.300
This is very elegant.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.560
It's very simple.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.690
I didn't have to wave
my hands too rapidly,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.650
I think, to explain it.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.790
There's only one tiny
problem with it--

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.170
prices don't rise at
the rate of interest.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.460
These are oil prices.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.850
These are 2010 dollars,
so the lighter line

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.230
is the real price of oil.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.290
And that is not a smooth curve
rising at the rate of interest

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.090
at any time in any place.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.090
So the first thing
you have to ask

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:22.690
is, is that theory fundamentally
crazy or is it too simplified

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.530
by a bit?

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.410
And the answer is, I
think, it's too simplified.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.120
And I'm going to talk a little
bit about what it leaves out,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.680
without trying to do anything
more complex than that.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.725
It's important.

00:11:40.725 --> 00:11:42.600
So there are a bunch of
things it leaves out.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.100
I think the most important
one is exploration,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.700
because you don't have 1,000
barrels in your well ever.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.920
You don't know what you've got.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.400
If you think about--
just focus on oil--

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.670
you look for promising geology.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.070
You explore it.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.650
You drill to prove the reserves.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.700
You refine your estimates.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.330
A former teacher of mine
just said Hotelling is wrong.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.650
It's not a tank of
oil, it's an inventory.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.920
As an oil company,
you build inventory,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.370
and then you run down inventory.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.090
So reserves at any time are the
result of a set of decisions.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.200
But the decisions have
this same dimension.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.540
When do you explore?

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.250
When do you invest?

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.250
When do you lease a tract?

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.450
When do you drill?

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.920
How many wells do you drill?

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.380
Those are all when decisions.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.810
Those are all
intratemporal decisions.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.500
And you have to think about
today's price and tomorrow's

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.700
price.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.800
And if you think today's
price is really low

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.940
and tomorrow's price is
going to be better, you wait.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.010
If you think today's
prices are high

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.460
and you can get the oil out
in a hurry, you move ahead.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:09.280
So this same notion that's
in the simple model, that

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.650
says I've got to think
about the path of price

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.170
to make decisions,
holds true, but these

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.720
are much more
complicated decisions.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.710
and in the face of uncertainty,
because you don't really

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:26.420
know reserves or demand
or anything else.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.100
And interesting little number--

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.810
from proved reserves, you
can look up a definition,

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.990
but it means reasonably likely
you can get that oil out

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.510
at commercial costs.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.680
So from the end of 1976
to the end of 2009,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:52.550
proved oil reserves in the US
fell by 10.26 billion barrels.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.710
How much do you think was
produced over that period?

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.830
How many of you think more
than 20 billion barrels

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.750
was produced over that period?

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.260
Reserves fell by 10.26.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.510
How many think that over
that period, more than 20

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.330
were produced?

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.950
OK, how many over 30?

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.610
Anybody think over 40?

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.450
78 and a half--

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.140
continuing process of
exploration, discovery,

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.810
proving the reserves,
expanding the field,

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.420
investing in recovery.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.030
Reserves are an inventory.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.650
You still have to decide
when, some cases if.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.850
You can lease a tract
that you can drill in.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.580
You may decide not to drill.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.770
You have a certain
amount of time.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.750
You decide not to
pick up the option.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:53.700
But all these decisions are
when decisions, but that's

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.380
why we're going to run out of
oil because reserves are low.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.970
Reserves are always low.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:59.900
This is the point.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.380
There's no point in building
up huge reserves, which

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.650
is an activity of exploration,
and investment, and discovery,

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.800
and so forth.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800
There's no point building
up reserves you're not

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.925
going to need for 50 years.

00:15:10.925 --> 00:15:14.550
Why make that investment now?

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.610
So that's one story.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.340
Exploration is a big story.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.490
It involves a lot of
when decisions, just

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.960
like the simple model.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.170
The other part of the
story is depletion.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.230
And depletion operates
at two levels--

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.620
a given oil field will
eventually stop producing.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.210
You will have all the oil out.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.700
But a given geographic
region like the US,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.040
it gets harder and harder.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.470
There's a reason
we're drilling miles

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.370
off the coast in the Gulf
of Mexico and miles down.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.110
The first wells in
Pennsylvania, the oil

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.320
was coming out of the ground.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.750
They basically used buckets.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.700
It's a little harder now.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.290
Cost rises.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.100
The other side of
the coin, of course,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.460
is that we're
getting better at it.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.370
And people in the oil business
talk about the price of oil

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.240
as a race between
depletion and innovation.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.200
It's harder to find it.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.490
It's harder to get
it out of the ground.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.115
We're getting better at finding
it and better at getting it out

00:16:11.115 --> 00:16:12.120
of the ground.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.620
There's no guarantee that
technology wins that race.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.570
So far it's done quite well, but
these massive things offshore--

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.130
we'll see how far that goes.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.080
And of course, you don't know.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.580
But one of the things--

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.200
you don't know the
supply, demand,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.980
what competitors are doing.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.310
So a lot of the fluctuations
in price you see

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.750
are due to just uncertainty.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.610
People misguess.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:39.510
There is a recession.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.410
The demand falls.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.660
There's a sudden, boom that
people hadn't anticipated.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.100
Demand rises.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.150
And particularly in oil, where
we spend a fair amount of time,

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.090
there isn't much flexibility.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.980
It's not quite like
that Hotelling model

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.350
where you basically
have a valve.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.600
When you've drilled and
there's pressure in the field,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.450
you tend not to shut a well in.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.040
That has a variety
of consequences.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.685
So in the short run-- and
it's expensive to store oil.

00:17:06.685 --> 00:17:07.560
I mean, you store it.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.190
It is stored, but it's not
stored in gigantic quantity.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.670
So there's relatively
inelastic supply.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.410
When we talked
about demand curves,

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.480
we talked about relatively
inelastic demand.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.670
And that means you've got
a steep supply curve--

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.910
let's see-- a steep supply
curve and a steep demand curve.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.390
And when they move,
price is very volatile.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.270
At the risk of-- well, there's
no eraser so I'm saved having

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:40.150
to use the blackboard, but
imagine a steep demand curve

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.680
and a steep supply curve--

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.480
little fluctuations move price.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.770
Thank you.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.150
And of course, it's not
a competitive market.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.960
There's OPEC.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.410
OPEC has a variety
of motivations

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.060
that are complicated.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.410
And modeling and trying
to understand OPEC,

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.440
people make nice livings
trying to do that.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.220
So that's sort of
what's missing.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.860
Oh, and of course, politics.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.320
Why in heaven's name would
you drill miles deep,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.780
miles offshore, when
you can produce oil

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.340
in Saudi Arabia for
$3 or $4 a barrel?

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.260
Why are we spending
these and doing

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.710
these incredible feats of
technology, risky technology?

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.830
And the answer is, it's
not a unified world market

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.870
politically.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.883
OK, comments about any of that?

00:18:32.883 --> 00:18:34.050
Questions about any of that?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.510
OK, I'm now going to, to the
extent that time permits,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.050
sort of walk through.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.282
Prosper, did you have your
hand up or were you just--

00:18:47.282 --> 00:18:48.240
thought it was up here.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.520
I didn't know.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.200
OK, I'm now going to just
walk through these markets--

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.690
first oil, then coal, then
uranium, and then I'll

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:58.860
start natural gas.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.160
Oil, again, some basic facts,
some numbers, blah, blah, blah.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.360
Oh, the key thing--

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.500
I was told this years ago, that
the key thing to pass yourself

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.960
off as an energy
economist, the key number

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.570
you need to without fail--

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.620
write this down--

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.170
42 gallons in a barrel.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.840
That's the number, 42
gallons in a barrel--

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.040
very esoteric.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.470
That's the number, 42 gallons.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.440
Oil is a global market.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.020
It's best model is a pool.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.770
Supply goes in the pool,
demand comes out of the pool.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.860
It's moved by
pipelines and tankers.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.800
Tankers can change
direction in mid-ocean.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.290
They often do.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.005
Active markets, spot
market, futures markets--

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.600
it's there are good data
on all of these markets.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.925
During the first Gulf War,
it was a source of some--

00:20:02.925 --> 00:20:04.300
there were a lot
of people saying

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.570
we should shut down the futures
markets because the futures

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:08.950
markets were
showing high prices.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.840
Because oil was
tough because Iraq

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.110
had suddenly come
off the market.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:21.070
The argument that won the
day against shutting down

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.990
the futures market was
that the futures market

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.920
was predicting a rapid
decline in the price of oil.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.170
You could do a term structure.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.628
You could say, what
does the market

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:33.053
predict January, February,
March, April, and so forth?

00:20:33.053 --> 00:20:34.470
And the futures
market was saying,

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.020
we expect this to
be a short war.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.400
And it was possible to make--

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.430
I was one of those who made it--
the argument that why would you

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.510
shut off something that is,
in fact, A, useful, and B,

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.350
providing exactly the signal
that you want to send--

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.360
that it'll be a short war.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.450
So very, very active
markets, global.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.480
The production is
concentrated, as we know,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.210
a lot of it in unstable places.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:05.160
OPEC is a complicated cartel.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.010
Saudi Arabia has
been the big player,

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.690
and about the only
holder of excess capacity

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.680
for most of the period.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.780
And price has been volatile.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.080
So let me elaborate
a little bit.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:28.270
International oil trade in 2010
was about 65% of production.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.260
So about 65% of world
production crossed

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.930
an international border.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.920
And if you look at
the big numbers here--

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.020
that's a big number,
that's a big number, that's

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.100
a big number--

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:48.110
the big sources are Russian
oil going mainly to Europe,

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.400
but also some to China--

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.870
Russian oil.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.130
Middle Eastern oil
going everywhere,

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.230
including to the US.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.390
Canadian oil coming to the US.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.000
In fact, Venezuelan
oil coming to the US.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.440
But importantly, the Mid East,
if you add up those numbers,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.440
that's a lot of numbers.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.630
And you add up, look
at the Russian numbers,

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.330
they're pretty significant.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.330
Globally, the Middle
East is about 30%.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.160
This is not a great chart, but
the Middle East is this bar.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.320
It's about 30% of
world production.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.650
It's over half of
proved reserves.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.700
So this is reserves over time.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.070
And this is a nice graph.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.530
All these things are
from the BP Statistical

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.320
Report, which is--
again, you can't read it,

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.310
but it's a good reference.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:44.860
Look first at how global
reserves have expanded,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.290
and they've continued to
expand for a long time.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:52.240
Global reserves have
gone up by almost 40%

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.790
between 1990 and 2010.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.135
The Middle East still
has over half, 54.4.

00:22:58.135 --> 00:23:02.950
Its share has declined
from 66 to 54.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.450
So people are exploring.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.370
And they're exploring
outside the Middle East,

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.840
as well as inside
the Middle East,

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.965
which is why the Middle
Eastern share has declined.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.670
This is OPEC's
share of the world

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.610
market over time, world output.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:19.570
And it has varied.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.880
These are the countries
in the Persian Gulf,

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.270
including Saudi Arabia,
that offloads into the Gulf.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.650
In reaction to the
first energy shock,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.030
you got lots of
investment outside OPEC

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.440
to expand capacity.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.800
And OPEC's share of output fell.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.680
It rose again.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.590
This runs out in
1997, and I haven't

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.390
seen a graph that
continues, but it

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.660
will have declined since 1997.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.470
But it's varied.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.150
It's varied over time.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.660
Even at 30%, OPEC
had the ability

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.690
to make a significant
difference to world prices.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.190
Again, short-run supply,
inelastic, short-run demand,

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.710
inelastic, very
steep demand curve.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.130
Change supply a little
bit, you can move price.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.980
So OPEC has had that ability.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.920
This is the final oil slide.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.748
This makes a point.

00:24:15.748 --> 00:24:17.290
It's really important
to keep in mind

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.040
when you listen to the media.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.200
This is a ranking of--

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.770
it's 2007 is the
latest I could find,

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:32.620
but it's companies ranked
by worldwide reserves.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:36.840
And the key thing is
there is ExxonMobil.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.380
ExxonMobil that we think of as
this giant company on the world

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:46.270
market is, on the world
market, not a giant company.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.850
There's Saudi,
there's Iran, there's

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.540
Qatar, which is mostly
gas, but there's Iraq,

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.320
there's Venezuela, there's
Abu Dhabi, there's Kuwait.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.030
And you have to come
pretty far down--

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.730
and those are all
government companies.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.070
Those are all
state-owned enterprises,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.780
creatures of the government.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.780
You've got to come pretty
far down before you get--

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:13.990
and there is Gazprom, Nigeria,
Kuwait, PetroChina, even.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.570
You've got to come pretty
far down before you

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.650
get to ExxonMobil.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.670
The Brazilian firm has
just found a huge oil field

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:25.300
off Brazil.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.500
So that will come up.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.780
The big companies are
government companies.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.400
The big players are governments.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.530
It's a single world market.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:36.620
Questions about oil?

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.120
Yes.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.662
AUDIENCE: So the
Middle East reserves

00:25:38.662 --> 00:25:40.310
have declined as a proportion.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.768
Do you think it's
because they just

00:25:41.768 --> 00:25:44.740
don't have an incentive to
explore now, they have so much?

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.820
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, they have explored.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.560
I think they're just
not as aggressive.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.770
Model them as a monopoly
facing competitors.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.850
They might not be aggressive.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.810
They still have a pretty
commanding position--

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:03.148
over half of reserves, running
now about 30% of production.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.320
I think they're just
not being as aggressive.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.660
I mean, you're not
drilling miles offshore

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.950
in the Persian Gulf.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.100
You're drilling miles
offshore in Louisiana.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.830
So you're drilling
in the North Sea

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.850
in very difficult conditions.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.300
The Saudis don't have to
do that, and they don't.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.982
They could be more aggressive.

00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:25.190
I don't know if there's
anything in the Persian Gulf,

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:29.720
but there are big fields
that aren't being pushed.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.400
But this isn't trivial.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.470
They have expanded
their reserves.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.410
And they've obviously
produced a lot in this period,

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.840
as well as expanding
reserves, so they're not just

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.650
sitting there.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.390
But they're less aggressive.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.020
Question about?

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I don't know
if [INAUDIBLE] the oil price.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.880
Would you happen to know the
volatility of the oil price

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.818
compared to, I don't know,
the stock market volatility?

00:26:53.818 --> 00:26:56.360
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, it's
really fascinating, isn't it?

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:02.030
I mean, when you go back here--

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:07.390
so this is in dollars, not
inflation-corrected dollars.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.830
So there's this long period.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.120
Yeah, it's volatile when
you take it up to 2010,

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.440
but this is--

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.990
we've lost the axis-- this
is between $1, $2, and $3

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.130
down here.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.290
So this is between $1 and $3.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:30.070
I guess it's fairly volatile,
but frankly, $3 a barrel

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:36.610
for oil, 42 gallons, $3
for half that in gasoline,

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.190
and then distribution
charges, not a big deal.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:47.740
This is hard to match, the
spike at $80 and the spike that

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.730
we're still debating
in 2008, I guess,

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.230
or 2007, whichever
one that hit in.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.420
I forget.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.180
That's just remarkably volatile.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.980
This one we understand.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.940
That was politics.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.100
That was a huge supply cut.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.840
This appears to be a
significant, unanticipated

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.350
increase in demand with very
inelastic short-run supply.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.070
But it is still being debated.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.700
There are people who say,
well that must be speculation.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.160
And you say, well, yeah,
but if you bought oil

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.830
at those high prices,
you took delivery.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.690
People actually got the stuff.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.810
People were taking
delivery at these prices.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:27.650
That isn't paper.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.870
That's barrels of oil
coming off a tanker.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:35.210
So it's hard to tell a
speculative story, I think.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.357
I think it's supply
and demand, but you're

00:28:37.357 --> 00:28:39.440
right-- that's just that's
as volatile as anything

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.060
you're ever going to see.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.850
And nobody expects
volatility to go back

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:48.050
to all these good, old days
because the politics haven't

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.280
gotten any simpler.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:55.020
If there is a war in Iran, you
will see a heck of a spike.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.530
And in fact, we and the
Europeans and others

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.440
are in the process of putting
sanctions on Iran designed

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.480
to limit their exports.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.030
Well, if the Saudis
don't pick up the slack,

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.680
we'll see another spike.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.220
We'll see.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.315
Anything else?

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:13.777
AUDIENCE: So the cost of
production was $3, $4?

00:29:13.777 --> 00:29:15.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I'm making up a number,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.485
but the cost of production
in the Middle East

00:29:17.485 --> 00:29:19.510
is well below the market price.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.640
AUDIENCE: And I'm just
wondering if it's $5,

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:27.193
and the cost of a barrel
of oil is $100 [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:27.193 --> 00:29:29.110
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, remember, the price

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.068
is always going to be
above marginal production

00:29:31.068 --> 00:29:34.220
cost because of the
opportunity cost argument.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.090
So that's not a big surprise.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:42.130
And the low-cost producers
in the Middle East

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.220
are not behaving like
pure competitors.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.240
They're restricting output.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.390
So yeah, there was a time
when the price of oil

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.650
was, I don't know--

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:56.110
well, look here-- when the price
of oil in the '73 shock went up

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.440
to-- and I think it--

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.570
I can't quite read this.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:06.270
Oh, this is some sort of blended
price, which I don't quite get.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.850
But the price of oil quadrupled.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.410
The cost of oil
didn't quadruple.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.060
And it stayed high.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.230
Look at the money of the day,
which is where we all live.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.905
It went up dramatically.

00:30:18.905 --> 00:30:20.280
Oh, you know what
the problem is?

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.740
I think this is in--

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.920
what is it dollars per--
yes, I never understood.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920
No, it's per barrel, OK.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.350
I thought it was per
ton of oil equivalent.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:34.280
But the price quadrupled
in a few months.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.930
And the cost didn't.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.690
That was pure market power.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.500
And if they were making
money at these prices,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.660
they were making a lot
of money at those prices.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.300
The journals were full of
articles about recycling

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.160
petrodollars, and
where were they

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.057
going to invest
them, and so forth.

00:30:52.057 --> 00:30:54.390
They managed to manage to
figure out ways to waste them,

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:55.480
so that was all solved.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.070
But yeah, that's--

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.460
And the cost now, who knows what
the cost of production is now?

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.730
There's also a number that
you see floating around.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.450
It's called the "finding cost."

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:13.950
There's one thing is the cost
of drilling and getting it out

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:14.533
of the ground.

00:31:14.533 --> 00:31:16.530
The other is the
cost of finding it,

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.060
which is the exploration,
and proving, and so forth.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.200
And those costs
have gone up a bit.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.110
The cost of producing it out
of an big known Saudi reserve

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.518
is turning a valve,
almost, short run.

00:31:28.518 --> 00:31:30.060
Long run, you've
got to-- medium run,

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.160
you've got to put the
piping and stuff in.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.630
Long run, you've got to find it.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:37.170
Medium run, cost pretty
low, well below price--

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.810
not off Louisiana.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.460
That's not far below the price.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.730
That's expensive stuff.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.150
So you have a range of costs.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.940
You have a range of
behaviors in this market.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.290
Anything else on oil,
questions on oil?

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:52.790
Yeah.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.248
AUDIENCE: Did the
sanctions on Iran

00:31:54.248 --> 00:31:56.030
have an effect on the
supply and demand.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: What
would have an effect?

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.478
AUDIENCE: The sanctions on Iran
because when Iran sells it,

00:31:59.478 --> 00:32:01.480
it can, pretty much,
with a phone call,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.730
go anywhere else in the world.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:03.680
Really, is it--

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.555
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I
don't know the answer.

00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:12.380
I know the problem is, if
we don't buy oil from Iran,

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.160
who cares?

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.470
Because they can sell to
other people and they'll

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.550
just displace other suppliers.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:21.350
So this was like when the
Arabs refused to sell oil

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.902
to the US in the '70s.

00:32:22.902 --> 00:32:24.110
We had been buying from them.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.580
We bought from others.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.680
And their oil went to
others, and so forth.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.730
If the US, and the EU,
and Japan, let's say,

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:40.550
have effective refusals
to buy Iranian oil, that's

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.365
enough that it might be hard for
them to find demand elsewhere.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.270
It gets to be a
quantitative question.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:56.130
If we can block
enough exits for them,

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.730
they may have a hard
time selling it.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.630
The question is, who buys then?

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.060
So I just don't know
whether it's had an effect

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.210
or whether people really think
it's going to have an effect.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.440
There are a lot of people--

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.940
I mean, a lot of
the other sanctions

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.320
have had an effect on Iran.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.570
You read discussions about
living in Iran these days.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.640
It's not very good.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.500
The economy is pretty
much in the toilet,

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.020
but how much of that's
the oil sanctions

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.630
and how much is everything else
we've done, I just don't know.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:24.130
OK.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:24.910
Anything else?

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:25.890
Yeah, Scott.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.470
AUDIENCE: Can we go back to
the slide with the picture

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.500
where the oil from different
countries are going?

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.875
I had a question
about something.

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:38.500
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah-- not quickly.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.120
There.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.953
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:33:39.953 --> 00:33:43.810
So it looks like the oil from
the US is going into Mexico,

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.030
and then the oil from
Mexico is going into the US.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.340
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
there's a little border trade.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.610
It's not a big number.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.310
AUDIENCE: So is that
because it's cheaper

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.377
to buy oil from Mexico than
to produce it ourselves?

00:33:54.377 --> 00:33:56.710
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
some of it is just geography.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.620
I mean, I'm little
surprised by that.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.000
You always see it
in the numbers,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.070
that we're exporting
something to somebody.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:07.900
It must be-- and some of this
is refined product rather than

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.590
crude.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.989
So yeah, maybe we
have a refinery here

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:15.820
that it makes sense to export
refined product to Monterrey.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.900
And they happen to have--

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:17.500
I don't know where they're--

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.880
I don't think they have
any fields up here.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.650
I'm not sure what
they're exporting to us,

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:25.449
but I'm assuming that some
of this is refined product.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.219
I don't know why would
be shipping crude.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:30.850
And I talk about
this as if it's easy,

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.449
but this is pipeline,
the US-Mexico's pipeline.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:37.659
It's almost
certainly not tanker.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.580
And of course, it's
where are the pipelines,

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.020
where are the demands.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.020
You could imagine as
Monterrey grows in Mexico,

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.060
it might be cheaper
since it's in the north.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.210
It might be cheaper to supply
it from the southern US

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.699
than from farther
south in Mexico.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.050
And maybe this is tanker.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.870
Maybe they put stuff and
take it to the West Coast.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:57.910
I don't know, but
you've got to figure

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:02.440
this has as much to do with
transport costs, pipeline

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.230
location, shipping
cost, refineries,

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.050
as getting it out of the ground.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.880
Mexico has a little
bit of a problem.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.050
Mexico has a constitutional
bar against foreigners

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.130
owning natural resources.

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:21.170
And that means they've operated
with a state-owned oil company

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.960
since the 1911--

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.780
no, since the 1930s
when they kicked out

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.490
the foreigners completely.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:31.010
And the state-owned oil
company has been inefficient

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.470
and has had a hard time
getting technology.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:37.250
So they're facing
production declines,

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.500
and facing
constitutional problems

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.810
of how do you bring
in foreign technology.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.720
So it's sort of an
interesting question.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.520
Yeah.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.600
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry, just
to throw some light on that.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.760
When I worked at JPM
on the crude oil desk,

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.760
one of the things they
used to always talk about

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.460
was the geographic difference
between a defense district

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.990
called PAD 5 over there, which
includes all of the West Coast.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:02.330
And there's severe
geographical limitations

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.620
that don't allow oil to
actually be transported.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.980
So they actually trade
completely differently

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.420
in terms of oil pricing.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.120
And because a lot of our oil
comes from Cushing, Oklahoma,

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.850
which is like that
central point over there,

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:17.120
they might have to exchange
it across international lines,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.650
even if it's crude oil.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:21.150
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You think
it might be refined in Mexico

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.778
and brought back as product.

00:36:22.778 --> 00:36:23.278
Yeah.

00:36:23.278 --> 00:36:26.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:29.734
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, that's a nice point.

00:36:29.734 --> 00:36:32.992
They're called PADs, or
Petroleum Allocation Districts,

00:36:32.992 --> 00:36:33.950
or something like that.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.200
It's a Cold War term, I think.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.325
AUDIENCE: Defense district
also included somewhere.

00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:38.660
It was created during wartime.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.077
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, I think

00:36:40.077 --> 00:36:41.430
that's a World War II thing.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.580
It's not real easy
to pump anything

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.470
across the Rocky Mountains.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:50.120
And so the West Coast tends
to operate separately.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.180
Alaskan oil tends
to come down here,

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.360
even though it'd be better
to sell it to Japan.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.030
And of course, Canadian oil--

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.710
you know the Keystone
Pipeline debate,

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.877
if you've been following it.

00:37:01.877 --> 00:37:04.310
Where Canadian oil goes is
another interesting question.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.530
But yeah, that's interesting.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:11.060
It may be that it's cheaper to
get Mexican oil into California

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.940
than to get oil from
elsewhere in the US,

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.710
and that some US oil--

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.470
this is the puzzler,
that we're shipping.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.930
It may be to be
refined in Mexico.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.787
It may be refined product
into the north of Mexico

00:37:23.787 --> 00:37:25.370
if they're short of
refinery capacity.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.810
AUDIENCE: I think the
oil pipelines go straight

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:27.352
into Cushing.

00:37:27.352 --> 00:37:28.435
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:37:28.435 --> 00:37:30.650
AUDIENCE: They might not
be able to even reverse

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.140
the flow, which they've
actually been doing recently.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.107
But back then, maybe,
when this was made,

00:37:35.107 --> 00:37:36.440
they weren't able to reverse it.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.843
So they have to move it and
then actually physically

00:37:38.843 --> 00:37:39.510
bring it around.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.260
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, these are 2010.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.410
these are 2010 data.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:43.910
So--

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:46.250
AUDIENCE: I think the reversal
happened just this year.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: This year.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.130
OK, happy to learn.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.300
Anything else?

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.160
OK, let me go to coal.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.130
Coal is concentrated.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:05.970
As that earlier case indicated,
we're probably the OPEC of coal

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.890
or the Saudi Arabia of coal.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.528
It is traded.

00:38:09.528 --> 00:38:11.070
Coal trades
internationally, and I'll

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.850
show you some numbers on that.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:16.540
But it has a high
weight to value ratio.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.930
So it's not quite as
easy to handle as oil

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.450
and it's not quite
as valuable as oil.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.030
So it's like international
trade in rocks.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.730
There is some, but
there isn't that much

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.740
because it's expensive.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.520
Markets are mainly national.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.890
There are some differences.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:36.420
We tend to have lower
prices than elsewhere.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.870
This isn't a business where
there are a lot of spot markets

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:40.830
and futures markets.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:44.460
There are some, but it's
mostly long-term contracts.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.200
And the world fact is this
unbelievable recent increase

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.810
in the Chinese use of coal
that we talked about earlier--

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.360
"unbelievable" is the
wrong term, but it's huge.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.870
I have to say I revised this
from last year's lecture.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.540
And the Chinese numbers
are dramatically different.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.770
It's kind of shocking.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.400
This is production and reserves.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.730
So you will see we have over
a quarter of the world's coal

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:09.840
reserves.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.480
China sort of comes in--

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.150
well, Russia comes
in second at 18%.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:19.380
China comes in third, but look
at that-- the Chinese produce

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:26.448
almost half the coal in
the world, 48% as of 2010.

00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:28.240
That's a number that
deserves to be in red.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.630
It was somewhere in the 20s
the last time I did this.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.050
Well, I did it two years ago,
so somewhere in the 20s or 30s.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:38.740
But it's relatively
concentrated.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.380
These five countries
account for 80% of output

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.000
and three-quarters of reserves.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.558
Again, these are
reserves, of course.

00:39:45.558 --> 00:39:48.100
Does that mean we've looked for
coal everywhere in the world?

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.373
No.

00:39:49.373 --> 00:39:51.040
Does that mean there
isn't a lot of coal

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.207
in places we haven't looked?

00:39:52.207 --> 00:39:52.810
No.

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.185
But we've looked
in these places,

00:39:54.185 --> 00:39:56.980
and we found a lot of it
in the US and a lot of it

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.090
in China and Russia.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.770
There may be some--

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.210
people talk about
coal in Africa,

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:05.670
but there hasn't been
that much exploration.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.580
Only about 15% of
production of coal

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.930
crosses international lines.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.840
So it really isn't like oil.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.630
These are the big exporters.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.300
And I didn't add up the
shares, but you can do that.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:23.970
We do export out of both coasts,
but I think mostly the East

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.230
Coast to Europe.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:29.660
The big exporters, though,
are Australia and Indonesia.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.970
And if you look at who
the big importers are,

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:35.000
you can see immediately
where it goes.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.800
Not only does China
produce a lot of coal,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.860
but they're the second-leading
importer of coal.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.200
So you have Australian
and Indonesian coal

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.900
going, to a decent
approximation, China, Japan,

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.780
and South Korea--

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.960
again, fairly concentrated.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.030
Expensive, not cheap to ship
this stuff, but huge demands.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.350
Japan has no energy.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:59.750
China has coal, but
China needs more coal

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.330
than it can produce
in the short run.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:03.660
So that's the flow.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.120
I don't have a good picture.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.260
Not a world market.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.350
You can't read this
well, but these are

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:11.930
Japanese prices in this column.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.835
Those are the ones that matter.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.340
Either column, you
will see they're

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.220
higher than the US
prices typically.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.120
And the European prices are a
bit higher than the US prices

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.290
typically.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.830
You can't do that for oil.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.140
The price of oil
is pretty uniform.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.500
But you can for coal.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.510
And this is the graph
that's shocking.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.240
This is world coal use.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.540
You see it rising gently
and then exploding.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.790
And if you look
behind that picture,

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.610
the explosion is mostly China.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:02.560
In the US, it's worth
looking at states.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.430
Production is
fairly concentrated.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:13.180
Wyoming coal is mined mostly
big strip-mining operations,

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.950
massive strip-mining operations,
close to the surface.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.240
Surface is taken off.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:19.810
You go down.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.610
You strip away a layer of coal.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.520
This coal tends to
have a low sulfur

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.610
content, the Western
coal, the Wyoming coal.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:31.930
So it's less polluting
on that dimension.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.270
There is a mix of low-
and high-sulfur coal

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:38.480
in these main mining regions
in the East, West Virginia,

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.800
Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.040
So those five states account
for almost three-quarters

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.110
of production.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.750
Consumption is much
less concentrated.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:51.250
This is for power
plants, but that's

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.260
almost all coal consumption--

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.840
Texas, Ohio-- these
are the states

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.480
with cheap electric
rates because they

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.310
burn a lot of coal.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.710
I got anything else on coal?

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.660
Yeah, that's about it on coal.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.960
Questions, comments,
reactions about coal?

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.700
Not the most
exciting of products,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:18.350
but very important and dirty--

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.520
not to be prejudicial.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.840
Anything?

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.290
OK, I'll say a little
bit about uranium.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:30.160
There isn't much that you
can find about uranium--

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.400
essentially nothing
in the BP book.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.980
And I'm focusing on uranium
rather than nuclear power

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.000
because that's the
nonrenewable part, is uranium.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.845
But it's also
relatively unimportant.

00:43:42.845 --> 00:43:44.470
I mean, it's not an
important component

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:49.390
of the cost of
nuclear electricity.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.070
It does seem to be
a global market.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.440
I'll explain that
in a little bit.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.470
Reserves are fairly dispersed.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:44:00.550
I mean, again, not clear there's
been extensive exploration

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.200
in lots of these places.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.620
You remember the
yellowcake from Niger,

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.020
very exciting in the run-up
to the second Gulf War.

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.880
I had a price graph.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.080
It's not very interesting.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.820
It's mostly long-term prices.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.310
They're are just flat
from the mid '80s

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.070
through the mid '90s,
or the early '80s

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:25.060
through the mid '90s.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.830
And then they began to escalate.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.110
And basically in
that early period,

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.390
people just stopped
producing uranium.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:32.740
And now they've tripled.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.840
There's new mining activity.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.240
There's really no
organized market

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.380
as there is for oil, or even
to some extent for coal.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.510
These are long-term contracts.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:44.620
There's a spot market.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.910
It's not very interesting.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:46.555
It's very thin.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:54.490
We import almost all of the
uranium we use in US reactors--

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:58.630
92%, a lot of it from
Australia and Canada,

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:02.530
and then from Russia and
a couple of the 'Stans.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:06.880
And production is more
concentrated than reserves,

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.020
so those countries
have 93% of production.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.050
Kazakhstan is a big producer,
Canada, Australia, and then

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.700
it falls off relatively rapidly.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.360
We account for about 3%
of global production.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:26.340
So not a terribly exciting,
not a terribly big market.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.530
Anything about uranium?

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:31.830
This is fairly boring
stuff, but you sort of

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.830
do need to have some basic
factual understanding of what

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.640
these markets look
like if you're going

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.680
to be in the energy business.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.670
Let me do gas.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.241
Gas is more interesting.

00:45:46.272 --> 00:45:47.730
You may at some
point have wondered

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:49.140
why we call it "natural gas."

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.490
It's not all that obvious, but
it's because beginning in 1816

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.875
we produced gas from coal.

00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:56.250
I don't know how
early in Europe,

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.160
but in this country in 1816.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.030
You heat coal.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.810
It gives off gas.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:01.920
You put the gas in a pipe.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.400
You ship it around the city
and use it for lighting.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.350
That was gas.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.233
Natural gas was the
innovation-- that you

00:46:10.233 --> 00:46:11.400
didn't produce it from coal.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.660
You got it naturally,
hence "natural gas."

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.770
It can be moved by pipeline.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:23.400
To move it by ship, you
have to liquefy it, cool it,

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.910
and compress it.

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:28.270
It is not a global market.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:33.000
As we'll talk about next
time, that might change--

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.040
lots of interesting
discussions there.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:35.820
That might change.

00:46:41.181 --> 00:46:42.957
This is circa 2010.

00:46:42.957 --> 00:46:43.665
This will change.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.650
We produce about 85%
of the gas we consume.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.280
Most of the rest is from
Canada, so North America

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.000
is pretty much
self-sufficient in gas.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.820
Most of our imports--

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.610
no, it's not on this slide.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.330
The way the prices
work, US prices

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:08.640
tend to be below
European prices.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.530
European prices are determined
by Russian gas prices,

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.240
and they're much lower
than Asian prices,

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:20.710
because Asia's gas tends to
come via liquefied natural gas,

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:24.310
which is expensive.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:28.360
Historically, if I were
doing this-- well, when

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.720
I did this class two years
ago, this sort of stopped here.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.120
Gas reserves are
associated with oil.

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.730
They tend to be in
politically unstable places.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:40.190
The gas we know most about is in
unstable regions in the Middle

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.660
East and, if you think
it's unstable, Russia.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.940
But that has
changed dramatically

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.460
in literally the last
three or four years.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:56.610
Shale gas can be produced
cheaply, not necessarily

00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:00.720
without environmental
costs, but cheaply.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.706
And once again, the US is
lucky-- we have a lot of it.

00:48:04.706 --> 00:48:07.460
We now have the ability
to produce a lot of gas

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:12.980
cheaply with environmental
costs, potentially.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.930
We think China has
that same ability.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.370
Some European countries do.

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.300
We're told it's under Paris.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.860
Paris is resisting drilling--

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.440
makes a good story,
even if it's not true.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.930
Might be true.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:34.030
I want to focus on this change
on Wednesday, because as I say,

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:36.820
this is the biggest
energy change, certainly

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.888
in my lifetime.

00:48:37.888 --> 00:48:39.430
Well, maybe OPEC
was bigger, but it's

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:45.130
close to OPEC in terms of a
change in the energy landscape.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:52.130
But what we do about it is
subject to serious debate.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.130
And I want to try to
outline that and get

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:56.110
you to engage a little bit.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.060
There are those who
say we should not

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.190
be using this technology.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:04.840
New York State
does not allow it.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.080
North Dakota
eagerly embraces it,

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.470
is thrilled to have
jobs, actually, in North

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:15.290
Dakota, and boomtowns, and cheap
liquor, and everything else--

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.680
all the other good things
that come with a boomtown.

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:26.770
But as a country,
we have some issues.

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:31.030
There's a question of its
impact on climate change.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.850
You sort of think cheap
gas would be good,

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.530
but what if it leaks?

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:39.460
So I want to spend
next time on that.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.250
Today, I want to just
go through some sort

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:48.490
of pre-fracking facts, if
I can say that, and lay

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:50.380
the groundwork.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.240
So this is gas trade.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:57.230
Most of it-- well, 70% of
it-- moves via pipelines.

00:49:57.230 --> 00:50:00.770
And again, if you focus
on the big numbers,

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:04.850
you see Russian gas
moving into Europe.

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:07.970
And you see gas from the
Middle East, importantly,

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.050
moving to Asia.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:11.750
But it's not moving by
pipeline across China.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:14.230
It's moving liquefied by tanker.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.890
There are some exports
from Indonesia,

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:20.570
some exports from Australia,
and a little gas into the US.

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:25.580
Big imports from Canada,
relatively speaking,

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.680
and I guess we
export to Mexico--

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.130
again, just because we can.

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.590
That's got to be just geography.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.530
As I say, most of
it's by pipeline.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:41.630
If you look at the output,
Russia is the big producer.

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:44.720
Russia produces 15% of the
natural gas in the world.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.400
The Middle East together--

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.400
and it's really hard to see
it on this lousy picture--

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.800
produces 14%.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:57.020
Reserves-- once again,
Russia is producing

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.480
a lot out of its 24%
of the world reserves.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.520
The Middle East has 40%
proved reserves as of 2010.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.990
The US had 5%.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:11.030
This picture will change because
you see now, with shale gas,

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:16.220
estimates of recoverable gas--
not yet a proven reserve--

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.130
are anomalous.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:23.200
So as exploration adds
to this inventory,

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.460
the US number will rise.

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.630
I don't know if the Middle East
has shale or Russia has shale.

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:31.690
China will show
up on the picture.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.510
And if they allow drilling
in Poland, Poland, I'm told,

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:35.680
has a fair amount.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.670
So that picture will change.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.510
This is just with
a proved reserve.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:42.300
But again, it's the
same picture as oil.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.390
The one exception-- and I
guess this is a little bit

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:50.070
interesting--

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:54.450
you'll see the share of the
Middle East actually rises.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:57.310
Not only does it rise in
absolute value, of course,

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:59.777
it rises in share.

00:51:59.777 --> 00:52:01.860
And you will recall when
we did the climate change

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:05.580
negotiations, you were
in Qatar or "cutter"

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.200
as it's sometimes called.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.840
That's their discovery of their
enormous natural gas reserves.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.450
That's one formerly
poor, little country

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:20.610
finding it is sitting on an
enormous amount of natural gas,

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:23.785
and that's the Middle
Eastern change primarily.

00:52:23.785 --> 00:52:25.410
Other people are
developing, of course,

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:27.310
but that's what's
going on there.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:32.580
And as I say, that North
America, which I guess

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.150
is this one--

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:40.340
that will change over time
because we have a lot of gas.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.640
But it's not yet proven,
not yet proved reserves.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.820
It's oh, my god, look at what's
almost certainly down there,

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:47.530
but it's not--

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:52.420
We have a lot of pipelines.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.110
This is how you
move natural gas.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:57.770
This is just a map of
the US pipeline network.

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:05.620
And here we are at the end
of the straw, as they say.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.260
So every so often,
there isn't enough gas

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.820
coming up to
Massachusetts-- most

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.220
of the time, not a problem.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.470
You hear about the Henry Hub.

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.240
Well, if you follow
this business,

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.550
you hear about Henry Hub.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:23.150
Henry Hub is about there.

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:24.860
There's a lot of
offshore pipelines,

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.740
but Henry Hub is in
southern Louisiana

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.650
a little bit east of the center.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.490
And it's where something
like 13 pipelines come in--

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:38.240
nine interstate and
four intrastate.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.030
And when you hear
the Henry Hub price,

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:45.860
pricing of natural gas
in wholesale markets

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:50.640
is mostly the price at the
Henry Hub plus transport cost.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.580
So people do futures
markets based on Henry Hub,

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.080
and then you add
in transport costs.

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.710
You do a contract on a Henry
Hub price and a transport.

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:01.410
So when I say gas moves
mainly by pipelines,

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.660
it moves in the US
a lot by pipelines.

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:08.760
You can also tell by the
pipelines where it comes from.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.510
At the moment, it comes
from Louisiana, Texas.

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.100
It comes from offshore.

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.540
That's northern Louisiana.

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.770
That's Oklahoma.

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:19.570
And that's mainly it.

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:21.650
That will change.

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:25.160
It's coming from North
Dakota, where you

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.170
don't see a lot of pipelines.

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:30.440
It's relatively easy to build
gas pipelines in this country,

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:36.320
so they will be built.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:40.670
Natural gas-- these are prices.

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:42.650
So this is the US
Henry Hub price

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:46.490
in red, the UK price,
the Japanese price,

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:48.020
and the German price.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:54.250
You will see in recent years,
at least, there's the US price,

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:59.330
there's the UK price,
there is the German price,

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:04.370
which is a Russian price, and
there's the Japanese price.

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:08.620
So you can sort
of see why there's

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:15.350
some interest in this country
in exporting natural gas.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:17.570
If you can actually
produce it for that price

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:21.220
and sell it to Japan, you
might eat half the difference

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:25.340
in transport, but
that's a huge margin.

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:28.240
So we have built terminals to
import natural gas that are now

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.250
being converted to export.

00:55:32.982 --> 00:55:34.940
Well, they're trying to
convert them to export.

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:40.595
And here is a historical
price series that cuts off.

00:55:40.595 --> 00:55:42.970
I thought this was a defect
of the way I got the picture,

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:47.830
but I now see in terms of the
flow here, it's a feature.

00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:50.230
This cuts off about 2009.

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:54.190
We will explore the
rest on Wednesday.

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:57.440
You see the price is volatile.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.560
That's a doubling
in less than a year.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.570
That's a doubling.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:02.835
That's almost a tripling.

00:56:02.835 --> 00:56:03.835
That's another doubling.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:11.140
So historically, gas price
volatility not quite as

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:16.610
bad as oil volatility,
but it's been there.

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:18.560
We'll see going
forward the picture

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.880
looks a little different.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.130
We'll see whether that's
likely to continue.

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:28.150
You've been very
quiet after oil,

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:31.640
so I'll need to see if you
have questions or comments.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.010
Because I don't want to
go into fracking today.

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.270
I'll wait till Wednesday.

00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:36.260
Comments on gas?

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:36.920
Yeah.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.710
AUDIENCE: So gas tends
to occur with oil

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:41.690
as in wherever there's
an oil reserve they're

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.085
surrounded by gas or something?

00:56:43.085 --> 00:56:44.210
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Often.

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:45.590
Not always, but often.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:49.320
Because these are fossils.

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.753
These are dead
dinosaurs and trees.

00:56:51.753 --> 00:56:54.170
AUDIENCE: So a lot of companies
are oil and gas companies,

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:55.850
often, not coal
and gas companies?

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:56.690
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, because they

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:57.900
tend to be co-located.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.360
There is gas.

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.850
There's coalbed methane.

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:07.850
There is some joint
occurrence of gas and coal.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:11.420
Historically, coal
companies ignored it,

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.470
because it's a little
tricky to recover.

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:17.690
There's more recovery
now of coalbed methane.

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:24.020
And the percentages differ
a lot from place to place--

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:24.980
oil versus gas.

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.260
In Qatar, for instance,
it's almost all gas.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:29.105
In some places it's
almost all oil.

00:57:29.105 --> 00:57:30.980
But there tends to be--
well, the Middle East

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.220
has lots of both.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.900
So in that broad sense,
that they co-locate.

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.400
Yeah, Andrew.

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.400
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.480
One thing that you mentioned
was about the price.

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:45.830
Does it track, or did it
used to track oil price

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.000
at all, natural gas, I mean?

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.958
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:57:48.958 --> 00:57:50.240
It doesn't here.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:57.420
Back in the day when oil was
used to generate electricity,

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:03.390
you had so-called "substitution"
at the burner tip,

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:07.410
that the ability of power plants
to switch between natural gas

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:11.520
and oil tended to link
their prices pretty tightly.

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.800
The Russian price to Europe--

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.270
prices, since it's not just one
price-- but the Russian prices

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:25.100
to Europe tend to be linked
by contract to the oil price.

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:29.750
In the US, since we
don't generate much--

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:33.410
we don't effectively know
electricity from oil--

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:38.210
there's some, but it's
not much, old diesels--

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:40.730
that burner tip
substitution doesn't link

00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:42.950
and there's no contractual link.

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:48.320
Now, per unit of energy,
gas is enormously cheaper

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.820
than oil in the US--

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.380
enormously cheaper.

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.520
I'm trying to
remember the ratio.

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.450
Is it 10 to 1?

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:57.320
It can't be that high,
but it's pretty high.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.640
It's a big difference.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.700
So even if you could burn
oil in a power plant,

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.113
you wouldn't today.

00:59:04.113 --> 00:59:06.280
And you haven't for a long
time because of the price

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.003
difference.

00:59:07.003 --> 00:59:08.420
AUDIENCE: The other
question would

00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:12.650
be [INAUDIBLE] you mentioned
that there is no world

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:14.470
market for natural gas.

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:17.530
And I'm just
wondering, and I was

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:20.770
going to mention that people
link it to oil, which doesn't

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:22.790
make a lot of sense to me.

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.910
I was wondering, and
you mentioned something

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:26.920
that it's about--

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.500
we might see a world
market for natural gas.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.470
What are the reasons that
they have not [INAUDIBLE]??

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.220
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Cost, transport cost.

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.330
AUDIENCE: Because I would
assume just because you have--

00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:39.905
the technology is there and
you see the differences--

00:59:39.905 --> 00:59:41.530
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Oh, the technology

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:44.410
is there, but to
liquefy the gas--

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:47.800
to compress it and
liquefy it costs money.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.760
The tankers are expensive.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.210
The terminal facilities
are expensive.

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:55.090
So that's the reason why--

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:58.240
Japan can import lots of gas,
but it's not a world market

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.760
in the sense of a world price.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.160
Because the market has been
traditionally very different

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:04.660
from the--

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.770
North America is pipelines,
boom, boom, boom.

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:11.020
And that's pretty unified.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.780
Pipelines are pretty cheap--

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.250
all things equal,
pipelines are pretty cheap.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:19.030
But liquefying the stuff,
and putting it on board ship,

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:24.220
and moving it across the ocean
is an expensive proposition,

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.500
which is why the Asian
price has been so much

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.780
higher than the European price.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:36.940
Now, as people say, suppose the
US really produces this stuff

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:43.180
at scale and begins to
export in quantity to Asia

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.840
to take into account
that price difference.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.240
Just geographically,
we're in a position

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.090
to undermine Russian
pricing to Europe

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:57.580
and in a position to undercut
Middle Eastern pricing to Asia.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.680
We don't have that
much gas, but we

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.840
have enough, some people
argue, to unify the world

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.400
in price terms.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.530
Some people say that's nuts.

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:12.670
So it comes down to the numbers,
and how much we produce,

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.830
and is there gas in China.

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:19.500
If there's a lot
of gas in China,

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.960
at cost comparable
to ours, then you

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.890
begin to see world gas
prices of around $5 to $6

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:29.760
instead of these $12,
$13, $14 prices in Asia.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.300
There's a possibility, but it's
not going to happen through--

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:41.400
well, it can happen through
LNG, but it is expensive.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.480
It is expensive.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.700
Yeah.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.590
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.820
AUDIENCE: What's the carbon
intensity vis-a-vis oil?

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.046
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Excuse me, what?

01:01:49.046 --> 01:01:51.420
AUDIENCE: What's the carbon
intensity vis-a-vis oil?

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:59.290
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It's less
carbon intensive than oil.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:00.040
It's methane.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.780
It's CH4.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.400
Oil tends to have
a good deal more.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.840
Oil varies.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.100
I can't give you a ratio.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.170
I should be able
to, but I can't.

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.880
You can look it up.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:17.530
But it's about-- the one number
that it does stick in my head

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:20.620
and this is because it's
a power plant number--

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.790
using natural gas in a power
plant as compared to coal

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:29.480
gives you about half
the CO2 emissions.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.540
Oil will be somewhere in
between, and different grades--

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.120
Canadian heavy oil may
be more carbon intensive

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.370
than light crude
from Saudi Arabia.

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:41.197
I just don't know the answer,
but somewhere in between.

01:02:41.197 --> 01:02:41.780
Anything else?

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.710
Prosper?

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:45.350
AUDIENCE: Is coal
gas still being

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.080
purchased internationally?

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.070
Also, are there countries
where using coal gas

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:53.432
is more cheaper than importing--

01:02:53.432 --> 01:02:54.890
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Importing LNG?

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:55.890
AUDIENCE: --natural gas?

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:02.980
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I hate to admit

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.970
that there's something
I completely don't know,

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:06.380
but I don't know.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.350
It wouldn't surprise me.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:15.140
If a country has coal
supplies, doesn't have gas,

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.780
and doesn't have
good port facilities,

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.800
then it would make sense
to do coal gasification.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.820
There are places where--

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.040
again, much of it's done--

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.570
there's talk of and some
use of gas from coal

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:36.860
to burn in power plants because
you're basically leaving

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:38.370
some of the carbon behind.

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:43.370
So you're getting combined
cycle efficiency, less carbon

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:44.000
emissions.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:53.720
But whether it's in use
at scale, I don't know.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.860
The South Africans were doing--

01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.630
they were mostly
doing liquid fuel.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.064
I don't know that they-- hmm?

01:04:00.064 --> 01:04:03.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:05.480
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, they built one.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.890
It may still be
working actually,

01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:08.840
but I thought that was
mostly for liquids.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.798
AUDIENCE: There's a
company here, [INAUDIBLE],,

01:04:10.798 --> 01:04:12.420
that actually [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.683
That's pretty much just
the only place [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:14.683 --> 01:04:16.850
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That's
doing coal gasification,

01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:19.010
but that's not for use as gas.

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.860
It's probably for use in
electricity generation,

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.840
or is it for use in gas?

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.790
AUDIENCE: Right now,
most of [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:29.600
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
electricity, so yeah, I

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.720
can't rule out it being
put in pipes for heating

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.120
and lighting someplace, but
I don't know of any place.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.330
Interesting question.

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:38.340
Yeah.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.850
Anything else?

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.100
Yeah, Ryan.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:46.330
AUDIENCE: So natural gas might
replace some coal because it's

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:47.510
cheaper, in some instances.

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:51.190
Will it replace oil in
a transportation sector

01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:54.220
or is that just out of
the question for a while?

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.740
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
that's a good question.

01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.430
One of the optional
readings for Wednesday

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.530
is this MIT Future
of Natural Gas Study.

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:08.150
And one of the things they
investigate is exactly that.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:13.320
If you think about one
of the issues that arises

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.450
is energy density.

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.940
Gasoline is just
this marvelous stuff

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.700
because in a
relatively small space,

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:25.710
you could store enough
energy to move a ton

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:28.110
and a half vehicle 200 miles.

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:34.350
Gas is hard to get that kind of
density unless you liquefy it.

01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:35.850
If you liquefy it,
of course, you've

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:38.550
got all this problem
of keeping it cold

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:40.940
and keeping the pressure.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:48.170
So on the other hand, per BTU,
it's so much cheaper than oil,

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:50.330
than gasoline or diesel.

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:54.170
So there's a lot of discussion.

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:57.350
We will probably see,
assuming prices hold,

01:05:57.350 --> 01:06:01.070
we'll probably see a lot of
use of gas in urban fleets.

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:06.380
You already see some, because a
bus fleet or a taxi fleet where

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.870
you don't have to travel far
from a place you can refuel,

01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:10.370
you refuel often.

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:13.430
And it's worth it if it's
just a whole lot cheaper

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:17.080
to refuel a couple of
times a day to save money.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.180
There are no technical
problems building engines

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.350
to run on the stuff.

01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:25.370
That happens now.

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:28.880
You can buy cars that
can run on natural gas.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.950
It's just the refueling
infrastructure

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:35.000
and the cruising range
is a problem for cars.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.140
People are talking.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:40.940
So urban fleets, yeah, delivery
vehicles, yeah, taxi cabs,

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.080
yeah.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.230
There's talk about using
liquefied natural gas

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:50.290
for long-haul trucks where
you don't need that many

01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:51.610
fueling stations.

01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:53.788
You need them on
the main routes.

01:06:53.788 --> 01:06:56.080
So instead of having to have
them all over the country,

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:59.420
you can have a few
at certain intervals.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.750
And because you're
hauling a lot,

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:06.940
it may be worthwhile to put
all that stuff on a truck.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.695
Again, the world divides
into those people

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:15.070
who think it's the natural
next step and those people who

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.690
think that's crazy.

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.370
And I don't know the answer.

01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:19.610
We'll find out.

01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:20.560
We'll find out.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.970
It's interesting.

01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:24.125
And again, what drives
it is the enormous--

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:25.750
and I'll get the
number for next time--

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:29.680
the anomalous per-BTU difference
between gas and oil right now.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.960
And we'll see gas prices
are probably unsustainably

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.220
low at the moment.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:37.860
But they're going to stay
low for a while, I think.

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.960
OK, anything else?

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.770
Questions, comments, speeches?

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:47.700
All right, we'll do hydraulic
fracking, the new world

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.910
of natural gas, the
boomtown in North Dakota,

01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:54.570
earthquakes in Ohio, flammable
drinking water in New York

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:58.235
State, and all of those
good stories next time.

01:07:58.235 --> 01:08:01.340
And we'll figure
out how to solve it.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.380
PROFESSOR: Today I want to
make some remarks about

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.400
William Barton Rogers.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.560
You were supposed to read an
essay that I wrote about him,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.060
so I'm not going to go
into great detail.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.390
I don't want to repeat what I've
already written in the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.070
essay, but I thought I would hit
had some high points and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.960
then end up talking a bit about
this piece that Charles

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.340
Eliot wrote called "The New
Education," because I readily

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.840
admit that that is not the
easiest thing to read and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.380
surely not scintillating
prose--

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.350
you would not want to keep it up
with you at night and think

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.140
you're going to read
it one AM.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.320
That wouldn't work.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.280
But it's an important essay.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.970
So we'll talk a bit about
that after I make

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.230
my few remarks here.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.650
First thing I want to say is
that it's hard to believe that

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.710
MIT has no full-scale
history--

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.510
history book, that is, a book
that's been written about the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.150
entire history of MIT.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.680
One does not exist.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.250
As close as we get to it is the
book you're reading now.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.620
And basically that consists
primarily of snapshots of

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.510
critical moments in the
institute's history.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.230
I think it's a very good book,
but it's not a complete

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.430
history of the Institute.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.050
And hopefully, someday, someone
will decide one is

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.510
needed and actually write it.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.110
It will take it a lot of work
because the more I read and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.020
study about this place, the more
I realize that it has a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.590
very deep and very
diverse history.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.200
And it will not be an easy book
to write, in my opinion--

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.720
or at least to make it
a good book, that it

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.170
really should be.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.440
But all the great universities
in the United States have

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.230
these histories and MIT is one
of the few that doesn't.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.800
And I was sort of surprised
at that.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.160
I must admit, I didn't know a
thing about the history of MIT

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.950
until about two or three years
ago, when I was asked to write

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.000
this essay, and then, all of
the sudden, I, of course,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.080
started to read as much as I
could about it in preparing

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.290
for the essay that I wrote.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.090
But I was really surprised that
there's no one big book

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.160
you can go to and kind of
get the story there.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.980
My assignment by the editor of
the book Moments of Decision,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.300
his name is David Kaiser, and he
teaches in the STS program,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.170
history of physics.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.430
He's also a physicist.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.080
He has a Ph.D in physics.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.950
And he persuaded me to write
this essay, which I did

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.110
because he was my colleague,
not because I wanted to, I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.740
must admit.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.890
But I'm glad I did in retrospect
because I learned a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.560
lot about this place
and especially

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.370
about its early years.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.030
And so what that in mind, I want
to talk about, well, what

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.500
did I learn from this extensive
reading that I did,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.200
and what did I learn especially
about William

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.990
Barton Rogers the person and the
significance of his life?

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.930
I think it's fair to say from
the outset that he is a very

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.790
significant educator.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.660
In the larger history of
education, he has to be one of

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.370
the more important people
of the 19th century.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.080
He came of age in the middle
of America's Industrial

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.650
Revolution.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.360
He was born in 1804, so he was
in his 20s during the 1820s,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.130
right at the very moment when
the United States was really

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.240
beginning to experience
factory systems, the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.610
mechanization of production,
the advent of railroads--

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.200
it was the moment.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.760
It was the right moment to be
in the country, to see these

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.830
changes taking place.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.910
And he saw them, and he was
very, very interested in them,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.118
though he always considered
himself to be a scientist.

00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:14.170
He was initially educated by
his father, primarily, at

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.030
William and Mary.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.010
His father was an academician.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.829
And he initially called himself
a natural philosopher,

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.800
which would be a 19th
century word for

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.400
a physicist, basically.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.720
Natural philosophy--

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.130
interesting name.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.280
But technology in those days,
interestingly, was also

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.980
referred to as "the useful
arts." The word technology, in

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.060
the 1820s, I don't even know
if it had appeared in the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.600
United States at that point.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.900
But in any case, it was a very
new word to the lexicon and it

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.690
was rarely used until we had
the founding of this place,

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.900
the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.430
It's very interesting that
he chose that word.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.440
If I could go back and interview
Rogers, that would

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.600
be one of the questions I'd want
to ask him, is why did

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.130
you choose the word technology,
not Massachusetts

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.270
Institute of Useful Arts, or
some more contemporary

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.710
expression that was used,
frankly, more often than the

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.790
word technology was, by 1860.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.920
In any cases here he is.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.660
He's a young man during
the 1820s.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.040
His first job out of college
was to teach in a small

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.140
private school in Baltimore
Maryland.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.520
And it's in Baltimore that he
comes in contact with some of

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.370
the really famous railroad
engineers of

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.370
the early 19th century.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.160
All of these guys were West
Point-trained people.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.000
They were army engineers who had
been basically seconded to

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.160
the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, a private

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.130
corporation, to initiate surveys
and construction of

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.410
this privately owned railroad.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.530
Talk about government in.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.450
It's a great example, in which,
here, the federal

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.410
government is actually sending
its own personnel to a private

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.470
corporation to get
the job started.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.960
And so he meets people like
William Gibbs McNeill and

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.640
George Washington Whistler,
who, actually,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.560
are brothers in law.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.960
Whistler is the more interesting
of-- well, more

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.540
historically interesting
of the two.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.850
They're both important engineers
because his son

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.990
became a very famous artist,
James McNeill Abbott Whistler,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.040
is George Washington's son.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.800
And the famous portrait,
Whistler's mother, that sits

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.270
in the Louvre in Paris is of
George Washington's wife, who

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.300
was a McNeill as a young lady.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.650
So here you have these engineers
in Baltimore

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.940
interacting with this young
teacher because he got

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.800
interested in railroads and
wanted to give a lecture about

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.160
the building of this new steam
powered railroad out of

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.150
Baltimore westward toward
the Ohio River.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.770
And he started borrowing models
from these engineers to

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.010
illustrate his lectures with.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.350
They were building very
interesting and fairly, not

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.720
large scale models--

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.250
but I've seen some of them,
they currently exist in

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.820
Russia, they're found in a
museum in St. Petersburg--

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.600
of the type of bridges that were
being built on the B&O

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.940
railroad, and the types of
locomotives and rolling stock.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.180
A locomotive would be maybe that
long, a 440, that wide,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.110
it's this high, fairly
sizable model.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.740
But he was borrowing these
models to give lectures with

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.490
and, in the process, began to
get interested in railroads,

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.520
and especially because his
brothers, two of his brothers,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.560
actually worked for McNeill.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.220
Once they left the B&O, McNeill
came north to the

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.010
Boston area to build a railroad
that, basically, is

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.900
now part of the Northeast
corridor.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.220
It's the road between Boston
and Providence--

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.910
and did the surveys on that,
even those these two young

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.060
were basically interested in
geology, McNeill hired them to

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.270
help with the survey team,
and then, on the side, he

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.190
encouraged them to do geological
explorations of the

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.240
area, which they did.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.500
And they loved it.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.660
And they got to really admire
these army engineers, so much

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.400
so that they really seriously
thought about becoming

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.800
engineers themselves.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.680
That didn't happen, primarily
because they felt that army

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.049
engineers had such an inroad
into the engineering business

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.820
at that time, they were really
the only serious engineers in

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.250
the United States, were these
West Point trained people,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.475
that they didn't think they had
much of a chance getting

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:45.783
the good jobs compared to what
Whistler, and McNeill, and

00:08:45.783 --> 00:08:48.080
others were getting as a result
of their connection

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.590
with the Army.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.990
Both Whistler and McNeill left
the Army in the 1830s and

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.170
became private, consulting
engineers.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.630
And Whistler went on to engineer
not only the Western

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.510
branch of what became the Boston
and Albany railroad,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.570
which was the first major
railroad to go over a serious

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.450
mountain chain, the Berkshire
mountains.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.230
If you drive west on the Mass
Pike and go up over the

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.580
Berkshires toward Albany, New
York, you're going exactly

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.940
through the area that Whistler
ran a railroad through during

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.610
the mid 1830s, late 1830s--

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.950
serious elevations there.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.405
And he did it.

00:09:26.405 --> 00:09:28.870
He got a lot of attention
for doing it.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.610
And one of the groups that paid
attention to him were

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.170
these Russian engineers that
were sent to the United States

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.250
by Tsar, I think
it's Nicholas.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.190
It's either Nicholas or
Alexander, but, in

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.940
any case, he was--

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.080
DAVID KAISER: Weren't they all
Nicholas or Alexander?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.800
PROFESSOR: Nicholas and
Alexander, you've got to be

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.860
one or the other.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.780
I can't be far wrong
on that one.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.810
But in any case, he was hired by
the tsar to go to Russia to

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.360
engineer what is now called the
Moscow and St. Petersburg

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.250
Railroad, which he did.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.840
He died in Russia, of
cholera, in 1849.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.830
But his body was brought back
to the United States and

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.610
buried down in Stonington,
Connecticut.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.970
I have visited his grave.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.250
And I can attest that George
Washington Whistler now lies

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.400
in Stonington, Connecticut.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.220
But he was a great engineer, and
he was an important here.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.220
He had a lot of influence on
Rogers and his brothers.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.950
And as a result of that, as I
said, they both contemplated

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.720
engineering careers but then
backed away and decided, no,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.360
we are really educators.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.340
We're interested in this new
field called geology.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.510
Both William Barton and his
brother Henry Darwin Rogers

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.030
became very, very eminent
geologists.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.340
In fact, Henry, his younger
brother, actually got an

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.110
appointment at the University
of Glasgow as a chaired

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.910
professor there during the--

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:56.130
I think it was during the
late 1840s, early 1850s.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.490
And it's in the process of
experiencing these things with

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.370
these new railroads and
industrial ventures that

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.350
really begins to turn his head
toward these "useful arts" and

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.320
to think about how are they
related to the sorts of

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.610
scientific interests
that he has.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.240
The other experience that he had
that's very important in

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.370
all this was that when he was
teaching at the University of

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:28.480
Virginia in the 1830s he was
appointed the head of the

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.320
state Geological Survey, and
I've written about that in the

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.600
essay, in which she had a
miserable time because of the

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.680
political interest that were
vying with one another.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.230
He conducted the survey.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.430
He completed it, but the results
of the survey, which

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.360
were important, were never
published because the

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.960
legislature was bickering
among themselves--

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.190
sounds familiar--

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:54.510
about the costs, whether it was
a worthwhile project, the

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.030
whole thing you might imagine.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:00.200
But in any case, Rogers was
disgusted with Virginia.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.370
Surely, by the late '40s, he was
really disgusted with the

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.270
whole state legislature and
political process there.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.670
But in conducting these surveys
from one end of the

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:15.080
state to the other, and in those
days, Virginia included

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.890
the current state of West
Virginia, not just the current

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:18.520
state of Virginia.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.720
It was a big state.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.670
He got interested, basically,
in things like mountain

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.880
formations and very much
interested in where mineral

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.040
deposits were located and
things like that.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.480
But the big problem was finding
assistants that could

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.860
help him conduct the sort of
geological work that he needed

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.010
to do in order to finish up the
survey and make a report.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.660
And that was another stimulus
toward his interest in trying

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.550
to do something with combining
science with the useful arts.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.950
So those are, I would say, two
critical moments during the

00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:01.000
1830s in which he really began
to begin to think about

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.250
establishing some sort of what
we would call a Polytechnic

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.380
Institute, or Institute
of Technology.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.340
He and his brother both started
talking about this as

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.380
early as 1829 in Baltimore.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.670
But then it got continued
throughout the 1830s and well

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.630
into the 1840s.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.560
And that's really how the whole
idea of what this place

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.025
is about got started.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.390
Rogers also saw, through these
years, that there was a crying

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.410
need for people to do
engineering work and meet what

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.730
he referred to as the "wants
of the age." This was the

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.540
great field, the open field--

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.370
lots of jobs and possibilities
for advancement.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.100
And he saw that, and,
again, it stimulated

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.220
his interest in education.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.880
So as a result of this, he
develops a plan for a

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.630
Polytechnic Institute, the first
draft of which, I think,

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.930
was written as early as 1829.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.900
And then over the next 30 years
he and his brother sort

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.970
of elaborate on this plan
about how would

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.710
they organize it?

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.190
What disciplines would
be included?

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.740
But the key, I think, the key
idea that they developed over

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.490
these years was trying to
combine, trying to develop an

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.110
educational system that would
combine science with the

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.670
useful arts, make them relevant
to one another and

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.080
especially inform the useful
arts about what science could

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.290
reveal to them-- the
understandings of chemistry,

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.990
or physics, or whatever.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:36.560
And of courses, as you've read,
the finality of this

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.860
comes in 1861, when he receives
a charter from the

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.960
state of Massachusetts to
establish what is called the

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.580
Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.400
Now in that, he'd had to
do a lot of lobbying.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.480
He had learned how to work with
politicians through that

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.170
miserable Virginia experience.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.650
I think it made him
a wiser man--

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.970
maybe a cagier person in terms
of learning how to work with

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.470
politicians or to get
around the obstacles

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.280
they put in this way.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.880
It's during the early questions
about the charter

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.430
for MIT, for example, that the
governor of Massachusetts, who

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:18.610
was a Harvard graduate, first
proposed the idea of, why

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.320
create this MIT as a
separate institute?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.720
Why not combine it
with Harvard?

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.470
It's one of those early
questions about, well, why not

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.750
combine it with Harvard rather
than make it a separate

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.320
institution?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.790
Rogers resisted that throughout
this entire life.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.810
And there were several other
attempts made during his

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.560
lifetime to try to merge
MIT with Harvard.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.820
But it began very early.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.250
And it began first with the
government of Massachusetts,

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.590
who would like to have
seen that sort of

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.500
combination put together.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.660
But once they got the charter,
the big challenge then was to

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.070
try to get the place going.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:57.340
And the problem was that he got
his charter in April 1861,

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.460
and what happens in
1861, in April?

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.060
Civil War.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.230
And so a war breaks out.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.280
It makes it difficult for him
to raise money, basically--

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.260
very difficult to raise money.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.790
And some scholars who have
studied the history of MIT

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.460
think that maybe it was a good
thing that there was a war, in

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.450
terms of his interest, because
it gave him time to complete

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.730
this plans and to work the
political process in a way

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.710
that allowed him to
eventually get the

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.060
Institute started in 1865.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.230
There may be some truth to that,
but I think the real

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.300
problem that he faced
1861 was money.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.890
And that was a problem MIT was
going to face for the next

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.600
four years or so.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.640
MIT was always running in the
red, basically, well into the

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.580
late 1890s and probably
beyond that.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.420
I just haven't studied that
much beyond the fiscal

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.650
situation beyond the 1890s.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.320
But in any case, he
got his charter.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.870
He has to hire faculty.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:04.569
He has to choose and acquire a
site to initiate classes in.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:06.550
He has to raise this money.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.880
There are a lot of things that
have to be accomplished.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.829
And I think one of the big
godsends of the period was

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:17.686
that there was a law
passed in 1862.

00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:22.140
It was a federal law, part of
the Lincoln administration's

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.109
political agenda called the
Morrill Land Grant Act.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.290
And I remember reading about
this when I was your age and

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.690
being totally bored by it.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.220
But it turns out that that is
a very important piece of

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.840
legislation because it led to
the establishment of what we

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.390
call the land grant university
system in this country.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.610
All the big state universities,
basically, are

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.610
related to that land
grant act.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.100
Some very directly, and others
less so, but, nonetheless,

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.170
most of them--

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:56.700
Texas A&M, Penn State, Ohio
State, Michigan State,

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.930
Wisconsin, Berkeley, you know,
you can go across the country

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:00.870
and almost choose.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.430
In every state, there's at least
one institution that was

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.800
founded under the Morrill Act.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.250
Well, that Morrill Act
was passed in 1862.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.060
And basically, what it said
was that for each

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.720
congressional representative
that you had in the US

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.540
Congress, the state would get
30,000 acres of land, which it

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.820
in turn could convert into
script and sell the script, or

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.060
the rights to the land, as
a way of raising money to

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.180
establish agricultural
mechanical colleges within the

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.180
state boundaries--

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.000
A&Ms, if you want to
call them that.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.360
So Massachusetts, I think,
had 10 congressional

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.150
representatives and
two US Senators.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:48.120
So it got a fairly sizable chunk
of land in the Midwest.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.110
If I'm not mistaken, it was out
in the area of northern

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.080
Iowa, southern Minnesota, in
that area, where a lot of this

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.850
land was located.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.510
People in Minnesota and Iowa,
by the way, were not happy

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.300
that the federal government was
giving away land in their

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.010
states to states that had
nothing to do with them.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.740
You can imagine how people in
Minnesota must've felt about

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.260
this huge chunk of land going
to New York State, or

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.230
Massachusetts, or wherever.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:19.010
But in any case, that converted
into substantial

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.750
funds that were used to found
not only MIT but also the

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.750
University of Massachusetts
at Amherst.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:33.020
And basically, MIT got a
third of those monies

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.820
over a 30 year period.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.040
It was given to them
in increments.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.370
They got a sizable amount of
money, well over $300,000.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.790
That may not sound like much
today, but if you convert it

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.140
into 2008 dollars, it's
a big hunk of money.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.360
I don't know but I've--

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.760
DAVID KAISER: Well, it would
put you through MIT today.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.420
PROFESSOR: It would put
you through MIT today.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.326
That's a good way to put it.

00:19:55.326 --> 00:19:58.380
Yeah, so it's a sizable
amount of money.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.540
DAVID KAISER: Plus a
couple vacations.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.700
PROFESSOR: But probably just as
important as the grant from

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.450
the state itself, which
consisted not only of money,

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:10.120
but also of land, over
in the Back Bay--

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.090
MIT was first established not
here, where we are today, but

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.590
over in the Back Bay
near Copley Square.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.750
If you're familiar with that
area, the original building

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.600
was very close, block or two,
from Copley Square.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.080
And it stayed there until
1916, pretty much.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.010
But in any case, the money for
all that came from the state

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.530
of Massachusetts.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.420
So the state was important
in all this.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.120
Without the state, I would, in
fact, question whether private

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.950
donors would have stepped
forward to donate money to MIT

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.440
because they weren't sure
about its future.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.510
But when the state began to
invest in MIT, that sort of

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:52.260
gave a signal that, yeah,
MIT's got a future.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.070
I'm going to pony up some money
and give --and one of

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:59.520
the big donations that came very
soon after MIT got the

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.560
state funds was a donation that
I begin my essay with,

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.330
this doctor--

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.810
what's his name--

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:07.600
DAVID KAISER: Walker?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.530
PROFESSOR: What is it?

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.050
DAVID KAISER: Walker.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.730
PROFESSOR: Walker, yes.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.720
William Walker, a physician who
had invested in industry

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.280
in this state.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.880
This was a leading
industrial state.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.110
And he ponied up $60,000--

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.450
a lot of money for a private
individual in those days.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.350
DAVID KAISER: On the last
day before the--

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.890
PROFESSOR: In the last day,
yeah, so it was an iffy

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.550
proposition from
the beginning.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:35.115
And Rogers, I think one of his
great skills was as a, in a

00:21:35.115 --> 00:21:37.040
way, small p politician,
a lobbyist.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.090
He was very effective at
lobbying people, and raising

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.650
funds, and keeping this
institution going from one

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.340
year, literally, one
year to another.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.150
Because every year, as I said,
it was running on the red.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.530
But he made it go.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.940
DAVID KAISER: Something about
Back Bay, too-- because maybe

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.630
not everybody knows that
what is now Back

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.970
Bay was once a Bay.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:58.440
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.670
DAVID KAISER: And I hadn't
really remembered until I was

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.010
reading the reading last night
that part of the initial

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.220
interest was--

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.040
they filled in the Back Bay to
make what is now Back Bay,

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.630
which was a huge engineering
project in and of itself.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.050
And then there was interest
in using that land for

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:19.790
educational purposes, which
Rogers then sort of satisfied

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.050
to some degree.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:21.990
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.820
And I think I mentioned in the
essay that the initial

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:31.030
proposal was not just for an
industrial school, MIT, but

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.205
was also for a natural history
museum and a society of arts.

00:22:34.205 --> 00:22:38.225
It was a 3 part combination that
was initially proposed.

00:22:38.225 --> 00:22:41.180
And eventually, of course,
MIT was the

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.480
one that really lasted.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.470
And the other two sort of
slipped by the wayside.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.240
But in any case, that's the
story of the beginning

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.040
because, I think, in the early
days, if I'm not mistaken,

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.810
that one of the early courses
at MIT was in mining and,

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.190
what's the other--

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.140
DAVID KAISER: Metallurgy.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.200
PROFESSOR: Mining
and metallurgy.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.560
And in those days, geology
would've been

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.640
lumped into that area.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.150
And then later, it becomes--

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.700
yeah, yeah.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.140
Now, I can't absolutely
swear that's the

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.960
case, but that's my--

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.610
what would say say, an
educated guess, I

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.010
guess, would be.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.300
So to look at Rogers and just
say, OK, what are some of the

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.840
important points to remember
about him?

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.170
One is, he's a good lobbyist.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.280
He keeps the place going.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.600
He keeps the vision alive, OK?

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.170
And secondly, there's
the vision itself.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:36.190
You see it on the great
seal of MIT.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.970
You know, interestingly, if
you look at the seal, it's

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:40.420
interesting.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.010
It says mens et manus--

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.200
mind and hand.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.210
Science and the useful arts,
another way to think of it.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.710
But clearly, that vision of the
combination of science and

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.040
the useful arts was there
from day one.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:03.640
And that seal was actually
approved in 1864, if I'm not

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.690
mistaken Rogers was on the
committee that, you know,

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.990
approved that seal.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.700
And he obviously played a role,
I mean, I think his

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.300
vision is sort of stamped,
literally, into the seal

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.190
itself, of what this place
was going to be.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.430
One curious thing about that
seal, however, I'll

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.790
point it out now.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.730
It's not original with me, but
a colleague of mine, years

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.740
ago, pointed it out to me,
and I have thought

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.550
about it ever since--

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:43.230
was that when you look at this
seal, you have a craftsman, or

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.980
an industrial worker, and a
scholar, OK, the scientist and

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:52.020
the useful arts standing next
to a pedestal, and then the

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.440
words mens et manus below,
and the date of

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.720
the founding of MIT.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.780
The interesting thing though is
that, in Rogers' vision he

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.080
wanted to combine, he wanted
each of them, science and

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.180
useful arts, to inform
one another.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.420
That was the special thing,
the idea that he had.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.730
This was a new way of
educating people.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:17.530
And yet these figures, science
and engineering, or science

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.410
and useful arts, they have their
backs turned to each

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.280
other, as if they're not
conversing at all.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.210
Curious.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.880
I don't know it if was for
aesthetic purposes or what,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.670
but from a didactic point of
view, they should have been

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.360
facing each other, and having
discussions, and interacting.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.950
Clearly, they're not
doing anything.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.970
They're sort of both in
their own worlds.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.700
And that's an interesting
comment, I think, just on the

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.655
seal, not necessarily about
Rogers' vision.

00:25:45.655 --> 00:25:52.170
But he has this important idea
about the combination of the

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.540
two, which is very important.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.000
And in the essay, I put a lot of
emphasis on the importance

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.290
of laboratory education there,
in which students are not just

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.190
being given lectures and
demonstrations by the

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.220
professor using the apparatus,
but, in fact, they're allowed

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.690
to go in and perform experiments
themselves using

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:12.980
the apparatus.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.570
One of the reasons why MIT was
constantly in financial

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.260
difficulty was the need to
maintain the laboratories that

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.920
were so critical to the
education of its students.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.720
Laboratories are very expensive,
to this day

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.840
probably the most expensive
item in the MIT budget, I

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.270
would think-- one of the
most expensive ones.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.560
Look around us at these new
buildings that are going up

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.250
just in the biological sciences
and think of the

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.080
expense that has been
invested in them.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.330
And it was no less true
in the 19th century.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:45.300
And it had a special meaning for
Rogers because he wanted

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.310
students to be immersed in that
experimental process and

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.800
not just lookers-on.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.750
He wanted them involved
in the process.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.380
And I think that's one of the
really distinctive things

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.470
about MIT, then and today.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:05.660
I keep thinking that vision of
1861, 1864, of Rogers can be

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.620
seen in the UROP projects.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.890
And several of you have written
in your reflections

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.850
about this today--

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:17.010
different programs that exist at
MIT that have that sort of

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:21.660
active involvement of students
that, in the days of the

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.370
1860s, just didn't exist at
other places, or surely not to

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.170
any extent like it did at MIT.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:34.870
The other thing that Rogers
had was an eye for talent.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.470
Every great leader needs to
surround themselves with

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.400
capable people.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.050
And the more capable,
the better.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.420
And Rogers, I don't know if
you want to call it good

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.770
fortune or just the ability to
spot people and hire them.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.430
But he hired a very
talented staff.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.520
I think there were something
like 20 professors, maybe not

00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.000
even 20, by 1870, five years
after classes started.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.630
But at least half of them were
very, very competent people.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:08.190
And two of the most important
were a guy named Francis

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:13.390
Storer, S-T-O-R-E-R, and
somewhat younger guy, but not

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:17.340
a lot younger, Charles Eliot,
both of whom were chemists,

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.070
both of whom were Harvard
educated, and, it turns out,

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.640
both of whom were
brothers in law.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.610
Storer married Eliot's sister.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.610
And Storer came to MIT first.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.200
He was one of the first faculty
hired at MIT, to set

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.640
up a chemistry department
here.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.250
And then Eliot, who was studying
in Germany, was hired

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:43.390
like in 1867 to come in and
fill out that enterprise.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:49.450
And they end up building
one of the first really

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.700
experimental research oriented
laboratories in the United

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.760
States, academic, anyway.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:00.670
And they also are the first to
write textbooks for the study

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.180
of chemistry, and chemical
experiments, and things like--

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.450
two very famous textbooks that
were published during the

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.470
early, well, the late 1860s
and early 1870s.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.910
So they're important people.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:15.720
Now the interesting thing is
that Eliot was at MIT a very

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.870
short period of time.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.810
He came and '67 and he
left in '69 to become

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.860
President of Harvard.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.910
And interestingly, it's Eliot
who really initiates all these

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:34.240
attempts to merge Harvard
with MIT.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.840
The essay that you read today
called, "The New Education,"

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.030
same guy, Charles Eliot, the
author is Charles Eliot.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.830
He wrote that while he was at
MIT, but the same year that

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.610
essay was published, he becomes
president of Harvard.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.310
And immediately, he starts
making overtures to William

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.740
Rogers about, come
on, Bill, let's--

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.960
I don't know if they'd
call him Bill.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.940
I've often wondered, what did
they call William-- did

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.640
William Rogers have
a nickname?

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.930
We had a reunion over in
Burton-Conner about two or

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.420
three weeks ago, and they
had this big cut

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.240
out picture of Rogers.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.565
And one of the students from
Burton-Conner came over and

00:30:10.565 --> 00:30:15.260
clipped a little ID badge on
him saying, "Billy." But I

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.260
can't imagine, William Rogers,
does not strike me that you

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.100
would walk up and call
him Billy Rogers.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.790
I don't know if he had
a nickname or not.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.180
But in any case, Eliot liked--

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.930
DAVID KAISER: Mr. Rogers.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:26.340
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.870
Mr. Rogers, that would
even be better.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:29.870
Yeah, Mr. Rogers.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.670
DAVID KAISER: And they called
MIT Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.040
PROFESSOR: Well, you're
just full of neat

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.410
observations today.

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.200
DAVID KAISER: That's
my job, [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.760
PROFESSOR: That's good.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.310
That's good.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.850
You remind me of Waldorf over
and-- you know, the muppets up

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:43.730
in the balcony?

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:44.500
DAVID KAISER: [LAUGHS]

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.320
PROFESSOR: You're
Waldorf today.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.850
Anyway, Eliot really liked
what he saw at MIT.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.820
He clearly thinks that MIT
is the core of this "new

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.240
education." This is where
the action was at.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.600
And he tried very hard during
his presidential years at

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.950
Harvard-- and he was president
of Harvard for at, what, 35

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:04.580
years or so?

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.400
A long time.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.630
Never happened.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.180
But that was one of his
fondest wishes.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.090
And he was one of these early
hires that William Barton

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:15.410
Rogers made here.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.070
Clearly, he had sold Eliot
on the MIT vision.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.390
There were others.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:29.680
Edward Pickering, like Eliot and
Storer, established a very

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.070
famous lab in physics here.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.660
And he was literally Rogers
successor as the teacher of

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.350
physics at MIT--

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.870
again, another Harvard
graduate.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.870
All these early professors are
pretty much Harvard graduates

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:48.500
who came to MIT and then, like
Storer and Eliot, often left

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.790
MIT to go back to Harvard,
interestingly.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.030
I don't know exactly why.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.400
Eliot was a very persuasive
person, but I'm sure Harvard

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.970
could shake a lot more money in
their faces, too, in terms

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.300
of salaries and things
like that.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:06.300
That's probably important,
an important attraction.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.960
So Pickering, as I recollect,
also returned to Harvard at

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.300
one point in this career.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:17.210
But he was a very important
laboratory builder here at MIT

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:20.930
that established, again, the MIT
model for spreading this

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.860
new vision of education
around the country.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.310
And then finally, in
architecture, another Harvard

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.080
graduate, William Ware,
establishes the Department of

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.190
Architecture at MIT.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:35.580
It's the first in the country,
and very successful, very much

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:41.030
oriented towards this hands on,
laboratory oriented design

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.900
process in architecture.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.170
He was at MIT for
about 15 years.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.480
And then he leaves to go to
Columbia and establish a

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.940
similar school at Columbia.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.230
He's considered the leading
educator in architecture of

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:58.120
the late 19th century.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.350
So you have here, in this
early faculty, some very

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.850
interesting and significant
people.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.250
And I think the important thing,
for the purposes of our

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.160
discussion today, is that
Rogers hired these guys.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.000
He had an eye for talent.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.400
And there's nothing like having
great talent around you

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.030
to build a great institution.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.360
And that was underway
by the 1870s.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.360
People were actually writing to
Rogers by the 1870s, like,

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.670
within five years of the
founding of this place,

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:33.000
saying, MIT is making
itself heard.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.910
And that reputation continues
to gain momentum throughout

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.450
the decades of the late
19th century.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:48.150
So much so that in the paper
that I wrote, I refer to

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:52.240
Francis Amasa Walker, who was
the third president of MIT

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.890
making his annual report in
1894, in which he comes out

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.460
and says, basically, thanks
to the founders of this

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.005
Institute, and especially to
William Rogers, the battle of

00:34:03.005 --> 00:34:04.780
"the new education" " has won.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.840
Well, the new education meant
that MIT had now become the

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:14.219
great model of this new way of
educating people toward a more

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:18.929
integrated curriculum built
around science and

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:19.830
engineering.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.679
That was a new model.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.860
And when you look around the
country today, virtually every

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:30.770
major university has sort of
bought in to that model.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.330
Even a number of small colleges
have, but especially

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.389
large state universities--

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:39.510
very much influenced by
this MIT approach.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.510
Now the final point to be made
about Rogers, I think, is that

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.929
he's one of the country's
first geologists,

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:48.239
professional geologist.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:49.929
He's one of the founders
of the field

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.889
in the United States.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:56.610
He is also a founder of the
American Association for the

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.650
Advancement of Science.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:01.990
He's not and he's not on the
inside of that operation, but

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:06.630
he's definitely consulted about
it, is an early member,

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.570
and plays a role in it.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.250
But he is an important geologist
in the history of

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.160
science in this country.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.410
And he's also an early defender
of Charles Darwin.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.650
Darwin's Origins of Species,
the famous book on

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.450
evolutionary theory, was
published in 1859.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.590
And Rogers was one of the first
in the Boston area to

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.780
embrace that theory,
and defend it, and

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.200
argue that it had--

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.970
from his geological perspective

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.300
was a viable theory.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.710
He was opposed, very vigorously,
by a zoologist

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:47.020
from Harvard named Louis
Agassiz, who, in more than one

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:52.850
time, tried to do in Rogers,
both as a geologist and as the

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.670
founder of MIT.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:36:01.250
But, again Rogers had staying
power and was able to make its

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.010
way through all these crises.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:08.400
But I think as a geologist, he
often gets forgotten in that

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.740
area, even though he
was an important

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.950
contributor to that field.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.610
Now what are the take
home points of the

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:14.540
essay that I wrote.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.480
I'll give you three.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.600
One is obvious.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.790
It's the sustainability of
Rogers' vision for MIT--

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:23.185
the mens et manus theme.

00:36:23.185 --> 00:36:27.845
The idea of combining, bringing
together science and

00:36:27.845 --> 00:36:30.140
the useful arts.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.610
It's a remarkable continuity,
if you ask me.

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:35.360
I think it's something that has
maintained itself right up

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.740
to the present.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.570
That's amazing.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.260
This place is 150 years old, and
yet the founding vision of

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.370
the place still informs
it in many ways.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.130
Now that doesn't mean there
haven't been changes.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.260
There surely have been.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.840
And we'll see them
during the term.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:54.190
But that basic concept has
maintained itself.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:56.380
That's amazing to me.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.770
Another thing that's important
to note here is the role of

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:04.770
the state in the founding of
MIT, the fact that the state

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.830
of Massachusetts, funded by
the federal government,

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.430
basically, put up a lot of the
real seed bed money that was

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.020
used to get this
place started.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.230
And then that, in turn,
attracted private

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.680
donations to MIT.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.530
But as late as the 1890s, MIT
was petitioning the state of

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:29.810
Massachusetts for increments of
$25,000 a year, simply to

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:33.010
try to support the building of
labs and stuff like that.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:38.310
So Massachusetts have a long
history of involvement with

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:42.290
MIT, even though this was
supposedly a "private

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.960
corporation." It's curious.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.280
It's a land grant school that
is a private corporation.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.090
Not many were like that.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.733
Most were state universities
that were state controlled and

00:37:54.733 --> 00:37:57.460
did not have this word
corporation.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.560
You might have been a member of
the board of trustees, but

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.870
you were not a member
of the corporation

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.120
like we have today.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.020
So again the state is
important here.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:14.130
And then finally, just about
MIT's significance, it's the

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.760
new education that's
important.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:22.020
It's a new breed of cat that's
being developed here, and it's

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.580
one that had legs.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.810
It's probably had, I suppose,
this sounds so much like a

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:31.210
homer lecture, but
it is, in a way.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.700
I'm enthusiastic about
the history of MIT.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.990
Maybe it's because I haven't
learned enough about it yet.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:41.500
But the vision for MIT
had an impact.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.010
It made impacts elsewhere.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.460
It continues to have that.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.060
We'll talk about, later in the
term, about how the MIT model

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.660
is now being exported to
Singapore, and to India, and

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.480
all over the world.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.090
So it's had enormous,
enormous impact.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.380
And that's not something
to be sneezed at.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.770
And it's really why Charles
Eliot wrote that essay called

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.120
"The New Education," was to
point out, this is something

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.340
new and different.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.740
This is worth attending to.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.960
And he does a survey of all
these various schools and says

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.130
the real place where the
action is is MIT.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.280
That's 1869.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.800
Within months, he was going to
become president of Harvard

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.790
and, as I said, made numerous
attempts to try to bring MIT

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.910
into the Harvard fold,
unsuccessfully.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:40.390
So David suggested that's
my remarks, OK.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.170
Brilliant.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.630
Aren't they?

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.310
Eli, you thought they were
pretty good, huh?

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.560
That's good.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:51.790
I know all these people.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.820
So you're wondering, why is he
talking to them, you know?

00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:00.240
Anyway, David suggested, before
the class started, that

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.840
we take a closer look at
Eliot's piece "The New

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.070
Education." I debated about
whether we should have you

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.530
read this or not because,
frankly, it's pretty boring.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.020
It's not an easy
piece to read.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.770
It's written in a very stilted,
19th century style.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.040
And yet it's says things, if you
can make your way through

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.830
it, it does say things,
I think, that are

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.980
important to note.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.930
And so, this is basically
Charles Eliot's take on the

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.860
state of education, higher
education, in the United

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.240
States circa 1869.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.980
That's really what this
essay is about.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:42.450
And the big distinction he makes
is that he talks about

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:47.480
how there are basically three
different types of higher

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.930
education institutions
in the United States.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:55.190
There are the classical colleges
that teach Latin and

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:59.280
Greek, mathematics, the typical
curriculum aimed at

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.030
cultivating an educated
gentleman for society.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:06.230
That's where gentlemanly
people went.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:10.320
Ladies, I'm sorry, were not
admitted to those schools in

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.200
those days.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.230
Most women, in those days, if
they went to college at all,

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:20.670
and many of them did
not, went to--

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.950
my grandmother, who went to one
of these college called

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:30.190
state teachers institutes, or
educational institutes.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:34.180
But rarely would you see women
on the campus of Yale.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.880
I don't even know
if Yale admitted

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.420
women, did they in the--?

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.170
DAVID KAISER: 1969.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.970
PROFESSOR: Wow.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.260
See?

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:41.940
It's a good--

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.840
OK.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.280
Well, Harvard had Radcliffe.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.120
So they're next door neighbors,
but there's this

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.190
divorce that exists.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.640
Now, interestingly, Rogers,
from day one, said we will

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.280
admit women to this place.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.670
A very, very small
number came.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:02.240
And most of those who did come
were called special students.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.640
They were not regular students
like you are but rather

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.870
special students who were part
time, basically, part time

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.380
students, women who were working
in the area who wanted

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.270
to take a chemistry class or
something, could enroll here.

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:21.510
But for it's day, that was quite
a revolutionary and open

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.190
minded thing to do, I think.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.100
But he was very open to that.

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.870
He was very much a reformer,
I think.

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:30.120
He was involved in the
abolitionist movement.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.860
And David pointed out today that
one of his friends from

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.660
Virginia, a guy named Edmund
Ruffin, was actually one of

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.560
the first to fire the
Confederate cannons on Fort

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.430
Sumter in 1861.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.620
So here's this man coming out
of Virginia who was imbued

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:52.166
with this slave oriented ethos
that's pervaded Virginia prior

00:42:52.166 --> 00:42:59.020
to the Civil War, who was open
minded enough to see the

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.340
problems and downright evils of
slavery, resist them, and,

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.410
eventually, remove himself
from the South

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:05.190
and come to New England.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.610
That's one of the reasons
he moved here.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:11.760
He was just so sick of the
violent society that Virginia

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:16.620
had become by the 1850s,
especially around slavery.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.270
A lot of his problems came
from that direction.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.810
Well, when Eliot writes about
"The New Education," he

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.460
doesn't use that phrase
a lot in here.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.910
You really have to
kind of look--

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:31.180
he may have mentioned the term
new education or some variant

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.560
of it maybe three or four times
in the entire essay.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.120
It's not something he's
pounding away at.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.220
But he's making as interesting
comparisons, first, between

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:44.430
these three kinds of
institutions that are trying

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:49.420
to organize educational
framework around the useful

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.200
arts and science.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.040
And he argues that two of them
are just abject failures,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.470
basically, there are schools
like the Lawrence School at

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:04.280
Harvard, or the Sheffield
School at Yale, or the

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:10.450
Chandler School at Dartmouth,
that make the attempt but can

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:15.690
never quite achieve what is
needed to be done because

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:19.620
their faculty come from
the school itself.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.740
And as a result, the faculty
loyalties and the degree of

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.680
involvement in these new
ways of educating

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.410
students is never complete.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:32.290
It's always sort of
a halfway process.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.400
And that's something that
bothered Eliot a great deal,

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.600
especially about Harvard because
the Lawrence School

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.810
was heavily endowed
for its day.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:42.780
And yet it had really had a
sort of a meager record of

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.190
turning out students who
were well educated

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.480
in the useful arts.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.080
And so that's a problem.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.130
There are other types of
colleges that he talks about

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.330
with reference to the useful
arts, smaller schools like

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:04.020
Union College up in Schenectady,
New York or Brown

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.470
University down in Providence.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.200
And basically, the argument is
somewhat similar there, is

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.950
that it's hard to introduce this
new concept of combining

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:18.480
useful arts and science in
environments that have been

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.350
completely oriented toward
the classical education

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.250
up until that time.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.020
It's very difficult
to do that.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:29.160
And as a result, he says, it's
really to the third type of

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.240
school, the RPIs, the MITs, are
the two main ones where

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.540
this model is more likely
to succeed.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:42.140
And there, he says that RPI's
been quite successful at it.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:46.560
It's really the first civilian
engineering school founded in

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.400
the United States.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.230
It dates to 1824.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.240
And RPI is basically a place
that trains civil engineers.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.730
It does not get into mechanical
engineering or

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.650
metallurgical engineering,
things like that.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.620
It's strictly oriented toward
civil engineering-- by the

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.500
time the Civil War,
very successful.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.830
But it's really to MIT
that he looks.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:13.150
And he says now here is the
model because it's so open to

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.360
educating not only civil
engineers but mechanical

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.970
engineers, architects,
metallurgical engineers--

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:25.070
MIT has a menu by the late 1860s
that no other school

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.350
really has.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:29.460
And so that is, I think,
a distinctive

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.735
comment that he makes.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:40.320
But basically, I read this,
and for me the takeaway is

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.520
that Eliot loves MIT.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:48.620
He sees MIT as the new direction
for higher education

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.740
and that's doing something
different than any other place

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.120
has ever done.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.370
It's a good question.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.840
The interesting thing, I wanted
to note, here, though

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:02.610
is that on page 216 near the
end, yeah, he's talking about

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:07.380
RPI and MIT, but he makes no
reference to the US Military

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.055
Academy, which is arguably the
first engineering school in

00:47:10.055 --> 00:47:10.910
the United States.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:14.010
It's modeled after the French
Ecole Polytechnique--

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:17.030
except for a footnote at
the bottom of 216.

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.130
Did you see this note?

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.670
He says the United States Naval
and military academies

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:25.440
are not referred to at length
because-- they're not refer to

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.990
at all, basically, because
access to them is not free.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.810
A thoroughly vicious system
blah, blah, blah.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.930
He does not like the
military academies.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:40.040
But he completely erases
them from the essay.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.426
Did you have your hand up?

00:47:41.426 --> 00:47:42.764
AUDIENCE: Um, not really.

00:47:42.764 --> 00:47:43.210
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:43.660
AUDIENCE: No.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.810
PROFESSOR: Oh OK, I thought
you were waving your hand

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.630
going, I object!

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.800
He's just anti-militarist,
or something.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.470
But those are important
places--

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:55.760
especially West Point.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:02.030
In fact, I think I say it in my
essay, that the president

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:05.700
of Brown University, Francis
Wayland, made a comment in the

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.200
1850s that West Point had
trained more engineers then

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.600
all the other colleges in the
United States put together.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.470
Well, that says something.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:16.850
It's not a big school.

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:20.550
And it also tells you about the
need for more engineers in

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:22.570
the country because West
Point could not produce

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.110
all of these people.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:29.360
Hence the reason why MIT became
so important by the

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.580
later decades of the
19th century.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:37.980
And where did early MIT
graduates go to work?

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.220
Many of them went
to railroads.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.400
That was the big industry
after the Civil War.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.520
And many of them go into the
railroad industry as managers,

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.420
engineers, railroad builders.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.530
Many go into chemical industries
that are beginning

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.540
to emerge during this
period too.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.040
It's interesting, for example,
that the du Pont family sends

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.120
the best and brightest of their
family, of young people,

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.750
up here to get educated.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:04.760
Pierre du Pont, one of
the really important

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:08.040
industrialists of the early 20th
century, is a graduate of

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.780
MIT class of 1890.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.660
And there were other du Ponts
that came here, too, but he's

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.230
probably the most important.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:21.690
And Arthur D. Little, famous
AD Little Laboratories.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.210
I don't know if they're still,
are they still in operation?

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.295
Private research laboratories
in chemistry?

00:49:27.295 --> 00:49:29.570
DAVID KAISER: I belive AD Little
is still in operation

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:31.710
but they sold off
the R&D lab--

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:32.390
PROFESSOR: They did, OK.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.310
DAVID KAISER: To an MIT
alum, actually, Kenan

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:35.730
Sahin, owns it now.

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:36.695
And it's got a different name.

00:49:36.695 --> 00:49:36.980
PROFESSOR: Oh, he did?

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.050
OK.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:44.000
Well, there's a list of very
eminent engineers, chemists,

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.910
applied scientists that are
coming out of MIT by the 1890s

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:53.600
that go on to really play a
big role in the commercial

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.930
development and
industrialization of the

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:57.410
United States in the
20th century.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:59.920
So MIT has had an impact.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.160
I don't know if you want to
say any more about Charles

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.520
Eliot's piece here.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:05.800
DAVID KAISER: I would
read through little

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.460
bit of it in detail.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.120
PROFESSOR: Go ahead.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.220
DAVID KAISER: How many people
brought the piece

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.700
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.670
PROFESSOR: Can you get it
off the scholar site?

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:16.300
DAVID KAISER: If you have it,
maybe pull it out because it's

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.630
sort of worth, I think, reading
parts of it in some

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:24.220
detail because, first of all,
it's a good exercise in what

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.010
we call close reading,
were how you--

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.630
I mean, the language
a little foreign.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:31.370
It's not very foreign, but
what's being said between the

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.370
lines, or what's he assuming
that people are saying.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.500
And I think some of it is
relevant to both what

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.410
[? Rowe ?] was saying, and
even to MIT today.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.410
I'm sorry?

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:45.990
It is on Stellar, yeah, so
if you have a laptop

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:47.742
you can find it.

00:50:47.742 --> 00:50:49.650
You know, he starts out
with this line--

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:54.220
"what can I do with my boy?"
Which is very interesting.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:57.320
I mean, obviously it's only
boys and men that he's

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.740
addressed like [? Rowe ?]
mentioned, that was the

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:02.720
language of the day, up until
a couple of decades ago.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.860
But, sort of addressed to the
parents, and of if you read

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.360
down a little bit, this is what
a parent might say, I

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.130
want to give my boy practical
education.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.770
One that will prepare him better
than I was prepared to

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:18.590
follow my business, or any
other active calling.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:23.390
And I like that phrase active
calling, because implied there

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.960
is there are passive callings.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.320
I wonder what he means by
a non active calling.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:34.690
I would guess he would mean the
clergy, or probably law,

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:36.560
and he comes back to
them a little bit.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.780
And then he says this is a
problem that everyone has, but

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.420
the difficulty presses more
heavily-- still in the first

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.200
paragraph--

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.940
on the thoughtful American
than on the European.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.580
And so he's making a distinction
that the

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:55.630
conditions of this country are
special, in some way, for this

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:56.530
kind of education.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:02.010
It's not the modern phrase of
old Europe, there are special

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:05.930
things here, because the
American is free to choose, in

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:10.070
a way, a way of life for himself
and his children.

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:10.600
And then--

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.690
a couple lines down-- in the
face of prodigious material

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:17.610
resources of a vast and new
territory, he is more fully

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:20.620
awake then the European can be
to the gravity and urgency of

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.140
the problem.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.860
Also a really interesting way to
start out at the beginning,

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.980
that there are special things
about this country.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.380
That's not a new idea, American
exceptionalism, is

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.050
what historians call it.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.730
But, the conditions here are
different than in Europe.

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:34.780
Partly because of the huge
size of the place.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.020
Partly because of the huge
amount of resources.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:41.530
And that makes the American
more fully awake.

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:44.870
And yet, he has fewer options
than any other, except

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.370
possibly the English, of
solving the problem.

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:52.920
And then on the next column,
he refers to implicitly

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.060
particularly the French
engineering schools.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:58.110
For more than a generation the
government schools of arts and

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.290
trades, arts and manufactures,
bridges and highways--

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:03.286
one of the famous French
engineering school is Ponts Et

00:53:03.286 --> 00:53:06.240
Chaussees, the school of
bridges and highways--

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:06.960
Ecole Des Mines--

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.020
another famous French
engineering school--

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.060
mines, agriculture, and commerce
have introduced

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:15.800
hundreds of well trained
young men.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.750
They begin as subalterns,
basically low people on the

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:23.160
totem pole, but soon become the
commission's officers of

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.620
the army, and of industry.

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.080
Which is interesting too, what
is the problem that the

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.630
European engineering schools
are feeding?

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:33.760
They don't have vast territory
remaining, they don't have

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.700
vast resources in their
countries, where are all those

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:42.210
engineers going, if in the US
they're going out west?

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:44.160
Into the colonies.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.950
It's a problem of maintaining
the empire.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:47.790
He doesn't talk too much about,
he does use the word

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:51.440
empire in there, but in a way
he's sort of arguing that

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.320
America has its own empire
right here, and French

00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.610
particularly, German, English,
they're all building railroads

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:02.460
in the colonies, a little
bit more in

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.900
the later 19th century.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.670
PROFESSOR: Think, for example,
the British and India, huge,

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:08.570
huge, and that's only a
part of the British

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:09.850
empire in that period.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.280
It's a huge empire.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.570
DAVID KAISER: Then he this
great line, The American

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:15.360
people are fighting
the wilderness,

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.840
physical and moral.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.980
Which is funny, it's also
interesting, this is four

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.080
years after the Civil War.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.270
In fact, most of the stuff we've
been reading, relatively

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:26.330
recent, doesn't mention
the war in here.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.140
You have a country that just
lost the better part of a

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.560
million people.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:34.910
The South has been destroyed to
a large degree by the war.

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:38.120
The young people's population
has been destroyed.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.210
I don't know, what was the
population of the US in the

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:41.370
time of the Civil War?

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:47.240
PROFESSOR: I want to say it's
around six million maybe?

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.480
DAVID KAISER: So six million,
even if you lost six--

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.180
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure.

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.140
DAVID KAISER: --hundred thousand
people out of that.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.040
10% of the population.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.330
Extend that out today, that's
like you having a civil war

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:58.260
where you are losing tens
of millions of people.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.300
Nobody would have been
unaffected, and he doesn't

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.100
mention it in this piece,
which is also very

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:02.530
interesting.

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:05.760
PROFESSOR: I know one thing,
the South lost 25% of it's

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.270
younger men during that war.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.525
25%--

00:55:08.525 --> 00:55:08.780
DAVID KAISER: That's huge.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.060
PROFESSOR: --that's a big,
big, [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.250
DAVID KAISER: The American
people are fighting the

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.770
wilderness, physical
and moral.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:16.030
So, you wonder what that,
physical wilderness is

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:20.790
obvious, moral probably is
referring to the, I would

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:22.690
imagine, the Western
wars and--

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:23.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:23.945
DAVID KAISER: --fighting the--

00:55:23.945 --> 00:55:24.200
PROFESSOR: Indians.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.050
DAVID KAISER: --Native
Americans there.

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.220
And that's his vision
of the battle.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.820
At the same time, trying to work
out the awful problem of

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:31.970
self government.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:35.630
So he's tying these basic ideas
about education to both

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:37.710
the physical state of the
country, and also the

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:41.270
ideological and government
state of the country.

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:44.330
PROFESSOR: One thing to note
in all that is that William

00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:47.490
Tecumseh Sherman was a very
famous Civil War general, he's

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:50.550
the one that burned Atlanta,
and did the famous march to

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:56.590
the sea, was asked during the
1870's, what he thought about

00:55:56.590 --> 00:56:01.270
the quote "Indian problem"
Here's this movement west, and

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:02.770
the part of white settlers.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.080
He says, nothing to worry
about, we're building

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.960
railroads in the West and that's
driving a stake into

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.450
the heart of the American
Indian, or

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.000
something like that.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.560
That was going to do them in,
is the engineering of these

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.150
new railroad technologies, is
just going to overwhelm them,

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:20.180
and it did basically.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.550
DAVID KAISER: So down in the
bottom of that column he talks

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:25.830
about all these frustrations,
but he knows the greatness of

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:27.840
the material prizes to be won.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.150
So it's not an appeal for moral
elevation necessarily,

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:34.080
or this and that.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:41.860
It's an appeal for material
prizes, which is very much on

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.130
the mind of Americans,
since the founding

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:50.150
On the next page, just
interesting phrases on the top

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:54.710
left, on 204, These old ways
have trained some boys well,

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:59.150
for the life of 50 or 100 years
ago, And the American

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:01.850
will not believe that they are
applicable to his son.

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:04.490
For the reason that the kind of
man which he wants a son to

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.690
make, did not exist in all
the world 50 years ago.

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:11.730
This was 1869, and somebody
mentioned in one of their

00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:14.520
response papers that they
appreciated, from the reading,

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.200
how close the revolution still
was, in that most of the

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.432
fathers of these people would
have been directly involved in

00:57:19.432 --> 00:57:20.800
it, which is correct.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.600
So, 50 or 100 years ago
there's been all this

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:27.310
political upheaval and America
was a very agrarian society,

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.945
but everywhere was, and he's
really referring to what we

00:57:29.945 --> 00:57:31.960
now call the Industrial
Revolution there.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.680
Entirely new kind of people
are required.

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.080
Then also down in that column,
I think this is very

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.730
interesting too, it requires
courage to quit the beaten

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:49.080
paths in which the great
majority of well educated men

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.690
have walked, and still walk.

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:55.230
So he's basically saying, and
you even still hear this to

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:59.000
some degree today, the MIT
graduates especially if

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.710
they're successful, will enter
a world where everyone knows

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:03.120
Latin and Greek.

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.020
Everyone knows different
kinds of history.

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:08.760
Everyone is going to be
extremely well versed in

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.410
theology, and these other
things, and MIT graduates, for

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:13.600
the most part, won't be.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:17.070
But he refers to it as courage
to go into that world with

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:20.160
this new kind of training,
because it will be so rare, it

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.990
certainly was rare
at the time.

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:26.080
Frankly, it's still rare, as
you'll find what you graduate.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.960
And that he talks about
a special kind of

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.140
courage that's required.

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:36.060
And down at the end or that
paragraph, even more, a boy

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.050
who was brought up in a
different way suffers

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:41.350
somewhat, both in youth and
in manhood, from the mere

00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:44.870
singularity of his education,
though it may have been better

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:46.630
than the common.

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:48.300
I found that really interesting
to read.

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:53.050
I never thought about this
kind of education as

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:56.100
courageous, or the kind of
people who are educated, as

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:56.840
taking that on.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.060
Because you will be an anomaly,
you may not be if you

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.700
go work for a very highly
technical corporation in the

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:04.570
engineering part.

00:59:04.570 --> 00:59:07.080
But, most corporations, even
the very highly technical

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:10.170
ones, as you rise up the people
are less and less

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:12.400
engineering educated, not
to mention in the

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.650
general social world.

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:21.570
Then he talks a little bit about
the organization that

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:23.380
Roe mentioned on the
next column.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.580
A large number of professors
trained in the existing

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.940
methods, hold firm possession
and transmit the traditions

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.990
they inherited.

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:32.590
And I just thought that was an
interesting word, inherited.

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:35.270
Because again, he's kind of
trying to overthrow European

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:38.810
model of inheritance, comes back
to that in a minute, and

00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:42.190
again the American model
is one of earning it.

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:48.160
And he talks here about how
stodgy these old systems are,

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.010
backed by the reputation of
their authors and the capital

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:53.000
of their publishers.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.980
Steadily fed by schools whose
masters are inspired, these

00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.460
are the older schools, and
all the so-called learned

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.620
professions, I love that
kind of language.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.120
Again, I think that's really a
dig at, probably, both the

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.810
clergy and the legal
profession, maybe

01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:10.060
some others as well.

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.990
Also, makes a distinction
between, it's an interesting

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:20.310
thing about, that none of the
MIT founders have any problem

01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:22.000
teaching languages.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.770
Which is interesting because one
of the few things that was

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:26.260
required then, that's not
required now, which I'm not

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.460
sure is the greatest idea, but
it's the living languages

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.960
versus dead languages.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.730
Especially, then if you don't
read French and German, you

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.820
can't read engineering
literature basically.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.010
It's not so true today.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.070
German was, for many years, the
real classic engineering

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.890
literature.

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.390
But just not Latin and Greek.

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:51.280
And then there's a great line on
the top of the 205 where he

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.060
talks about, again, the
old style educators.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.020
To have been a school master or
college professor 30 years

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.810
ago only too often makes a man
an unsafe witness in matters

01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:02.165
of education.

01:01:02.165 --> 01:01:03.760
It Is just a great metaphor.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.850
There are flanges on his mental
wheels which will fit

01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:08.760
only one gauge.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.240
What is that a reference to?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.750
It's a railroad analogy.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:17.380
So he's using these sort of
technical analogies to make

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.630
his point about the education.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.190
Then he talks here, again, also
sort of a dis at the kind

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.790
of great professor model
of education.

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:32.360
In no country is so little
attention paid by parents and

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.140
students to the reputation of
teachers for genius and deep

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.950
learning as in our
own country.

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:40.260
Faradays, Rumfords,
and Cuviers--

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.030
these are the famous European
professors--

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:46.060
would get very few pupils here
if they're teachings were

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.780
unmethodical and objectless.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.500
If, in short, they taught under
a bad general system.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:55.070
Spasmodic and ill-directed
genius cannot compete in the

01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.870
American community with
methodical, careful, teaching

01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:01.050
by less inspired men.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.600
Very interesting argument
to make.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.470
I'm not sure if everyone would
agree with that today

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:08.370
necessarily, but obviously we
don't want to have spasmodic

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:10.340
and ill-directed directed
genius in

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.940
front of the classroom.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.300
But, it really is very much
an argument about order in

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:20.220
education and sort of focus
on what's empirical.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.350
And I think that's a really
important component of a lot

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:26.260
of the background here, we
haven't said anything about

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.140
the Enlightenment yet,
in this class.

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.630
Anybody heard that
phrase before?

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:35.490
Usually associated with the 18th
century, late 17th, most

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.770
of the 18th century, into
the early 19th.

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:41.230
But, one of the great focuses
of the Enlightenment is

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.890
empirical learning, not just
theorizing, not just the sort

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:48.760
of platonic philosophy of
working as the ancients

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:54.250
through a set of reasoned
arguments, but, actually

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.400
gathering data from the world.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.320
Now, what's interesting about
that, is there's sort of a

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.160
split that you observe where
if you look at someone like

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.030
Louis Agassiz who Roe has
mentioned, the great Harvard

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:08.800
natural history professor at
the time, very much an

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.620
enlightenment empiricist, in the
sense of Natural History.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.330
Has anybody been over to
the Harvard Natural

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:17.390
History Museum lately?

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:20.240
What kind of a museum is it?

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.740
AUDIENCE: It has
a lot of rocks.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.600
DAVID KAISER: OK,
a lot of rocks.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.850
What else?

01:03:26.965 --> 01:03:28.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:30.871
DAVID KAISER: What?

01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:30.990
Animals.

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.880
It's a kind of, old-fashioned,
glass case museum.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.170
Right?

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:37.670
Very typical, not what you'd
find, I was just at the

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:40.930
Natural History Museum in New
York, which is used to be that

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:43.340
kind of museum, and still has
pieces of it, but is a very

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.230
different kind of museum.

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:47.540
But the Harvard museums are sort
of lovely and wonderful

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:50.420
in this way, but there's cases
and cases of specimens,

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:55.260
whether they're , plants, or
stuffed animals, what's the

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:55.850
correct word?

01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:57.100
Taxidermy.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.120
I brought my daughter there
actually, she liked the

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.790
stuffed animals.

01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:08.470
Animals, plants, geological
specimens, and that's very

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.680
much the kind of natural
historical world that Louis

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.680
Agassiz represented.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.720
There, the empirical philosophy
was one of

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.110
collecting, ordering the
collection, everything's very

01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:20.760
carefully labeled.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.580
Very carefully name with a
very fancy Latin name.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:28.250
Often then numbered, drawers and
drawers, taking the world

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:31.230
classifying it, putting
it into a hierarchy.

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:34.630
You're familiar with the
Linnaean hierarchy of the

01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:35.950
natural world.

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:39.240
Very much an enlightenment
practice, but slightly more,

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.590
kind of, 18th century version
of it that Agassiz, sort of,

01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:46.350
still represents into
the 19th century.

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:49.330
Rogers, in his reaction against
that, is in a way,

01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:51.830
kind of even further, more
radical enlightenment.

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:54.160
What's different about the kind
of world that he would

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.460
think about?

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.580
Let me give you an example that
maybe you could set off.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.910
I was reading last night an
example of a student who said,

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:01.760
when I went to work for
Louis Agassiz at

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.280
Harvard as a student.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:09.030
Basically, he locked me in a
room with 500 tortoise shells

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:13.920
and no supporting anything, and
my job was to discern the

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.500
inherent truth of nature that
was collected in those

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.390
tortoise shells.

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:23.220
What's the kind of world, the
way that Rogers and an MIT

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.100
approach to that problem
might use?

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.710
It's also very empirical,
collecting

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:33.420
information from the world.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:35.910
So it's not that what
he's reacting

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:37.160
against is not empirical.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.920
Well first of all, intervention
by active

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.440
experiments.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.720
You're not just collecting the
world and putting it in glass

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.000
cases, you're often physically
out in it, collectors were

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.010
doing that too, but your making
changes to it, putting

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:55.670
things on, and also enhancing
your senses by using

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:57.440
instruments.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.030
He was a great fan, Rogers, of
new kinds of instrumentation

01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:03.190
and the uses of these kinds
of instruments.

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:08.470
They might be spectroscopes,
spectrographs, or obviously

01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:12.440
microscopes, but other kinds
of photometers and things.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:16.670
And a much more kind of, you
might call it high-tech in a

01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:21.100
way, but also very active
intervention in the world of

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.460
nature, the physical world, the
things you're going into.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.350
It's not a world of collecting
and classifying, and

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:29.990
discerning this inherent
underlying truth from.

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:33.910
It's a world of very active,
and again, as much for the

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:38.040
students as for the researchers
in his world.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.020
Which says something about
why he was such

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.380
an admirer of Darwin.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.830
Yeah, very much so.

01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:44.080
PROFESSOR: It's a world
that's evolving.

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:50.470
DAVID KAISER: There's a nice
story, which we haven't really

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:54.330
told about, when Rogers finally
gets the charter for

01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:57.410
MIT, and the war starts.

01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:00.100
And Massachusetts gives him
one year to come up with

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:04.230
$100,000, which is then later
extended to two years and he

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:06.280
almost doesn't make it except
for this big gift from

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.820
[? Walker ?].

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:11.090
And so he's figured, OK great,
now I'm off and running, I've

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:15.170
got all this time, the war is
probably going to delay our

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:16.990
plans a minute I can just
go raise money.

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:19.510
And the governor comes back to
him and says, oh, and by the

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:21.170
way, I would really like
you to become the

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:25.640
inspector of gas in Boston.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.830
And gas, at the time, is the
new high tech way to light

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:32.560
your home, and it's a
technological systems, there

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.520
are pipes being run under
the streets in the city.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.560
But it's very dangerous,
because as still

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.840
today, gas is explosive.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.660
Probably every few months, a
house in the Boston area blows

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.910
up because of a gas leak.

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:48.610
And Rogers says, no way,
I can't take the

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:49.460
time out to do this.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.450
This is crazy.

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:53.990
And the governor calls him in
for a one on one, and we don't

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:55.710
really know what was said,
but he walks out of there

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.470
convinced that he's
going to do it.

01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:59.290
So he takes on this job.

01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:02.800
And soon he finds that the
instruments that he's been

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.130
given to inspect the gas,
probably the quality of the

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:09.710
gas, and different chemical
composition of it, and the

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:12.800
different illuminating
capabilities, and maybe

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.000
measure leaks and things
for safety, are

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.350
inadequate for him.

01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:19.170
So he re-engineers, and
re-designs a number of the

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:20.279
instruments.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:22.470
And then he begins to see that
this is actually a very

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:25.350
valuable thing for him because
he uses the states money to

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.240
buy the latest instrumentation.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.200
He has very close contact with
industry, and it gives him

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.649
insight into what the latest
kinds of instrumentation

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:36.930
should be that the students at
MIT, that he would then buy

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:38.680
for the laboratories as
they're outfitting

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.640
laboratories.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.430
And it's a nice little story,
partly because of the kind of

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:46.060
ethos of presidents of MIT doing
national service, or in

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.660
that case they service, which is
something we'll talk about

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.240
later, starts at
the beginning.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.710
But also because it gets him
out in the world, get him

01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:55.720
involved, and he's very much
a fan of instrumentation.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.600
Even though you think about
geology in the 1830's and '40s

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.880
is not a ton of instrumentation
associated

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.740
with that, although certainly
there is in surveying.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:09.069
It gives you the sense of him as
not simply a scientist, but

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:10.319
also quite a tinkerer.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:16.340
A couple other things to point
out in Elliott essay.

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:23.850
I found it interesting because
I actually went to Yale as an

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:25.229
undergrad, and studied
engineering.

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:28.160
So, I could see why he thought
that was all the wrong model,

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.200
although he praises
it a little bit.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.319
But, at Yale the school he was
writing about, The Sheffield

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.939
Scientific School, which was
a very famous science and

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:38.130
engineering school, doesn't
exist anymore.

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:42.060
It was closed down by the Yale
faculty in the 1950s.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:48.670
So, it sort of supports his case
that, that kind of model

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:51.010
and The Lawrence Scientific
School doesn't existent at

01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:54.610
Harvard either anymore, that
that kind of model is the

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:57.400
wrong model, and not really
destined survive as a second

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.650
class citizen there.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.950
But there are a couple other
interesting pieces I

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:04.200
want to point out.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:15.070
He talks on page 215 about, and
this a good reminder, 216

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:18.180
on the bottom and the left,
he says, when the American

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.500
University emerges, it will
not be a copy of foreign

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.930
institutions or a
hotbed plant.

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:28.210
But the slow and natural
outgrowth of American social

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.800
and political habits.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.520
An expression of the average
aims and ambitions of the

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.280
better educated classes.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.260
That's interesting because you
think we've been spending all

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:39.200
of our time you're talking
about the emergence of an

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.950
American university, and the
whole issue vis a vis Harvard.

01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:44.250
What is he referring to there?

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:52.450
Well, it's worth keeping in
mind that everything we've

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:56.130
been talking about, so far, is
really about college teaching.

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.540
Harvard College is still Harvard
College at the time.

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.210
I don't know when they changed
their name to Harvard

01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:01.850
University.

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.090
He says the American college
is an institution without a

01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:07.880
parallel, the American
University future tense, will

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.410
be equally original.

01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:12.470
MIT is not a university then
either, some people think it

01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:16.350
isn't today, but I don't think
that's really right.

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.450
But what's the difference
between a college and

01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:19.700
university?

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.710
Simple crude distinction.

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:25.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
have more colleges.

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:26.460
DAVID KAISER: Sorry?

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.180
AUDIENCE: Universities have
[? several ?] colleges.

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:32.700
DAVID KAISER: Some
do, not all.

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.480
Graduate education.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.910
So that's actually the first,
does anybody know what the

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:40.790
first university is in
the United States?

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:42.580
Johns Hopkins actually.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:48.500
And it's founded late 19th,
early 20th century.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.990
Where you really have the idea
that there's research and

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:54.160
graduate education, combined
with a college.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.660
So it's just worth keeping
that in mind, as we move

01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:00.330
forward in time, and MIT does
become a university.

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:02.440
I mean if you read rankings,
everybody thinks of it as a

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.270
university.

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:05.292
There are people here still who
say, no it's a technical

01:12:05.292 --> 01:12:07.370
institute, it's not
a university.

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:10.740
I don't think there's really
too much to be argued for

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:15.850
that, but arguably MIT only
really became our university,

01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:17.460
in that sense, about
20 years ago.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.920
It's not an old thing.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.020
But the graduate model, the
American University that he is

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.020
referring to, is really still
40 years away when he's

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.130
writing this in 1869.

01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:31.860
Then I just thought there was a
great passage on 218, on the

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:36.410
right column, which also
have an amazing,

01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:38.560
and truly MIT metaphor.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.060
People who think vaguely about
the difference between a good

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:45.640
college and a good Polytechnic
school are apt to say, that

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.120
the aim of the college course is
to make a rounded man, with

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.700
all his faculties impartially
developed.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.870
While it is to express object of
a technical course to make

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.040
a one sided man, the mere

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.690
engineer, chemist, or architect.

01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:02.480
Two truths are supported in
this form of statement.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.540
First, faculties are
not given by God.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.630
Sorry, two truths
are suppressed

01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:10.030
in this form statement.

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:11.020
He was arguing against it.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:15.550
First, faculties are not given
by God impartially, to each

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:17.750
round soul a little
of each power.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:21.000
As if the soul were a pill,
which must contain it's due

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.110
proportion of many variance
ingredients.

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:26.550
To reason about the average
human mind as if it were a

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:29.300
globe, to be expanded
symmetrically from a center

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:32.600
outward, is to be betrayed
by metaphor.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.320
Then I love this.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.840
A cutting tool, a drill, or an
auger would be a juster symbol

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.850
of the mind.

01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:40.760
If there's not a great
MIT statement, I

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.580
think it's that one.

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.500
PROFESSOR: That's good.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.400
DAVID KAISER: The natural, best,
and particular quality

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.890
of everybody's mind
should be sacredly

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.560
regarded in his education.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.690
The division of mental labor,
which is essential in

01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:54.980
civilized communities, in order
that knowledge may grow

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.180
and society improve, demands
this regard to peculiar

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:02.390
constitution of each mind,
so on and so forth.

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:05.960
But I think, in some way, that's
also a nice statement

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:11.960
of the case for MIT, in
an intellectual sense.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:17.280
That, not everybody agrees with
it by any stretch, but

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.680
that the model of the mind is
the cutting tool, or the

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.040
drill, or the auger.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.740
Those of you, all of you, who
are here as undergrads could

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.630
probably feel maybe your mind
as being expected to behave

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:34.800
that way on a regular basis,
honed finely and sharpened.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.550
So, I sort of thought
it was worth going

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:37.580
through some of this.

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.000
It is a difficult
piece to read.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.200
It's written in this, sort of,
19th century English which can

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.560
be hard to read, but it's
actually a very rich piece,

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.980
and he's got a very strong
opinions, and some of them I

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.260
think are still valuable.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:54.890
I did exactly what he thought
was a bad idea.

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.820
Which was I did both a literary
education and

01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.990
engineering education
at the same time.

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:03.970
And given that there's only 24
hours a day, it's very hard.

01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:06.750
I always my students it's not
hard to do a double major,

01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:08.920
it's just twice the work.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.070
Which is sort of true, but
inevitably there are

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:13.600
compromises on either side.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.665
And the question is, what's
the benefit versus what's

01:15:16.665 --> 01:15:20.830
lost, I think it probably
depends on the individual and

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.300
what you see.

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:25.410
I think in all this
conversation, right, don't

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:29.180
forget that the people who run
this world are still more

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:31.630
Harvard graduates that
MIT graduates.

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:32.680
OK.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.570
There is something about that
model, you go over to Harvard

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:39.680
and you see Teddy Roosevelt,
and Franklin Roosevelt, and

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.530
John F Kennedy, and any number
of US presidents who have been

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:45.710
Harvard graduates.

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:49.830
And any number of Harvard
graduates who are in Congress,

01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:52.370
and the Senate, and the Supreme
Court, at any given

01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:57.300
time, far out way, and even
arguably at the top echelons

01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.120
of corporations,
MIT graduates.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.290
And it is worth thinking about
why that is, and why it hasn't

01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:09.500
been different in the last
150 years, that way.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.700
So what we're reading is the
argument of the people who

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.070
founded MIT, and there's
no question that in the

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:20.090
scientific and technological
world MIT graduates have been

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:23.910
great leaders, and actually in
other countries they are more

01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:27.750
likely to be found as presidents
or top political

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.240
leaders than they are
in this country.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.140
There are many other countries
where engineering is a much

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:33.950
higher prestige profession,
relatively

01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:36.770
speaking, than it is here.

01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:42.570
And there's reasons for
that, historically.

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:45.010
Even in France, for example,
the polytechnic graduates

01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:47.975
really are the people who
populate the upper echelons of

01:16:47.975 --> 01:16:48.720
the government.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.320
That may be changing now
in the last 20 years.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.550
But it has not been changing
dramatically.

01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:59.110
And so there's a lot of
reasons for that.

01:16:59.110 --> 01:17:01.370
And it's a whole other
conversation to have.

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:06.710
But it is interesting to think
about what it really takes to

01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:13.490
train people to be leaders and
how well are we doing at that?

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:17.620
Or how well does Eliot's
model do that?

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.720
I think the general principle
of it really does go back to

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.340
the beginning.

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:28.250
There has always been a fair
amount of English history,

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:30.750
management sort of stuff,
languages, again.

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:33.590
Languages, were considered,
frankly, they probably should

01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:36.090
still be considered, a core part
of a technical education.

01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:39.220
Because we go around as MIT
saying we're training global

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:42.690
leaders and to do that and not
have a language requirement

01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:45.030
for the undergraduates is a
little bit missing the mark.

01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:47.250
That's my opinion.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:50.940
And I'm not someone who's good
with languages at all.

01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:54.800
But many colleges have language
requirements, and it

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.050
probably would be, as someone
pointed out, more Chinese than

01:17:58.050 --> 01:17:59.500
German today.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.080
That's fine.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.510
That's the way the
world is going.

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:04.450
But whatever people
took would surely

01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:07.610
benefit them in the world.

01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:10.260
But the actual school of
humanities and social sciences

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.270
was founded in 1949.

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:17.430
We just celebrated, well just,
10 years ago, we celebrated

01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:20.660
the 50th anniversary
of the school.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:23.880
And the actual eight courses,
I believe, dates from then.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.160
And that was a product, and
we'll come across this, and

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.310
we'll read the report that the
so-called Lewis Commission

01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:33.180
wrote at the end of World War
II, which really did a lot of

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:37.280
introspection about what kind
of place is MIT becoming.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.580
There's all this military
research, there's all this big

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.140
time research on campus.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.000
What do we really owe
our students?

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.990
And you all know that you have
eight required HASS courses.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:51.760
That's quite a bit larger than
most comparable technical

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:57.800
institutions like Caltech
and RPI, Georgia Tech.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.970
It's usually lower.

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:02.490
Certainly overseas at technical
institutions it's

01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:04.480
close to zero.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.790
And so it is a much bigger
component of it and arguably

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:12.690
why MIT can consider itself now
among the top ranks of the

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:14.310
universities.

01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:17.760
If you asked people at MIT
20 years ago, who are our

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.380
competitors?

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:23.090
They'd say Caltech, Georgia
Tech, RPI, The Royal

01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:26.510
Institute, ETH in Zurich
and so on.

01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:30.370
Now, people will say Harvard,
Yale, Stanford, Princeton.

01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:34.320
And that's really only in the
last 20 years that I know as

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:39.520
we compete for undergraduates,
most students who say no to

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.252
MIT as undergrads,
where do they go?

01:19:42.252 --> 01:19:42.966
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:42.966 --> 01:19:43.204
Harvard?

01:19:43.204 --> 01:19:46.170
DAVID KAISER: No, Stanford is
the place where you lose the

01:19:46.170 --> 01:19:46.910
most people to.

01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:49.910
So that's a good measure of who
you think you're competing

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:53.090
against when you accept the
student, and they say no,

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:55.180
where are they going?

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.580
Far fewer do we lose
to Caltech or

01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:00.280
RPI or Georgia Tech.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:00.720
That's true--

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.424
AUDIENCE: Does that also
have to do with

01:20:02.424 --> 01:20:04.129
the size of the school?

01:20:04.129 --> 01:20:07.051
Like Stanford is a larger
school than Caltech.

01:20:07.051 --> 01:20:08.440
DAVID KAISER: It may well.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.770
But Stanford is a very different
place from Caltech.

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:13.520
And so Caltech is a very small
college, as you know.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.535
It's really, still is, in
many ways a college.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:23.330
Other questions?

01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:25.369
Comments from the reading?

01:20:25.369 --> 01:20:26.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you
mentioned before that

01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:28.243
[INAUDIBLE] college
and universities.

01:20:28.243 --> 01:20:32.250
So how did graduate education
work for people in the 19th

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:35.090
century here, or how did
it work in Europe?

01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:38.376
Was there a lot of advanced
degrees [? conferred?]

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:41.592
in physics or what not?

01:20:41.592 --> 01:20:46.810
DAVID KAISER: Well, up into the
1920's, certainly in the

01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:51.820
sciences, if you wanted to get a
Ph.D, you went to Germany or

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.780
to Europe in general, England,
France as well.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:59.670
And so if you look at the MIT
faculty in the sciences in the

01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:03.560
teens and '20s, most of them
would probably have European

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.290
educations at the
graduate level.

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:08.010
That was not just because of
what programs were available

01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:09.750
but also because
of the quality.

01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:12.250
It was really the German
universities in physics that

01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:13.200
were the main thing.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.790
That begin to change during
the decades before the

01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:16.750
second World War.

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:20.800
Not least when a lot of European
professors came here.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.250
But PhDs in engineering, I mean
you don't even see them--

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:26.460
MIT did not--

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:31.250
I know Vannevar Bush, who
graduated with a Ph.D in 1916,

01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:34.740
I believe, that was MIT's fifth
Ph.D in engineering.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:40.430
So a 20th century phenomena
to be sure.

01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:44.650
And, again, engineering was
considered a useful art.

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:49.380
A Ph.D was considered a high,
scholarly calling.

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:54.250
And there was a lot of ferment
in and around I want to say

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:57.282
1890 to 1905 or so.

01:21:57.282 --> 01:22:00.160
University of Chicago
was big in that.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.410
They hired--

01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:05.630
it was in Worcester, Clark
University used to have all

01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:06.620
these famous people.

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.510
Robert Goddard was there
for a while and so on.

01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:12.060
And now it's sort of a little
university in a way.

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:12.270
Why?

01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:14.260
Because the University of
Chicago came in with a lot of

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:19.870
money and hired away all their
people around 1910, I believe.

01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:23.790
So it's very much a 20th
century thing.

01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:29.800
PROFESSOR: I was thinking about
Warren Lewis who is the

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.730
author of the report David
referred to that established

01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:36.380
the humanities requirement
at MIT.

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.550
He was a chemical engineer.

01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:46.050
And he joined the MIT faculty
around 1910, 1911 after doing

01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:48.700
his Ph.D in Germany.

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:52.180
And so he's right at the
borderline, I think.

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.520
And he's very much responsible,
in a way, for not

01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:00.650
just revolutionizing
undergraduate education after

01:23:00.650 --> 01:23:05.720
World War II but also being
involved in the establishment

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.310
of doctoral programs at MIT.

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:12.890
After the arrival of Karl
Compton which is 1930 that--

01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:17.850
Compton is a physicist who came
to MIT from Princeton and

01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:22.390
comes out of a background at
which doctoral education is

01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:23.450
important to him.

01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:24.860
And so he supports that.

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:28.310
And then it really grows, I
think, during his presidency

01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:29.840
and then beyond.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.420
But Lewis is a really
interesting person.

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:37.440
To think that here's a chemical
engineer who is

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:42.890
talking so strongly about the
need for humanities education

01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:45.350
at a technical university,
basically, or a technical

01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:48.560
institute is very interesting.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.030
His granddaughter is a
colleague of ours.

01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:55.800
And I think she's coming to
give a talk about him.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.880
He's extremely interesting, he's
one of these key people

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:02.100
at MIT in the 20th century
that had his

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.660
hand on a lot of things.

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:07.580
DAVID KAISER: You would not find
MIT faculty mostly having

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.500
PhDs until probably
also about 1920.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.660
Arthur Kennelly is either the
first or one of the first

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:19.280
electrical engineering
professors here and really

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.590
kind of founds the department.

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:22.310
He was Bush's advisor.

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:23.570
Where did he come from?

01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:25.880
He worked in Thomas
Edison's lab.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:29.980
I don't believe he had a Ph.D.
And Edison really started this

01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:33.590
model of industrial research
around the 1890s.

01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:36.240
And that was what brought
people back in.

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.590
PROFESSOR: Is that it begins to
happen after World War II

01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:44.140
mainly because so much
important research

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.230
was going on here.

01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:49.850
And big laboratories were
established after World War II

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:54.150
or during and after World War
II that would have enhanced

01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:55.680
graduate education.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.770
And as a result, when
you're educating the

01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:01.200
best, you hire them.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.500
I think that's how it happened,
especially in the

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:08.030
School of Engineering which has
had a fairly long track

01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:11.370
record of hiring its own.

01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:13.970
If you're producing the best,
you try to hire the best.

01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:18.080
And so I would guess, it's
a guess, I don't have the

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.890
answer, but I would guess that
it's right after World War II

01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:23.130
that you begin to see it.

01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:24.010
DAVID KAISER: So I would give
you a different answer.

01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:25.750
I would guess that
it was earlier.

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:28.110
Because, again, if you read
all the stuff like in

01:25:28.110 --> 01:25:31.840
Elliott's piece about why the
institution not only needs to

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.460
be what it is, but it needs
to be autonomous.

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.110
I often think of it as a kind
of sign of MIT's arrogance

01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:39.730
like nobody else in the
world is good enough.

01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:41.850
So we have to hire
our own students.

01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:44.670
But you read this sort of stuff,
and you see it's part

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:48.840
of the culture in that when
they're on the cutting edge of

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.810
either a field or just generally
of the types of

01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:54.590
teaching that you're doing then
you really, it's very

01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:58.090
hard to find people from
elsewhere who are doing that.

01:25:58.090 --> 01:26:01.500
PROFESSOR: So, you would say
it's during the Compton years

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.070
starting in the '30s
or there abouts?

01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:04.170
Or even before that?

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:05.940
DAVID KAISER: I would imagine
it's before that with hiring

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.070
instructors.

01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:09.330
Not sure about that.

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.376
PROFESSOR: That's interesting.

01:26:11.376 --> 01:26:14.280
DAVID KAISER: Obviously,
it's not so early on.

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.690
But I bet as soon as they become
the right age, it's

01:26:16.690 --> 01:26:18.040
something that gets done.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:21.680
It can't be something that's
done that often without some

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.150
traditions behind it.

01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:26.940
A lot of universities
won't do it at all.

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:29.270
Although, here, I was talking to
someone in Economics, they

01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:33.420
won't hire their own graduates
on the faculty until they've

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:35.115
gone away for a year or
two, and then they

01:26:35.115 --> 01:26:36.640
will hire them back.

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.940
So, they have a rule that you
cannot come out of your Ph.D

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.740
and join the faculty.

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.822
But you go somewhere else for
a little while and then you

01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:42.350
can come right back.

01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:46.585
And many of their faculty
have PhDs from here.

01:26:46.585 --> 01:26:49.080
PROFESSOR: Not a bad rule.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.710
Not to my knowledge.

01:26:50.710 --> 01:26:52.190
I don't think there is
a big difference.

01:26:54.780 --> 01:27:02.640
It's basically a play on the
same word, technic but

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.360
preceded by poly means many.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.410
Basically, it's perhaps
a reference to a

01:27:08.410 --> 01:27:11.260
more diverse approach.

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.980
I don't know.

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.670
You're asking good questions.

01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:16.020
I don't have the answers.

01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:16.940
DAVID KAISER: I think it's
just what you said.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:19.690
I think polytechnic, especially
at this time, has a

01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:21.650
little more European
connotation.

01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:25.180
The French schools really are,
they are called polytechnique.

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:30.080
And they have a certain
way of being that.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.300
West Point was modeled after
much of, but probably not so

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.000
all of, in that they're
very connected in

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.050
the political system.

01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:40.280
And there's a very sort of well
understood hierarchy for

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.220
the alumni to go through and run
the big bureaucracies and

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.450
the government.

01:27:45.450 --> 01:27:48.410
And there are polytechnic
schools in this country.

01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:50.990
There's California Polytechnic,
there's Brooklyn

01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:53.410
Polytechnic.

01:27:53.410 --> 01:27:57.080
And I think it's really
those are not--

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.770
there's no meaningful
distinction from them from MIT

01:27:59.770 --> 01:28:02.240
or Caltech.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.257
It's a kind of term,
connotation.

01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:11.310
PROFESSOR: The other thing
that's relevant to that is

01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:20.080
that Rogers, Charles Eliot,
William Ware in architecture

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:25.570
all spent time in Europe,
especially in France during

01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:30.750
the founding years of MIT, late
'60s early '70s, looking

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:34.750
at European universities and, to
a degree, German technical

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:35.970
institutes.

01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:42.920
And so they're influenced by
these European organizational

01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.620
models, if you want
to call it that.

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.140
They don't copy them directly.

01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:51.470
But they surely are looking
and trying to find niches

01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:55.670
where certain parts of the
French educational system fit

01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:58.230
in to the MIT model and
stuff like that.

01:28:58.230 --> 01:28:59.320
They're borrowing.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:03.300
They're definitely borrowing
ideas as they should.

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:07.080
And so those influences are
very much in evidence

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.011
especially during
the early years.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:12.010
DAVID KAISER: It's worth
mentioning a phrase that may

01:29:12.010 --> 01:29:13.710
come up which is technocrat.

01:29:13.710 --> 01:29:15.910
Has anybody ever heard
that phrase?

01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:17.080
PROFESSOR: Technocrat.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.420
DAVID KAISER: You'll hear it
used from time to time.

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:26.910
And, again, technocracy is a
sort of funny social movement

01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:27.540
from the '20s.

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.820
It's not quite worth
talking about.

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.700
But people do talk about
technocrats when they're

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.330
technically trained people who
are in high positions of

01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:37.820
bureaucracies of one kind or
another and bring a sort of

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.240
technical mentality to running
a large organization.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:45.480
And, again, in France, the
technocratic tradition is a

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.760
very old tradition where the
leaders of the polytechnic go

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:55.480
into the UN, they go into the
various civil bureaucracies,

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:00.230
and it's the big government
institutions are very much run

01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:02.800
by people with technical
backgrounds.

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.610
It's just not a tradition
in the US that has

01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:05.780
been nearly so much.

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:09.350
And so we'll come across it when
we talk about the '60s

01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:13.790
like Robert McNamara who ran
the Pentagon during the

01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:15.540
Vietnam War is not an MIT

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:16.640
graduate, he's not an engineer.

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.450
But he was a very technical
person, very mathematical.

01:30:19.450 --> 01:30:21.770
He was a sort of prototype
technocrat.

01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:24.840
But most leaders of the Pentagon
are not technical,

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.280
most of them are political in
background and have very

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:31.050
different kinds of skills and
approaches to the world.

01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:34.430
Robert Seamans, who we'll talk
about as well, who was an MIT

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:37.510
graduate and kind of led the
chief engineer on the Apollo

01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:40.510
program and Secretary of the
Air Force and the first

01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:43.130
Secretary of the Energy was
much more in a kind of

01:30:43.130 --> 01:30:47.560
technocratic role where he had
this kind of background.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:51.450
And so you'll see some of
it in the US setting

01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:52.620
but not that much.

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:56.630
Whereas, again, the
polytechniques and the English

01:30:56.630 --> 01:30:58.340
system doesn't really work
that way either.

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:01.395
They have their own civil
service system and engineers

01:31:01.395 --> 01:31:03.182
are not particularly high up.

01:31:03.182 --> 01:31:07.030
PROFESSOR: Seamans is one of
these MIT trained engineers,

01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:10.770
comes from an old New England
family as I understand it, but

01:31:10.770 --> 01:31:14.970
who really reached in
the higher echelon.

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:18.520
He wasn't a politician, but he
ran a number of agencies and

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.380
really was a person of
considerable influence.

01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.700
He's only been dead, what?

01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.150
Three years, four years?

01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:25.060
DAVID KAISER: One or two.

01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:26.290
Has anyone heard that name?

01:31:26.290 --> 01:31:27.160
Robert Seamans?

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.485
PROFESSOR: Robert
Seamans, aero?

01:31:28.485 --> 01:31:29.600
DAVID KAISER: We'll
come across him.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.020
PROFESSOR: I'm so sorry he's
not still alive to come and

01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:33.670
visit this class because
he was quite--

01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:34.900
DAVID KAISER: He's an
interesting story.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:38.520
You know we haven't also
mentioned huge issue of social

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:41.220
class between Harvard and MIT.

01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:44.580
And all of this stuff that we're
reading has buried in it

01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:49.780
the sort of MIT attitude that
Harvard is for elites, and the

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:53.760
Harvard attitude that MIT
is for vocational

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:56.130
middle class workers.

01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:59.390
And that runs throughout
all this history.

01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:02.990
And Seamans came from this very
old New England family,

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:05.940
comes from a family on
the North Shore.

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:08.050
And he went to Harvard as an
undergrad, in fact he was

01:32:08.050 --> 01:32:10.070
classmates with John
F. Kennedy.

01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:14.140
And I think he maybe took one
course, or he had a friend who

01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:15.970
was doing something at MIT,
and he got really

01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:16.860
interested in MIT.

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.030
And he wanted to come here
for graduate school.

01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:22.180
And he writes in his memoirs
about how his parents said,

01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:25.890
no, no, no, fine boys from our
background don't go to MIT,

01:32:25.890 --> 01:32:27.220
that's not what they do.

01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.660
Go, study science at Harvard.

01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:32.150
And he rebelled against that and
really said, no I really

01:32:32.150 --> 01:32:33.050
want to go to MIT.

01:32:33.050 --> 01:32:34.900
And he did amazingly
well here.

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.530
But when time came for him to
advance in his career, he was

01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:41.130
certainly helped by the fact
that he had this advanced

01:32:41.130 --> 01:32:43.850
social background when he
went back to Washington.

01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:49.480
And, again, he was rubbing
elbows with JFK and all the

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.160
senior leadership during
that period.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.690
And he was socially very
well suited for it.

01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:55.790
So he was a little
bit unusual as an

01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:57.096
engineer during that period.

01:32:59.964 --> 01:33:05.090
PROFESSOR: About every 20 years,
there's a discussion

01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:09.140
that pops up in the MIT
community about why doesn't

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:14.690
MIT have as many CEOs as Harvard
or Princeton or--

01:33:14.690 --> 01:33:19.470
and a lot of it centers around
what David has just said is

01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:24.170
that if you look at the social
backgrounds of CEO's, the

01:33:24.170 --> 01:33:26.990
majority of them come out of
backgrounds like Seamans.

01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:32.400
They come out of well-to-do,
socially placed families.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:37.600
And so there's this generational
movement that you

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.020
went to Harvard, and you're from
an old family, and you

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:43.250
have an interest in the company,
you become the CEO at

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:44.240
some point.

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:46.030
I think there's a lot
of truth to that.

01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:50.860
And MIT, I think, has been
more of a place that has

01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:55.810
attracted socially mobile
students from middle class

01:33:55.810 --> 01:34:00.210
backgrounds, sometimes working
class backgrounds,

01:34:00.210 --> 01:34:01.450
oftentimes, I think.

01:34:01.450 --> 01:34:04.160
And which is one of the great
things about the place, I

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:04.960
think, is that--

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.850
DAVID KAISER: The fraction of
our students who are the first

01:34:08.850 --> 01:34:12.040
generation of their family
to go to college, even

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.675
today, is very high.

01:34:13.675 --> 01:34:15.310
A lot of children
of immigrants--

01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:20.950
PROFESSOR: I think there's a
very old cultural influence

01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:24.360
involved in all of this in the
sense that during the 19th

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.390
century when we're talking about
the founding of MIT, one

01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:30.880
of the tensions of that period
in the academic world was

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.000
between what groups we'll call
Ancients versus Moderns.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.680
And the Moderns would be the
type of school like MIT that

01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:44.470
was emphasizing science and
engineering as opposed to the

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:48.320
Ancients, which were the old
classical colleges teaching

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.680
Greek and Latin and all the
classics and literature and

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.060
things like that.

01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:56.620
There was a lot of
tension there.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:35:00.990
And it also had class
implications that you were

01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:04.570
educating people on the classics
to be gentlemen and

01:35:04.570 --> 01:35:05.990
ladies and things like that.

01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:10.000
Whereas people coming to the
MIT were people that were

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.940
going to go out in the world
and engineer that world or

01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:15.560
pursue science in that world.

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.950
It was a much more utilitarian
oriented disposition, I think,

01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:27.610
which is very American in
many ways because early

01:35:27.610 --> 01:35:30.590
sociologists, I guess you could
call them, people like

01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:33.590
Alexis de Tocqueville, who
visited the United States in

01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:37.630
the 1830's and wrote a very
famous treatise called

01:35:37.630 --> 01:35:43.280
Democracy in America, asks a
lot of questions about what

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.540
makes the United States
what it is.

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:47.250
Why is it different
from Europe?

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:49.950
That's one interesting questions
he's asking.

01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:52.990
One of the answers he gives is
that these Americans are so

01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:54.730
utilitarian oriented.

01:35:54.730 --> 01:36:00.030
They are very oriented towards
things that work, things that

01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:02.370
are put to work in society.

01:36:02.370 --> 01:36:04.830
Where as you don't see as
much of that in Europe.

01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:07.570
That was one of his most
important statements about the

01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:10.640
difference between Europe and
the United States, is

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.720
Americans like utility.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.810
They like things that work.

01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:19.050
They like to get out and tinker
around with stuff.

01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:21.850
He also talks about literacy
in the United States being

01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:23.340
higher than it is in Europe.

01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:26.910
And that being a more literate
nation meant that the United

01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:32.400
States was more apt to be
inventive and pursue areas of

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.240
engineering and science
that others would be

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.280
less involved with.

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.130
DAVID KAISER: It arguably is.

01:36:41.130 --> 01:36:42.640
Which I'm not so
sure, German--

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.270
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:44.920
DAVID KAISER: I'm not so sure.

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.160
Where it is also is very much
in developing countries even

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.930
in the Middle East and lots of
places where MIT has had an

01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:56.140
influence actually setting
up engineering schools.

01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:06.440
But I'll give you one example,
a lot of wealthy American

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.350
families, they send their
brightest kid to Harvard and

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:15.210
may become a lawyer or other
place and become a lawyer.

01:37:15.210 --> 01:37:17.000
I used to spend a lot
of time in Turkey.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.380
And I worked with some people
who were very wealthy and ran

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:23.640
a lot of big international
trading which is an old

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.380
Turkish kind of profession.

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.150
And these were the very
few, very elite

01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:30.940
families in that country.

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:34.330
And the people who were my age
who were really the ones

01:37:34.330 --> 01:37:37.880
running and soon to inherit
the business, they had all

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.410
gone to American engineering
schools and

01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:40.600
gotten American MBA's.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.220
That was their education.

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:48.830
And I was once at a conference,
and I sat next to

01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:53.500
a guy who was a deputy oil
minister from Iran, which I

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.080
don't meet a lot of
Iranian government

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.330
officials in my work.

01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:59.180
And I was sort of like, this
will be an interesting

01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:02.260
conversation with the two of
us are going to talk about.

01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:04.450
And he was like, you're
from MIT?

01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:07.130
I went to the Iranian Institute
of Technology, it

01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:09.610
was all founded on
MIT's principles.

01:38:09.610 --> 01:38:13.500
And he was incredibly pleased
to meet someone from MIT.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:19.380
And sort of like a lot of the
Iranian technocratic class, as

01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:22.000
it were, were trained
as engineers.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.190
And, again, it has a lot to do
with when countries got on the

01:38:25.190 --> 01:38:27.330
steep part of the development
curve.

01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:30.800
And if it was after World War
II, engineering is generally a

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:33.710
pretty high status thing
in the field.

01:38:33.710 --> 01:38:36.515
If they're older countries, it's
going to be less so and

01:38:36.515 --> 01:38:38.850
more political or financially
oriented.

01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:43.210
That's a broad generalization,
but it's probably not that--

01:38:43.210 --> 01:38:46.800
PROFESSOR: It's interesting.

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:50.590
DAVID KAISER: I have one story
that maybe we should end with

01:38:50.590 --> 01:38:53.280
which was, I went to Yale as an
undergraduate, and I was a

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.560
middle class kid.

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.360
And I remember going
to graduation--

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.900
has anybody here been
to one of the MIT

01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:00.050
commencements, by the way?

01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:01.440
You'll all go in
a couple years.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:01.900
PROFESSOR: I hope you do.

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:04.130
DAVID KAISER: Hopefully,
you'll all go.

01:39:04.130 --> 01:39:08.780
So when I graduated from Yale,
it was a beautiful May day,

01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:11.260
and it had the feeling of
sort of a garden party.

01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:15.240
Everybody was incredibly well
dressed and sort of very

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.850
polite and well behaved
with the big hats on.

01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:20.400
And you had the sense that these
families had been to

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:23.260
Yale graduations many
times in the past.

01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:24.930
And it was very sort
of contained.

01:39:24.930 --> 01:39:27.210
And the clapping was
sort of like this.

01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:30.910
When you go as faculty or as
students too to an MIT

01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:34.170
graduation, you march down
Memorial Drive in all the

01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:36.590
regalia, and there's somebody
in the front with the

01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:37.390
processional.

01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:40.180
And you don't really see any of
the parents or any of the

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:44.510
audience until you turn off
of Memorial Drive into the

01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:46.700
Killian Court, right in
the center there.

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.600
And it has this feeling,
you feel like

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:49.670
you're at a rock show.

01:39:49.670 --> 01:39:52.610
I mean the parents are
just over the top.

01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:56.050
And there's hundreds of them
outside the gate because they

01:39:56.050 --> 01:40:00.000
only get two tickets per grad,
but they bring like 15 people

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.040
and cousins and aunts and uncles
and grandparents and

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:02.380
everything.

01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:04.820
And you really have the sense
that it's like a huge

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:06.065
celebration.

01:40:06.065 --> 01:40:08.480
And, to me, that always
represents that kind of

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.910
different social standing where
it's a really big deal

01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:15.550
for families when their kids
graduate from MIT whether

01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:18.000
they're immigrants
or not because--

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.560
but it sort of represents
something.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.750
Sometimes that's a pressure that
the students carry, which

01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:23.540
is not so easy.

01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:25.790
But it really represents
something.

01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:27.110
And it's a big celebration.

01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:30.880
It's not nearly as much
something that generations of

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.480
Smiths have done for all these
years, and it's been expected,

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.480
and we're so proud of
you, kind of thing.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.015
And you'll see when
you graduate, it

01:40:37.015 --> 01:40:37.590
really feels that way.

01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:39.250
There's 10,000 people there.

01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:42.740
And they're just sort of like
coming out of the woodwork and

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.440
climbing up the trees
and everything.

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.540
And it's a very--

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:48.320
to me that's the kind of
ultimate MIT moment where--

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:51.070
it's nice as a faculty member,
you remember like what we were

01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:54.360
working for all these years and
I'm sure students as well.

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's a good
time, you'll enjoy it.

01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:04.320
Alex will go up to get his
diploma, or whoever, and

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.900
you'll hear people
shouting from the

01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:09.240
audience, that's my Alex.

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.896
And then other students are
going, ah Alex, way to go,

01:41:11.896 --> 01:41:12.780
blah, blah.

01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:14.282
It's all very exciting.

01:41:14.282 --> 01:41:18.660
DAVID KAISER: And they read
every single name of the 2,000

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:22.670
or so people who graduate,
which itself is quite an

01:41:22.670 --> 01:41:25.680
accomplishment of logistics
to make that work.

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:27.760
PROFESSOR: You'll have your
hand shaken either by the

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.290
President of the Provost.

01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:32.250
Isn't that they hand
out every degree?

01:41:32.250 --> 01:41:34.530
So, it's pretty cool.

01:41:34.530 --> 01:41:38.200
When I went to Ohio State, there
were like, I don't know,

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.250
5,000 people on the
football stadium.

01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:42.380
They are all down on the field
and the President gets up, and

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.710
said, I hereby declare
you Bachelor of Art.

01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:45.300
Boom.

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:46.310
And that was done.

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:50.590
And everybody goes, OK, let's
get the hell out of here.

01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:52.110
It's very, very different.

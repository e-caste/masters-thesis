WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So today, we're

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.960
going to get into innovation
at the institutional level.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.100
So that's our fundamental topic.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.730
Because we've been
out for two weeks,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.950
let me do a recap so that we're
all current with the underlying

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.210
framework.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.150
Class 1, we talked about, as
you remember, growth theory,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.030
and we read Robert Solow
and Solow taught us

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.760
that technological and
related innovation is

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.170
the dominant causative
factor in economic growth.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.230
Old classical economics posited
that it was capital supplier

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.280
labor supply.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.830
Those remain important, but
the monster in the room,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.030
Solow found, to the
tune of 60% or more,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.120
is technological and
related innovation.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.100
We also read Paul Romer.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.810
And Paul Romer
says, wait a minute.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.790
It's not just having
an R&D system.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.010
You've got to staff
that R&D system.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.870
It's the talent base.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.910
That's a key driver.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.040
That's another critical factor.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.473
So his phrase is quote, "human
capital engaged in research."

00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:33.890
So if you train great physicists
and they're driving cabs,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.870
they're not engaged
in research, right?

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.580
That's a no-net gain.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.420
But if they're engaged in that
system, that's what's critical.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.980
And his prospector
theory says the size

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.830
of a well-qualified talent
base makes a huge difference.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.120
That's a key driver.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.390
Talent on task and a
lot of talent on task

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.010
is better than less
talent on task.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.760
So those are two fundamental
innovation factors

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.520
that we arrived at
in the first class.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.530
Class number 2,
we began thinking

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.025
about innovation systems.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:11.900
So we got two factors
out of the first class.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.750
Then we began to
think about systems.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.290
Nelson tells us that there are
national systems of innovation

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.780
that you can analyze,
innovation at the systems level,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.957
and look at the
actors in that system

00:02:25.957 --> 00:02:27.790
and the strength of the
actors and therefore

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.040
the strength of
the whole system.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.340
So that gives us a
third innovation factor,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.390
which is really--

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.320
we'll call it
innovation organization.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.170
And then we read some
other pieces in there.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.610
I'll highlight a couple.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.760
Don Kash and Robert
Rycroft said, you've

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.960
got to network the actors.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.760
It's the network, the strength
of the network of the actors,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.730
that's now, particularly
in a 21st century context,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.340
particularly critical.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.845
And we also read Charles
Schulze, a noted economist

00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:07.220
from the University
of Minnesota,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.120
who was a senior governmental
official in the Lyndon Johnson

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.370
era and then Jimmy Carter era.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.290
And he raises the issue
of what's the public role?

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.010
What's the private role as we
look at innovation systems?

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.900
What should the public
function be versus

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.390
what the private
sector should be.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.310
An absolutely fundamental
set of issues.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.500
So then we did classes 3 and 4.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.140
We essentially focused on
the innovation challenge

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.360
ahead in production.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.340
And in class 3, we looked
at the kind of history

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.270
of US manufacturing problems.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.690
We read Kent Hughes,
and he explains

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.450
the fascinating competition
when Japan launches

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.350
a brilliant new innovation
system and production

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.420
around quality.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.340
That's where the
rust belt begins.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.320
That's where US statistics
about growing inequality begin.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.920
That's where this problem
that we're now worse off at,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.510
that's where it commences.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.610
And then we looked
at Korea and Japan

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.360
and how they built
manufacturing-led innovation

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.290
systems.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.029
And then in class 4, we looked
at the current US manufacturing

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.540
problems.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.590
So I wanted to put a set
of real issues, really

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.190
timely critical issues, kind
of on the table, if you will,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.930
at the very beginning of the
class so that we're not--

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.020
you know, this is not a
class about abstraction.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.800
These are real issues
that are extremely

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.700
timely in the way in which
society operates and functions.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.440
And the US built a
comparative advantage

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.020
around its R&D system.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.860
It did not organize around
manufacturing-led innovation

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.350
like Japan, Germany, Korea,
Taiwan, China, and so on.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.890
We missed that
organizational step,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.850
and we are continuing
to pay a price for that.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.680
So we talked some two weeks
ago about David Autor and some

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.020
of his absolutely
fascinating work

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.300
on the decline of
US manufacturing

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.400
and the effect on
the labor force.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.260
He has a new piece
out that talks

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:35.410
about the effect on innovation
of the intense competition

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.910
with China.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.980
And essentially,
what he finds is

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.310
that firms that go up against
head-on-head competition

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.190
over a particular
product line with China

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.910
have to slash their innovation
capability, their R&D

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.180
capability, in order
to stay in the game.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.520
But that kills them long term.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.090
So that this
competition with Japan

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.155
is not only having an
effect on the labor market,

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:02.280
but it's also having a big
effect on the innovation

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.380
capability of companies.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.960
And then we talked about
whether advanced manufacturing

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.590
could bring a new paradigm
to the table, where

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.290
US developing countries can
kind of get back in the game.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.620
So in effect, they would
take innovation leadership,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.300
innovate in the
production system

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.470
process and technologies, and
be able to compete better.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.460
That's the essential question.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.080
And as I mentioned last
week, MIT for example,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.850
there are 14
manufacturing institutes

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.940
that have been stood up
in the last few years.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.280
MIT is participating
in 9 of the 14,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.090
leading one particularly
active and about three or four

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.620
but also participant
in the others.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.630
So this is something
that's now ongoing

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.100
on this campus in a
pretty sizable way.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.680
So that's the background
on manufacturing.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.910
Now we go back to
our whole project

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.470
on innovation organization.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.420
That's today's class.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.490
And we're looking
at that problem

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.600
of how do you innovate at
the institutional level?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.110
And in particular, we're looking
at where did the US innovation

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.150
system come from?

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.500
How did it get created?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.610
How did it get put together?

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.630
And that's the story
that we'll weave today.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.060
As a backdrop to that,
we'll start with a framework

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.687
that a scholar named
David Hart put together.

00:07:29.687 --> 00:07:31.395
David teaches at George
Mason University.

00:07:31.395 --> 00:07:35.430
He teaches innovation
policy issues there.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.960
And he wrote this-- he got
his PhD from MIT and STS.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.450
He was head service in
the Office of Science

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.430
and Technology Policy
so he as practical

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.280
as well as a lot of
academic experience.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.070
Authored a big book on
energy innovation policy.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.660
David did this
book back in 1998,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.330
and he essentially argued that
what's the ideology of science

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.420
and technology policy?

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.140
If you put it into a political
economy kind of context,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.730
what is the thinking process?

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.900
How do you think about this?

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.660
And he identified kind
of five political strains

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.190
in the US that, frankly--

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.080
you know, I worked in the
Senate for over 15 years.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.790
I saw them all.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.520
They were real.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.280
They were all still there.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.640
There were all ways of
thinking about science and tech

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.159
policy, R&D policy that
I saw all the time.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.497
So these are very
much alive and well.

00:08:39.497 --> 00:08:41.289
And David tried to put
a frame around them,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:47.435
and they will help guide us on
the politics of science support

00:08:47.435 --> 00:08:49.060
and technology support
in this country.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.160
So what are these five visions?

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.720
I'm going to summarize
them briefly.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.280
And which of our discussion
leaders has David Hart?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.780
Chloe.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.920
OK.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.840
So the first was conservatism.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:07.400
Now, this perspective saw
no need for the state,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.350
for the federal government,
to do anything other

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.900
than providing for
defense, including

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.200
military technological
innovation.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.110
Get the state out
of everything else.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.800
They've got to do defense,
but leave the rest

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.420
to the private sector.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.710
It's a very
non-interventionist philosophy.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.750
The budget that President
Trump just sent to Capitol Hill

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.800
for FY '18, largely written
by the Heritage Foundation,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.940
argues exactly this
theoretical line.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.540
It takes-- it eliminates
ARPA-E. It takes $2 billion

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.030
out of the Applied
Research Agencies

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.130
and takes almost $1 billion out
of the basic research agencies

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.380
at DOD.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.420
It's a gigantic cutback.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.592
The theory is, let the
private sector do it.

00:10:00.592 --> 00:10:01.800
They'll do this energy stuff.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.530
So this is right on us.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.560
This theoretical framework
for approaching R&D support

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.450
is right there.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.610
One of its leading
proponents, and we'll

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.640
run into him when we
talk about Alfred Loomis,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.980
one of its leading proponents
in this period that David

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.810
is writing about in
the '20s and '30s

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:27.440
when these ideologies really got
put together, was Frank Jewett.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.720
Jewett was head of Bell Labs.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.720
And he was president of
the National Academies.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.450
Had both slots.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.370
And he's head of Bell Labs.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.100
He's got one of the
great basic research

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.080
as well as applied
research organizations

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.370
in the history of the world.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.910
There is a phone monopoly.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.100
The last thing he wants
is the federal government

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.930
messing around in his turf.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.040
Naturally, he's a proponent
of keeping the feds out,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.040
except in defense and military,
which they've got to do.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.540
So we'll run into to Frank
Jewett in a few minutes.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.790
But this is a noninterventionist
defense-only piece.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.490
Now, on the other
side of that argument

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.532
is what David calls
associationalism.

00:11:13.532 --> 00:11:17.690
We would call this
public-private partnership.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.590
That's the lingo that's more
or less used at this time.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.900
But the meaning is
roughly the same.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.600
David points out that the
first big exponent of this

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.080
was Herbert Hoover, who
along with Jimmy Carter,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.360
was one of the
only two engineers

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.390
to ever be president
of the United States.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.100
That doesn't mean there can't
be more, just as a lesson to you

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.600
all.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.590
Hoover was an amazing engineer.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.330
He was a great organizer of the
World War I war relief effort

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.690
to save a staggering number
of lives after World War I.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.230
He was a highly innovative
Secretary of Commerce

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.910
and made that at
the time actually

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.510
one of the most important
Cabinet agencies.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:08.790
His vision was that unlimited
economic competition

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:15.420
curtails firms' ability
to be innovative.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.000
If you're frantic
about your competitors,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.610
you're not going to have the
energy, time, or resources

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.590
to spend on longer-term,
higher-risk R&D.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.520
So there ought to be a gathering
between public and private

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.520
sectors that would
collaboratively undertake this.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.410
So this associationalism
really occurs in the 1920s.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:48.310
He is a great leader of NIST,
the standards organization.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.010
That would be a classic
public-private collaboration,

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.060
where private industry
under government auspices

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.810
would come together
and negotiate and work

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.950
on standards for products
to enable their much more

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.510
efficient production.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.620
So that would be a classic
Hoover kind of effort.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:11.260
Franklin Roosevelt adopts
this associationalist attitude

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.550
when he becomes president.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.380
There's a lot of
public-private connectivity

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.140
during the Roosevelt regime.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.510
So that gives us two models.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:28.170
Now, this next model,
it's kind of disappeared.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.410
But it was a big
movement in the 1930s.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:42.060
The basic theory was
that cartels, monopolies,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.450
collusion amongst firms
discouraged innovation.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.730
You build up market control.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:54.130
The last thing you want
is a disruptive product.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.160
And we can see this, of
course, in a sector like energy

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.710
even now.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:06.470
So the concept was reestablish
markets by legislation

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.160
or through example by
anti-trust laws or regulation,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.660
and you would
encourage innovation

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.118
to break out, because you'd be
breaking up the cartels that

00:14:14.118 --> 00:14:17.600
were limiting innovation.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.040
There's so much global
competition now,

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.840
and the competition is so
intense that, frankly, there's

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.110
just not that much going on in
anti-trust practice or theory.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.230
Firms may be curtailing
innovation because

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.690
of day-to-day
competitive pressures,

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.490
but that's not an
underlying cartel problem,

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.000
because the
competition is there.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.820
So this one is less present
now than it was back

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.760
in that kind of '30s timetable.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.640
A fourth is keynesianism.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.890
You remember John
Maynard Keynes.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.220
Keynes develops some
crucial fundamentals

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.620
of economic theory.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.380
His principle contribution
is that in periods

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.320
of economic downturn,
government spending

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.270
can step up to the
plate and substitute

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.500
for the decline in private
spending and, in effect,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.060
stabilize an economy.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.250
So we just saw this
whole theory played out

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.050
in the Economic Stimulus Bill.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.770
That's what happened in
the 2009 Stimulus Bill.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.310
Massive economic stimulus.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.840
I think the economists
would say that it worked.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.340
It did stabilize the economy
in fairly surprisingly

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.360
short order, given the
depth of the threat.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.810
We didn't slip into another
great recession or Great

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.490
Depression.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.250
But the idea here, as applies
to science and technology,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.400
is look out for the
macro-investment levels.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.820
Have a governmental role in
funding investment in research

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.420
and development, because
the public sector is not

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.660
prone to take longer-term risks.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.060
And the government can
substitute for that.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.700
So this factor is still with us.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.890
That's why in the
first class when

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.530
I had you read the National
Science Foundation Indicators

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.050
that told us all about
investment levels

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:26.860
by government in R&D,
that's Keynesian thinking.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.250
That's government substituting
because the private sector has

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.590
difficulty undertaking
longer-term high-risk

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.400
investment in research.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.510
So that's another ideological
kind of element here.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.090
The fifth is a little
bit like conservatism,

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.310
but it's much more far-reaching.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.100
This emerges in World
War II and the Cold War.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.230
And this doctrine says,
whatever it takes.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.640
National security is so
critical, we will do anything.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.960
The government will be
every bit as interventionist

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.520
as it needs to be in order
to get us national security.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.700
And that's still
very much alive.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.150
I'd say someone like Senator
John McCain, who is currently

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.319
the Chairman of the
Armed Services Committee,

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.660
Senator McCain is probably
a conservative when it comes

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.280
to federal R&D investment,
generally speaking,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.060
but when it comes to
defense, whatever it takes.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.710
So an organization like
In-Q-Tel, which essentially

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.620
buys a controlling
share in companies so

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.510
that the government can get
the technologies at once,

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:45.480
it's government becoming a
venture capitalist on steroids.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.390
McCain is a huge
fan of that model.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.400
And In-Q-Tel works in
the intelligence security

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.050
kind of area.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.620
So this movement is around too.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:02.000
And this is essentially what
Vannevar Bush puts together

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.800
when he creates a
connected science model--

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.600
we'll talk about
it a little later--

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.760
during World War II.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.310
So these are the ideologies.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.230
I'll just summarize
them very quickly again.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.590
Conservatism.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:19.090
Government can do military
innovation, but that's it.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:19.930
Associationlism.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.940
That's the public-private
partnership model.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.440
Reform liberalism, which
is stamp out cartels.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.450
They limit innovation.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.670
And that's not really
a powerful movement

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.130
at this point because of
international competition.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.100
Keynesianism, which is
analyze science and technology

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.610
based upon these
macro-investment levels

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.880
by the public
sector, which serves

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.150
to offset a market failure
on the private sector side.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.850
And then the fifth one is
this national security state.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.980
So when I was working
in the Senate,

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.160
I saw all of these,
sometimes all them

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.340
in a single day in debate
on the Senate floor,

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.400
as people would take
different perspectives

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.530
and different political
understandings

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.690
of the role of R&D in
science and technology.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.310
So these are all still
very much with us

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.550
and guide a lot of
thinking to this day.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.290
The latest example,
as I mentioned,

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.670
was President Trump's
FY '18 budget,

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.920
and it's his position--
explicit position--

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.018
on supporting research, which
a lot of it the private sector

00:19:22.018 --> 00:19:22.810
could just pick up.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.440
It's just straight out of
the conservatism playbook.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.450
CHLOE: All right.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.670
Chloe, it's yours.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.170
OK.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.460
So first of all, obviously
he gave a rundown--

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.460
very effective rundown--
of all the different--

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.460
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You
didn't have to say that.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.280
CHLOE: Just curious
why I wouldn't do that

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.680
for a third time
and for everyone.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.440
I think just in conclusion,
tagging onto that,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.950
it's interesting to note, and
Hart sort of makes the point,

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.790
that an ever-changing
political tide--

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.490
he says that it generates a
lot of policy entrepreneurs.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.870
So people coming out
and being like, oh, this

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.480
is my new policy.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.105
It's brand new.

00:19:56.105 --> 00:19:57.300
It's never been seen before.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:02.220
But in actuality, a lot of
these theories were Frankenstein

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.480
models from previous theories,
and the successful ones often

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.480
owed their success in part
to the pre-existence of other

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.600
institutions that they could--

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.110
and resources that
already existed

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.230
that they could
repurpose for readjusting

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.760
their mission for
how they viewed

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.010
how science and technology
research funding

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.670
should actually go about.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.170
So in looking through a lot of
your summaries and questions,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.540
it seemed like a
lot of people wanted

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.370
to discuss the relevance
of these five visions

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.630
to this particular time period,
maybe what political climate we

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.430
have now, like what combination,
what hybrid of these five

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.110
that we are living with today,
and then also maybe what

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.458
components of each are
actually successful,

00:20:45.458 --> 00:20:47.250
in your own personal
opinion or experience,

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.830
for funding research.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.650
So just to sort of hone in on--

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.450
I found associationalism
and liberal--

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.530
reform liberalism the two
most interesting ones.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.180
This is my first
question for you

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.860
all, sort of talk about a bit
of a tragedy of the commons type

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.910
situation.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.910
So the institutions
desired by associationalism

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.040
are intriguing.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.200
But does such an
implementation have a degree

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.780
of naivete outside of wartime?

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.950
Are all who utilized new
information as a resource--

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.220
do all who utilize the
information as a resource

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.425
as an end to the mean
of their final product,

00:21:25.425 --> 00:21:27.300
are they also invested
in the idea of sharing

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.220
that information with
their competition,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.110
even on a national scale?

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.870
I think that's something a
lot of people would think

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.050
is naive perspective.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.180
MAX: Well, it probably
depends on the context.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.050
So if you were to look at
Conant actually-- yeah,

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.660
shameless plug, because
that's my reading--

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.930
so if you look at that, in the
time period in World War II,

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.450
you had companies that were
fighting this absolute evil

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:58.200
that was going to just
engulf the entire planet

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.520
in a Nazi regime.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.762
So people were scared.

00:22:00.762 --> 00:22:02.220
So they thought,
OK, you know what?

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.320
We're going to do whatever
it takes to fight this.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.610
And it was in
everyone's best interest

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.010
to fight it and share all the
knowledge that they could.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.260
Actually, in another class,
I was reading a case study

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.750
on-- your part of
Lincoln Electric.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.760
It's this company,
they make arc welders.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.010
They've been working
for a few decades,

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.770
and they actually shared a lot
of their manufacturing secrets

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.520
during World War II,
just for that reason.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.390
So that's one way that it's not
extremely naive, like they just

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.890
need the right incentive.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.740
On the other hand, if
you look at today when

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.860
there isn't an overarching
evil that everyone

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.065
can unite behind and try to
fight against, people have--

00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:40.440
they don't have
as much incentive

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.332
to share all their secrets.

00:22:42.332 --> 00:22:44.040
CHLOE: So you think
that you specifically

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.630
need that defense urge for
that cooperation to exist.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.940
MAX: That's what
history has shown me,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.285
at least from what I can tell.

00:22:53.285 --> 00:22:55.160
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
I'm glad to tell you,

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.490
Max, that next week we'll have
a reading that's entitled,

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.830
is war necessary
for economic growth?

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.460
So we will continue
this discussion-- that's

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.020
week two-- in addition to that.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.520
CHLOE: Do you think that
any institution that

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.050
might benefit from this sort
of like government-funded

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.810
encyclopedia of information, do
you think people wouldn't want

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.910
to contribute to that or
take from that in a time

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:29.730
where there wasn't this
pre-existing military need?

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.182
Because I mean, I think it's
arguable that you would still

00:23:33.182 --> 00:23:34.890
benefit-- a lot of
these theories, to me,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.480
one of the overarching things I
noticed is that a lot of them--

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.730
a lot of people seem
to feel the need

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.500
for the government providing
something that would facilitate

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.050
communication between
innovators and people

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.800
who implemented
them in industry.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.752
It would save a lot of time if
the people who-- if everyone

00:23:54.752 --> 00:23:56.460
had the same terms
and everyone knew what

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.220
was possible and achievable.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.720
And I don't know if that's
something that implementable,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.145
even outside of a time
when the country all

00:24:03.145 --> 00:24:04.600
needs to work together.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.180
MAX: It also could--

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.957
it could scare some
people who went

00:24:07.957 --> 00:24:10.290
through the Great Recession,
where you've got industries

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.090
that are quote, unquote,
"too big to fail,"

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.507
because then if you have all
these industries that are all

00:24:14.507 --> 00:24:16.080
sharing all of
their information,

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.370
then in some sense, they
kind of are becoming

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.863
one big conglomerate then.

00:24:21.863 --> 00:24:24.030
At least, that's the way
that the thinking could go.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.738
Now, there are flaws
with that, like they

00:24:25.738 --> 00:24:27.978
don't share the same
finances, the same employees,

00:24:27.978 --> 00:24:28.770
all sorts of stuff.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:33.240
But people could rationalize
that it's a step toward that.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.540
And from there, that also
could reduce competition.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.700
Then you have, hey, the
anti-trust laws come back,

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.152
and they're actually
interesting again.

00:24:44.152 --> 00:24:45.750
CHLOE: I think
that's a good point.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.250
MAX: Yeah.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.333
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:49.170
So Chloe, you're
pushing us to the point

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.770
that, given your interest in
the associationalist, model,

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.130
the public-private
partnership model,

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.680
this is exactly what
Hoover was driving at,

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.260
that there may be
a way of creating

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.290
at least limited
cooperation, particularly

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.630
around fundamentals,
what has become known

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.093
as pre-competitive research.

00:25:08.093 --> 00:25:09.510
In other words,
research before it

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.630
reaches a competitive level
that's key to your company.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:16.590
At least you could all cooperate
on the pre-competitive stuff.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.340
So that has been a conscious
part of the design of some

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.410
of these public-private
partnership models

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.780
in timetables like the
Clinton administration,

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.030
for example in particular.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.300
Could companies come
together and share resources

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.280
around this
pre-competitive stuff,

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.980
even if they were going to
be at each other's throats

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.910
the moment that
work was completed?

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.360
And how practical is that?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.640
Are they really going to
be willing to do that?

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.890
So the manufacturing institutes
that we mentioned last week,

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.980
this is a critical
issue for them,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.280
absolutely critical issue.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.060
How do you get all these
manufacturing companies,

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.520
small and large,
into the same room

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.910
to cooperate when they're
all also in competition

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.250
and the Manufacturing
Institute model is actually

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.740
pretty applied stuff.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.410
It's around production processes
that for some companies

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.240
may be their secret sauce.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.380
So how do you--

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.260
you've identified a
really critical barrier

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.480
in this associationalist model.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.470
How do you get this
kind of collaboration,

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.065
given the reality and
importance of competition?

00:26:27.203 --> 00:26:28.620
MARTHA: I'll come
in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.910
I've been here for a while.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.370
I'll throw in a thought,
though, of course,

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.890
which is I do think it's
really specific areas

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.550
and pre-competitive and then
also enabling technologies,

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.820
like looking today, and we're
not seeing it really happen,

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.950
but at the MIT
Energy Initiative,

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.725
companies are excited--

00:26:45.725 --> 00:26:47.850
energy companies are excited
about getting together

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.450
on carbon capture
and sequestration,

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.780
partly to enable them to just
keep running their companies.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.900
Now, we haven't seen anything
formal really happen,

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.470
and the technology is still
way too expensive, et cetera.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.898
But I think in specific
areas that it can happen.

00:27:04.898 --> 00:27:05.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.710
It's an interesting
idea, Martha.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.180
In other words,
in areas that are

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.060
outside your core
competitive advantage,

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.530
could you get
together with others,

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.910
because it might help everybody?

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:15.410
Right?

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.993
MARTHA: And I was wondering that
about the Manufacturing Bill.

00:27:17.993 --> 00:27:19.633
I am not that
knowledgeable about it,

00:27:19.633 --> 00:27:21.300
but if you consider
your secret sauce is

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.770
something other than the
actual manufacturing,

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:28.740
if you're a conglomerate that
has great product design,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.108
you know, I don't
know, does that work?

00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:31.650
I don't know.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.170
I don't know where you
were willing to open up

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.400
your secrets to others.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:35.880
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.338
One of the
manufacturing institutes

00:27:37.338 --> 00:27:40.170
we talked about last week
was around 3D printing.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.360
And it turns out
that that is going

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.180
to be an absolutely
critical core

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.210
technology and the way in which
anybody ever makes another jet

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.110
aircraft engine.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.930
I mean, maybe not this
week, but certainly

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.550
in the foreseeable future.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.830
It's going to be
absolutely critical.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.050
So there's frankly been
a tremendous amount

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.250
of nervousness when
companies like Pratt and GE

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.820
and Lockheed and Boeing and
others come into the same room

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.600
and who's ahead?

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.010
And are they going to
share their secret sauce?

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.260
And how is this going to work?

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.360
So working on the intellectual
property agreements

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.540
has been really complicated.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.080
So this public-private
partnership model,

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.380
there's a lot of examples
of it working brilliantly,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.390
but it is not an
easy model to bring

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.400
these highly-competitive
firms together and try

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.872
to get them to
agree on an agenda

00:28:28.872 --> 00:28:31.330
that they might be able to work
together on that would save

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.350
them all resources and funding.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:37.300
And Martha runs into that,
I'm sure, every day in MITii.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.740
MARTHA: And we will more and
more with these consortia

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.570
that we're putting together.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.397
CHLOE: I thought another--
to bring free-form liberalism

00:28:46.397 --> 00:28:48.480
into the discussion-- an
interesting contrast that

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.270
emerged between them, sort of
off of that topic of trying

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.118
to figure out who
the other people--

00:28:53.118 --> 00:28:55.410
like, what they're thinking--
other people in the room,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.420
what they're thinking, and what
your competition is thinking,

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.250
is that both these two policies
seem to have very different--

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.922
two theories-- seem to have
very different views on--

00:29:02.922 --> 00:29:04.380
to get a philosophical--
the innate

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.220
goodness or lack thereof
in industry leaders.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.905
And I think this was such fun.

00:29:09.905 --> 00:29:11.280
I forget the name
of the reading.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.870
It was a later one
about how there's

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.510
a philosophical difference
between basic research

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.350
and applied research
and the people who

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.933
make a career out of each.

00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:23.100
At the end of the day, they
have different end goals

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.312
and different core values.

00:29:26.312 --> 00:29:28.020
So I thought it was
interesting that that

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.180
was sort of superimposed
onto industry leaders,

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.390
and I wasn't quite
sure if that actually

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.140
makes a wide base for
an economic policy,

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.210
is judgment calls
about human nature.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.460
So I know that's a
little touchy-feely,

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.470
but I'd be interested to hear
if anyone was like, good idea,

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:45.000
bad idea.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.190
AUDIENCE: I have the reading
that you're talking about.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.060
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Stokes, right?

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.373
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:29:54.373 --> 00:29:57.410
AUDIENCE: So I think a really
important distinction that he

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.900
makes is that whether to sort of
base it off like a speculating,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.370
like speculating if these
are the goals of the actors

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.637
or like retroactively knowing.

00:30:06.637 --> 00:30:08.720
And I think that's a really
important distinction,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.373
because if you're making
policy, of course, you can't--

00:30:12.373 --> 00:30:13.790
hindsight is 20/20,
but you're not

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.120
going to know retroactively.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.665
But you have to have some
degree of speculation, which

00:30:18.665 --> 00:30:19.790
is something that I think--

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.373
well, I wasn't quite sure what
Stokes was trying to say there,

00:30:22.373 --> 00:30:24.417
but he was saying
that the retroactive

00:30:24.417 --> 00:30:26.750
way of looking at it is
actually better than speculating

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.742
when looking at it.

00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:29.450
But I think it's a
little bit impractical

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.242
when you're thinking
about policy decisions

00:30:31.242 --> 00:30:35.630
to kind of try to interpret what
the goals of the certain actor

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.940
are going to be based on
something like human nature

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.134
or like some other type of kind
of non-tangible measurement.

00:30:41.134 --> 00:30:41.634
CHLOE: Yeah.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.190
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Chloe, would you

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.710
give us a closing
thought on David Hart?

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:49.210
CHLOE: Sure.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.058
I guess, would a
closing question be OK?

00:30:54.058 --> 00:30:55.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Sure.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.610
CHLOE: Because still I haven't--

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.902
this is a central question
for me, one that I haven't--

00:30:58.902 --> 00:31:01.710
I feel like we haven't
come to a conclusion on.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.120
How have these policies sort
of survived the test of time,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.730
because they're all
so built on each other

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.850
and come from different
periods, World War II, Cold

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.930
War, the Korean War, and
different manufacturing stages

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.070
throughout our history?

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.782
They're all sort of
interwoven and interdependent.

00:31:19.782 --> 00:31:21.240
What does that
leave us with today?

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.370
What lessons have we
learned and what theories

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.580
are working for us right now?

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.810
Yeah.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:31.040
STEPH: I thought that
an interesting concern

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.460
about the Hart reading was
that it sort of presumed

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.770
that scientists and
technologists were not

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.900
a part of the policymaking
process, that they're

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.285
sort of receivers of the
actions of policymakers.

00:31:41.285 --> 00:31:43.160
So I thought it would
be interesting to think

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.970
about maybe today or in the
next election cycle for midterms

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.433
and congressional elections,
what it would look

00:31:51.433 --> 00:31:52.850
like if there were
more scientists

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.220
and technologists
running for Congress

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.342
and as policymakers and
maybe a scientist running

00:31:57.342 --> 00:31:59.300
for president someday or
a technologist running

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.100
for president, as
they have speculated

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.530
Mark Zuckerberg to be doing.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:05.360
Because in that sense,
it wouldn't so much

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.300
be a conflict
between ideologies,

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.660
but a conflict between
how much that person chose

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.700
to put in money in the
industry that they're a part of

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.028
and how much they are
motivated by what they know

00:32:18.028 --> 00:32:19.070
and what they don't know.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You
put your finger right

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:32.860
on a pulse of a
critical issue, Steph.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.650
The reason why I'm teaching
this class is so that all of you

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.810
will be citizen
scientists and be

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.840
ready to do great science and
engineering and technology

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.570
and run venture capital
firms and start companies.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.330
I want you to do all that
stuff, but in addition,

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.000
if you would also hold public
office, I'd appreciate it too.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.610
No, in other words,
the science-- this

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.000
is an intensely
interest-group-driven

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.340
political system we've got.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.310
And if you don't show up,
you don't get counted.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.820
And frankly, science
and engineering

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.680
doesn't show up very much.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.440
And there's a lot at
stake, as we speak, now.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.360
And part of the story is that
the community of scientists

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:21.620
and engineers, they're
not on the front lines.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.400
And in an
interest-driven society,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.380
that's really problematic.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.930
Now, it's storytelling time.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.800
I couldn't resist putting this
in, because at least those

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.650
of you from MIT, this is an
important part of your history.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.615
But I think it's
fun for everybody.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:48.010
This is Alfred Loomis and Luis
Alvarez, the great physicist,

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.040
called him the last of the
great amateurs of science.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.890
And you know, he's a
very good-looking guy,

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.300
as you can tell.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:00.430
That's the Rad Lab in MIT,
where the Stata Building is now.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.610
That's Rad Lab
latest radar sets.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:07.540
This is an early army radar set.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.050
And that's the business of the
Rad Lab that Loomis creates.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.400
And what's this story?

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.790
So if you go over to Stata
and you wander around

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:19.719
on the first floor, at the end
of one of the student streets,

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:23.409
you're going to see some
of these radar sets.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.040
And there's plaques and
stuff around there saying

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.560
this was where the Rad Lab was.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.699
And from an MIT perspective,
one statistic you need to know

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:45.760
is that in the period from 1941
to 1945, MIT as an institution

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:51.520
received 80 times more
federal funding than it did

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.449
in all its previous 80 years.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:58.660
This is what creates the
federally funded research

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.550
university.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:05.370
And it starts big
time at the Rad Lab.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:09.200
This is where MIT becomes a
critical and big and important

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.190
institution.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.780
It really scales up.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.040
It's not alone.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.650
This is happening at other
research universities

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:18.350
across the country.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.530
And it's the story of Loomis.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:27.140
So let me just give you a
little background on him.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.140
Born in 1887, died in 1975.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.830
He comes from this WASP
blue-blood family in New York.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.560
And his father is
a society doctor,

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.332
serving those blue bloods.

00:35:39.332 --> 00:35:41.290
I'm not sure they ever
had any health problems.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.650
But if they did, his
father was there.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.690
Until his father runs
off with his secretary.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.960
This is when Loomis's
life changes.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.470
Loomis is now stuck with the
responsibility for the family.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:59.540
He can't do what he wanted
to do, study science.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.720
Instead, he has to go to
become an investment banker,

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.380
heaven forbid.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.610
So he has technical
training and a love

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.190
for science and strong
undergraduate science training.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.280
He goes into investment banking.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.650
He understands technology.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:26.510
He makes an absolute, one of
the great fortunes of the 1920s,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.660
and his investment
banking firm is setting up

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.820
utility companies,
utility holding companies.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.060
He understands the electricity
technology, the transmission

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.710
technology.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.230
He's able to capitalize
on that and make

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.910
a fortune for
essentially electrifying

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.900
large parts of the country.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.420
He sees what's going to happen.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:56.780
And in 1928, he takes his
entire fortune, every last dime

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.790
and gets out of the market,
because he saw the bubble.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.490
And then what's he do?

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:14.450
So he's got the estate, Tudor
house, pond, grounds, lawns,

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:19.110
40 acres' worth in a
place called Tuxedo Park,

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.930
which is about 40 miles
north of New York City.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.660
The tuxedo, you know,
the funny penguin suit,

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.848
comes from Tuxedo Park.

00:37:25.848 --> 00:37:27.390
That's the kind of
clothing they used

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.040
to wear there in the evening.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.570
Gives you an idea
of what it's like.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:35.910
It's like the first kind
of gated multi-acre suburb

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.990
for this compound for
staggeringly rich people

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:44.270
from New York City, only
40 miles north of the city.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.790
So he's got this
Tudor mansion there.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:49.200
He loves science.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.870
He's walked out with his
entire fortune intact.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:59.440
He creates probably the top
private research laboratory

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.400
in the 1930s.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.200
And he staffs it with an
incredible group of scientists.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.020
But in particular, he
specializes in what we now

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.020
call the summer study.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.110
And he's there
researching himself.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:17.500
His field is physics,
particularly microwave physics.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.100
And he invites in the
who's who of physics

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.640
from all over the world.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.330
So the famous
European physicists

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.660
are there for summer projects,
and they're rowing on the pond

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.880
and playing lawn tennis
on his lawn tennis courts,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.700
and doing little
research, and talking away

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.750
and having great meals.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.970
It's a nice setting.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:36.670
All right.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.380
You get the picture.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.260
He gets to know the whole
who's who of physics,

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:47.808
and he's doing important
work himself in physics,

00:38:47.808 --> 00:38:49.100
in this microwave physics area.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:54.415
Time passes.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.520
World War II breaks
out in Europe.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.620
He's very sympathetic
to the Brits.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.640
His mentor, his first
cousin, is Henry Stimson,

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.110
who's Secretary of War to
Franklin Roosevelt. Stimson's

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.810
a famous leader of the War
Department during World War II

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:31.095
and a very talented, highly
respected figure in that era.

00:39:31.095 --> 00:39:33.470
He had been Secretary of State
previously in the Coolidge

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.970
administration.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:41.030
Stimson trusts Loomis.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.750
They're first cousins,
but in effect, Stimson

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.570
is Loomis's father figure.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:52.370
So Loomis becomes a very
critical advisor to Stimson

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.270
in this pre-war
period of '39 and '40.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.170
And in addition, Loomis is
serving with Vannevar Bush, who

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:04.880
we'll talk about in a minute,
on the early defense research

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.318
committees.

00:40:08.318 --> 00:40:13.980
So let's switch to Britain.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.097
So Britain and the United
States develop radar roughly

00:40:17.097 --> 00:40:17.930
about the same time.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:24.660
In the US context, it
was developed by the Navy

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.680
at the Naval Research Laboratory
on the Anacostia River.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.300
And they were fiddling
around with radio,

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.900
and they were
shooting radio beams

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.430
across the Anacostia River.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.740
And they noticed
this peculiar thing,

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:42.450
which was a boat would
come down the river

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.540
and the radio beam
would bounce back.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.230
Voila.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.760
Radar.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.650
The British were
doing experiments

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.240
at roughly the same time period.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:00.290
And because the US wasn't 100
miles away from German bombers

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.930
or 200 miles away
from German bombers,

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.195
there was no sense of
emergency in developing

00:41:05.195 --> 00:41:06.320
radar in the United States.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.810
There was a considerable
sense of emergency developing

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:09.590
radar in Germany.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.030
The going doctrine
of the time, based

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.090
upon what happened
in Spanish Civil War,

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.910
was that mass bombing
was going to be

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.510
a core offensive
military strategy

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.010
and that there was
nothing you could

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:30.150
do to stop the bombers
from getting through.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.400
The bomber will
always get through

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.470
was the prevailing doctrine.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:38.010
And people began to see
the effect of mass bombing

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.980
from sites like Guernica
during the Spanish Civil War.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.210
And it was a nightmare.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:44.377
It was a complete nightmare.

00:41:44.377 --> 00:41:48.300
It dictated a lot of the
politics of appeasement

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.000
in the 1930s, because
the assumption

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.290
was that you couldn't defend
against these bombing raids

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:58.500
and that cities like
London and others

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:03.190
would just be leveled
at huge slaughter.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.120
So if your assumption is
that you can't defend it

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.930
against them, that
you're going to lose,

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.470
and that you're going to lose
a huge part of your population,

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:14.720
you can understand where a
lot of appeasement doctrine

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.110
comes from, where Chamberlain
and Baldwin are coming from.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:26.360
Meanwhile, Winston
Churchill, always a maverick,

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.240
is trying to figure out what
to do about the situation,

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.140
because it's untenable from
his political perspective.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:39.110
So there's an
interesting figure named

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:46.200
Tizard, who is head of
Imperial College in London,

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.630
previously a professor.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.632
But in World War I a
pilot and in World War I,

00:42:50.632 --> 00:42:52.090
because his eyes
weren't that good,

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.310
he was relegated to
being a test pilot

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:58.930
in the RAF, the early
version of the Royal Air

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.840
Force, Royal Flying Corps.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.560
And he learned pilot talk and
how to get along with pilots.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.197
He was one, and he
knows the language,

00:43:07.197 --> 00:43:08.530
and he understands how it works.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:14.420
And the radar idea
comes to Tizard.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.520
As a noted academic,
he's heading

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.040
a scientific advisory group
for the Royal Air Force.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.630
And he seizes on
and realizes this

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:28.350
could be the core of
a defensive strategy

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:32.280
against the bomber, that
might be able to stop it

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.280
from going through.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.538
And just because you
have a technology idea,

00:43:37.538 --> 00:43:40.080
it doesn't mean anybody in the
military is going to adopt it.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.700
It's got to become operational.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:47.700
So he spends years working
with the Royal Air Force trying

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.090
to develop an operational
doctrine to integrate

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:55.890
these early long-range radar
systems, the communications

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:59.220
with the Spitfires and fighter
planes and the Hurricanes,

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.470
to communicate the results
that they're seeing

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:05.430
on their long-range
radar screens,

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.082
get those up to the fighter
pilots, get them up in the air

00:44:08.082 --> 00:44:10.290
and get them to the right
location at the right time.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:14.580
That's critical, because you
can't maintain continuous cover

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.080
with fighter planes.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.150
They're short distance,
and they're under-fueled,

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:19.690
and they have limited range.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.833
So if you try to defend
against 1,000 bombers,

00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:24.000
you can only have a certain
number of fighter planes

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.500
up in the air at
any given moment.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.750
But if you know exactly when
the bombers are coming in

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.292
and exactly where
they're going to be

00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:31.290
and what altitude
they're going to be at,

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.930
then you can mash
your fighter planes

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.720
and get them position ahead
of time and then take them on.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.090
And that's what the British
figured out with radar.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:42.570
Now, their system
was long-wave radar.

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.840
So they had like a system
all around the coast

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.920
of like these big 60-foot
telephone pole kinds of things.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.750
And then these
big 30-foot things

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.250
that looked like
bed springs, only

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.740
they were about 30 feet long.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.050
And it was called the
Chain Home System.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.780
It was all around the
critical parts of the coast.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.970
And then they would get
information from the radar sets

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.580
to an operational center
that would run the fighter

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.410
plane cover system at air bases
throughout the British Isles

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.127
and scramble these jets--

00:45:16.127 --> 00:45:18.210
scramble these fighter
planes and get them up just

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:19.043
in the nick of time.

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:29.190
It's very clumsy, because the
pilots don't have the radar.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.640
They're talking to somebody who
is in turn talking to somebody

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.230
about what the radar says.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.570
You can imagine what the
communication is like.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:40.367
I mean, you have to get it down
to almost a separate language

00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:41.700
on how to communicate to people.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.950
So it's very tough.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:49.343
Wouldn't it be better if the
radar was in the airplane?

00:45:49.343 --> 00:45:50.760
But if it's
long-wave, how are you

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.660
going to put this 30-foot bed
spring into a fighter aircraft?

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:55.480
That's the problem.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.170
So the British work on--

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.790
frantically working
on microwave radar.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:08.940
You know, 10-centimeter long
radar beams with the idea

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.845
that whoever figures
this out is going

00:46:10.845 --> 00:46:14.670
to have a staggering tactical
and strategic advantage

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:16.520
in the war.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:20.030
And they put a team on
it, and they come up

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:26.410
with 12 early sets
of microwave radar.

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.040
Then what are they going to do?

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.460
Well, Britain has so
allowed its industrial base

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:38.290
to erode that the best thinking
is we're going flat-out

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.080
on building munitions,
we don't have capacity

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.470
to take up this whole new
territory of effectively invent

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.930
electronics.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.310
We can't do that.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:49.810
Who could do it?

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:51.220
The Americans.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:55.270
So Churchill, pressed
by to Tizard and others,

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:58.510
comes up with the
idea that they'll

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:01.690
take microwave radar and
a bunch of other secrets

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:05.513
that they've got, because
remember, British science is

00:47:05.513 --> 00:47:07.680
very strong, probably
stronger than American science

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.760
at this point.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.480
We wouldn't think so, but
that's probably the case.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:19.830
And Tizard is nominated to lead
a mission to the United States

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.720
and essentially offer to put--

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.670
they offer to put their
secrets on the table

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:27.570
if we, the United States, will
put our secrets on the table.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:28.860
We'll trade secrets.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.632
That would be the deal.

00:47:30.632 --> 00:47:37.690
So a group of scientists and
a couple of military officers

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.450
get on a high-speed
passenger ship.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:42.580
Now, passenger ships are
moving at about 30 knots

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.110
across the ocean.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:47.700
U-boats are much slower.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.490
On the surface, 14, 15 knots.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:53.670
Far slower if they're
running below the surface.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.240
So nobody sank a passenger
ship on the Atlantic route

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.110
during World War II.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:00.390
They always got across.

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:05.630
So they go into Halifax,
and they have in a suitcase

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.190
the most critical
secret of the war,

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:11.755
one of these 12
microwave radar sets.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.270
Loomis flies over to Halifax.

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:22.570
They take the train down.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.430
They go to Washington.

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:28.130
There's a meeting at
the Wardman Park Hotel.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:29.150
At the Wardman Park--

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:30.560
I bet you it's still there--

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.860
Loomis, rich guy,
consulting in Washington,

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.330
trying to help the
war effort, he's

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:39.720
got a penthouse on the top
of the Wardman Park Hotel.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.908
Fireplace.

00:48:40.908 --> 00:48:41.700
I'm sure it's nice.

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:48.990
The meeting is at a private
dining room downstairs,

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:53.370
just off the big dining room at
this fancy Wardman Park Hotel.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:55.535
Loomis, as Stimson's
unofficial advisor

00:48:55.535 --> 00:48:56.910
about science and
technology, has

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:59.220
convened the military
leaders from the services,

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:03.270
from the Army and Marine
Corps and the Air Force,

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.660
and this is apocryphal.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:10.350
It may not exactly be
the case, but in essence,

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.480
our uniformed
military leaders have

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:19.060
decided that they're not going
to agree to exchange secrets.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.710
They're not going to do it.

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.882
They think Britain
is going down.

00:49:22.882 --> 00:49:24.715
Battle of Britain is
hanging in the balance.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.590
They think Britain
is going to lose.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.173
Anything that goes
to Britain is going

00:49:30.173 --> 00:49:33.370
to fall in the hands of Germany.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:37.150
So they hit on a strategy,
is the apocryphal part,

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:40.360
of pretending to get
drunk at the meal

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.960
and falling asleep
in their soup dishes.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.090
This may be exaggerated.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:48.100
It was told to me by
someone, but we'll see.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.130
So they do it, and
the Brits have just

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.210
come across the ocean.

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.570
They've got the suitcase
with them in the room.

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.523
I mean, you know, the war
is hanging in the balance.

00:49:58.523 --> 00:50:00.190
The war could be one
if these yanks just

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:03.340
pick up this technology
and manufacture it.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.410
Lots at stake.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:13.490
And they start throwing
out hints, little hints

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:17.770
about this cavity
magnetron, as they call it,

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.260
and it's microwave capabilities.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.580
And of course, sitting
at the head of the table

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.140
as Alfred Loomis, who happens to
be America's leading microwave

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.690
physicist at this point,
author of numerous articles

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.550
and so forth.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.900
No PhD, but for every
intent and purpose,

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.270
the leading scientist
in the field.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.130
He gets the hints.

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.430
He's been working on a much
earlier stage of radar himself.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.930
He starts to understand
what they're talking about.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:46.550
Little more time
passes, Loomis goes up

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.000
to his penthouse with
Tizard and the five others,

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.860
sitting around the fireplace,
and the story comes out.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.020
And then they in
turn meet at, you

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:02.850
guessed it, Tuxedo Park and
the suitcase exchanges hands.

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:07.610
And then Loomis, who probably
unique in the country,

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:10.790
is capable of understanding
what this technology is,

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.710
how powerful it is.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:18.740
If you put a radar set in an
airplane, the airplane can see.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:23.870
The airplane can fly at night,
not just during the daytime.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:28.640
It can do its own interception
and its own targeting.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.210
It doesn't have to rely on
clumsy radar signals going

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:34.940
through two or three
people down on the ground.

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.220
It's a transformative
technology.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.600
He understands what it is.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.880
He's been himself working
on kind of a much earlier

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.070
stage of this.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:44.250
What's he do?

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:49.610
Well, never underestimate the
power of WASP blue blood family

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:50.450
connections.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:52.130
So he immediately
gets on the phone

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.650
with Henry Stimson, his
first cousin and mentor

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.560
and surrogate father.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.330
Henry, got to move on this.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:00.440
Go see Roosevelt.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.960
Henry, same day, goes to see
Franklin Roosevelt. Franklin

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:08.690
Roosevelt, the Dutch WASP
blue blood family connections,

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:10.550
yes, move on it, Henry.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.840
So literally within a day, the
fundamental decisions are made.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:19.160
Tizard advises Loomis on the
structure of the organization

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:24.410
that the Brits have put
together to do this.

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:26.580
And the Americans decide
to do the same thing.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.180
So what did Tizard set up?

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:33.470
This is not a bureaucratic
military laboratory

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.510
that is doing radar in Britain.

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:40.340
This is civilian scientists,
not in uniform, organized

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:45.170
in a loose almost academic kind
of flat, non-hierarchical way,

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.240
where everybody pitches
in with the best ideas.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.980
There's leadership,
there's organization,

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:53.957
but it's not a
military bureaucracy.

00:52:53.957 --> 00:52:55.790
Loomis doesn't have to
be persuaded of this.

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:58.190
He had worked in the war
effort in World War I

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.490
and found the military
bureaucracy impregnable

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.260
to ideas.

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.170
It had been completely
frustrating to him.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:07.790
Vannevar Bush had a similar
experience, complete frustrated

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:08.870
as well.

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:13.670
So they latch onto the way in
which the Brits have organized

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:17.600
their scientific advisory
groups and their organizational

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.000
efforts for doing science
in a wartime setting.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:27.260
The microwave radar is a
really important importation.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.480
The model of
scientific organization

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.880
is every bit as important.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.962
And Loomis runs with them both.

00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:36.420
Loomis immediately
gets hold of one

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.760
of his very best friends,
who is Ernest Lawrence, who

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.510
is the most prominent American
physicist at the time.

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:46.200
Loomis had been personally
funding Ernest Lawrence's work

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.240
to build the early cyclotrons
up on Cyclotron Road

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:55.160
up above the Berkeley campus,
where Lawrence is a professor.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.660
They're very close.

00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:00.080
Loomis has been paying
for him and his projects.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.975
So he gets Lawrence on the
phone and says get out here.

00:54:02.975 --> 00:54:04.350
I can't talk to
you on the phone.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:06.110
Let's get out of here.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:07.820
Lawrence-- it's
unusual at the time--

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.130
he doesn't take the
train, he flies,

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:12.650
meets within days with Loomis.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.780
The two of them
get on the phone.

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:18.170
Because of the summer
studies at Tuxedo Park,

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.650
Loomis knows everybody and
Lawrence knows everybody else.

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.740
They get on the phone, and the
conversations are like this--

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.510
hi.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:28.910
We're going to set
up a new laboratory.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:31.310
We can't tell you
anything about it.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:36.750
Arrive in Cambridge in two
weeks and quit your job.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.330
They all come.

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:44.060
So powerful are Loomis and
Lawrence that they come.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:48.290
The who's who of physics in
the United States shows up.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:51.183
Now, why are they going
to show up in Cambridge?

00:54:51.183 --> 00:54:52.850
It's another critical
part of our story.

00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:00.230
Here's some of the characters
that were in the room.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:06.560
So there's this defense advisory
group that Vannevar Bush, here,

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.370
is running.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:14.460
And Loomis is his advisor,
here, on air defense microwave

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.160
radar, all this radar stuff.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:21.018
And Vannevar Bush and
Loomis call a meeting

00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:22.560
to make a decision
about where to put

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.710
this new Critical Defense
Laboratory that's going

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:28.290
to work on microwave radar.

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:31.900
Not in this picture is--

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:35.190
you remember Frank Jewett,
the exponent of conservatism

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:39.870
who is head of Bell Labs
and the National Academies?

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.790
Frank is in the room.

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:46.350
Frank says, well, we're
going to put it at Bell Labs.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.540
It's where it's going to go.

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.140
Who would even think otherwise?

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:51.770
There's a vote.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:56:00.160
So in the room is Karl Compton,
president at MIT, and James

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.760
Conant, president of Harvard.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.420
You may recall that those
two schools are in Cambridge.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:13.560
Loomis and Vannevar Bush, and
that's Lawrence, by the way.

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.800
And that's Arthur Compton,
who is Karl's brother, also

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.080
a quite prominent and
important physicist at the time

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.497
and involved in
this defense work.

00:56:20.497 --> 00:56:22.800
But he's not in the room.

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.850
And then Jewett.

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:30.860
So it's one, two, three,
four, plus Frank Jewett.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.770
Surprise.

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:33.330
The vote is 4 to 1.

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:35.760
It's going to go to MIT.

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.270
And all there is at
MIT is industrial space

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:40.478
all over the place.

00:56:40.478 --> 00:56:42.270
And it's just coming
out of the depression.

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.580
So there's a lot
of space in MIT.

00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:49.880
So President Compton
volunteers the space.

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.710
And that's how come the Rad
Lab gets stood up at MIT.

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:58.040
And it is a remarkably
successful organization.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:02.610
This is how-- this is the
foundation of electronics

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:03.720
in the United States.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.390
This is where most
of that comes from.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:12.840
Of the numerous scientists
that worked at the Rad Lab,

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.660
I think 10 win the Nobel Prize.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:23.640
The group of scientists that
set up the Rad Lab do it on this

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.870
radical, flat,
non-hierarchical, collaborative

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:33.280
stay-out-of-uniform
organizational model.

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.740
Loomis plays a critical
role in scaling up

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:39.370
the Manhattan Project, which
had been kind of desultory.

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:41.510
So Loomis next jumps
on that problem

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:43.830
and gets that organized.

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:46.740
Oppenheimer, who we will
talk about in class 7,

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:49.340
is designated to
head that project.

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:52.620
Oppenheimer doesn't know
how to organize this stuff.

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:57.870
Eleven people go from the Rad
Lab to organize Los Alamos

00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:00.310
and work there.

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:06.010
And II Rabi, who is from the Rad
Lab, a great Columbia physicist

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:09.700
and Nobel Prize winner, he
becomes Oppenheimer's advisor

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.940
on how to organize the
Los Alamos project.

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:14.620
So you begin to get
the picture here.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.470
It's a great story about
a particular technology,

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:20.290
but frankly, more
important than that story

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:22.690
is a story of
scientific organization.

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:25.900
How are we going to organize
science in this country?

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:31.200
And what we call the FFRDC,
Federally Funded Research

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:36.120
and Development Center, that
is going to be the model.

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:41.590
And the first one of those
is the Rad Lab at MIT.

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.290
Then Los Alamos and then so on.

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:47.440
Lincoln Laboratory
up the street is

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.610
organized on exactly
these same kind of lines.

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:52.815
So it's the organizational
model in the end

00:58:52.815 --> 00:58:53.690
that's most critical.

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:54.827
Rasheed.

00:58:54.827 --> 00:58:55.910
RASHEED: This is a point--

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:57.660
I'm pretty sure that's
a cyclotron drawing

00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.138
on the chalkboard
in the picture?

00:58:59.138 --> 00:59:00.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's very cool.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.055
I've always wondered
what it was.

00:59:02.055 --> 00:59:03.550
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:07.900
You can tell by the two halves
of the circle on the right.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:08.510
Yeah.

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:12.020
And then I'm pretty sure that's
a magnet drawing in the middle

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:12.890
there on the left.

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:14.630
I don't know what's
going on above it.

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:15.140
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: This one?

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.145
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:59:16.145 --> 00:59:17.600
Random sinusoid.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.308
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Thank you.

00:59:19.308 --> 00:59:19.850
That's great.

00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:22.070
Now I know the picture better.

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.535
If you could check that out,
that would be fascinating.

00:59:24.535 --> 00:59:26.027
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:59:26.027 --> 00:59:28.610
I mean, if Ernest Lawrence drew
it, it's probably a cyclotron.

00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:30.040
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.790
I don't see the chalk
in his hand, though.

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:34.160
I don't know.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.712
But it's entirely possible.

00:59:36.712 --> 00:59:39.170
But I think they're all smiling
and happy because they just

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:41.130
rolled Bell Labs
and Frank Jewett,

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:44.900
I think is what's going on.

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.700
All right.

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.300
That's my storytelling.

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.330
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:50.663
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: What's that?

00:59:50.663 --> 00:59:53.627
STEPH: Oh, I looked
up the blueprint.

00:59:53.627 --> 00:59:55.210
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
It is a cyclotron.

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:57.247
RASHEED: Cool.

00:59:57.247 --> 00:59:58.330
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Is it?

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:00.760
Steph, it's a cyclotron?

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.080
Great.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.000
Rasheed, good.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.130
That was good.

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:06.080
STEPH: Created by UC Berkeley.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Hey, that's Lawrence.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.090
This guy.

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:12.140
MAX: I had no idea
that Karl Compton was

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.990
both the guy who made Compton
scattering and the president

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.532
of MIT.

01:00:15.532 --> 01:00:16.740
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Oh, yeah.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.118
MAX: I didn't-- awesome.

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:19.160
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.370
This is an unbelievable
collection in this room.

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:26.570
That is hard to beat that
collection of talent.

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:33.350
And Janet Conant's
grandfather is James Conant.

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:36.140
So she's able to do
the book on Loomis,

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.960
because she's got all
the family records, all

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.296
the correspondence.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.082
So Rasheed, we have a
scientific consensus

01:00:47.082 --> 01:00:48.040
that that's what it is?

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.690
RASHEED: Yeah.

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:51.980
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:52.580
Great.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.540
Thank you.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.550
That will add a whole new
piece to the evolution

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:57.534
of the story over time.

01:00:57.534 --> 01:00:59.617
STEPH: It's what social
scientists are good for.

01:00:59.617 --> 01:01:01.530
We do research.

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:03.660
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's good.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.160
All right.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.460
Max, have you got this one?

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.050
MAX: Yep.

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:06.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:06.980
MAX: All right.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.550
So--

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:08.090
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
You could actually

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:09.770
tell us what actually happened.

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:10.840
MAX: Yeah.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.598
Let's see.

01:01:11.598 --> 01:01:12.140
I don't know.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.395
You covered it in spades.

01:01:16.642 --> 01:01:19.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It's one
of my favorite story tellings.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.550
MAX: Yeah, I gathered.

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:24.020
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: One
story time in most classes.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.520
MAX: I did appreciate--
so something

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.220
I gather when I
was reading it, I

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.330
thought this had taken
place before the Manhattan

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:30.370
Project was ever formed.

01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:30.770
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Oh, yes.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:31.810
Absolutely right.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:32.893
MAX: OK, which I thought--

01:01:32.893 --> 01:01:34.268
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So this group

01:01:34.268 --> 01:01:36.680
may well be gathering around
next stages of the Manhattan

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.080
Project.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.610
MAX: Yeah.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:37.880
OK.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.000
So--

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.625
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Because these folks

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:42.510
are central to everything
that goes on in science

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:44.120
in that World War II period.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.430
MAX: So I thought that
was one of the general,

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:48.860
like that emphasized the
genius of this group,

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:51.770
because before then,
there weren't really like

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:53.690
giant gatherings of this sort.

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:55.570
And it was before the
Manhattan Project.

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:57.938
So something of that scale
had never been done before.

01:01:57.938 --> 01:01:59.480
LUYAN: What is the
Manhattan Project?

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.110
MAX: What?

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:01.652
LUYAN: What is the
Manhattan Project?

01:02:01.652 --> 01:02:03.960
MAX: Oh, to build
the atomic bomb.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.700
Yeah.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.200
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So Luyan, that's

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.210
the great crash project at
Los Alamos up on a mason

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:13.620
surrounded by barbed wire,
way off in the deserts

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:17.750
of New Mexico that does
most of the critical work

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:21.080
on developing atomic weapons
in the course of World War II.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.620
And the great fear, as
Max suggested earlier,

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:29.540
was that most of US physicists
knew Heisenberg personally.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.570
And Heisenberg's in charge of
the German atomic projects.

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:35.210
They know how brilliant he is.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.400
They think he's going
to get there first,

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.350
that they're way behind.

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:44.533
And the war would
be over in an hour

01:02:44.533 --> 01:02:45.950
if Germany had
gotten there first.

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:48.367
So that's why there's such a
crash project to put together

01:02:48.367 --> 01:02:49.580
the Manhattan Project.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.470
But this Rad Lab
stuff is equally

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:55.880
important from a
tactical point of view,

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.040
in terms of the ability
of aircraft to operate,

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.760
the power of air power in World
War II, the ability of radar

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.710
systems to see
incoming airstrikes,

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:09.770
the ability of fleets
to manage air attacks.

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.660
All that stuff
comes out of here,

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.910
and those are critical
day-to-day developments

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:14.600
in World War II.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.220
So the atomic bomb may have been
the final ending of the war,

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.940
but the day-to-day
warfare is dramatically

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.190
changed by the microwave radar.

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:26.800
MAX: So the first
question that I

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.350
thought of when I was just
looking at all this reading,

01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:33.100
I was thinking, well, they
were able to take this design

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.190
and build up the manufacturing
facilities, build up the labs,

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:38.620
scale everything,
get all the people,

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:41.950
and make these planes
with this radar equipment

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:44.640
really quickly, because the
war is only like four years.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.150
So they had to do all of
that in that time span.

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:51.310
So what struck me was just how
did they get it so quickly?

01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:53.560
Was it only because
they had, as I mentioned

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.840
earlier, the Nazi
Germany threat, that they

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.100
had to actually face?

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.840
And is there any way that
we could do that today?

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.950
Any way that we
could, without some

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:05.470
sort of evil that
we have to fight,

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:08.050
is there any way
that we can increase

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:11.320
the speed of, I don't
know, research progress

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:16.060
or at least the
development side of R&D,

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.280
if we can make it that quick?

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.690
CHLOE: I think, just
tagging off of MIT history

01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:24.940
and then sort of tagging
in modern MIT history

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:30.550
or modern today
and MIT, but my lab

01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:35.770
builds CubeSats that are
oftentimes funded by the Air

01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:37.240
Force Research Laboratory.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.430
And it's an
interesting experience

01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:43.480
seeing the extremely short
developmental lifecycle

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.000
of these spacecraft
that are technically

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.280
supposed to be student
platform spacecraft, but still

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:53.110
spacecraft, being churned out in
two years, which is ridiculous.

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.980
Like, that's really fast.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.570
And I think that that
development speed is achievable

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:01.810
because of the combination
of a lot of money

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:05.260
from the government
institution given

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.740
to an academic institution where
you have a lot of young people

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:13.150
who are very passionate to do
good work, who haven't been

01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:15.722
sort of exhausted by the
industry already, you know,

01:05:15.722 --> 01:05:16.930
their passion is still there.

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:18.800
There's still light
in their eyes.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.770
And then they have the
resources to-- you know,

01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:24.238
everyone's in one
building or, you know,

01:05:24.238 --> 01:05:26.530
everyone can easily connect
to the resources they need.

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:31.480
So it's a good utilization
of funds given to people who

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.280
know how to use them quickly.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.195
So I think that
combination works.

01:05:36.195 --> 01:05:36.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:40.990
And I think that the
Nazi threat is definitely

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:44.560
something that lit a
fire under the research,

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.000
leading to application
and widespread use,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.600
but there were also a couple
of really important factors

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.510
in this particular instance.

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.300
One is that Loomis bankrolled
a lot of this stuff

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.290
by himself at the
very beginning.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:05.110
And so it took the
government more years,

01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:08.650
I think, to get behind it
financially and finally

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:09.720
jump on board.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.100
And then the other
is that Loomis

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.370
can do pretty much
anything he wants,

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:19.420
because his cousin Stimson
just gives him this blank carte

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.230
blanche, do what you have to do.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.988
But I think that--

01:06:23.988 --> 01:06:24.530
I don't know.

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:27.290
Luis Alvarez makes a really
bold statement there,

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:29.528
like the last of the
amateurs of science.

01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:30.070
I don't know.

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:32.170
What about Bill
Gates, for example,

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.650
is trying to do something,
I think, sort of analogous

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:39.355
at this point in time, with
the newer nuclear reactors

01:06:39.355 --> 01:06:40.480
that he's trying to set up.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.700
And he's bankrolling that
to a large degree and so--

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.180
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.597
And he's taking
MIT online courses

01:06:44.597 --> 01:06:46.102
in physics at the same time.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:47.300
AUDIENCE: Is he really?

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.050
MAX: That's great.

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:50.620
AUDIENCE: And he's assembling
billionaires for this fun.

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.370
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:52.900
It's another great
group, I think.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:56.288
So I disagree with Luis
Alvarez on this point.

01:06:56.288 --> 01:06:57.580
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Stay tuned.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.000
MAX: Well maybe the emphasis
in that statement is amateur,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.970
like maybe there's a
difference between what

01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:06.130
he defines as an amateur
and maybe Bill Gates.

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:09.760
Of course, it depends on
his specific definition.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.370
Other questions that
I had included--

01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:16.690
so someone had mentioned--
someone had asked the question,

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:20.020
I think it was Stimson, who
had said that he would prefer

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.748
to just stay involved
with his research,

01:07:21.748 --> 01:07:24.040
and he really didn't want to
get involved with politics

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.980
or any sort of war effort.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:31.390
So someone has-- well,
should research--

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:33.280
should scientists
usually just stay

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.780
in that mindset and just
mostly stay into their research

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.830
or should they get involved
in politics at all?

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.208
And I see the
advantages of both,

01:07:41.208 --> 01:07:43.750
because on one hand, if you have
people that are only working

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:49.030
on research, well, they have
a unique perspective they

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.220
can contribute to politics.

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:51.490
But on the other
hand, that's time

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.230
they're spending away
from their research

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:55.730
when they could be producing
something that could be helping

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:57.670
people across the planet.

01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:01.892
So I was just curious if you
guys had any thoughts on that.

01:08:01.892 --> 01:08:03.350
RASHEED: I think
I'd probably argue

01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:06.140
that it's pretty myopic to
say that your research has

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:10.190
no effect on the outside world,
in general, just because you're

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:11.890
studying the outside world.

01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:14.630
That's going to exist
outside of the lab,

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:16.430
and it will have an
effect no matter what

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:20.720
you do scientifically, like say
you have your academic research

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.428
circle that's probably
directly affected.

01:08:22.428 --> 01:08:24.803
And then if you look outside
of that, if your research is

01:08:24.803 --> 01:08:26.720
impactful enough, you're
just going to have,

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.973
no matter what, there are
political ramifications

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:31.890
and everything like that
to everything you do.

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:33.710
And so I think
reminding scientists

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.260
to be cognizant of
those things and just

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:39.020
asking them to actively
take this into consideration

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:42.020
while they do research is
sort of necessary, just

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.660
because that's just
how the world works.

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.319
You can't really put
a drop in the bucket

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:52.040
and not experience
ripple effects outside.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.830
So I think this is probably one
of the really solid examples

01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:57.830
of why that's probably a
good thing, because you

01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:59.247
have these people
very interested,

01:08:59.247 --> 01:09:00.414
obviously, in the academic--

01:09:00.414 --> 01:09:01.705
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:04.430
RASHEED: Yeah, like the
academic implications

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:07.140
of radar, sort of
electromagnetism,

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.228
but also war efforts.

01:09:08.228 --> 01:09:09.770
MAX: And I definitely
think that like

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.600
this current political
climate definitely

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.740
emphasizes why scientists should
make their opinions more known

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:21.040
and the consequences
of not doing that.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.957
You had your hand
up for a while.

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:25.040
AUDIENCE: So I think
scientists and engineers like

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.100
to do their work as entirely
objective, like what they're

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.152
doing is like black and
white, like this is the truth

01:09:31.152 --> 01:09:31.819
and this is not.

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:34.640
And I think that misses out
a lot on the social context

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.810
in which they're doing their
work and other, like the fact

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:40.939
that both what they're
studying and how

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:44.229
they study it is affected by
the world that they live in.

01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:46.729
And so saying that they can
isolate themselves from that

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:52.590
doesn't seem very
realistic or effective.

01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:55.600
AUDIENCE: I want to go back to
that point about Luis Alvarez.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.215
I think what he meant is there's
a whole period time where it

01:09:58.215 --> 01:10:04.000
was like [INAUDIBLE]
JJ Thomson, Tesla,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.500
where it was like people who
just did experiments versus now

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.708
it's more academic, more
like worrying about theories

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:11.470
and then you do some research,
but there's people that only--

01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:13.240
they did experiments and
they came to conclusions,

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.740
and then they built stuff
off those conclusions

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.730
about what they built.

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:20.020
So it's more of an organic
process of innovation.

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.760
The benefit too of Loomis
was he came from Wall Street,

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.030
so it was very fast cycle,
always getting things done.

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:27.040
Sometimes you step on some toes.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.290
And so there's some benefits
to that kind of attitude,

01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:31.383
because he thought about
it more like a business

01:10:31.383 --> 01:10:32.800
problem in terms
of, like, oh, I'm

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.680
going to get the best people.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.350
I can incentivize
them to be here.

01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:39.910
And he pretty much made the
first startup incubator.

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:42.893
And then also, who do I need
to know to get this thing done?

01:10:42.893 --> 01:10:45.310
Because he could have definitely
just been like, I'm rich.

01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:49.260
I'm going to be in my penthouse
and just like take some drinks.

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.250
I don't know if he
had a wife or not.

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:51.970
But like--

01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:54.873
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'll
tell that story in a minute.

01:10:54.873 --> 01:10:57.290
AUDIENCE: I mean, I assumed
there was a story there, yeah.

01:10:57.290 --> 01:11:00.980
But it very interesting
in terms of he's

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.110
just somebody who had
to get things done.

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:04.870
But he just kind of
had a side interest.

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:07.480
And that's usually like some
of the most interesting people,

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.147
where they come from
one domain and then

01:11:09.147 --> 01:11:10.450
they go interdisciplinary.

01:11:12.558 --> 01:11:14.850
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And that
Cavendish Lab, by the way,

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:18.000
is a fascinating great
group in the 1920s.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.907
It's really fascinating.

01:11:19.907 --> 01:11:20.740
AUDIENCE: Cavendish?

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:21.290
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.832
At Cambridge.

01:11:21.832 --> 01:11:22.900
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.600
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Where
Thompson and some of the others

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.000
were.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.910
AUDIENCE: So there's this
theory that we should think

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.550
about science more like
politics and that there's

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:29.710
different schools of thought.

01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:30.800
And the problem
with science right

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.175
now is more that we only have
one way of thinking about--

01:11:33.175 --> 01:11:35.350
you learn science one way
or you learn math one way,

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:37.100
whereas if you got
different perspectives,

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.430
it would make it easier
to solve problems.

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:42.395
And that's a very
powerful thing.

01:11:42.395 --> 01:11:43.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.067
So I think Loomis himself
said that he thought

01:11:46.067 --> 01:11:47.900
the scientists were
more productive focusing

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.900
on their research and
getting them off politics.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.340
I think maybe he
almost saw himself

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.150
as kind of the
interface probably.

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.150
So as a more amateur scientist.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:59.633
But he's kind of facilitating
this and making it possible.

01:11:59.633 --> 01:12:02.300
And yeah, I think it's important
that scientists think about it.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:07.190
But I guess I do agree that
they should be focused and maybe

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:09.830
have other people interface.

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:11.560
I'll be interested
to hear what goes

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.550
in it as working in the
MIT DC office that's

01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:18.010
a large part of what
you guys do, I imagine,

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:20.900
just talking to the
professors here and advocating

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:23.920
on their behalf.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:24.930
MAX: You had a comment?

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.222
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, I just
had a similar point to Matt,

01:12:27.222 --> 01:12:29.770
just like if you have an
organization with people

01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:33.010
serving different functions,
like maybe scientists can stick

01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:35.740
to their realm of specialty
and focus on their research

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.990
if there are other
people connecting them

01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:40.210
to politics and outside.

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:41.170
MAX: I see.

01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:43.553
STEPH: To counter, I think
about Ernie Moniz a lot.

01:12:43.553 --> 01:12:44.220
AUDIENCE: Moniz.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:44.830
STEPH: Moniz.

01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:45.160
Moniz.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.285
AUDIENCE: That's all right.

01:12:46.285 --> 01:12:46.930
You've got it.

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:48.010
STEPH: I think of it
in the French, yeah.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:48.927
AUDIENCE: You're fine.

01:12:48.927 --> 01:12:49.735
You're fine.

01:12:49.735 --> 01:12:52.350
STEPH: I greatly admire him.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:56.140
No, I've just been looking at
this picture lovingly of him.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:57.190
He's one of my heroes.

01:12:57.190 --> 01:12:58.660
AUDIENCE: Well, tell him that.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:12:59.363
STEPH: Please.

01:12:59.363 --> 01:13:01.780
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: He's next
door to Martha, as I recall.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.420
STEPH: Oh, my gosh.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:02.920
OK.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.452
Even better.

01:13:04.452 --> 01:13:05.670
I'm blushing.

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:06.820
Oh.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:10.310
Yeah, so I totally
have a crush on Moniz.

01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:11.860
And I think about him a lot.

01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:17.320
So I spent--

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.750
I took a gap semester
to intern in Congress.

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:21.670
And one of the things
that came out of that

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:23.980
was becoming good friends
with the White House liaison

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:25.147
to the Department of Energy.

01:13:25.147 --> 01:13:28.060
So he was one of the people
who helped pick Moniz.

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.585
And then he took me around
the office and the top floor.

01:13:30.585 --> 01:13:31.632
I saw his office.

01:13:31.632 --> 01:13:32.340
That was amazing.

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.040
I passed out nearly.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.777
But the reason I
think a lot of him,

01:13:36.777 --> 01:13:38.860
other than the fact that
I have an enormous crush,

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.360
is that he is one of those
scientists who I almost

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.990
feel like there's an immense
trade off because he became

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:49.960
a public servant, because
he could be doing so much

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.950
incredible work in his area
of specialty and expertise.

01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:55.660
And at the same
time, I trust no one

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.480
but him to run the
Department of Energy, right?

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:04.720
And so there's that sense
that he can do what he wants,

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.750
because he is an adult expert.

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:11.890
And at the same time, that is an
immensely personal calculation

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:14.800
that he has to make about where
he feels he can make the best

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.240
contribution.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.690
So I feel like our jobs,
not only as students taking

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:22.060
this course and as
stakeholders in the future

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.540
of a civil society,
as civil as it can be,

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:28.570
is to really consider whether
the bulk of our impact

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:31.990
in the world is going to be
in an arena like politics

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.720
or if we are better off
delegating that to someone else

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.870
and providing our
opinion to other people.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:41.890
Because it could be that in the
coming years, as he reflects

01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:44.740
on his tenure as Secretary
of Energy, he thinks,

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.140
well, I feel like I made
a measurable impact,

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.120
but it was for naught,
because of the ways

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.370
in which this next
administration is

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:53.710
going to dissolve a
lot of the efforts

01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:56.590
that he was able to create.

01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:59.340
So I think it'll be
interesting to hear

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:02.070
him give personal
feedback and maybe

01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:05.110
more intimate conversations
with students like ourselves.

01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:07.690
And if you do,
please let me know,

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.800
because I guess I would
hate for him personally

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.410
to feel like he gave
up so much of his life

01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:18.630
and his productive potential to
something that is going to get

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:20.380
destroyed ultimately.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:23.220
MAX: I was actually, like,
when you mentioned him,

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:24.720
I kind of started thinking--

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.865
I hadn't researched Compton
before outside of scattering,

01:15:28.865 --> 01:15:30.240
for anyone who
doesn't know, it's

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.690
like when photons will scatter
off of electrons and atoms.

01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:34.710
Does anyone know this?

01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:36.780
I don't know.

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.860
So I didn't realize
before this class

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.610
that he was actually
the president of MIT.

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:43.710
So it makes me think
that I don't really--

01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:48.137
at that point, I have
a parallel point--

01:15:48.137 --> 01:15:50.137
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
this guy is his brother.

01:15:50.137 --> 01:15:51.810
MAX: I wonder-- wow,
I didn't realize--

01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:53.220
I didn't even know
he had a brother.

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.410
There's so much about
him I don't know.

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:56.577
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: He was
another famous physicist.

01:15:56.577 --> 01:15:58.660
One of the all-time
great MIT presidents.

01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:00.270
MAX: And it makes--

01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:03.085
apparently, he was a really
good president, so that's good.

01:16:03.085 --> 01:16:04.710
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
He's credited, Max,

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:06.510
with bringing great
science to MIT.

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:07.440
MAX: OK.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.350
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So MIT had
always had very good science,

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:13.710
but Compton really
embarks on an effort

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:19.680
to both train and find
truly fabulous science.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.550
So MIT is positioned, frankly,
in that 1930s period when

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:26.340
he's president, to
be this unbelievably

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.520
capable institution with
these two sides of the story,

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.710
engineering and science,
kind of unified here.

01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:33.630
MAX: So, Stephanie,
I would bring up

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:36.750
that as almost a
counter to your point,

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:40.140
saying that maybe it depends
on the time period, not really

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:43.440
the person, because I'm sure
that Moniz is really awesome.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.330
I'm sure that he's
very articulate,

01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:49.080
and he is certainly very
convincing in his positions.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.100
But it probably just
depends on the timing.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.580
So when people try to
advance whatever agenda

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.670
that they believe is best
for society as a whole.

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:04.950
So with Compton, I feel that
he had a lot of advantages

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:08.700
at the time period, like, oh,
the United States at the time

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:11.700
realized that we needed science
in addition to our development

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.080
capabilities.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.580
So it definitely made
it a lot easier to--

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.920
there was a gap that
he recognized, that he

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.380
knew that could be filled.

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:28.030
STEPH: I'm trying to think of
a statistic about how to get

01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:29.680
a woman to run for office.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.780
I think it takes
something like eight times

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.460
to tell a woman
to run for office,

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.440
and she'll finally
begin considering it

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.450
in any sort of serious capacity.

01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:40.330
And when you ask a man, it has
to be maybe one or two times

01:17:40.330 --> 01:17:42.760
before they seriously
consider it.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.870
And I wonder what it would
look like for scientists.

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:48.550
To what extent do
you have to cultivate

01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:54.320
this paradigm of evaluating
the impact of your work

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.660
and weighing that against the
impact of your perspective and

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.805
how that can make a
difference in the world?

01:18:00.805 --> 01:18:02.680
So I'm going to be quiet
now, because Rasheed

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.490
seems to have a point.

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:04.073
RASHEED: Yeah.

01:18:04.073 --> 01:18:06.280
I'm going to argue
for form here.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.130
So I think these guys are
all sitting around the room.

01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:10.870
I don't know how
often this happens.

01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:12.640
This might happen like totally
independent of the war.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.200
These guys just get together
just because they're

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.700
so interconnected anyway.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:20.740
But the point is, I think
there's an argument here

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.530
that all it really
takes is you just

01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:26.530
have to get six or seven of
these people of this caliber

01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:28.480
in a room, and
they'll naturally come

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.117
to the conclusion or
the idea that we need--

01:18:33.117 --> 01:18:35.700
they'll sort of come up with a
solution for a federally funded

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.350
research institution.

01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.060
And what's really
nice here, I think,

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:43.080
is Karl Compton is president
of MIT and then it's Bush.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.482
Is there a president
between them?

01:18:45.482 --> 01:18:46.440
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: No.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.520
Bush is not president.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:51.480
So Bush is Dean of Engineering
and then Vice President MIT.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.450
And then he goes off to
the Carnegie Institute,

01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:58.650
which is then a leading
scientific funding organization

01:18:58.650 --> 01:18:59.520
based in Washington.

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.770
And he becomes Franklin
Roosevelt's science advisor

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:03.490
member during the war.

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:05.880
So he has a rich past at
MIT as a faculty member.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.820
We'll talk about it in a minute.

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:11.450
RASHEED: But I think because
they're both sort of at MIT

01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:12.960
and sort of
interconnected anyway,

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:17.370
you have an opportunity
to kind of transform

01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:20.610
MIT from this great scientific
institution under Karl Compton

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:23.610
to sort of this federally funded
research institution, which

01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:29.100
largely was an idea of
Bush and like a proponent.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.610
I guess they sort of around the
table came up with the idea,

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:33.330
but Bush writes
this paper about it.

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:36.120
And then they kind of
do it under the Rad Lab

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:36.820
and everything.

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:39.780
So I think there's an argument
here that all you really need

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:43.760
is sort of seven
people, six or--

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.440
I'm going to say a small
group of people who have

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:53.440
the connections and sort of
ability to make transformations

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.050
with connections with
large research endowments,

01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:59.880
the top facilities,
the top minds,

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.890
and then have access to just
the kind of drop-of-a-hat call,

01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:08.040
70 scientists, and they'll all
sort of show up the next day

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.040
in a room and then say that this
is the direction we're going

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.240
to chart.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.620
And so I'd probably argue
that, in addition to timing,

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.230
kind of access to
human capital and form

01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:20.940
probably allows these
people to just make

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:25.440
decisions and kind of chart,
really, kind of drastically

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.600
new directions for
large institutions

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.300
or large universities and even
like the future of science

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:34.710
and technology funding in the US
and kind of make this model up.

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:37.350
Because it didn't really exist
before they got there, but just

01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:39.180
get seven of them in
a room, and now you

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:41.580
have the Rad Lab
kind of in two weeks.

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:45.940
And then a day later, you
have funding from Stimson.

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.690
So I think maybe if we're
looking in the future

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:51.330
to do this, a group of these
people of this magnitude

01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:54.210
or caliber could meet together
semi-regularly and come up

01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:55.590
with ideas for how to do that.

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:59.077
And then maybe they don't
necessarily every single time

01:20:59.077 --> 01:21:00.660
have to do something,
because it's not

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:03.420
as imminent as like Manhattan
Project or the Rad Lab,

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.450
but they probably have
some pretty good ideas

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:07.617
on how to reorganize things.

01:21:07.617 --> 01:21:08.992
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So we'll dive

01:21:08.992 --> 01:21:10.530
into a lot of this
thinking when we

01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:11.928
talk about great group theory.

01:21:11.928 --> 01:21:14.220
So Martina, I'm going to ask
you to hold your question.

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.970
I want to wrap up Loomis,
take a quick break,

01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:19.860
and then we'll come back.

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:22.560
Let me just close
out with Loomis.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.750
What happens after the war?

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:27.000
He's created these
amazing institutions.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.280
He's played an
absolutely critical role

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.590
in both getting
the Rad Lab created

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:35.600
and in getting Los Alamos and
then the Manhattan projects

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.290
accelerated.

01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:37.155
It's quite a story.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.270
We just talked
about the ideology.

01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:43.890
He's an adherent
of conservatism.

01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:49.320
He doesn't believe in a strong
federal-dominating kind of role

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:53.680
in R&D. So he and
Vannevar Bush literally,

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.510
as soon as the war ends,
dismantle the Rad Lab.

01:21:57.510 --> 01:22:02.040
So MIT is left with this
weird wooden building.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.705
And a fair amount of
that is Building 20.

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:15.940
Loomis divorces
his wife, marries

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:21.760
the wife of his research
director for Tuxedo Park.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:26.950
They live in a Mies van
der Rohe-like glass house

01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:30.250
on the site of Tuxedo Park.

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:33.010
Loomis also happens
to own Hilton Head.

01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:36.520
So they spent a nice
time down there.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.740
He just quietly fades.

01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:42.850
He kind of quietly, kind of
after this amazing activist

01:22:42.850 --> 01:22:47.343
role, and he faces a certain
amount of social ostracism

01:22:47.343 --> 01:22:48.760
because of this
divorce, which was

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.020
considered pretty scandalous in
that era, and it affects him.

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.100
So he kind of
withdraws from society

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.580
in some interesting
kind of ways.

01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:01.570
But he kind of
does this fade out

01:23:01.570 --> 01:23:06.880
in places like his Mies
van der Rohe glass house

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.800
and on Hilton head.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.660
And the Rad Lab itself, Building
20, becomes very famous at MIT,

01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:17.080
as those of you engineers
will understand this,

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.430
but this is anything-goes space.

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:25.000
And it's an engineering dream.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.070
When the returning vets
come back World War II,

01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:29.930
this is thrown into a dormitory.

01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:33.190
A lot of returning vets
had learned gun play

01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:34.510
during the course of the war.

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:37.750
There's an old shooting
gallery in the basement.

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:40.820
The stories are wild.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:44.920
It was made from Hurricane
of 1936 wood that

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:48.310
crashed all over New Hampshire,
and they just trucked it down.

01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:51.670
This lasts for another more
than a half century at MIT.

01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:54.010
And it's like the
wide-open experiment.

01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:55.780
You can blow the
place up, anything

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:58.630
goes kind of space, which
is great in science.

01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:00.862
I mean, you really want
some of that space where

01:24:00.862 --> 01:24:02.320
you can do anything
and don't worry

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.350
about blowing the building
up and knocking it down.

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:08.140
So it becomes this great
creative center at MIT,

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:13.150
and lots of stuff happens there,
not quite related to science,

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:15.760
but Noam Chomsky
invents the whole field

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.364
of linguistics in Building 20.

01:24:17.364 --> 01:24:18.406
AUDIENCE: Does he really?

01:24:18.406 --> 01:24:18.904
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Huh?

01:24:18.904 --> 01:24:19.900
AUDIENCE: Does he really?

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:20.170
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:20.590
Really.

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:21.090
It's true.

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:22.120
In this building.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.350
So it's wild wide-open space.

01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:26.275
So when Frank
Gehry is brought in

01:24:26.275 --> 01:24:30.500
to tear this down and put the
Stata Center in its place,

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:36.220
he tries to preserve some of
that funky wide-open cement

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:41.180
open space culture to sponsor
its experimentalist feeling,

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:45.070
which I think he actually
does fairly successfully.

01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:49.912
And indeed, in those wild CSAIL
laboratories behind glass,

01:24:49.912 --> 01:24:51.370
pretty much anything
goes up there.

01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:54.540
It's a pretty interesting space.

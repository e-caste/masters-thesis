00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.860
PROFESSOR: Last time we
spoke about the Stern-Gerlach

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.840
experiment, and how you
could have a sequence

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.800
of Stern-Gerlach boxes that
allow you to understand

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.050
the type of states and
properties of the physics

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.750
having to do with spin-1/2.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.740
So the key thing in the
Stern-Gerlach machine

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.130
was that a beam of silver
atoms, each of which

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.880
is really like an electron
with a magnetic moment,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.870
was placed in an inhomogeneous
strong magnetic field,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.820
and that would classically mean
that you would get a deflection

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.750
proportional to the z-component
of the magnetic moment.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.100
What was a surprise
was that by the time

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.670
you put the screen
on the right side,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.430
it really split into
two different beams,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.260
as if the magnetic
moments could either

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.110
be all the way pointing in
the z-direction or all the way

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.910
down, pointing opposite
to the z-direction,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.660
and nothing in between.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.190
A very surprising result.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.590
So after looking at
a few of those boxes,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.680
we decided that we would try
to model the spin-1/2 particle

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.880
as a two-dimensional
complex vector space.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.090
What is the two-dimensional
complex vector space?

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.980
It's the possible space of
states of a spin-1/2 particle.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.980
So our task today to go
into detail into that,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.460
and set up the whole
machinery of spin-1/2.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.300
So we will do so, even though
we haven't quite yet discussed

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.090
all the important
concepts of linear algebra

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.800
that we're going to need.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.000
So today, I'm going to
assume that at least you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.050
have some vague notions
of linear algebra

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.740
reasonably well understood.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.340
And if you don't, well,
take them on faith today.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.150
We're going to go
through them slowly

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.650
in the next couple
of lectures, and then

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.870
as you will reread
this material,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.410
it will make more sense.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.140
So what did we have?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.300
We said that the spin states,
or the possible states

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.860
of this silver atom, that really
correspond to an election,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:25.340
could be described by states z
comma plus and z colon minus So

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.950
these are the two states.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.620
This state we say corresponds
to an angular momentum Sz hat.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.460
Sz-- I can put it like
that-- of h-bar over 2,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:50.000
and this corresponds to Sz
equals minus h-bar over 2.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.100
And those are our two states.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.290
The z label indicates that
we've passed, presumably,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.150
these atoms through a
filter in the z-direction,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.380
so that we know
for certain we're

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.410
talking about the z-component of
angular momentum of this state.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.540
It is positive, and
the values here again

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.250
have the label z to remind us
that we're talking about states

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.660
that have been organized using
the z-component of angular

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.160
momentum.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.160
You could ask whether this state
has some angular momentum--

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.700
spin angular momentum--
in the x-direction

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.540
or in the y-direction,
and we will

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.530
be able to answer that
question in an hour from now.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.960
So mathematically, we say
that this statement, that

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.730
this state, has Sz
equals h-bar over 2

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:10.240
means that there is an operator,
Sz hat-- hat for operators.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:21.230
And this operator, we
say, acts on this state

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.990
to give h-bar over
2 times this state.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.660
So when we have a measurement
in quantum mechanics,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.190
we end up talking
about operators.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.880
So this case is no exception.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.330
We think of the operator,
Sz, that acts in this state

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.390
and gives h-bar over 2.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:53.870
And that same operator,
Sz, acts on the other state

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.960
and gives you minus h-bar
over 2 times the state.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.020
You see, an operator on a
state must give a state.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.470
So in this equation, we
have a state on the right,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.890
and the nice thing is
that the same state

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.640
appears on the right.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.220
When that happens,
you say that the state

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.140
is an eigenstate
of the operator.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.250
And, therefore, the
states z plus, minus

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.620
are eigenstates of the
operator Sz with eigenvalues--

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:36.470
the number that appears here--
equal to plus, minus h over 2.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.770
So the relevant
physical assumption

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.330
here is the following, that
these two states, in a sense,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.790
suffice.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.660
Now, what does that mean?

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.300
We could do the experiment again
with some Stern-Gerlach machine

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.640
that is along the
x-axis, and say, oh,

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.030
now we've got states
x plus and x minus

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.520
and we should add them there.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.490
They are also part of the
possible states of the system.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.220
Kind of.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.400
They are parts of the
possible states of the system.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.850
They are possible
states of the system,

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.550
but we shouldn't add
them to this one.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.570
These will be thought
as basis states.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.350
Just like any vector
is the superposition

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.840
of a number times
the x-unit vector

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.890
plus a number times
the y-unit vector

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.410
and a number times
the z-unit vector,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.460
we are going to
postulate, or try

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.420
to construct the theory
of spin, based on the idea

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.730
that all possible spin
states of an electron

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.140
are obtained by suitable linear
superposition of these two

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.200
vectors.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.760
So, , in fact, what we're
going to say is that these two

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.900
vectors are the basis of a
two-dimensional vector space,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.890
such that every possible state
is a linear superposition.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:23.400
So psi, being any
possible spin state,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:35.725
can be written as some constant,
C1 times z plus plus C2 times z

00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:43.940
minus where these
constants, C1 and C2 belong

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.210
to the complex numbers.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.690
And by this, we mean that
if any possible state is

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:57.160
a superposition like that,
the set of all possible states

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:03.670
are the general vectors in a
two-dimensional complex vector

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.620
space.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:11.650
Complex vector space, because
the coefficients are complex,

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:17.220
and two-dimensional, because
there's two basis vectors.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.770
Now this doesn't quite
look like a vector.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.190
It looks like those
things called kets.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.830
But kets are really
vectors, and we're

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.160
going to make the
correspondence very clear.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.680
So this can be called
the first basis

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:44.560
state and the
second basis state.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.910
And I want you to realize
that the fact that we're

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.830
talking about the complex
vector space really

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.530
means these coefficients
are complex.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:07.080
There's no claim that the
vector is complex in any sense,

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.300
or this one.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.030
They're just vectors.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.950
This is a vector, and
it's not that we say,

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.971
oh this vector is complex.

00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:16.470
No.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.170
A complex vector space, we
think of as a set of vectors,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.540
and then we're allowed
to multiply them

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.715
by complex numbers.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:38.840
OK, so we have this, and this
way of thinking of the vectors

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.730
is quite all right.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.230
But we want to be more concrete.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.200
For that, we're
going to use what

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.800
is called a representation.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.270
So I will use the
word representation

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:58.010
to mean some way of
exhibiting a vector

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.050
or state in a more concrete way.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:07.160
As something that any one
of us would call a vector.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:14.080
So as a matter of notation,
this being the first basis state

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.230
is sometimes written
as a ket with a 1.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.370
Like that.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.700
And this being this
second basis state

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.720
is sometimes written this way.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.340
But here is the
real issue of what

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.890
we were calling
a representation.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.580
If this is a two-dimensional
vector space,

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.820
you're accustomed to
three-dimensional vector space.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.040
What are vectors?

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.380
They're triplets of numbers.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.330
Three numbers.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.110
That's a vector.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.600
Column vectors, it's perhaps
easier to think about them.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.990
So column vectors.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.570
So here's what
we're going to say.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.790
We have this state z plus.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.720
It's also called 1.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.000
It's just a name,
but we're going

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.200
to represent it as
a column vector.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.060
And as a column
vector, I'm going

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.750
to represent it as the
column vector 1, 0.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
And this is why I put
this double arrow.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.540
I'm not saying it's
the same thing--

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.830
although the really
it is-- it's just

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:37.220
a way of thinking about it as
some vector in what we would

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.080
call canonically a vector space.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.018
Yes

00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:42.208
AUDIENCE: So do the components
of the column vector

00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:45.940
there have any
correspondence to the actual.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.750
Does it have any basis in the
actual physical process going

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.250
on?

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.780
Or, what is their connection to
the actual physical [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.860
represented here?

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.040
PROFESSOR: Well, we'll
see it in a second.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.240
It will become a little clearer.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.740
But this is like saying, I have
a two-dimensional two0 vector

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.770
space, so I'm going to think of
the first state as this vector.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.490
But how do I write this vector?

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.110
Well, it's the vector ex.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.260
Well, if I would write
them in components,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.310
I would say, for a vector, I can
put two numbers here, a and b.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.120
And this is the a-component
and b-component.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:28.085
So here it is, ex would be 1, 0.

00:13:28.085 --> 00:13:33.740
And ey would be 0, 1.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.837
If I have this notation
then the point a,

00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:41.500
b is represented by a
and b as a column vector.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.580
So at this moment,
it's just a way

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.370
of associating a vector in
the two-dimensional canonical

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.320
vector space.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.770
It's just the column here.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.520
So the other state,
minus-- it's also

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.470
called 2-- will be
represented by 0 1 1.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:12.840
1 And therefore,
this state, psi,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:22.480
which is C1 z plus
plus C2 z minus

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:31.870
will be represented as C1 times
the first vector plus C2 times

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.800
the second vector.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.220
Or multiplying, in C1, C2.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:49.890
So this state can be written
as a linear superposition

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.590
of these two basis
vectors in this way--

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.720
you can write it this way.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.500
You want to save
some writing, then

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.010
you can write them with 1 and 2.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.432
But as a vector, it's
represented by a column vector

00:15:04.432 --> 00:15:05.265
with two components.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.865
That's our state.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.650
Now in doing this,
I want to emphasize,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.090
we're introducing the
physical assumption

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.720
that this will be enough to
describe all possible spin

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.020
states, which is far from
obvious at this stage.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.230
Nevertheless, let's
use some of the ideas

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.020
from the experiment, the
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:44.590
We did one example of a box
that filtered the plus z states,

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.160
and then put it against
another z machine,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.470
and then all the states
went through the up.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:57.050
Which is to say that plus
states have no amplitude,

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.980
no probability to be
in the minus states.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.980
They all went through the plus.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.150
So when we're going to introduce
now the physical translation

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.620
of this fact, as saying
that these states are

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.890
orthogonal to each other.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:19.950
So, this will require the
whole framework, in detail,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.310
of bras and kets to
say really, precisely--

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.910
but we're going to do
that now and explain

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.580
the minimum necessary
for you to understand it.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.840
But we'll come back to it later.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.320
So this physical
statement will be

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.250
stated as z minus with z plus.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:48.870
The overlap, the
bra-ket of this, is 0.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:53.460
The fact that all particles
went through and went out

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:59.610
through the plus output
will state to us, well,

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.200
these states are
well normalized.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:11.819
So z plus, z plus is 1

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.150
Similarly, you could have
blocked the other input,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.965
and you would have
concluded that the minus

00:17:16.965 --> 00:17:19.240
state is orthogonal to the plus.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.839
So we also say that these,
too, are orthogonal,

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:29.020
and the minus states
are well normalized.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.870
Now here we had to
write four equations.

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:45.460
And the notation, one
and two becomes handy,

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.620
because we can summarize
all these statements

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:56.840
by the equation Ij
equals delta Ij.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:04.730
Look, if this equation
is 2 with 1 equals 0.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.240
The bra 2, the ket 1.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.220
This is 1 with 1 is equal to 1.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:22.020
Here is is 1 with 2 is equal to
0, and 2 with 2 is equal to 1.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.850
So this is exactly
what we have here.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.340
Now, I didn't define for
you these so-called bras.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.790
So by completeness, I
will define them now.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:47.120
And the way I will define
them is as follows.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:56.390
I will say that while for
the one vector basis state

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:04.460
you associate at 1, 0, you will
associate to one bra, the row

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.030
vector 1, 0.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.590
I sometimes tend to
write equal, but-- equal

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.760
is all right-- but
it's a little clearer

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.470
to say that there's arrows here.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:24.440
So we're going to associate to
1, 1, 0-- we did it before--

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.260
but now to the bra, we
think of the rho vector.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.500
Like this.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.220
Similarly, I can
do the same with 2.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.670
2 was the vector 0, 1.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.050
It's a column vector,
so 2 was a bra.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:47.960
We will think of it as
the row vector 0, 1.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:08.080
We're going to do this now
a little more generally.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.990
So, suppose you
have state, alpha,

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:19.810
which is alpha 1,
1 plus alpha 2, 2.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:26.100
Well, to this, you would
associate the column vector

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.500
alpha 1, alpha 2.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:37.640
Suppose you have a beta state,
beta 1, 1 plus beta 2, 2.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.360
You would associate beta 1,
beta 2 as their representations.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.440
Now here comes the
definition for which

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.630
this is just a special case.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.790
And it's a definition
of the general bra.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:11.050
So the general bra here, alpha,
is defined to be alpha 1*,

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:19.770
bra of the first, plus
alpha 2*, bra of the second.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:26.710
So this is alpha 1*
times the first bra,

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:35.400
which we think of it as 1, 0,
plus alpha 2* times the second

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.190
bra, which is 0, 1.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.410
So this whole thing is
represented by alpha 1*,

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.890
alpha 2*.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:22:02.200
So, here we've had a column
vector representation

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.320
of a state, and the bra is
the row vector representation

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.120
of the state in which
this is constructed

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.670
with complex conjugation.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:19.740
Now these kind of
definitions will

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.410
be discussed in more detail
and more axiomatically

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.800
early very soon, so that
you see where you're going.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.860
But the intuition that
you're going to get from this

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.640
is quite valuable.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.286
So what is the bra-ket?

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.090
Alpha-beta is the
so-called bra-ket.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.130
And this is a number.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.280
And the reason for
complex conjugation

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.250
is, ultimately, that when
these two things are the same,

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.270
it should give a
positive number.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.880
It's like the length squared.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.230
So that's the reason for
complex conjugation, eventually.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:04.720
But, for now, you are supposed
to get a number from here.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.160
And the a reasonable way
to get a number, which

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.620
is a definition, is
that you get a number

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.090
by a matrix multiplication
of the representatives.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:22.800
So you take the representative
of alpha, which is alpha 1*,

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.140
alpha 2*.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.480
And do the matrix product
with the representative

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.970
of beta, which is
beta 1, beta 2.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:41.480
And that's alpha 1*, beta
1 plus alpha 2*, beta 2.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.670
And that's the number
called the inner product,

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.760
or bra-ket product.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:55.300
And this is the true meaning
of relations of this kind.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.670
If you're given an
arbitrary states,

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.180
you compute the inner
product this way.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:08.280
And vectors that satisfy
this are called orthonormal

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.770
because they're orthogonal
and normal with respect

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.490
to each other in the
sense of the bra and ket.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:31.060
So this definition,
as you can see,

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.970
is also consistent with
what you have up there,

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.020
and you can check it.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:43.380
If you take I with j, 1,
say, with 2-- like this--

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.290
you do the inner
product, and you get 0.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:50.270
And similarly for
all the other states.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:57.980
So let's then complete the
issue of representations.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.600
We had representations
of the states

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.560
as column vectors-- two by two
column vectors or row vectors.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:11.370
Now let's talk about this
operator we started with.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:16.220
If this is an operator,
acting on states,

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.330
now I want to think of
its representation, which

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.310
would be the way it acts on
these two component vectors.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:28.700
So it must be a two by two
matrix, because only a two

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:34.510
by two matrix acts naturally
on two component vectors.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.970
So here is the
claim that we have.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:46.920
Claim, that Sz hat
is represented--

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.973
but we'll just put
equal-- by this matrix.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.790
You see, it was an operator.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.790
We never talked about matrices.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:10.570
But once we start talking about
the basis vectors as column

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.810
vectors, then you can
ask if this is correct.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.470
So for example, I'm
supposed to find

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.980
that Sz hat acting
on this state 1

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.270
is supposed to be h-bar
over 2 times the state 1.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:28.850
You see?

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.220
True.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:35.060
Then you say, oh let's put the
representation, h-bar over 2,

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.280
1 minus 1, 0, 0.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.980
State one, what's
its representation?

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.510
1, 0.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.520
OK, let's act on it.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.150
So, this gives me h-bar over 2.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.850
I do the first
product, I get a 1.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:56.220
I do the second
product, I get a 0.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.970
Oh, that seems
right, because this

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:03.090
is h over 2 times the
representation of the state 1.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:12.470
And if I check this,
and as well that Sz on 2

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:18.740
is equal minus h-bar over 2, 2--
which can also be checked-- I

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.070
need to check no more.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.320
Because it suffices
that this operator does

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.020
what it's supposed to
do of the basis vectors.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.690
And it will do
what it's supposed

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.260
to do on arbitrary vectors.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.470
So we're done.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:40.460
This is the operator
Sx, and we seem

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.390
to have put together a lot of
the ideas of the experiment

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.910
into a mathematical framework.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:54.040
But we're not through because
we have this question,

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.380
so what if you align and
operate the machine along x?

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.055
What are the possible spin
states along the x-direction?

00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:03.930
How do you know that
all that the spins state

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:09.370
that points along x can be
described in this vector space?

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:13.770
How do I know there
exists a number C1, C2 so

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.130
that this linear
combination is a spin

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.130
state that points along x.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:28.430
Well, at this moment, you
really have to invent something.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:35.020
And the process of invention
is never a very linear one.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.780
You use analogies--
you use whatever

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.950
you can-- to invent
what you need.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.940
So, given that
that's a possibility,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.520
we could follow what Feynman
does in his Feynman lectures,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.900
of discussing how
to begin rotating

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.080
Stern-Gerlach machines, and
doing all kinds of things.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:02.040
It's an interesting argument,
and it's a little hard

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.240
to follow, a little
tedious at points.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.940
And we're going to
follow a different route.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.540
I'm going to assume that you
remember a little about angular

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.670
momentum, and I think you
do remember this much.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.193
I want to say, well, this
is spin angular momentum.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.780
Well, let's compare it with
orbital angular momentum,

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.130
and see where we are.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:37.260
You see, another way of asking
the question would be, well,

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.970
what are the
operators Sx and Sy.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.180
Where do I get them?

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:48.190
Well, the reason I want to
bring in the angular momentum

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:54.330
is because there you have Lz,
but you also have Lx and Ly.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:59.590
So angular momentum had
Lz, just like we had here,

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:07.905
but also Lx and Ly.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.920
Now these spin things look a
lot more mysterious, a lot more

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:27.650
basic, because, like Lz,
it was xpy minus ypx.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:32.513
So you knew how this operator
acts on wave functions.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.620
You know, it multiplies by
y, takes an x derivative,

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.460
or it's a dd phi.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:48.130
It has a nice thing, but Sz on
the other hand, there's no x,

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.470
there's no derivatives.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.810
It's a different space.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.840
It's working in a
totally different space,

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.270
in the space of a
two-dimensional complex vector

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.170
space of column vectors
with two numbers.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.860
That's where it acts.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.900
I'm sorry there's no dd x,
nothing familiar about it.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.920
But that's what we
have been handed.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.910
So this thing acts
on wave functions,

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.400
and thus natural things.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.410
Well, the other one
acts on column vectors.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.160
Two-by-two-- two
component column vectors,

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.860
and that's all right.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.540
But we also know
that Lz is Hermitian.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.550
And that was good,
because it actually

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.950
meant that this is
good observable.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.310
You can measure it.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.340
Is Sz Hermitian?

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.170
Well, yes it is.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.460
Hermeticity of a matrix--
as we'll discuss it

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.310
in a lot of detail, maybe
more than you want--

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.760
means you can transpose
it complex conjugated,

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.380
and you get the same matrix.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.430
Well that matrix is Hermitian.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.920
So that's nice.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.260
That maybe is important.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.740
So what other
operators do we have?

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.910
Lx and Ly.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:18.550
And if we think of Lx as
L1, Ly as L2, and Lz as L3,

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.740
you had a basic
computation relation.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:33.530
Li with Lj was equal to i
epsilon ijk Lk-hat-- oops

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:34.030
i-hbar.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:41.780
And this was called the
algebra of angular momentum.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:46.350
These three operators
satisfy these identities.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:53.170
i and j are here, k is supposed
to be summed over-- repeated

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.690
in this is our sum
from 1, 2, and 3.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:01.250
And epsilon ijk is totally
anti-symmetric with epsilon 1,

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:05.270
2, 3 equal to plus 1.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:09.180
You may or may not
know this epsilon.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.870
You will get some practice
on that very soon.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.410
Now for all intents
and purposes,

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.200
we might as well write
the explicit formulas

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.880
between Lx, Ly equal i-hbar Lz.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:32.700
Ly Lz equals i-hbar Lx.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:42.765
And Lz Lx-- there are hats
all over-- equal i-hbar Ly.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.970
So we had this for
orbital angular momentum,

00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:00.630
or for angular
momentum in general.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.420
So what we're going
to do now is we're

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:16.790
going to try to figure out
what are Sx and Sy by trying

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.550
to find a complete analogy.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:24.570
We're going to declare that S
is going to be angular momentum.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:36.900
So we're going to want that
Sx with Sy will be i-hbar Sz.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.900
Sy with Sz will be i-hbar Sx.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:52.775
And finally, Sz with
Sx is i-hbar Sy.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:35:01.820
And we're going to try that
these things be Hermitian.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.700
Sx and Sy.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:11.240
So let me break for a second
and ask if there are questions.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.650
We're aiming to
complete the theory

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:21.460
by taking S to be angular
momentum, and see what we get.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.650
Can we invent
operators Sx and Sy

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.160
that will do the right thing?

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.654
Yes.

00:35:27.654 --> 00:35:30.546
AUDIENCE: What's the
name for the epsilon ijk?

00:35:30.546 --> 00:35:34.570
I know there's a special
name for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.836
PROFESSOR: What's the name?

00:35:35.836 --> 00:35:38.316
AUDIENCE: There's a
[INAUDIBLE] tensor.

00:35:38.316 --> 00:35:40.280
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.655
Let [INAUDIBLE]
to be the tensor.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.145
It can be used for
cross products.

00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:48.790
It's very useful
for cross products.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:51.600
It's a really useful tensor.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.030
Other questions.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.060
More questions about
what we're going

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.230
to try to do, or this so far.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.060
Yes.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.590
AUDIENCE: When you use
the term representation,

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.884
is that like the technical
mathematical term

00:36:07.884 --> 00:36:10.046
of representation,
like in algebra?

00:36:10.046 --> 00:36:10.670
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:15.210
It's representation of
operators in vector spaces.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:19.900
So we've used the
canonical vector space

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:25.800
with column vectors represented
by entries one and numbers.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.730
And then the operators
become matrices,

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:32.980
so whenever an operator
is viewed as a matrix,

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.845
we think of it as
a representation.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:38.760
Other questions.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.966
Yes.

00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:41.830
AUDIENCE: Will we
talk about later

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:46.020
why we can make an
analogy between L and S?

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.450
Or is it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:57.990
PROFESSOR: Well you see, this
is a very strong analogy,

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.800
but there will be
big differences

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.930
from orbital angular momentum
and spin angular momentum.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:07.990
And basically having
to do with the fact

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.400
that the eigenvalues
of these operators

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.320
are plus minus h-bar over 2.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.040
And in the orbital
case they tend

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.460
to be plus minus
integer values of h-bar.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:24.535
So this is a very deep
statement about the algebra

00:37:24.535 --> 00:37:28.840
of these operators that still
allows the physics of them

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.700
to be quite different.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:34.820
But this is probably the only
algebra that makes sense.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.160
It's angular momentum.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.280
So we're going to try to
develop that algebra like that,

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.040
as well here.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.180
You could take it
to be an assumption.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.280
And as I said, an experiment
doesn't tell you the unique way

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.820
to invent the mathematics.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.540
You try to invent the
consistent mathematics

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.530
and see if it coincides
with the experiment.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:03.720
And this is a very natural
thing to try to invent

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.960
So what are we facing?

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.340
We're facing a slightly
nontrivial problem

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.010
of figuring out these operators.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.250
And they should be Hermitian.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.880
So let's try to think of
Hermitian two-by-two matrices.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:34.620
So here is a Hermitian
two-by-two matrix.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.850
I can put an arbitrary
constant here because it

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:43.580
should be invariant on
their transposition, which

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.170
doesn't change this diagonal
value in complex conjugation.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.980
So c should be real.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.335
d should be real.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.050
For the matrix to be
Hermitian, two-by-two matrix,

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:04.300
I could put an a here.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:09.500
And then this a would have
to appear here as well.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:15.440
I can put minus ib, and then
I would have plus ib here.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:20.310
So when I transpose a complex
conjugate, I get this one.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:30.180
So this matrix with abc
and d real is Hermitian.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.860
Hermiticity is some sort
of reality condition.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:47.940
Now, for convenience, I
would put a 2c and a 2d here.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.340
It doesn't change
things too much.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.780
Now to look at what
we're talking about.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.673
We're talking about this
set of Hermitian matrices.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:10.210
Funnily, you can think of
that again as a vector space.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.350
Why a vector space?

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.310
Well, we'll think about
it, and in a few seconds,

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.500
it will become clear.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.830
But let me just try
to do something here

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:22.450
that might help us.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.640
We're trying to identify
Sx and Sy from here

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.280
so that this commutation
relations hold.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.840
Well, if Sx and Sy have anything
to do with the identity matrix,

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.510
they would commute
with everything

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:45.050
and would do nothing for you.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:50.070
So, I will remove from
this matrices then trying

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:54.300
to understand something having
to do with the identity.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.670
So I'll remove a
Hermitian matrix,

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:03.960
which is c plus d
times the identity--

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.500
the two-by-two identity matrix.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.080
This is a Hermitian
matrix, as well.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.670
And I can remove it, and then
this matrix is still Hermitian,

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:19.760
and this piece that I've removed
doesn't change commutators

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.410
as they appear on
the left hand side.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:25.390
So if you have an
Sx and an xy here,

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.110
and you're trying
to do a computation,

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.510
it would not contribute,
so you might as well just

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.570
get rid of them.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.460
So if we remove
this, we are left

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.250
with-- you're subtracting
c plus d from the diagonal.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.920
So here you'll have c minus d.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:54.520
Here you'll get b minus c,
a minus ib, and a plus ib.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.810
And we should keep searching for
Sx and Sy among these matrices.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:08.690
But then you say,
look, I already got Sz,

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.300
and that was Hermitian.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.380
And Sz was Hermitian,
and it had a number,

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.920
and the opposite number on
the other diagonal entry.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:27.380
If Sx and Sy have a little
bit of Sz, I don't care.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.930
I don't want these to
be independent matrices.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.740
I don't want to
confuse the situation.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.980
So if this thing has something
along Sz, I want it out.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:45.400
So since precisely this number
is opposite to this one,

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:50.270
I can add to this matrix
some multiple of Sz

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.890
and kill these things
in the diagonal.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:06.760
So add the multiple
and Sz multiple,

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.140
and we finally get this matrix.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:17.240
0, a minus ib, a plus ib, and 0.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.680
So we've made quite
some progress.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.450
Let's see now what we have.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:45.870
Well, that matrix could be
written as a times 0, 1, 1,

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:54.050
0 plus b times 0, minus i, i, 0.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.780
Which is to say that it's
this Hermitian matrix

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.640
times a real number, and
this Hermitian matrix

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.140
times a real number.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:14.060
And that makes sense because
if you take a Hermitian matrix

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:18.610
and multiply by a real number,
the matrix is still Hermitian.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.560
So this is still Hermitian
because these are real.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.760
This is still Hermitian
because a is real,

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.520
and if you add Hermitian
matrices, it's still Hermitian.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:35.320
So in some sense, the set
of Hermitian matrices,

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:41.630
two-by-two Hermitian matrices,
is a real vector space

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:44.970
with four basis vectors.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:50.220
One basis vector is this,
another basis vector is this,

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:55.620
the third basis
vector is the Sz part,

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.399
and the fourth basis
vector is the identity

00:44:58.399 --> 00:44:59.190
that we subtracted.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:09.090
And I'm listing the
other two that we got rid

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.990
of because physically
we're not that interested

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:15.660
given that we want Sx and Sz.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.370
So, Sx and Sy.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:19.800
But here it is.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:24.280
These four two-by-two
matrices are

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.795
sort of the linearly
independent Hermitian matrices.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.060
You can think of them as
vectors, four basis vectors.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.380
You multiply by real numbers,
and now you add them,

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.030
and you got the most
general Hermitian matrix.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:48.870
So this is part of the subtlety
of this whole idea of vector

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.500
spaces of matrices,
which can be thought

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.920
of as vectors
sometimes, as well.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.880
So that's why these
matrices are quite famous.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:04.070
But before we just discuss
why they are so famous,

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.040
let's think of this.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.890
Where we're looking
for Sx and Sy,

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:12.950
and we actually seem to
have two matrices here

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:19.660
that could do the job, as
two independent Hermitian

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.830
two-by-two matrices.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:28.290
But we must add a little
extra information.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.390
We don't know what the scale is.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:36.270
Should I multiply this
by 5 and call that Sx?

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.830
Or this by 3?

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.240
We're missing a
little more physics.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.660
What is the physics?

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:49.240
The eigenvalues of Sx should
also be plus minus h over 2.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.240
And the eigenvalues of Sy should
also be plus minus h over 2.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.120
Just like for Sz.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.300
you could have started the
whole Stern-Gerlach things

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.810
thinking of x,
and you would have

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:04.020
obtained plus minus h over 2.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.110
So that is the
physical constraint.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.990
I have to figure
out those numbers.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:15.730
Maybe Sx is this one,
as y is this one.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.300
And you can say, oh,
you never told us

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.640
if you're going to get
the unique answer here.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.080
And yes, I did tell
you, and you're not

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.110
going to get a unique answer.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.820
There are some sign notations
and some other things,

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.020
but any answer is
perfectly good.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.054
So once you get an answer,
it's perfectly good.

00:47:35.054 --> 00:47:36.720
Of course, we're going
to get the answer

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.640
that everybody likes.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.520
And the convention is that
happily that everybody

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.920
uses this same convention.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.891
Questions.

00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:46.516
AUDIENCE: So I have
a related question,

00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:50.200
because at the beginning we
could have chosen the top right

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.880
entry to be a plus ib and the
bottom left to be a minus ib

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.980
and that would have yielded
a different basis matrix.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.206
PROFESSOR: Right, I would have
called this plus and minus.

00:48:00.206 --> 00:48:00.706
Yes.

00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:04.110
AUDIENCE: Are we going to show
that this is the correct form?

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.210
PROFESSOR: No, it's
not the correct form.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:11.110
It is a correct form, and it's
equivalent to any other form

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.540
you could find.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.360
That's what we can show.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.590
In fact, I will
show that there's

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.990
an obvious ambiguity here.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.080
Well, in fact, maybe I can
tell it do you, I think.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:36.260
If you let Sx go to minus
Sy, and Sy goes to plus Sx,

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.340
nothing changes in
these equations.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.870
They become the same equations.

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:44.350
You know, Sx would
become minus Sy,

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.940
and this Sx-- this
is not changed.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.870
But, in fact, if you
put minus Sy and Sx

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:53.330
as the same commutator
then this one

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:55.180
will become actually
this commutator,

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.700
and this one will become that.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.230
So I could change
whatever I get for Sx,

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:02.765
change it from minus
Sy, for example,

00:49:02.765 --> 00:49:05.240
and get the same thing.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.460
So there are many
changes you can do.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.770
The only thing we need
is one answer that works.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:13.520
And I'm going to write,
of course, the one

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.980
that everybody likes.

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.630
But don't worry about that.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:21.550
So let's think of eigenvectors
and eigenvalues now.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:24.850
I don't know how much
you remember that,

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:29.000
but we'll just take it at
this moment that you do.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.910
So 0, 1, 1, 0 has
two eigenvalues,

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:39.950
and lambda equals 1,
with eigenvector 1

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:42.265
over square root of 2, 1, 1.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.420
And a lambda equals minus
1 with eigenvector 1

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.075
over square root
of 2, 1, minus 1.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:17.000
The other one, it's
equally easy to do.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.970
We'll discuss eigenvectors
and eigenvalues later.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:30.490
Minus i, i, 0, 0, plus a
lambda equals one eigenvector,

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:36.000
with components 1 over
square root of 2, 1, and i.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.860
I'm pretty sure it's 1 and i.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.690
Yes, and a lambda
equals minus 1,

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:49.320
with components 1 over
square root 2, 1, minus i.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.820
Now I put the 1 over
square root of 2

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.250
because I wanted them
to be normalized.

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:58.540
Remember how you're supposed
to normalize these things.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:02.485
You're supposed to take the
row vector, complex conjugate,

00:51:02.485 --> 00:51:03.880
and multiply.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.320
Well, you would get
1 for the length

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.680
of this, 1 for the
length of this.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.630
You would get one for
the length of this,

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.130
but remember, you have
to complex conjugate,

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:17.860
otherwise you'll get 0.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.270
Also, you will get one
for the length of this.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:25.070
So these are our eigenvalues.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:29.930
So actually, with eigenvalues
lambda equals 1 and minus 1

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:32.910
for these two, we're
in pretty good shape.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:43.020
We could try Sx to be h-bar
over 2 times 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:55.310
And Sy to be h-bar over
2, 0, minus i, i, 0.

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:58.140
These would have the
right eigenvalues

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.930
because if you multiply
a matrix by a number,

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.430
the eigenvalue gets
multiplied by this number,

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:10.140
so the plus minus 1s become
plus minus h-bar over 2.

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.480
But what are we was
supposed to check?

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.218
If this is to work,
we're supposed

00:52:15.218 --> 00:52:16.343
to check these commutators.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:23.060
So let's do one, at least.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:27.480
Sx commutator with Sy.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:33.580
So what do we get? h-bar over
2, h-bar over 2-- two of them--

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:40.150
then the first matrix, 0,
1, 1, 0 times 0, minus i, i,

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:48.980
0, minus 0, minus i,
i, 0 times 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:53:03.720
Which is h-bar over 2 times
h-bar over 2, times i, 0, 0,

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:13.860
minus i, minus minus i, 0, 0, i.

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:21.805
And we're almost there.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:36.190
What do we have?

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:40.630
Well, we have h-bar
over 2, h-bar over 2.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:44.150
And we've got 2i and minus 2i.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:58.710
So this is h-bar over 2 times
h-bar over 2, times 2i times 1,

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:01.360
minus 1.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:07.610
And this whole thing is i
h-bar, and the other part

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:14.410
is h-bar over 2, 1, minus 1,
which is i h-bar as z-hat.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.440
Good, it works.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.080
You know, the only
thing that could

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.240
have gone wrong-- you could
have identified 1 with a minus,

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.540
or something like that It
would have been equally good.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:36.310
Once you have these
operators, we're fine.

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:41.170
So one has to check that the
other ones work, and they do.

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:44.540
I will leave them
for you to check.

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:49.820
And therefore, we've
got the three matrices.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:55.360
It's a very important
result-- the Sx Sy, and Sz.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:04.130
I will not rewrite them, but
they should be boxed nicely,

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:07.900
the three of them
together, with that

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.015
one there on top
of the blackboard.

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:17.270
And of course by construction,
they're Hermitian.

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.490
They're famous
enough that people

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:22.090
have defined the
following object.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:27.680
Si is defined to
be h-bar over 2,

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:32.050
sigma i, the power
of the matrix sigmas.

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:38.310
And these are poly matrices,
sigma one is 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:43.140
Sigma two is 0, minus i, i, 0.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.340
And sigma three is equal
to 1, minus 1, 0, 0.

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:58.820
OK, so in principle--
yes, question.

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.236
AUDIENCE: Is it
at all significant

00:56:00.236 --> 00:56:05.980
that the poly matrices are
all squared [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.100
PROFESSOR: Yes,
it is significant.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:13.300
We'll use it, but at this
moment, it's not urgent for us.

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:20.686
We'll have no application
of that property

00:56:20.686 --> 00:56:22.690
for a little while,
but it will help

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:27.508
us do a lot of the algebra
of the poly matrices.

00:56:27.508 --> 00:56:30.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
eigenvalues, right?

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:31.972
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:35.940
AUDIENCE: Doesn't that follow
from the eigenvalue properties

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:40.256
that we've [INAUDIBLE]
plus or minus one.

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:46.910
Because those were both
squared. [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.390
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.340
I think so.

00:56:54.340 --> 00:57:05.110
Our eigenvalues--
yes, it's true.

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:09.100
That the fact that the
eigenvalues are plus minus 1

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:13.390
will imply that these
matrices squared themselves.

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:17.280
So it's incorporated
into our analysis.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:21.210
The thing that I will say
is that you don't need it

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:23.680
in the expression
of the commutators.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.470
So in the
commentators, it didn't

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:28.480
play a role to begin with.

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.800
Put it as an extra condition.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.990
Now what is the next thing
we really want to understand?

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:39.540
Is that in terms
of plain states,

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:44.940
we now have the answer for most
of the experiments we could do.

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.520
So in particular,
remember that we

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:53.560
said that we would have Sx,
for example, having states

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:59.880
x plus minus, which
are h-bar over 2

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:05.930
plus minus, x comma plus minus.

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:11.660
The states along the
x-direction referred

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:16.010
like that would be the
eigenstates of the Sx operator.

00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:20.370
But we've calculated the
states of the Sx operator--

00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:23.040
they're here.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:27.180
The Sx operator is h-bar
over 2 times this matrix.

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.200
And we have those things.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.606
So the plus eigenvalue
and the minus eigenvalue

00:58:33.606 --> 00:58:36.170
will just show up here.

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:44.780
So let me write them, and
explain, in plain language,

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.490
what these states are.

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:53.630
So the eigenstate
with lambda equal

00:58:53.630 --> 00:59:00.720
1-- that would correspond
to h-bar over two-- so the x

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:04.890
plus corresponds to this vector.

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:10.070
So what is that state?

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:15.980
It's that vector which, if
you want more explicitly,

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:24.070
it's the z plus, plus z minus.

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:30.080
This is the state 1 over
square root of 2, 1, 1.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:39.423
The x minus is z
plus, minus z minus.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:47.800
As you see on that
blackboard, it's 1 minus 1.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.150
So here it is.

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:55.010
The states that you were looking
for, that are aligned along x--

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.860
plus x or minus x--
are not new states

00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.340
that have you to add
to the state space.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.160
They are linear combinations
of the states you've got.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:14.070
We can invert this formula
and write, for example,

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:22.445
that z plus is 1 over
square root of 2, x plus,

01:00:22.445 --> 01:00:29.470
plus 1 over square
root of 2, x minus.

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:39.330
And z minus is 1 over square
root of 2, x plus, minus 1

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:43.130
over square root of--
minus the square root of 2

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:49.740
is already out, I'm
sorry-- minus x minus.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:58.170
So actually, this answers
the question that you had.

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:02.170
For example, you
put a z plus state,

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:07.250
and you put an x
filter-- what amplitude

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:17.060
do you have to find a state
in the x plus, given that you

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.240
start with a state
on the z plus?

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.030
Well, you put an
x plus from here.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:31.560
You get 1 from this
and 0 from this one

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.360
because the states
are always orthogonal.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.860
The states are orthogonal--
you should check that.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.270
And therefore, this is
1 over square root of 2.

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:47.200
If you ask for x minus
with respect to z plus,

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.100
that's also 1 over
square root of 2.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.430
And these are the
amplitudes for this state

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:56.040
to be found in this, for this
state to be found in them.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:56.890
They're equal.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:59.610
The probabilities are 1/2.

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:01.180
And that's good.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.570
Our whole theory
of angular momentum

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:06.460
has given us something
that is perfectly

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:10.040
consistent with the
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.440
and it gives you
these probabilities.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.695
You can construct in the
same way the y states.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:26.980
So the y states
are the eigenstates

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:31.845
of that second matrix, Sy,
that we wrote on the left.

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:45.500
So this matrix is Sy, so
its eigenstates-- I'm sorry,

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.430
Sy is there.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.060
Sy is there.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.850
The eigenstates are
those, so immediately

01:02:52.850 --> 01:03:00.390
you translate that to say
that Sy has eigenstates y

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:03.770
plus minus, whose
eigenvalues are

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:08.880
plus minus h-bar
over 2y plus minus.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:16.790
And y plus is equal 1
over square root of 2,

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:29.150
z plus-- and look at the first
eigenvector-- plus iz minus.

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:33.650
And, in fact, they can
put one formula for both.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.640
Here they are.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.600
So, it's kind of neat
that the x1s were

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.580
found by linear combinations,
and they're orthogonal.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.100
Now, if you didn't
have complex numbers,

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:53.130
you could not form
another linear combination

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:55.300
of this orthogonal.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.100
But thanks to these
complex numbers,

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.880
you can put an i there--
there's no i in the x ones--

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.430
and the states are
orthogonal, something

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:06.850
that you should check.

01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:09.170
So again, you can
invert and find

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.550
the z states in
terms of y, and you

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:14.860
would conclude that the
amplitudes are really

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:18.060
the same up to signs, or
maybe complex numbers,

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.360
but the probabilities
are identical.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.990
So we've gotten a long way.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:28.650
We basically have
a theory that seems

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:33.460
to describe the whole result of
the Stern-Gerlach experiment,

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.690
but now your theory
can do more for you.

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:39.600
Now, in the last
few minutes, we're

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.550
going to calculate
the states that

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.960
are along arbitrary directions.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:52.410
So here I produced a
state that is along

01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:57.180
the x-direction plus, and
along the x-direction minus.

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:02.020
What I would like to construct,
to finish this story,

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:06.150
is a state that is along
some arbitrary direction.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:16.010
So the state that points
along some unit vector n.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:22.560
So here is space, and here's a
unit vector n with components

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:26.700
nx, , ny, and nz.

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:39.775
Or you can write the vector n
as nx ex plus ny ey plus nz ez.

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:45.660
And I would like
to understand how

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:49.710
I can construct, in
general, a spin state that

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:53.110
could be said to be
in the n direction.

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:56.610
We have the ones
along the z, x, and y,

01:05:56.610 --> 01:06:00.560
but let's try to get something
more general, the most general

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.490
one.

01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:09.740
So for this, we
think of the triplet

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:17.350
of operators S, which
would be Sx, Sy, and Sz.

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:27.020
Now you can, if you wish,
write this as Sx-hat ex vector,

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:33.635
plus Sy-hat ey vector,
plus Sz hat ez vector.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.580
But this object, if
you write it like that,

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.350
is really a strange object.

01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:44.150
Think of it.

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:49.430
It's matrices, or operators,
multiplied by unit vectors.

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:52.790
These vectors have nothing
to do with the space

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:56.210
in which the matrices act.

01:06:56.210 --> 01:07:00.430
The matrices act in an abstract,
two-dimensional vector space,

01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:04.540
while these vectors are sort
of for accounting purposes.

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.430
That's why we sometimes
don't write them,

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:09.300
and say we have a triplet.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.850
So this product
means almost nothing.

01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:14.260
They're just sitting together.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:18.660
You could put the e to the
left of the x or to the right.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.560
It's a vector.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.130
You're not supposed to put
the vector inside the matrix,

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:24.480
either.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.930
They don't talk to each.

01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:29.650
It's an accounting procedure.

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:33.680
It is useful sometimes; we will
use it to derive identities

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.110
soon, but it's an
accounting procedure.

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.670
So here's what I want to define.

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:45.000
So this is a crazy thing, some
sort of vector valued operator,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.110
or something like that.

01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:48.450
But what we really
need is what we'll

01:07:48.450 --> 01:07:57.430
call S-hat n, which will be
defined as n dot S. Where

01:07:57.430 --> 01:08:01.750
we take naively what a dot
product is supposed to mean.

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.160
This component times
this component,

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.560
which happens to be an operator.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.950
This times this,
this times that.

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:18.100
nx Sx plus ny Sy, plus nz Sz.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.830
And this thing is
something very intuitive.

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.800
It is just an operator.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.850
It doesn't have anymore
a vector with it.

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:29.484
So it's a single operator.

01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:33.170
If your vector points
in the z-direction,

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:37.734
nx and ny z, and you have Sz
because it's a unit vector.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:46.859
If the vector points in the
x-direction, you get Sx.

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:51.960
If the vector points in the
y-direction, you get Sy.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.149
In general, this we
call the spin operator

01:08:56.149 --> 01:09:00.180
in the direction
of the vector n--

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:10.220
spin operator in
the direction of n.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:19.540
OK, so what about
that spin operator?

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:25.779
Well, it had eigenvalues plus
minus h-bar over 2 along z, x,

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:29.880
and y-- probably does still
have those eigenvalues--

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.630
but we have to make
this a little clearer.

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:40.450
So for that we'll
take nx and ny and nz

01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:43.050
to be the polar
coordinate things.

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:49.229
So this vector is going
to have a theta here

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:52.510
on the azimuthal
angle phi over here.

01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:59.550
So nz is cosine theta.

01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:02.575
nx and ny have sine theta.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:09.370
And nx cosine phi, and
this one has sine phi.

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:19.940
So what is the
operator Sn vector hat?

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:26.080
Well, it's nx times Sx.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.450
So, I'll put a h-bar
over 2 in front,

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:39.590
so we'll have nx sigma x,
or sigma1, plus ny sigma2, ,

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:42.510
plus nz sigma3.

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:47.460
Remember the spin operators
are proportional h-bar

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:53.480
over 2 times the sigmas--
so sigma1, sigma2, sigma3.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:58.590
And look what we
get. h-bar over 2.

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:04.160
Sigma1 has an nx here, nx.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:10.100
Sigma2 has minus iny plus iny.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:14.260
And sigma3, we
have a nz minus nz.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:27.612
So this is h-bar over 2, nz is
cosine theta, nx minus iny--

01:11:27.612 --> 01:11:30.130
you'd say, oh it's a
pretty awful thing,

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:37.760
but it's very simple-- nx
minus iny is sine theta times e

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.630
to the minus i phi.

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:51.310
Here it would be sine
theta, e to the i phi,

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:53.786
and here we'll have
minus cosine theta.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:00.760
So this is the whole
matrix, Sn-hat, like that.

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:06.580
Well, in the last
couple of minutes,

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:10.985
let's calculate the
eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:17.350
So what do we get?

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:19.410
Well, for the
eigenvalues, remember

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:23.980
what is the computation of
an eigenvalue of a matrix.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:27.710
An eigenvalue for
matrix a, you write

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:34.325
that by solving the determinant
of a minus lambda 1 equals 0.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.800
So for any matrix a,
if we want to find

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.330
the eigenvalues
of this matrix, we

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:49.760
would have to write
eigenvalues of Sn-hat.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.840
We have to ride the
determinant of this,

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:04.190
minus lambda i, so the
determinant of h-bar over 2

01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:09.770
cosine theta, minus lambda,
minus h-bar over 2 cosine

01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:12.220
theta, minus lambda.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:22.420
And here, it's sine theta, e
to the minus i phi, sine theta

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:29.630
e to the i phi, the
determinant of this being 0.

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:32.560
It's not as bad as it looks.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.750
It's actually pretty simple.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:38.550
These are a plus b, a minus b.

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:42.100
Here the phases cancel out.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:49.630
The algebra you can read in the
notes, but you do get lambda

01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:54.840
equals plus minus h-bar over 2.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:02.750
Now that is fine, and we
now want the eigenvectors.

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:08.450
Those are more non-trivial, so
they need a little more work.

01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:11.860
So what are you supposed to
do to find an eigenvector?

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:17.760
You're supposed to take this
a minus lambda i, acting

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.310
on a vector, and put
it equal to zero.

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:21.435
And that's the eigenvector.

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:28.440
So, for this case,
we're going to try

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:34.600
to find the eigenvector n plus.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:44.410
So this is the one that has
Sn on this state-- well,

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:51.485
I'll write it here, plus minus
h over 2, n plus minus here.

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.210
So let's try to find
this one that corresponds

01:14:57.210 --> 01:15:03.675
to the eigenvalue equal
to plus h-bar over 2.

01:15:03.675 --> 01:15:17.890
Now this state is C1 times z
plus, plus C2 times z minus.

01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:21.420
These are our basis states,
so it's a little combination.

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.970
Or it's C1, C2.

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:26.790
Think of it as a matrix.

01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:32.610
So we want the eigenvalues
of that-- the eigenvector

01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:36.450
for that-- so what do we have?

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:47.100
Well, we would have Sn-hat
minus h-bar over 2 times 1,

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:55.560
on this C1, C2 equals 0.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.680
The eigenvector equation
is that this operator

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.280
minus the eigenvalue
must give you that.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.730
So the h-bars over
2, happily, go out,

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.930
and you don't really need
to worry about them anymore.

01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:19.700
And you get here cosine
theta minus 1, sine theta

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:27.000
e to the minus i phi,
sine theta e to the i phi,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:36.720
and minus cosine theta
minus 1, C1, C2 equals 0.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:44.205
All right, so you
have two equations,

01:16:44.205 --> 01:16:47.220
and both relate C1 and C2.

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:51.050
Happily, and the reason
this works is because

01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:57.120
with this eigenvalue that
we've used that appears here,

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.220
these two equations
are the same.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.100
So you can take
either one, and they

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:05.900
must imply the same
relation between C1 and C2.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.490
Something you can check.

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:11.840
So let me write one of them.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:19.090
C2 is equal to e to the i
phi, 1 minus cosine theta

01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:21.990
over sine theta C1.

01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:42.070
It's from the first line.

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:49.560
So you have to remember, in
order to simplify these things,

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.950
your half angle identities.

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:52.450
Sorry.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.930
1 minus cosine theta is 2
sine squared theta over 2,

01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:06.000
and sine theta is 2 sine theta
over 2 cosine theta over 2.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:15.540
So this becomes e to the
i phi sine theta over 2,

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:19.040
over cosine theta over 2, C1.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.560
Now we want these things
to be well normalized,

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:32.620
so we want C1 squared plus
C2 squared equal to 1.

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:37.620
So, you know what C2
is, so this gives you

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:43.430
C1 squared times 1 plus--
and C2 you use this,

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:46.670
when you square the
phase goes away--

01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:54.100
sine squared theta over
2, cosine squared over 2

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.940
must be equal to 1.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.930
Well, the numerator
is 1, so you learn

01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:08.250
that C1 squared is equal to
cosine squared theta over 2.

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.370
Now you have to take
the square root,

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:15.220
and you could put an i
or a phase or something.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.800
But look, whatever
phase you choose,

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:22.200
you could choose C1 to
be cosine theta over 2,

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.060
and say, I'm done.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.370
I want this one.

01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:28.810
Somebody would say, no
let's put the phase, e

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:32.140
so to the i pi over 5.

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:37.870
So that doesn't look good,
but four or even worse,

01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:41.100
this phase will show
up in C2 because C2

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.870
is proportional to C1.

01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:45.090
So I can get rid of it.

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:48.110
I only should put it
if I really need it,

01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:51.660
and I don't think I need
it, so I won't put it.

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.330
And you can always
change your mind

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:57.150
later-- nobody's going to
take your word for this.

01:19:57.150 --> 01:20:02.180
So, in this case, C2 would
be sine theta over 2,

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:05.850
e to the i phi.

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:08.000
It's nice, but it's [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.965
And therefore, we got
this state n plus,

01:20:11.965 --> 01:20:19.420
which is supposed to be
cosine theta over 2, z plus,

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:30.060
and plus sine theta over
2, e to the i phi, z minus.

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.365
This is a great result.

01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:38.700
It gives the
arbitrarily located spin

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.480
state that point
in the n-direction.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.030
As a linear superposition
of your two basis states,

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:49.240
it answers conclusively
the question

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:52.350
that any spin state
in your system

01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:56.860
can be represented in this
two-dimensional vector space.

01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:05.030
Now moreover, if I take
that theta equals 0,

01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:09.440
I have the z-axis, and it's
independent of the angle phi.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.850
The phi angle becomes
singular at the North Pole,

01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:14.160
but that's all right.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.340
When theta is equal to
0, this term is 0 anyway.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.300
And therefore, this goes,
and when theta is equal to 0,

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:24.620
you recover the plus state.

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:27.495
Now you can calculate
the minus state.

01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:35.610
And if you follow exactly the
same economical procedure,

01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:38.930
you will get the
following answer.

01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:41.520
And I think, unless
you've done a lot

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.280
of eigenvalue calculations,
this is a calculation

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.390
you should just redo.

01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:50.300
So the thing that you get,
without thinking much,

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:58.940
is that n minus is equal to
sine theta over 2 plus, minus

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:06.230
cosine theta over 2,
e to the i phi minus.

01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:09.980
At least some way of solving
this equation gives you that.

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:12.970
You could say, this is
natural, and this is fine.

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:17.730
But that is not
so nice, actually.

01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:38.870
Take theta equal to
pi-- no, I'm sorry.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:43.470
Again, you take
theta equal to 0.

01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:45.570
Theta equal to 0--
this is supposed

01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:49.050
to be the minus state
along the direction.

01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:51.650
So this is supposed to
give you the minus state.

01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:56.030
Because the vector n is
along up, in the z-direction,

01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:58.050
but you're looking at
the minus component.

01:22:58.050 --> 01:23:00.300
So theta equals 0.

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.600
Sure, there's no plus,
but theta equals 0,

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.340
and you get the minus state.

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:11.850
And this is 1, and phi is
ill-defined-- it's not so nice,

01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:14.790
therefore-- so, at
this moment, it's

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:20.600
convenient to multiply this
state by e to the minus i phi,

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.240
times minus 1.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:27.830
Just multiply it by
that, so that n minus

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:34.490
is equal to minus sine theta
over 2, e to the minus i phi,

01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:42.680
plus, plus cosine
theta over 2, minus.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.785
And that's a nice
definition of the state.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.130
When theta is equal
to 0, you're fine,

01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:57.510
and it's more naturally
equivalent to what you know.

01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:01.770
Theta equal to 0 gives you
the minus state, or z minus.

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:04.770
I didn't put the zs
here, for laziness.

01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:08.510
And for theta equal to
0, the way the phase phi

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:09.460
doesn't matter.

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:10.960
So it's a little nicer.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.430
You could work with this
one, but you might this well

01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:16.520
leave it like that.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:22.000
So we have our general states,
we've done everything here

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.450
that required some linear
algebra without doing

01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:28.560
a review of linear
algebra, but that's

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.800
what we'll start
to do next time.

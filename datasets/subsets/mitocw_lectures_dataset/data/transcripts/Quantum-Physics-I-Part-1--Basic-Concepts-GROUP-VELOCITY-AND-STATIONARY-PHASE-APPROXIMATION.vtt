WEBVTT

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.320
PROFESSOR: Velocity.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.490
So we assume that we
have an omega of k.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.350
That's the assumption.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.370
There are waves in which, if
you give me k, the wavelength,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.540
I can tell you what is omega.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.130
And it may be as simple
as omega equal to kc,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.870
but it may be more complicated.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.420
In fact, the different waves
have different relations.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.200
In mechanics, omega would be
proportional to k squared.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.040
As you've seen, the energy
is proportional to p squared.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.380
So omega will be
proportional to k squared.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.900
So in general, you
have an omega of k.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.100
And the group velocity is the
velocity of a wave packet--

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.444
packet--

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.165
constructed--

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.290
by superposition of waves.

00:01:12.943 --> 00:01:13.897
Of waves.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.400
All right.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.030
So let's do this here.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.540
Let's write a wave packet.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.970
Psi of x and t is going to
be done by superposing waves.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.200
And superposition means
integrals, summing over

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.220
waves of different values of k.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.580
Each wave, I will construct
it in a simple way

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.920
with exponentials.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.030
ikx minus army of kt.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.980
And this whole thing, I will
call the phase of the wave.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.370
Phi of k.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.970
So that's one wave.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.630
It could be sines or cosines,
but exponentials are nicer.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.560
And we'll do with
exponentials, in this case.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.240
But you superimpose them.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.060
And each one may be superimposed
with a different amplitude.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.180
So what does it mean?

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.480
It means that there is a
function, phi of k, here.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.090
And for different
k's, this function

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.640
may have different values.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.870
Indeed, the whole assumption
of this construction

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.460
is based on the statement
that phi of k peaks.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.450
So phi of k--

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.880
as a function of k is
0 almost everywhere,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.420
except a little bump around some
frequency that we'll call k0.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.715
Narrow peak.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.680
That is our wave.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.180
And depending on how
this phi of k looks,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.820
then we'll get a different wave.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.400
We're going to try to identify
how this packet moves in time.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.293
Now--

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.550
There is a quick way
to see how it moves.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.230
And there is a way to
prove how it moves.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.520
So let me do, first, the
quick way to see how it moves.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.370
It's based on something
called the principle

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.050
of stationary phase.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.870
I doubt it was said to you
in [? A03 ?] in that way.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.970
But it's the most
powerful wave to see this.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.070
And in many ways, the quickest
and nicest way to see.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.480
Takes a little bit of
mathematical intuition,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.210
but it's simple.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.140
And intuition is something that.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.025
I think, you have.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.905
If you're integrating--

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.944
a function--

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:30.260
multiplied-- a function, f of x,
multiplied by maybe sine of x.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.360
Well, you have f of
x, then sine of x.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.430
Sine is 1/2 the times positive,
1/2 the times negative.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.530
If you multiply
these two functions,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.710
you're going to get the function
that is 1/2 time positive

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.010
and 1/2 the time negative.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.210
And in fact, the integral
will contribute almost nothing

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.180
if this function
is slowly varying.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.710
Because if it's slowly varying,
the up peak and the down peak

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.000
hasn't changed
much the function.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.090
And they will cancel each other.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.850
So the principle
of stationary phase

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.230
says that if you're integrating
a function times a wave,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.280
you get almost no contribution,
except in those places where

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.600
the wave suddenly becomes
of long wavelength

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.870
and the phase is stationary.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.920
Only when the wave doesn't
change much for a while,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.770
and then it changes again.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.210
In those regions, the function
will give you some integral.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.700
So that's the principle
of stationary phase.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.000
And I'll say it here,
I'll write it here.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.564
Principal--

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.940
of stationary phase.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.720
We're going to use that
throughout the course.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.990
Phase.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.310
And I'll say the following.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.002
Since--

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.990
phi anyway only
peaks around k0--

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.880
This is the principle of
stationary phase applied

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.550
to this integral.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:27.140
Since-- since only for
k roughly equal to k0.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.448
The integral--

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.116
has a chance--

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.150
To be non-zero.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.980
So here is what I'm saying.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.720
Look.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.210
The only place where this
integral contributes-- it

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.810
might as well integrate
from k0 minus a little delta

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.610
to k0 plus a little delta.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.920
Because this whole
thing vanishes outside.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.860
And if we're going to integrate
here, over this thing,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.620
it better be that this wave
is not oscillating like crazy.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.250
Because it's going
to cancel it out.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.580
So it better stop
oscillating there

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.800
in order to get
that contribution,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.890
or send in another way.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:30.610
Only when the phase stops,
you get a large contribution.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.650
So on the phase stops varying
fast with respect to k.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.930
So you need-- need--

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:49.422
that the phase
becomes stationary--

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:58.380
with respect to k, which is
the variable of integration--

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.650
at k0.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.200
So around k0, better be that the
phase doesn't change quickly.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.640
And the slower it changes,
the better for your integral.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.510
You may get something.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.780
So if you want to
figure out where

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.970
you get the most
contribution, you

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.960
get it for k around
k0, of course.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:33.289
But only if this thing
it's roughly stationary.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:39.912
So being roughly stationary
will give the following result.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.810
The result is that
the main contribution

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:06.790
comes when the phase, phi of k,
which is kx minus omega of kt,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.380
satisfies the condition
that it just doesn't vary.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.710
You have 0 derivative at k0.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.020
So the relative
with respect to k

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:31.550
is x minus d omega of
k dk at k0 t must be 0.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.380
Stationary phase.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.960
Function phase has
a stationary point.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.350
Look what you get.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.530
It says there that you
only get a contribution

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.140
if this is the case.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:52.320
So the value of x, where you
get a big bump in the integral,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.850
and the time, t, are
related by this relation.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:04.080
The hump in this packet will
behave obeying this relation.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:12.900
So x is equal to d
omega dk at k0 t.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.610
And it identifies the packet
as moving with this velocity.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.840
x equal velocity times times.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.780
This is the group velocity.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.950
End of the answer
by stationary phase.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.400
Very, extremely simple.

00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:25.120
PROFESSOR: OK, we have the
clicker question up.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.510
We're going to have another
clicker competition today.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:37.180
The defending champs, there's
Darcy's recitation.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:01:44.720
So, OK, let's just take 10
more seconds on this.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.960
OK, not too bad, 74%.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.520
So, in this problem, the trick
was just to look at the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.620
equation and figure out what's
going on -- which element is

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.990
being reduced, and which
one is being oxidized.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.970
So this is something that
you will be seeing on

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.600
the upcoming exam.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.330
So we're going to talk about
that in a few minutes, but

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.550
first I want to answer the
question from last time.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.130
So, first, let's just, I know
you've all been wondering

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:26.960
about how vitamin B12 is
reduced in the body.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.840
So, let's take a look
at this now.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:38.080
So, if everyone can quiet
down, let's get started.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.250
So, vitamin B12 is reduced by
a protein that's called

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.530
flavodoxin.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.920
And flavodoxin is a protein that
has a cofactor which is a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.110
flavin, and that's also a
vitamin B, as it turns out,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.010
they're both vitamin B's.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.240
So, vitamin B12 has a redox
potential or a standard

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.720
reduction potential
of minus 0 .

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.180
5 2 6 volts, and that is
a very low number for a

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.290
biological system.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.435
And flavodoxin has a potential
of minus 0.

00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:19.180
2 3 volts.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:31.210
So, which of these things is
a better reducing agent?

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.530
So, which thing, you want to
think about reducing agent,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.390
which thing would prefer
to be oxidized and

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.850
reduce something else?

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.660
So, with the low negative
number, B12 is a better

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.170
reducing agent than flavodoxin,
and just based on

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.650
these numbers, vitamin B12
should be reducing flavodoxin,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.790
not the other way around.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.160
So, how does this work then?

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.940
So, in your body right now,
you have a version of a

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.490
flavodoxin protein, and you of
vitamin B12 attached to an

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.370
enzyme, methionine synthase, and
for that to be activated,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.540
it needs to be reduced.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.630
So how is this happening?

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.860
So, let's consider whether the
reduction of B12 by flavodoxin

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.060
is spontaneous.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.990
It happens in your body so one
might think that it is.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.600
But let's look at that.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.680
So, we can look at it the same
way you've looked at all the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.790
other systems, we're talking
about batteries, electric

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.080
chemical cells -- you can use
the same equations if it's a

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.830
biological system as you can
for any other system.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.470
So we've seen this
equation before.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.040
We've calculated changes in
the standard reduction

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.620
potential for a cell, and we
talked about e nought for

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.900
reduction minus the e nought for
oxidation, and we can use

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.000
that same equation.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.590
So we can put it in in the
biological context.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.610
The vitamin B12 is the thing
that's being reduced, and the

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.060
flavodoxin is the thing that's
being oxidized, that's the

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.580
reaction that happens.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.260
So, we can plug those
values in.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.140
So we have minus 0 .

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.720
5 2 6 volts, minus
a negative 0 .

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.970
2 3 volts, and if you
put those together,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.350
you get minus 0 .

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.590
2 9 6 volts.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.080
So is that going to be a
spontaneous reaction?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.180
No, it's not going to be.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.100
Your value for the e is
negative, which means what is

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.180
true about delta g?

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.630
Positive, so it won't
be spontaneous.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.170
So, let's figure out how not
spontaneous it's going to be.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.860
How much trouble
are we all in?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.340
So we can use again, the same
equation that we used for

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.060
batteries that we've used in
this course -- just because

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.270
it's a biological system,
doesn't mean the equation

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.980
doesn't hold.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.230
So our equation for delta g
nought minus n, the number of

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.350
moles of electrons times
Faraday's constant times the

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.060
change in the standard
potential.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.270
So we can plug it in.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.330
I can tell you it's a one
electron process -- flavodoxin

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.610
puts one electron into vitamin
B12, so we have minus 1 times

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.020
Faraday's constant times the
cell potential difference you

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.120
just measured, which
is minus 0 .

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.400
2 9 6, and if you multiply those
out, then you get 28 .

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.270
6 kilojoules per
mole positive.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.470
That is a very big value --
that's not spontaneous and

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.270
it's not a small number for
a biological system.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.000
So, why don't we all have
heart disease and

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.320
megaloblastic anemia?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.890
Those are problems associated
when this particular enzyme is

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.280
not functioning.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.990
So, what happens in this system
is what happens in a

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.290
number of biological systems.
How do you drive something

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.580
forward that is not
spontaneous?

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.450
And what you can do is put
energy into the system to

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.380
drive that non-spontaneous
reaction.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.790
And in this case, the energy
that's put into the system is

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.760
from a molecule called
s adenosylmethionine.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.550
And the cleavage of s
adenosylmethionine has a delta

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.380
g nought of negative 37 .

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.480
6 kilojoules per mole.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.350
So it's more favorable than
the reduction of B12 is

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.410
unfavorable, and so this
drives this system.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.050
So, s adenosylmethionine is your
friend, it helps in the

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.100
body for B12 to be reduced
so that you can

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.070
function and be healthy.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.240
So, many biological systems
work like this.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.580
So what have we been calling
something, a cell, in which an

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.290
unfavorable reaction is driven
by applying some kind of

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:11.400
energy or current, what
do we call that?

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.450
Two types of cells
we mentioned.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.470
One that has a favorable, it
has a spontaneous reaction.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.070
A cell that has a spontaneous
reaction is called what?

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.780
Galvanic.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.780
And the other kind is called?

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.050
Yup.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.500
So, electrolitic cell.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.900
So this is sort of the
biological equivalent of an

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.310
electrolitic cell where you
have s adenosylmethionine

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:38.340
cleavage coupled to an
unfavorable reaction to drive

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.480
that reduction of B12
by flavodoxin.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.360
And B12 has such a low
potential, that there really

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.640
isn't anything else that
can reduce it.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.740
It has one of the lowest
potentials known in a

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.720
biological system, so nature
said, OK, well, we're not

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.110
going to make something with a
lower potential to do this

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.640
chemistry, we'll have something
else with a higher

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.680
potential, but will drive the
reaction because it's going to

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.740
be non-spontaneous.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.320
So that's how this works.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.500
So, today there's a long list
of topics, all of these are

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.730
pretty short and basically
constitute the introductory

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.830
material in this unit.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.190
And we've jumped ahead,
this is in chapter 16.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.840
So, I really like transition
metals, because I am a fan of

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.260
metals that are involved in
biological systems. So, I just

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.670
thought as part of chemistry, I
just want to sort of review

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.260
the kind of basic areas of
chemistry for a minute.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.150
This is not in your handout, but
just so you sort of think

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.720
about what are all parts
of chemistry.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.600
There is organic chemistry --
does anyone know what organic

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.300
chemistry concerns itself with?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.100
Carbon.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:02.470
And then what we have known
as inorganic chemistry.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:07.080
Anyone know what that is?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.910
Not carbon.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.570
So, a lot of people who are
inorganic chemists study

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:18.590
transition metals, but
it's basically other

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.220
things besides carbon.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:25.480
And then one of the areas that
I like is bioinorganic

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.930
chemistry, and these
are people who

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.690
study metals in biology.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:40.800
So, people who study metals in
biology, and we're also kind

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.680
of referred to as, we're
sort of in a club,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.070
which we call the MIB.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.150
So, some of you -- and Will
Smith did a disservice --

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:58.020
people now associate this with
hunting aliens, but in fact,

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.040
people who are in MIB are
associated with hunting for

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.640
metal ions in biological
cells.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.460
So this is sort of
the true MIB.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.510
And in an honor of this
discussion today, I am wearing

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.630
a teeshirt from one
of our meetings.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.440
This is from the International
Congress on Bioinorganic

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.040
Chemistry, which we
refer to as ICBIC.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.160
And you notice that the clever
people who made this teeshirt

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.090
used the B from the bioinorganic
to make B12,

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.540
which is a very popular
vitamin in the

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.770
bioinorganic community.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.890
So, metals in biology.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.810
Carbon, carbon's a good
thing, amino acids are

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.970
good, I like proteins.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.990
But often, when you take a
metal and attach it to a

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.570
protein, that protein can do
really cool chemistry --

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.490
really need oxidation
reduction chemistry.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.430
So, here is part of the periodic
table that includes

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.990
many of these transition metals
that we're going to be

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.190
talking about.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.010
And things that are in orange
here are metals that are very

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.070
important biologically.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.750
Some of the things that are in
grey here are metals that are

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.780
used as probes or as drugs in
biological systems, and some

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.670
could be both.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.640
So, when you add a metal to a
protein you can do cool stuff.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.460
What can you do?

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.330
Well, you can split nitrogen.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.290
You learned that the triple
bond of nitrogen is pretty

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:39.020
hard to break, but metals
in proteins can do it.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.140
You've heard of hydrogen fuel
cells and things like that.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.090
There's a protein called
hydrogenase that uses metals

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.230
to do chemistry with hydrogen.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.220
You could you radical
based chemistry.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.600
You can do a lot of really great
things when you have a

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.200
protein that has
a metal in it.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.690
So, let me introduce you to
some of the concepts and

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.010
terminology involved in this, so
we're going to have a metal

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.000
and the metal's going to
be bound to stuff.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.440
So, one of the great features of
transition metals is their

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.520
ability to form complexes with
small molecules or ions.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.130
They also, this applies to a
protein system in the case

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.220
that instead of small molecules,
you have amino

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.490
acids of proteins it can also
form complexes with.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.210
So, the way that they do this is
metals have often, they can

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.880
attract electron density,
usually a lone pair of

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.010
electrons from another atom, and
so they can form what are

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:44.480
called these coordination
complexes.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.890
So, now we're going to review
for a minute, donor atoms,

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:52.550
they're called ligands, and we
can think about something that

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.180
we learned when we talked about
acids and bases, our

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.290
more broad definition.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:01.390
So, donor atoms are ligands,
and ligands are what?

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.020
Lewis acids or Lewis bases,
and what do they do?

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:43.690
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:48.000
So most of you thought donor
atoms -- the answers that had

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.800
donate electrons did better,
so that was good reading of

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.950
the question, but they
are Lewis bases.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.860
So Lewis bases donate
electron pairs.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.250
So, here's some examples that
you will see of ligands that

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.520
we'll be talking about
in this unit.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.530
You will become very familiar
with some of these as you work

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.420
problems. So they're typically
donating one

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.140
lone pair of electrons.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.380
So, acceptor atoms are the
transition metals themselves,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.570
and so the transition metals are
acting as Lewis acids, and

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.620
so then they would be
accepting those

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.410
lone pairs of electrons.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.270
So, you can think about
coordination complexes as

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.110
Lewis acids and Lewis bases,
or acceptor atoms and donor

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:48.580
ligands or donor atoms. So
here are some examples of

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.070
transition metals that we're
going to see, so it's that

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.180
sort of d-block of the periodic
table that we'll

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.690
become very familiar
with in this unit.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.110
So, then when you take your
acceptor atom and your donor

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.800
atom and you put them together,
you get what is

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.220
known as coordination
complexes.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.210
So, coordination complex is just
the metal or the Lewis

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.520
acid surrounded by the ligands,
or the Lewis bases or

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.840
the donor atoms.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.850
And here is an example of
a coordination complex.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.830
We have metal, we have cobalt
in the middle, and it's

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.000
surrounded by a series
of ligands, and

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.130
these are n h 3 ligands.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.100
And so then our cobalt in the
center, our metal, is the

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.720
Lewis acid, and it's going
to be the acceptor atom.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.150
And the n h 3 groups are our
Lewis bases, they're donor

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.240
atoms, see it's written with
those two electrons there,

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.340
that they're sharing their
electrons with the cobalt

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.600
forming this coordination
complex.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.730
And in this scheme, we have
the bonds are just these

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.940
straight lines are in the plane,
the thick bonds coming

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.690
out are coming out toward you,
and the dashed lines going

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.800
back are going back into
the screen here.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.110
So, let's talk about a couple
of definitions here.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.340
We have something called
coordination number or CN

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.440
number, and this is simply
the number of ligands

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.010
bonded to the metal.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.920
So the number is six, there
is six ligands.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.780
Typically, the numbers will
range for these coordination

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:33.440
complexes to two to 12, with
six being the most common.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.050
So, here is some notation.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.810
If you see this picture, you
should be able to write a

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.530
notation for it.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:44.490
And within a bracket, you would
write cobalt, and then

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.700
you have your n h 3, six of
them, so you put that in a

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.880
bracket and indicate that
there's six n h 3 groups.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.830
Then you have this overall
bracket here

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.550
with a charge up above.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.000
And so over here, we have this
little bracket plus 3, that

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.610
means that this whole
coordination complex has a

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.940
charge of plus 3.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.980
Because it has a positive
charge, sometimes coordination

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.860
complexes are associated
with counter ions.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.090
So, you might see three chloride
minus 1 ions around

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.110
to counter that charge.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.310
And if you did, you would see
the three chlorides on the

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.790
outside of the bracket.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.290
So things inside of the
bracket are actually

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.870
coordinated to the metal, things
outside the bracket are

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.580
counter ions.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.720
And so that would be how you
would translate that

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.360
particular notation.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.580
All right, so, we're back
to geometry again.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.880
As I said, everything you learn
in this course, we're

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.430
going to use again.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:47.970
So, if you're forgetting some
material from units 1 and 2,

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.630
this would be a good time
to review those.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.940
So, if we have this coordination
number of six

00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:14.400
things around, what kind of
geometry are we going to have?

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:28.740
All right, 10 seconds.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.980
Yup, so we have octahedral
geometry.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.230
And here is an example of
our octahedral geometry.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.790
So, let's just quickly run
through the rest of these.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.040
You can yell out the answers,
either looking at your handout

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.030
or not looking at
your handout.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:51.170
The next one over here,
what is it?

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:51.810
Right, trigonal bipyramidal.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:56.800
For a c n number of five, we
have another option shown over

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.130
here, what's that one called?

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.520
Square pyramidal.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.310
For c n numbers of four, there's
two things that you'll

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.690
commonly see, what's the
first one called?

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:08.530
Square planar.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.210
The second one?

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:10.500
Tetrahedral.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.900
For c n number of three, what's
that geometry called?

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.960
Trigonal planar.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.290
And c n of two, only
one option.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:20.490
Linear.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.930
All right, so let's just review
the angles as well,

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.200
those are not in your handouts,
but you can yell

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.850
those out as well.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:33.040
So what angle do we have in
an octahedral system?

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.700
90.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.180
There are two angles involved
if we have trigonal

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.850
bipyramidal.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.110
What's the angle from the
axial to the equatorial?

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.410
STUDENT: 90.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.380
PROFESSOR: And what's the angle
from one equatorial atom

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.110
to another equatorial atom?

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:53.990
So, we have 90 and 120.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:58.080
What about in our square
pyramidal system, what are the

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.250
angles here?

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.890
90.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:10.060
What about square planar?

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:10.840
90.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:16.650
Tetrahedral?

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.390
Let's try that again with
more enthusiasm.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.750
Awesome, 109 .

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.910
5.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:25.250
Trigonal planar?

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.320
120.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.840
And finally, linear.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.360
180.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.640
So, we're going to use this
information again in this

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.950
unit, and of course, it'll be
on the final when we're

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.040
talking about Lewis structures
and hybridization and other

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.850
things as well.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.920
So this comes back in several
times, vsper theory, you have

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.580
this several times.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.860
OK.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.520
So, another term that you hear
a lot when people are talking

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.180
about coordination complexes
is what's

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.930
called the chelate effect.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.880
So, ligands that bind to a metal
at one point are called

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.980
unidentate or monodentate, and
that's from dent, which is

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.350
tooth, so one tooth.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:26.780
Now, if a ligand attaches with
two or more points of

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.260
attachment, it can be called
a chelating ligand.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.200
And this comes from the
Greek, chele is claw.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.540
So, if it's attaching with
more than one point of

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.670
attachment, if the ligand is
grabbing on, it's like a claw

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:45.940
and that's called a chelate.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.050
So, if you have two points
of attachment,

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.750
that's called bidentate.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.270
And even if you've never had
a unit on transition metals

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.030
before, I bet that you can
answer this without me even

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.440
telling you.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.230
What do you think tridentate
might be?

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.420
Three.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.180
Tetradentate?

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:08.870
Four.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.330
Hexadentate?

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.180
Six.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.380
So sometimes this would be a
little question on the final.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.520
Please don't get this wrong,
this is my gift to you, right,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.250
you knew it even before
I taught it.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.090
So, this should be something
that you can definitely get a

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.880
couple extra points
on on the final.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.970
All right, so, chelates bind
with more than one point of

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:35.320
attachment, and metal chelates
are unusually stable.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.330
And this property is due to
favorable and tropic factor,

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.520
so we're back to entropy, we're
back to thermodynamics.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.050
And this has to do with the fact
that when a chelate binds

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.990
a metal, it releases a lot of
water, and that makes the

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.440
chelate pretty stable.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.090
So, let me give you some
examples of chelates, and then

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.830
we're going to come back
and think about the

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.810
chelate effect again.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:05.680
Of course, you knew it, vitamin
B12 has a chelating

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:11.410
ligand associated with it.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:16.870
So, cobalt is in the middle of
vitamin B12, and it has a ring

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.410
system around it.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.550
And the ring system has these
nitrogens, the nitrogens are

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.880
the donor ligands to the cobalt,
and so this ring

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.530
system is attaching at four
points, so it's a

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.260
tetradentate ligand.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.500
There's also two other ligands
attached to vitamin B12,

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.810
there's an upper ligand shown
here, which is 5 prime

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.400
deoxyadenosine, and a bottom
ligand, which is a

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:42.980
dimethylbenzamitisol ligand.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:49.200
So, let's take a look, this is
the cartoon, but let's look at

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.780
another model for this here.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.360
So, we have a ring system, we
have this upper ligand, and

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.490
then a lower ligand down here.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:03.090
And so, the middle ring system
is a tetradentate chelate.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.300
Overall, at the cobalt
metal, what is the

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.110
geometry of this system?

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.710
It's octahedral, right.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.220
So we have this sort of square,
the middle part is

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.680
square planar, but the two upper
and lower ligands make

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.640
the whole thing an octahedral
system.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.980
So this is an example
of a naturally

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.200
occurring chelated complex.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.110
So, this structure is
actually fairly

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.730
complicated for a vitamin.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.410
It's one of the most complex
vitamins that's known, and I

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.830
thought I'd just mention just
a moment of history.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.530
So, this structure was
determined by Dorothy Hodgkin

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.230
who was a crystalographer
in England.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.290
And she started working on this
in the late 1940's, and

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.010
people told her she was crazy,
that something this large

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.850
could never be solved by these
x-ray defraction techniques.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.510
And, of course, now people are
solving today's structures of

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.720
things like the ribosomes.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.530
So, we've come a long way
with crystallography.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.540
But she was one of the first
true believers that x-ray

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.980
crystallography was a
powerful technique.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.790
And so, she went ahead, despite
what everyone said,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.060
and determined this structure.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.670
And for this work and for some
other things, she was awarded

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.920
a Nobel Prize.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.460
So, this was a really
significant contribution in

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.440
the early 1950's and
late 1940's.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.270
She had graduate students
that she inspired.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.710
Some of them went on to become
famous crystalographers.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.750
Other ones were not
so successful --

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.310
crystallography's hard and
it's not for everyone.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:41.235
She was actually known also,
Dorothy was, for her work in

00:26:41.235 --> 00:26:43.910
the third world and her liberal
politics, but one of

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.080
her graduate students did not
agree with her politics, but

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.220
they were still friends.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.050
So this is just a message that
as you go through your career,

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.590
Margaret Thatcher who is a
graduate student of Dorothy

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.350
Hodgkins, couldn't quite cut it
as a crystalographer, but

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.540
for some people, you haven't
found your true thing, and she

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.690
was able to find another
job, so I'm told.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.000
So, just remember that if you're
not good at one thing,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.520
there's something else
out there that you

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.360
might be good at.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.130
So, let me give you a second
example of a chelate.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:26.380
This molecule is
known as EDTA.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.480
So this ligand has six points
that it can attach to a metal.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.340
So, it is six atoms the can
serve as these donor ligands.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.860
So, we have one up here, have
the little electrons and the

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.920
oxygen, another oxygen down
here, nitrogen, nitrogen,

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.110
another oxygen, another
oxygen.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:49.790
So all of those six points can
coordinate to a metal.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.320
So here again is the free EDTA,
and here's a structure

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.930
of EDTA bound to a metal, the
metal is abbreviated m.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:24.720
So, why don't you tell me what
the geometry is of that metal?

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:39.260
All right, let's take only
10 more seconds.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.680
Hoping for 90, we're getting
close, maybe

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.780
by the end of today.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.070
All right, yeah, so it's
octahedral geometry.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:50.430
So we have upper ligands and
a lower ligand, two ligands

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:55.190
coming out, two ligands going
back, and it's also a

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.680
hexadentate complex.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.800
So we see we're coordinated
with the oxygen in red,

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.570
nitrogen in blue, around to the
other nitrogen in blue,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.780
another nitrogen in purple,
another nitrogen up here in

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.380
green and in blue.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:16.260
So, EDTA, when EDTA binds to a
metal, it forms a very stable

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.450
metal complex.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.460
And the reason for this
is that chelate

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.770
effect, and it's entropy.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.090
So if we look, metals are often
coordinated by waters if

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.750
they're just is solution.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.910
But if you bind one molecule
of EDTA to the metal, it'll

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.930
take all of those six sites,
displacing all

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.650
of these six waters.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.650
So here, on this side, you
have one thing free in

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:42.350
solution, and over here you have
six things that are free.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.240
So that's entrotropically
favorable, you have more

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.620
entropy when you have
lots of more free

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.160
things floating around.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.290
So this has greater entropy.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:56.680
So, the chelate effect, then,
has to do with entropic

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.430
effect, that when you're binding
a metal with multiple

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.910
points of attachments,
it's releasing water.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.860
So these are very stable.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.780
And so, because of this
stability, they have a lot of

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.240
important uses.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.870
What is one use you can think
of that you might have for

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:15.480
such a thing?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.050
When might you want to chelate
a metal out -- get metal out

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.450
of something pretty quickly.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.400
Yeah.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.820
Yeah, you can purify out a metal
out of water with this.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:34.880
What about rushing to the
emergency room with something?

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.700
Yeah, lead poisoning, yup.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.430
So, sometimes you might want to
just purify your water, you

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.640
might be happy with that, other
times you might really

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.280
want to have that metal out.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.180
So, every emergency room in
the United States, and

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.690
probably mostly around the
world, will have EDTA on hand

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:57.050
in case someone comes in
with lead poisoning.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:01.560
Do you know who's at the most
risk for lead poisoning, at

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.970
least in this country?

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.700
Kids.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.560
And what do they do they gives
them lead poisoning?

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.630
Lead paint, yeah.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.910
So, I don't know, most of you
are probably living on campus,

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.040
but if any of you move off
campus, and some people who

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.800
are living maybe across the
river in fraternity houses,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.010
those buildings are old and they
have had lead paint in at

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.320
some point or another.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.790
So this is a big problem,
actually, in the Boston area.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.570
So, if you have any toddlers
visiting you, you might want

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.710
to make sure they're not eating
paint chips off any

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.610
window sill or anything
like that.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:38.520
Or if you do, have some
EDTA on hand.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.860
All right, one other thing, some
of you, once you start

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:46.330
studying chemistry, it's always
fun/scary to start

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.710
reading the ingredients
on food packages.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.220
But you will discover that some
food that you eat will

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.690
say as an ingredient EDTA
added for freshness.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.060
So, bacteria and fungi and
things like that need metals

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.270
for growth, metals are very
important for life, and so you

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.510
add a little EDTA and it
prevents things from growing

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.630
on your food.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.330
So that's added for freshness.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.880
So you'll see it in food.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.280
Another use that occasionally I
find MIT students are not as

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:27.760
familiar with is in cleaning
bathtubs, so you want to

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.740
chelate out the calcium in
tub scum, and that's a

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.380
good use for EDTA.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.520
So, I always like to mention
how freshman chemistry

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.080
information can make
you a lot of money.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.540
So, I thought I'd tell you a
little story about a man named

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.640
Robert Black.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.020
So one day, I think it might
have been a little before

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.750
Thanksgiving, Mrs. Robert Black,
I don't know her first

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.870
name, said to her husband,
"We're having company, how

00:32:55.870 --> 00:33:01.790
about you go clean the bathtub?"
Apparently, Robert

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.400
Black's wife had never mentioned
this to him before,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.530
and he had, in fact, never
cleaned a bathtub.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:11.790
Also, I think that Robert
Black's wife was tired of

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.700
cleaning the bathtub, and
perhaps, had not done it for,

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.470
say, a very long time.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.055
So, Robert Black went in there
and tried to scrub off the

00:33:21.055 --> 00:33:23.450
scum, and it was actually really
challenging and he was

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.290
very frustrating, and he said,
"I never want to do that

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.600
again."

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.490
So, he went and developed a
product, a shower cleaner,

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.960
that had all the ingredients of
the shower cleaners he was

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.450
using, except that he advertised
it slightly

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:42.990
differently, and he said "Every
time you shower, just

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.330
spray a little bit on and you'll
never have to really

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.350
scrub again." because this will
take care of it and avoid

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.980
scrubbing in the future, so a
little bit of spraying after

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.050
each shower avoids these
problems. And the ingredients

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.900
he had in were all typical
ingredients, including

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.700
chelating agents.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.310
You need a surfactant to break
up the water beads, and

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:08.100
alcohol to get rid of the oily
stuff, and the chelating agent

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.990
for the calcium in
the tub scum.

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:14.230
And the one he actually
used is EDTA.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:18.970
So, as a result of a wife saying
to her husband, it's

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:22.490
your turn to clean the tub,
they now make $70 million

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:24.390
dollars annually.

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:29.190
So, I think this is a lesson
that we can learn in many ways

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.210
that cleaning the tub is
something that everyone should

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:36.420
do at some point in their life,
and that the simple

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.570
things you learn in freshman
chemistry can, if applied

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.030
correctly, make you
a lot of money.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.640
And I just want to encourage
you, again, that anything that

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.460
I teach you that you use to
make a lot of money, I'll

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.860
remind you that I am perfectly
willing to have a

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.460
cut of any of that.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.580
So, just something
to keep in mind.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:00.880
So, one more thing that you
might have heard for EDTA.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.700
Have any of you heard, perhaps,
maybe watching

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:14.170
television or a movie,
about a use for EDTA?

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:20.290
Have any of you, perhaps, seen
a movie called Blade?

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.090
How many of you have
seen this?

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:25.040
Not very many people.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.930
Hmm, I think we're going to
have a separate course in

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:37.950
vampire movies and TV. Anyway,
Blade fights vampires, and

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.360
they have a special gun, and the
special gun has cartridges

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.240
-- cartridges are shown here.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.970
And the cartridges have in them
-- anyone want to guess?

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.630
EDTA, yes.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.370
And the idea behind it, if you
shoot at a vampire, the

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:58.040
vampire turns instantaneously
to dust, and the idea behind

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.960
it is that vampires drink blood,
blood has what in it?

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.150
Iron.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.970
What chelates iron?

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.610
EDTA.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:10.250
And, therefore, if you chelate
the iron out of blood, and a

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.970
vampire's mostly blood, it just
instantaneously turns to

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:19.920
dust. So, actually, as chemistry
goes, it's kind of

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.300
cool, yeah.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.490
So, that's the final use that
I am aware of for EDTA.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:30.600
Some of you may encounter
some more.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:36.080
All right, so coordination
complexes.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.200
Some of them can have isomers.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.510
They can have geometric
isomers.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.860
And geometric isomers can have
vastly different properties.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.650
And if you're interested in
biochemistry, this is

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.920
something that you'll be
interested in, because this

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.390
can be very important in
biological systems.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.850
So, let me tell you about a
coordination complex that has

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:06.970
platinum at the center, it has
two ammonia ligands and two

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:12.860
chloride ligands, and it has two
ways that you can do it.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.800
So, you can either put the
ammonia ligands on different

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.990
sides or you can put them
on the same side.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:24.300
So, here we have two nitrogen
ligands over here, and I have

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.700
these here.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:30.830
So, on one side, you have the
two nitrogen ligands, on the

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:36.630
other side two chlorides, or we
can have a transarrangement

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.810
where they're across
from each other.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:40.700
So you see, there's 2 different
ways to do it, on

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.060
the same side or
sort of across.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.030
So, cis or trans.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:52.060
Cisplatin is a potent
anti-cancer drug, transplatin

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.160
has no use that anyone's
been able to detect.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.230
So it's the exact same
composition, but a different

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.120
arrangement of the
atoms coordinated

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.910
to the central metal.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.930
So, why should it make a
difference, they have the same

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:10.880
ingredients, why should one be
a potent anti-cancer drug and

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.450
the other one be useless?

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.820
Well, it's because of how it
interacts in the body.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.150
And so, one of the people who
have spent a lot of their

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:24.110
career studying cisplatin is
Professor Steve Lippard, who's

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.990
in the Chemistry Department
here, and he has determined

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.750
x-ray structures looking at
this, and done a number of

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:31.780
other studies.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.930
And so, here is a little cartoon
of cisplatin bound to

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:39.730
DNA, so the chlorides are
displaced when it binds, and

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:42.640
so they need to be on the same
side, otherwise it's

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.980
not going to work.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:50.960
And when cisplatin binds to
DNA, then this will act to

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.820
kill the cancer cells.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:58.950
So, the chlorides both need to
be on the same side so a

00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:59.940
combined DNA.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.490
If they're on other sides,
that's not going to interact

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.190
with DNA, and so it doesn't
have any known function.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:11.560
So, geometric isomers, same
composition, but in different

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:18.120
arrangements can have vastly
different properties.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.140
So you can have what are called
optical isomers or

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:25.100
enantiomers, and so these can
our mirror images of each

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.160
other, but they're not
superimposable.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.680
And so, when you have a mirror
image like this, it's called a

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.750
chiral molecule, and this is a
term that you'll hear a lot

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.000
when you take organic
chemistry.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.170
So, I have two mirror images up
here, so these are mirror

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:45.280
images, so the mirror plane is
between these molecules.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.340
But these molecules may look
the same in the mirror, but

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.070
they're non-superimposable.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:54.970
So, they are, in fact, different
molecules, and they

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:59.860
can have different properties
in a chiral environment.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.580
What do I mean by a chiral
environment?

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.670
Well, the human body, for
example, is a chiral

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.180
environment.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.710
So that's why a lot of drugs,
people are wanting to make

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.600
just one enantimer of the drug
and not the other, one

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.690
enantiomer can have good
properties, the

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.670
other one may not.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:24.100
All right, so let's do some
d-electron counting.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.120
This is the final thing we
need to talk about in

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.490
coordination complexes.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.110
So we're going to refer to a
thing called the d-electron

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:39.510
count of the metal, which just
has to do with a group number

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:43.470
from the periodic table minus
the oxidation number of the

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.710
metal, is going to tell us
the d-electron count.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:50.330
So, if you haven't learned how
to do oxidation numbers yet,

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.340
you need to know that for exam
3, and you need to know that

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.190
for this unit.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:58.520
So, let's look at a few examples
of this, and we'll

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.780
put up our friend, the
periodic table.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.030
So let's look at the complex
that we saw on the first page

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.420
where we had -- in the beginning
of today's lecture

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.800
where we had cobalts with
six n h 3 ligands in a

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.820
coordination complex that
had a charge of plus 3.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.240
So here, we need to figure out
the oxidation number of the

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.260
cobalt, and for this particular
group, the overall

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.950
charge of that is 0.

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:35.680
We have three hydrogens at plus
1, and we also have a

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.400
nitrogen at minus 1.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.550
And so, overall that
charge is 0.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:46.990
So we have six things of 0, and
what does that leave for

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.680
our cobalt charge?

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.020
Plus 3.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:55.520
Because overall, it now
has to equal plus 3.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.870
So, then our d count for our
electrons is going to be the

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.080
group number.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.840
And for cobalt, what's
the group number?

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.670
9.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:14.630
So minus 3 is 6, so this cobalt
in this complex is

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:21.290
what's called a d 6 system.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:31.090
All right, let's look at a
couple other examples here.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:35.820
Let's look at nickel with
carbon monoxide

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:40.800
ligands, four of them.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:47.300
What would nickel
be in this case?

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.770
Someone said zero.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:49.900
That's right.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:54.330
So this is zero, and
nickel is zero, the

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.270
overall charge is zero.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:03.950
So, our oxidation number
here is 0.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:09.170
So, our d count here, what's the
group number for nickel?

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.630
10.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:14.290
10 minus 0 is 10.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:20.860
So we have a d 10 system.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.310
So, I'm going to write another
example down and you're going

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:28.050
to tell me the answer to this
one as a clicker question.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:42.340
So we have cobalt, two waters
-- three waters -- that's

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.670
actually a mistake.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.940
It should be two.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:50.020
Two waters, because it's going
to be six things -- this is

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:54.340
not some kind of bizzaro
seven complex.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.980
So here's the correct, cobalt,
two waters, one ammonia, and

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:32.040
three chlorides with an overall
charge of minus 1.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.370
All right, let's just take 10
seconds, since we're running

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:49.260
out of time.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:53.670
So that's right, we should have
a charge of plus 2 here.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:45:00.380
This is zero, 0 minus 3, overall
minus 1, so we have a

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.990
plus 2 state.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:07.890
We have 9 minus 2, which is
7, and it's a d 7 system.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.860
N2O5 is a reagent that was used synthesize
explosives like TNT. Unfortunately, N2O5 decomposes

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.330
relatively quickly at or above room temperature,
so if you accidentally leave a bottle of it

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.430
out on the counter, you could be in trouble!
In this video, we'll approximate a solution

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.870
to the decomposition rate equation to figure
out whether a batch of N2O5 that you left

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.400
at room temperature can still be used. We'll
also determine under what conditions our approximation

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.260
is valid.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.530
This video is part of the Linearity video
series.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.640
Many complex systems are modeled or approximated
linearly because of the mathematical advantages.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.769
Hi, my name is Ben Brubaker, and I'm a professor
in the Department of Mathematics at MIT.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.889
Today we'll be talking about linear approximations.
In mathematical terms, this is just another

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:55.210
name for the tangent line to a function. But
the name suggests more. Linear approximations

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.260
can be used to simplify mathematical models
that are not analytically solvable. The approximated

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.500
model will have a solution that is only acceptable
under suitable conditions. However, it can

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.439
still illuminate the behavior of the system
within a certain acceptable range.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.280
Before watching this video, you should know
the definition of the derivative, and how

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.780
to write the equation of a line with a given
slope that passes through a given point.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.719
After watching this video, you should be able
to recognize the linear approximation of a

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.280
function as the tangent line to the function,
apply linear approximations to solve simple

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.710
differential equations, and explain the limitations
of linear approximations both mathematically

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.380
and graphically.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.009
Let's begin by defining the linear approximation.
Recall that if a function is differentiable

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.700
at a point c, then when we zoom in on the
point c, the function begins to look more

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.259
and more like a line. This only works when
the function is "smooth"â€”it doesn't have

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.100
any kinks, corners, or discontinuities. Given
a function f(x), which is differentiable at

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.060
the point c, we define the linear approximation
to be the tangent line to the function at

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.060
c. This is a line whose slope equals f'(c).

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.300
As an example, let's look at the following
cubic equation: f(x) = one thirtieth x times

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.800
x minus 2 times x plus 5. This function is
differentiable everywhere, and in particular

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.520
is differentiable at the point x=3. Find the
equation of the tangent line to this cubic

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.520
equation at x=3 for yourself.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.700
We've also found the equation for the tangent
line. To do this, we found the value of the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.290
function at 3, which we found to be 4/5. And
then we computed the derivative and evaluated

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.290
it at x=3, which we found to be 7/6. We'll
write the tangent line as T sub 3 of (x) to

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.220
remind us that we are finding the tangent
to our function at the point 3. Then the equation

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.220
for this line can be written as T sub 3 of
x equals 4/5 + 7/6 times (x-3).

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.170
Let's take a look at the graphs of f(x) and
T sub 3 of x. The function f(x) is graphed

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.090
in red. The further we zoom into the graph
at x=3, the more it begins to resemble a straight

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.500
line. The slope of the line approaches the
value of the slope of the tangent line at

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.570
3, which is drawn in blue.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.390
The tangent line certainly seems to be a good
approximation to our function when we are

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.650
close to x=3. But what about when we zoom
out? Is it still a good approximation? Let's

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.420
give a mathematical justification that the
tangent line is a good approximation. Our

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.820
function is differentiable at a point, say
x=3. This is equivalent to the statement that

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.280
when x is near 3, the slope of the secant
line is approximately equal to the slope of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.280
the tangent line. That is, for x near 3 f(x)-f(3)
over x-3, is approximately equal to the value

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.980
of the derivative at 3.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.339
In order to see why these statements are equivalent,
we need explain what we mean by "approximately

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:25.310
equal to". This means that we can make the
difference between these two sides as small

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.310
as any error bound we choose, provided that
we choose x close enough to 3.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.940
And this is exactly the definition of differentiability
at the point 3.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.810
To relate this to linear approximations, we
use a bit of algebra. First we multiply both

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.810
sides by (x-3), and we get f(x) -- f(3) approximately
equal to f'(3)(x-3). Adding f(3) to both sides,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.040
we get that f(x) is approximately equal to
f(3)+f'(3)(x-3). And this right hand side

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.460
is the equation for the tangent line at 3.
So indeed the tangent line closely approximates

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.760
the function as long as x is close to 3.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.010
Here we see the tangent line drawn in blue,
the function drawn in red. The graphs demonstrate

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.330
our mathematical proof that the tangent line
is a good approximation near x=3, but the

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.670
further we get from x=3 the worse the approximation
seems.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:42.590
Now you might see that the function and tangent
line intersect at x=-9. Is the tangent line

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.990
a good approximation for the function near
x=-9?

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.990
No, it isn't. If we move a small distance
along the tangent line away from x=-9, this

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.620
does not model the behavior of the function
near x=-9. This property is extremely important

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.010
in applicationsâ€”no measurement or observed
quantity is ever given exactly.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.550
A1 The linearization of a function that is
differentiable at x=c is just another name

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.590
for the tangent line through c.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.220
The A2 key properties of this tangent line
are that it shares the same value as the function

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.639
and the same first derivative of the function
at x=c. And A3 we've seen through both graphical

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.060
intuition and the definition of the derivative
that this linearization closely approximates

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.520
the function for points x sufficiently close
to c.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.210
Let's see how we can apply a linear approximation
to simplify a problem. Let's suppose that

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.060
you are participating in undergraduate research
in a chemistry lab. You have been using a

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.060
.01 molar solution of N2O5. You bring it out
of the refrigerator at 9:00 Monday morning,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.020
and promptly forget about it, leaving it on
the counter in the lab, which is 25 degrees

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:09.020
Celsius. When you realize you left the solution
out, 1 hour has passed. You panic.

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:16.169
The problem is that N205 decomposes into NO2
and O2 at room temperature. If the molarity

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.419
of the solution has changed significantly,
it might ruin your experiments. Experiments

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:27.940
have shown that the rate of decomposition
follows first order kinetics. This means that

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:34.190
the instantaneous rate of change in concentration
of N205 is proportional to the concentration

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:41.190
of N205. The constant of proportionality,
k, has been found experimentally to be 1.72

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:48.540
times ten to the negative 5 inverse seconds.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.990
Because you are panicking, you are having
a hard time solving this differential equation.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:59.990
Instead, find the _approximate_ decomposition
in the N205 solution after 1 hour using a

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:07.150
linear approximation at time t=0. Note that
because the reaction constant has units of

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.150
inverse seconds, the variable t must have
units of seconds.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:22.770
In order to produce a linear approximation
at t=0, we need two ingredients: the concentration

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:28.760
at time 0, and the value of the derivative
at time 0.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:34.870
The initial concentration was .01 molar. To
find the value of the derivative, we use our

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:40.719
differential equation, and we find that the
value of the derivative at time t=0 is just

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:47.719
minus k times the initial concentration at
t=0, or negative k times .01 molar. Remember

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:56.019
that k has units of inverse seconds.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:00.470
Putting this together into the formula for
the tangent line at zero, we see that the

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:07.470
linear approximation, is given by T0(t)= (.01
molar) times 1 minus $kt$.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:19.420
Now we are interested in approximating the
value at 1 hour, or 3600 seconds. Plugging

00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:26.649
in the value for k, we find that to two significant
figures T0(3600)=.0094 Molar. So the molarity

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.860
is not so different. Phew!!

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.220
Now you are feeling relieved, so when you
look back at the reaction rate, you realize

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.170
that in fact, a first order reaction rate
is telling you that the concentration is some

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:49.529
function of time whose derivative is proportional
to itself.

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:54.860
The function with this property is the exponential
function! So the concentration function is

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.670
equal to some constant times e to the negative
kt.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:06.670
The constant must be the initial concentration,
which is .01 Molar, so [N2O5]=(.01)e^{-kt}.

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:20.889
Evaluating this expression at time t=3600,
we find that the exact concentration is also

00:10:20.889 --> 00:10:27.889
.0094 Molar to two significant figures. To
be more precise, we can look at the error,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.790
which is the absolute value of the exact solution
minus the approximate solution all divided

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.899
by the exact solution.

00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:44.899
The error at time t=3600 seconds is .002 or
.2%.

00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:51.829
This is really quite good. Generally speaking,
we might consider an error of less than 5%

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:55.110
to be acceptable.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:02.110
So our linear approximation was definitely
within the acceptable range 1 hour later.

00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:08.100
But now it's Tuesday. Today you leave the
.01 Molar N2O5 on the counter for a full 10

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:14.550
hours. Oops.
We know that the exact solution is an exponential

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.139
decay.

00:11:17.139 --> 00:11:22.199
So do you think that the linear approximation
will be an over estimate, an under estimate,

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:29.199
or equal to the exact solution after 10 hours?
[pause]

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:38.670
The linear approximation of the concentration
after 10 hours at room temperature is T0(36000)=

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:46.889
.0038 Molar.
The exact solution of the concentration after

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:54.709
10 hours is .0054 Molar. Comparing these two
solutions, we see that linear approximation

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:03.160
is an under estimate as we would expect, with
error is .29 or 29%. So a linear approximation

00:12:06.529 --> 00:12:12.379
is definitely not acceptable for this time
range.

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:18.290
But now you begin to wonder, for what times
is the linear approximation at t=0 within

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:25.290
5% error of the exact solution? [pause] Because
we are only interested in positive time values,

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:36.509
you should have found that the approximation
is acceptable for times 0 less than t less

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:43.209
than 16, 700 seconds, which is about 4.5 hours.
Now that you've carefully examined this problem

00:12:43.209 --> 00:12:48.149
using linear approximation, it is probably
time to tell your graduate student adviser

00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:55.149
that you need to order a new batch of N_2
O_5 solution.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.910
Let's review. A1 The linear approximation
to a function at a point c is the tangent

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:07.040
line of a function at c. A2 This linear approximation
only accurately models the function for points

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:13.100
sufficiently close to c. A3 It is easy to
read off the derivative at a point from a

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:19.449
differential equation, and thus give a linear
approximation to the solution. In our example

00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:25.449
with the concentration of N205, we could also
solve the differential equation exactly and

00:13:25.449 --> 00:13:32.239
demonstrate that the approximation was acceptable
near the point of approximation t=0, but not

00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:34.879
so for larger time intervals.

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:39.389
Notice that we used this simple example to
illustrate linear approximation because we

00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:45.959
could also solve it exactly and use the exact
solution to determine the error. This is somewhat

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:51.049
misleading, since we often want to use linear
approximation precisely when the differential

00:13:51.049 --> 00:13:57.399
equation that describes our physical situation
does not have an analytic solution.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:02.170
So you may wonder, is there a way to estimate
the error in a linear approximation without

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:08.089
knowing the exact solution. The answer is
yes! However, it involves Taylor's Remainder

00:14:08.089 --> 00:14:13.309
theorem, which finds an acceptable range in
terms of higher order derivatives, and is

00:14:13.309 --> 00:14:19.980
beyond the scope this video.

MATTHEW VANDER
HEIDEN: So today we're

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.170
going to begin by going
over the Calvin cycle, which

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.320
I know I went quite
quickly on just

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.885
to introduce it at the
end of the last lecture.

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:24.760
And so we'll spend a
little time there first.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.950
And then we'll
move on to discuss

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.040
the main topic of today,
which is the pentose phosphate

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.390
pathway.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.890
But before we get
there, I just want

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.960
to remind you about the Calvin
cycle, which you'll recall

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.550
happened in three phases.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.970
So there was the
fixation, reduction,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.520
and regeneration phases.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.140
And so remember, fixation was
this special reaction that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.220
occurs only in photosynthetic
organisms catalyzed by rubisco

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.630
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.540
where a
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.430
molecule combines with CO2,
and then is split to produce

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.200
2,3-phosphoglycerates.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.160
This was the reaction
that Calvin described

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.120
as the dark reaction, that
now bears the name of this

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.760
as the Calvin cycle.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.120
Once you get those
2,3-phosphoglycerates,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.170
you can then enter them
into gluconeogenesis.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.820
This, of course,
happens in the stroma

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.690
of the chloroplast in eukaryotic
photosynthetic organisms,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.590
and it's exactly the reactions
for the reduction phase

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.210
that we learned about for
glycolysis or gluconeogenesis

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.650
when we described it at the
beginning of the course.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.310
And so that 3PG is turned into
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates and

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.690
dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.790
Of course, that
has to go backwards

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.110
through the phosphoglycerate
kinase as well

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.540
as the glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase step

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.850
that we learned about
when we discussed

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.860
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.160
And so therefore, our cost ATP,
as well as need a source of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.320
electrons to go through
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.250
dehydrogenase, and that
those come from NADPH

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.220
when this is occurring in
photosynthetic organisms

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.840
and the chloroplast.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.610
Once you get these
trioses, of course,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.670
you can continue
with gluconeogenesis,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.520
combine them at the aldolase
step to make fructose

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.780
1,6-bisphosphate.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.010
That can be-- take the
phosphate off by FPPase

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.230
to give you fructose
6-phosphate.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.060
That can then be isomerized
to glucose 6-phosphate, which,

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.040
of course, could be further--

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.200
remove the phosphate
and go to glucose,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.880
or be turned into glucose
1-phosphate or whatever else

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.530
to build starch or another
storage sugar for the plant--

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.200
combine glucose and
a fructose, say,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.130
to make sucrose, table sugar.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.060
And so dose reduction steps
we didn't spend a lot of time

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.270
on, because it's really
gluconeogenesis with the use

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.130
of NADPH rather than
NADH, as we described it

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.700
when we describe
gluconeogenesis back

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.930
at the early part of the course.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.400
Now, once you run this part
of the cycle that, of course,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.440
gives you glucose.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.590
But of course, in order to
net run this as a cycle,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.990
much like we saw
for the TCA cycle,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.910
that if this is going
to run as a cycle,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.720
you need a source of carbon
acceptors for the next CO2.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.540
Anaplerosis, that we
described in the TCA cycle--

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.690
remember, we needed a
source of oxaloacetate

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.240
that could net accept
the next acytal-CoA

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.010
to continue running the cycle.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.180
Same thing happens here.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.970
You need a source of
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.270
so rubisco has
something to add CO2 to.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.770
And so anaplerosis of this
cycle involves regeneration

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.680
of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.260
And that's the confusing
set of reactions

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.150
that I introduced
last time that we'll

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.340
spend much more time
talking about today.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.180
And so, effectively, this
comes from both 6 and 3 carbon

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.120
units-- so glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate and fructose

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.360
6-phosphate with a series of
2- and 3-carbon swaps that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.620
ultimately generate these three
pentoses, xylulose 5-phosphate,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.520
ribose 5-phosphate, and
another xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.430
Once you have those
xylulose 5-phosphate,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.880
you can see differs from
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.460
by the stereochemistry
at the three position.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.060
And so an epimerase
reaction can fix that.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.800
We talked about those earlier.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.610
And then, of course, you need to
phosphorylation the 1 position

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.150
on the sugar to give you
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.060
That's how you deal with
the 2 xylulose 5-phosphates.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.880
And ribose
5-phosphate, of course,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.910
you need to change it from
the aldose to the ketose.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.010
So that's an isomerase reaction
plus a phosphorylation to give

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.140
you ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.450
Now, if you run
this entire cycle,

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.320
if you're going to net
generate a hexose--

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.420
a glucose or some other hexose--

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.630
for the plant to store
as a storage sugar--

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.400
of course, if it's
coming from CO2,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.590
you need to run
the cycle six times

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.930
to take six CO2s and net
generate one hexose that

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.270
can be stored for later.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.000
And so I just want to
start by showing you

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.460
that this accounting can work.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.920
So if we start here
at the top with six

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.410
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphates
and add 6 CO2 molecules,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.530
you're going to net generate
12 3-phosphoglycerates.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.850
Those 12 3-phosphoglycerates
can be turned into, of course,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.500
12 glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.020
So that's going to cost 12 ATPs.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.990
And 12 is from the light
reactions and photosynthesis.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.060
And so now you have 12
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.660
I'm going to divide them
up in the following way.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.970
If I take two of those
and place them over here,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.320
then take the remaining
10, use five of those

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.200
here and turn five more into
dihydroxyacetone phosphate--

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.060
so that gives me 5 plus
5 plus 2 equals 12 total.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.140
Of these five glyceraldehyde
3-phosphates and five

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.680
dihydroxyacetone phosphates,
I can run them through

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.385
the aldolase step to
generate five fructose

00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:18.920
1,6-bisphosphates, turn those
five fructose 1,6-bisphosphates

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.360
into five fructose 6-phosphates.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.430
And, of course, I
need one of those

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.210
to ultimately generate a
glucose 6-phosphate or whatever

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.050
hexose that I'm going to
have as my net product.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.870
If I do that, that
leaves me four left over.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.630
And so I'm going to
allocate them such

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.190
that I have two
here and two here.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.270
So the two I have here can be
combined with the remaining two

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.960
glyceraldehyde
3-phosphates to generate

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.815
two xylulose
5-phosphates and two

00:07:57.815 --> 00:08:02.070
erythrose 4-phosphates,
a 5-carbon sugar,

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.230
and a 4-carbon sugar.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.920
This 5-carbon sugar-- this
xylulose 5-phosphate--

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.800
I can then use a
epimerase and ATP.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.970
So that's two ATPs
running back through.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.530
And that's going to net give me
two ribulose-1,5-bisphosphates,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.860
which I'll draw up there later.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.440
Coming back down here, I
have this two erythrose

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.900
4-phosphates and two
fructose 6-phosphates.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.820
So this was a two carbon swap.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.640
So I took the two
carbons for this step

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.520
to generate the xylulose
5-phosphate and erythrose

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.570
4-phosphate.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.809
I took two carbons from
fructose 6-phosphate

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.300
added them to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.810
That's how I got the 5-carbon
xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.560
And that left me with a
4-carbon erythrose 4-phosphate.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.210
So all the carbons add up.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.420
Now I take this 4-carbon
erythrose 4-phosphate

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.530
and the two remaining
fructose 6-phosphates.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.530
And if I move three
carbons from here

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:10.290
to there, what I end up getting
is a 7-carbon sedoheptulose

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:16.990
7-phosphate and a 3-carbon
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.060
And so two in, two out--

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.780
now I'm going to move two
carbons again-- to carbons

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.940
from sedoheptulose
7-phosphate to

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.820
the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.340
And that's going to give me 2.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.200
7 minus 2 is 5.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.150
3 plus 2 is 5.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.500
So two 5-carbon sugars,
two ribose 5-phosphates,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.650
and two xylulose 5-phosphates--

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.830
xylulose 5-phosphates
through the epimerase,

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.290
costing me two ATP.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:54.320
Ribose 5-phosphate through
isomerase, costing me two ATP.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.510
And when I net generate is two
ribulose 5-phosphates here,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.490
two ribulose
5-phosphates there, two

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.350
ribulose 5-phosphates there.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.360
2 plus 2 plus 2 equals 6.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.260
And so by running
this cycle six times,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:17.330
six ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
in, six CO2 in, six

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:25.430
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
out, and one hexose out.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.890
So all the accounting adds up.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.660
I know there's a lot
of moving pieces there.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.770
It's confusing.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.680
But we'll see as we go through
today why it works this way.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.680
However, before we
get there, I just

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.290
want to stress what we've
actually accomplished here.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:56.090
So basically, we started
with six CO2 molecules.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:05.430
And we added to that 12 NADPHs.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.210
And so those 12
NADPHs came there

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.490
through the
3-phosphoglycerate to generate

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.950
the glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate-- so running

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.250
through the GAPDH
reaction using NADPH.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.770
And so we had to
do that 12 times

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:28.500
plus a total of
18 ATP molecules.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.430
And so 12 of them up there
through the phosphoglycerate

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:38.880
kinase cost me 12 ATPs, plus I
needed an additional six ATPs

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.900
to regenerate the
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphates

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.810
re-phosphorylation the six
pentoses that I generated

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.000
through the regeneration
phase of the Calvin cycle.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.850
And so that's 12 plus 2 plus 2
plus 2, or 12 plus 6 equals 18.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:07.830
And what I net generate
is one glucose molecule

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.930
from my six CO2.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.420
And, of course, to do this, I
needed a lot of energy input.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.610
That comes from the 12 NADPHs
and the 18 ATPs, which,

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:29.780
of course, are the products
of the light reactions

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.010
of photosynthesis.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:46.450
And so you'll recall that if
we go back to our chloroplast,

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.500
the light reactions
are happening here

00:12:48.500 --> 00:13:00.810
at the thylakoid membranes
of the chloroplast.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.460
And that's where
we're generating

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.590
our ATP and our NADPH
from the light reactions.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.250
And then here in the
stroma of the chloroplast

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:15.300
is where we're doing the dark
reactions, and so perfectly

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.110
positioned where the
ATP and from the light

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:24.090
reactions are there to
fuel the dark reactions,

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.860
the Calvin cycle, and
net have this turn CO2

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.830
and generate a pentose--

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.550
glucose, fructose, combine
them to make a sucrose,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.480
or a bunch of glucose that we
can build as alpha-1,4 polymers

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.340
to make starch, depending on
the organism and how it chooses

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:50.260
to store its sugars.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.610
So that is the Calvin cycle.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.230
But what I want to do now
is look a bit more closely

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.080
on why it works
this way-- that is,

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.870
why nature chose this confusing
system with two and three

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.710
carbon swaps.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.840
Wouldn't it just have
been easier to just,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.750
I don't know, take CO2s
and build a glucose

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.460
molecule together?

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.423
Well of course,
the reason it does

00:14:18.423 --> 00:14:20.090
this has to do with
the chemistry of how

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.410
the reactions happen.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:28.550
And if we look more closely
at the various steps and these

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:36.890
swaps that take place in
the regeneration phase,

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:41.580
basically what we see is
in every single situation--

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.400
so it's basically this
reaction, this reaction,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:50.840
and this reaction, which are the
swap part of the regeneration

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.650
phase--

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.910
you see that in every case,
we're moving two carbons.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.770
And so here two
carbons were removed

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:03.200
from fructose 6-phosphate to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.560
So 6 minus 2 equals 4.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.720
3 plus 2 equals 5.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.490
That's how we get
erythrose 4-phosphate

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.830
and xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.500
Here we started with
our fructose 6-phosphate

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.820
and our erythrose 4-- phosphate,
moved three carbons from here

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.820
to there.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.980
So 6 minus 3 equals 3.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.620
4 plus 3 equals 7.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.750
So that's a three carbon swap.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.860
And then here, again, is
another two carbon swap--

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.480
so three carbon glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate, 7-carbon

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.610
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.590
Move two carbons
from here to there.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.910
7 minus 2 is 5.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.470
3 plus 2 is 5.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.160
And that's how we get
those two pentoses.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.720
Now, if we look more
closely at this,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.510
what you'll see in
every case, the swap

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:55.460
involves a ketose and an aldose.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.430
So here we have
fructose 6-phosphate.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.320
It's a ketose.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.570
Here we have
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.740
It's an aldose.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.940
And what we end up
with is the aldose

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.610
getting longer by
two carbons to become

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:15.580
a ketose and the ketose
getting shorter by two carbons

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.020
to become an aldose.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.920
Same thing happens here--

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.940
here we have a
ketose and an aldose.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.020
We do the swap.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.550
We have the aldose getting
longer by 3 carbons

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.570
to become a ketose,
and the ketose becoming

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:36.610
shorter three carbons, in this
case, to become an aldose.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.610
And lastly, same swap
we showed before--

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:44.410
here we have a
ketose and an aldose.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:51.490
The ketose gets shorter by two
carbons to become an aldose.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:57.205
And the aldose gets longer by
two carbons to become a ketose.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:08.230
So I recognize
that it's very hard

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.250
to follow that when I'm saying
aldose and ketose over and over

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.490
and over again.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.349
But effectively in every single
case, what we're doing is

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:24.400
we're moving two
carbons or three carbons

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:35.180
and we're moving them from
a ketose to an aldose.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:41.090
And so that means that our
product, when we do that,

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:49.250
is we end up getting
a longer ketose.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:18:04.720
So our former aldose
plus 2 or plus 3 carbons

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.240
becomes a longer ketose.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:17.940
And then we end up
getting a shorter aldose

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:28.920
from the former ketose minus
two or minus three carbons.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.930
So if you go and
look at that, you

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.640
will see in every
single case where

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.950
we're doing those two
and three carbon swaps,

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.060
we're effectively
following that rule.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.640
So these reactions, which
I've abbreviated up there,

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:52.110
are catalyzed by
enzymes called TK,

00:18:52.110 --> 00:19:01.310
which stands for
transketolase or TA,

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.640
which stands for transaldolase--

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:15.500
TK, transketolase,
TA, transaldolase.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.730
I want to point out that
these are the enzymes that

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.945
catalyze the transketolase
is going to catalyze the two

00:19:23.945 --> 00:19:26.900
carbon swaps.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.030
And the transaldolase is going
to catalyze the three carbon

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.500
swaps.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.200
And so twice we
used transketolase,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.360
once we used transaldolase.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:44.450
Transketolase moved the
two carbons from the ketose

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.130
to the aldose, giving you a
longer ketose and a shorter

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.210
aldose.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.150
And transaldolase
also catalyzed,

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.810
in this case, the
3-carbon swap, giving you

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.250
a longer ketose and a
shorter aldose following

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.910
the exact same rules.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:10.220
Now, these enzymes is
why it works this way.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.810
And I want to point out that the
enzyme names are absolutely not

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.300
helpful for remembering
what they do.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:22.340
Both enzymes use a ketose
donor and an aldose acceptor.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.240
Both generate products
where the former aldose

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.040
becomes longer as a ketose
and the former ketose

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.040
becomes shorter as an aldose.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:40.730
So don't rely on the enzyme
names to remember what they do.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.950
You'll see partially
why they're named

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.080
what they are as we go
through the mechanisms.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.170
But for now, just remember that
transketolase, two carbons,

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.410
transaldolase, three carbons--

00:20:54.410 --> 00:21:00.290
different numbers of carbons
moved, but always follow

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.870
the exact same rules.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.870
I know this is confusing
and so it's probably better

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.110
to go through
exactly what is going

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.815
on using a couple examples.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:27.990
So let's start off
here with a ketose.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.100
So here is a ketose.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:58.340
This is, of course,
fructose 6-phosphate.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.670
And so fructose
6-phosphate is a ketose.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.360
If we use this step
here as an example--

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:12.200
fructose 6-phosphate and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate--

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.165
so here we start
with our ketose.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:23.915
And if we also use
with it a aldose--

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.125
so here is glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate,

00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:51.180
which is, of course, an aldose.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:59.230
So if we subject this to a
transketolase reaction, which,

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.970
remember, moving
two carbons, we're

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.120
going to take the two
carbons from the ketose

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.050
and move them to the aldose.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.940
So if we do that, what
we end up with is--

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.410
if we take two
carbons from here,

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.810
we end up with a shorter aldose.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.775
And we end up with
a longer ketose.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:34.680
So transketolase reaction--
ketose donor of two carbons,

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.970
give them to an aldose,
acceptor of two carbons.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:44.190
That gives me an
aldose that's shorter--

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.000
minus 2 carbons.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.670
So the bottom four carbons
from fructose 6-phosphate

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.360
now become a erythrose
4-phosphate, an aldose.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.140
And here we have our aldose
accepts the two carbons.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:05.490
And so now we generate a ketose
that is longer by two carbons.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:11.640
And that gives me
this longer ketose--

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.080
so in this case,
xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.950
So this is the exact
transketolase reaction

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.790
that is right there--
this first part,

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.970
fructose 6-phosphate
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.890
give me an erythrose 4-phosphate
and a xylulose 5-phosphate.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.700
So two carbons move from
a ketose to an aldose,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.615
gives me a shorter aldose
and a longer ketose.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:53.870
Now, if we do exactly
the same thing,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.760
but this time rather than
do a transketolase reaction,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.220
do a transaldolase
reaction-- so now

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.800
I'm going to move three carbons.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.620
So same thing-- ketose
donor, aldose acceptor.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.800
So now I'm going to end up
with-- if I donate three

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.280
carbons from that
ketose, what I end up

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:25.280
with is 3 carbons remaining.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.940
And if I start with this
3-carbon as an acceptor,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.320
move three carbons over, now
I end up with a longer ketose.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.390
So instead do a
transaldolase reaction--

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.540
take three carbons
from the ketose,

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.120
transfer them to the aldose.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.720
That means the ketose now
gets shorter by three carbons

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.840
and becomes an aldose.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.590
And the former aldose gets
longer by three carbons

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.080
and becomes a ketose.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.780
And so if I use these two
things as substrate-- fructose

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.490
6-phosphate and those are
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.410
what do I generate?

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.220
I generate another
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.620
fructose 6-phosphate,
where all I do

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.710
is scramble which
carbons are aware.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.500
And so this, obviously,
is not a reaction

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.350
I showed for how you do
anaplerosis of the Calvin

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.830
cycle, but clearly can happen.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.650
These transketolase and
transaldolase enzymes

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.910
are highly reversible.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:28.120
And so this is, of course, is
happening-- scrambling carbons

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.530
around, but there's no net
generation or consumption

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:34.390
of anything, because,
of course, we're

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.180
just moving carbons between
a ketose and an aldose,

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.560
generating the same ketose
and the same aldose using

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.480
these particular substrates.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.410
But if we look at how it worked
where we showed it here--

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.230
fructose 6-phosphate
erythrose 4-phosphate--

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.260
we end up moving
those three carbons

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.210
onto erythrose 4-phosphate.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.700
That gives us
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.240
and leaves us with
a shorter aldose

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.480
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.930
And so I color-coded
the carbons here

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.110
to show how transketolase
and transaldolase work.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.840
And if you go back over here
through the Calvin cycle,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.600
you will note that every single
one of the reactions where

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.810
I drew transketolase
and transaldolase

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:27.540
follows those exact rules.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.820
So why does it work this way?

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.120
Well, it works this way
because of how transketolase

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.630
and transaldolase
work as enzymes.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.980
And so as I said at the
beginning of the course

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.190
and have now alluded
to several times,

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.360
is that biochemistry is
just nature repurposing

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.950
the same chemistries,
the same reactions,

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.140
with slight variations
over and over

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.420
and over again to
build that complexity.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.800
And I think that is
very evident here.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.490
So a lot of complexity in what
we described, but it's really

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.770
just using two
enzymes-- transketolase

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.300
and transaldolase.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.790
And transketolase and
transaldolase basically

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.520
use variations on chemistry
that we've already

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.010
seen to catalyze
these reactions, which

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:20.173
is almost certainly why
it evolved this way,

00:30:20.173 --> 00:30:21.840
because you already
have a reaction that

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.370
catalyzes something.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:24.690
You tweak it.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.960
And now you can get these
swaps and nature figures

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.860
out a way to have it work.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.020
And so what are those reactions?

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.100
So transketolase,
which, remember,

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.550
catalyzes the 2-carbon movement.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.560
That's two carbons
that are moving.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.940
It uses TPP+.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.540
So that's, remember,
thiamine pyrophosphate.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.950
We saw it before.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:57.120
It was involved in those
decarbonization reactions

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.820
of alpha-keto acids.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.090
We saw it in the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.910
to turn pyruvate
into acetyl-CoA.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.940
We saw it in ethanol
metabolism to turn pyruvate

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.380
into acetaldehyde.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.030
And we saw it in the TCA cycle
to turn alpha-ketogluterate

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.330
into succinate.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.690
And in all of those
cases, we decarboxylated--

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.327
that is broke a carbon-carbon
bond of an alpha-ketoacid.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.620
And that used TPP+.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.460
And basically what happens in
the transketolase reaction is

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.850
TPP+ plus is also used to
break a carbon-carbon bond.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.660
But this time, rather
than releasing CO2,

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:47.070
it's basically moving
the 2-carbon unit over

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:52.280
to another molecule, as
I'll show in a minute.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:58.110
Transaldolase, which,
remember, moves three carbons,

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.320
does not use TPP+.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:10.290
Instead, it uses an
aldolase-like mechanism

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.520
to move the three carbons.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.530
And so aldolase, you remember,
if you think way back to when

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.370
we described glycolysis,
aldolase broke

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.325
the carbon-carbon bond
to take you from fructose

00:32:23.325 --> 00:32:28.230
1,6-bisphosphate to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.000
and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.500
And so that was done with
an active site lysine.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.830
And transaldolase
basically repurposed

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.130
that reaction-- also has
an active site lysine,

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:43.470
breaks a carbon-carbon
bond, but this time

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:49.290
to transfer the 3-carbon
unit from ketose donor

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.108
to an aldose acceptor.

00:32:51.108 --> 00:32:52.650
And when we go
through the mechanism,

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.710
you'll see it will be
very reminiscent of,

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.720
if you look back
in your notes, how

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.730
aldolase worked in glycolysis.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:13.050
So let's start with the
mechanism of transketolase.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:18.240
So transit delays uses
thiamine pyrophosphate.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:27.350
So remember this here
is the active part

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:31.310
of thiamine pyrophosphate,
the stabilized carbanion.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:06.740
So let's here just draw
a generic ketose donor.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.260
So this intermediate
is very similar to what

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.145
we saw for the--

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:10.580
when we did decarboxilation
of the alpha-ketoacid.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.930
Basically, this same
mechanism would occur.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:18.200
But rather than
release CO2, which gets

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:30.640
released here instead
is this shorter aldose

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.570
with two carbons that
are lost and remain here

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:47.419
on the active site of the enzyme
on thiamine pyrophosphate.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:07.910
Now, this molecule here then
needs to be transferred to a--

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.345
so here we have our
aldose acceptor.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:56.030
So that then will
regenerate TPP+.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.750
And, of course,
what we're left with

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:22.110
is our former aldose, which
now becomes a ketose that's

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.120
two carbons longer.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.970
And so ketose donor, TPP+
breaks off the two carbons,

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:37.750
releases that ketose two
carbons shorter as an aldose.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.730
Those two carbons
are then transferred

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.320
to an aldose acceptor.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.330
And it becomes two carbons
longer and becomes a ketose.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.430
And so the net
result is is that we

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.970
take two carbons
from the ketose donor

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.520
give them to the
aldose acceptor.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.940
The ketose gets
shorter by two carbons

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.250
to become a shorter aldose.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:04.090
And the former aldose acceptor
gets longer by two carbons

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.610
to become a ketose.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.050
And this is, basically,
repurposing very similar

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:15.700
chemistry to what we saw
for the decarbonization

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.320
of alpha-ketoacids.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.090
So that's how
transketolase works.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.620
This is how transaldolase works.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:37.810
And so this works to move,
of course, three carbons.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:40.410
And so this is going
to work much more

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:48.890
like what we saw for
the aldolase reaction

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:49.780
in glycolysis.

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:33.600
So let's here use this here
as our generic ketose donor.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.345
So this is going to be a
donor of three carbons--

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:48.550
so active site lysine
and transaldolase place.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:40.210
So basically, this should
look very familiar to you

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:45.760
as the mechanism for how
aldolase worked to break

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.240
the carbon-carbon bond to divide
fructose 1,6-bisphosphonate

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.170
to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
and dihydroxyacetone phosphate,

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:58.900
except, in this case, what we're
left with is taking this ketose

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.190
donor.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:05.530
And it releases an aldose
that's three carbons shorter

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:13.560
while retaining, down
to the enzyme, the three

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:25.460
carbons from the ketose
donor, just like we

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.280
saw for the aldolase reaction.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:44.270
Now, when we saw the
aldolase reaction--

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:49.053
glycolysis, of course-- we just
took this off the molecule.

00:43:49.053 --> 00:43:51.470
And that's how we ended up
with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:54.560
from the bottom and
dihydroxyacetone on the top.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.780
The difference here
is is now we're

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.460
going to use this
as a way to combine

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:06.140
it, move this 3-carbon unit
rather than just releasing it,

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.985
transferred over to
an aldose acceptor.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:53.350
And then, once we re-take
the 3-carbon unit and add it

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:57.750
to the aldose acceptor, you'll
see that then you release this,

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:01.230
now, aldose three carbons
longer as a ketose--

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.410
again, very similar mechanism,
if you look back on your notes,

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.670
to how aldolase
worked in glycolysis.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.730
And so the net effective
the transaldolase reaction

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:16.410
is that we take three
carbons from a ketose donor.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:23.160
We end up releasing an aldose
that's three carbons shorter,

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.410
take those three
carbons, transfer them

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:29.280
to an aldose acceptor,
and now generate a ketose

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.020
that is three carbons longer.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:40.190
And so this ultimately
moves to carbon units

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.610
in the case of transketolase,
three carbon units

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:46.190
in the case of transaldolase.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:51.720
It evolved this way because it's
repurposing existing chemistry

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.420
to allow these two and
three carbon swaps.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.660
That ultimately gives
you the flexibility

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:01.620
to build a cycle like
the Calvin cycle, where

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:06.180
one can interconvert 3-carbon
sugars and 6-carbon sugars

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:11.160
with 5-carbon sugars and
ultimately make that cycle

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.330
work.

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:16.590
And so on the Calvin cycle this
is useful because we can start

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.560
with the 5-carbon
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.070
and net generate a hexose
as a storage sugar,

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:28.530
while regenerating our 5-carbon
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:32.010
But it has an additional benefit
in that this is also a way

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.050
to generate 5-carbon sugars.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:37.590
And so you can see
that ribose 5-phosphate

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:41.550
is one of the intermediates
in the carbon cycle.

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:45.420
And, of course, ribose
is a useful sugar

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.010
to generate nucleoside.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.890
So all the time you spent
talking about RNA and DNA

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.760
with Professor
Yaffe, you saw lots

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.840
of 5-carbon sugars,
lots of pentoses,

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.090
as the ribose in
those backbones.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:04.080
And so it's not just-- you
know now, not just nucleosides.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.750
It's also part of
lots of cofactors--

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:11.310
NAD, FAD, coenzyme A.
All of those cofactors

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:16.620
ended up having
nucleosides in them--

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.220
and so lots of ribose
needed by the cell

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.500
in order to make nucleosides.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:27.690
And this is a way to, for at
least photosynthetic organisms,

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:33.570
the Calvin cycle, a way for
them to make ribose to generate

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.430
all those nucleosides.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:39.570
Now, that's great if you're
a photosynthetic organism,

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:44.010
because you can run the Calvin
cycle and do it in a way

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:49.050
that you can store carbon
for the night as some hexose

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.090
that you can burn
later when you don't

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.730
have light to carry
out the light reactions

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.170
of photosynthesis.

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:57.360
Or, if you want to
grow, you can use

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.450
it to make nucleosides
and replicate your genome,

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:04.230
or make RNA, or make ribosomes.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:08.370
And in fact, the Calvin
cycle generating ribose

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:10.230
is a way to get those.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.330
You'll see when we get
to this in a few lectures

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:15.660
that ribose 5-phosphate
is the starting point

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:20.880
to generate both purine
and pyrimidine nucleotides.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:25.500
However, this reactions,
the Calvin cycle,

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.110
is unique to
photosynthetic organisms.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:31.170
But of course animals,
including us-- are all

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:35.400
nonphotosynthetic organisms--
also need to make ribose.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.970
And we also need a
way to make NADPH.

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.640
And we need a source of
NADPH for the same reason

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.200
plants needed it.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.210
And that is we need something to
have an NADPH/NADP ratio that's

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:51.030
useful to keep our
glutathione reduced.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:55.260
That allows us to keep our
cells in a reducing state,

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.020
battle reactive
oxygen species, help

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.230
with reductive biosynthesis.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:04.890
We all know that if
we eat too much food,

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:09.010
we can all store those
excess calories as fat.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:10.890
Fat is reduced carbon.

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:13.650
Making their reduced
carbon in the fatty acids

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:17.520
is going to require a
source of electrons.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.770
All organisms, that
source of electrons

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.380
is going to be NADPH,
which makes sense,

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:26.910
because an NADPH/NADP
ratio that's more reduced

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:29.460
can favor reduction reactions.

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.010
And in our next
lecture, we will see

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:36.270
how that's used to actually
store carbon as fat when

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:40.020
there's excess NADPH around.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.810
Now, that makes a lot of sense.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:48.150
But obviously, as
nonphotosynthetic organisms,

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:51.090
we, as well as all non
photosynthetic organisms,

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:53.950
can't rely on photosynthesis
in the Calvin cycle.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:57.540
And so we need
another pathway that

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:03.240
allows us to do both
NADPH production as well

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.680
as ribose production.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.400
And that's where we get to
the pentose phosphate pathway.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:43.400
And so the pentose
phosphate pathway, the PPP--

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:50.110
also sometimes referred to as
the pentose phosphate shunt--

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:53.950
is a major pathway
that all organisms,

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:56.440
photosynthetic and
nonphotosynthetic,

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:02.620
can use to generate NADPH,
which is useful for cells

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:08.910
as a source of reducing power,
as well as ribose, which

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:10.770
is going to be
necessary if we're

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:17.250
going to build nucleosides
and cofactors that

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:18.885
contain nucleosides sites.

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:27.790
Now, how one runs the pentose
phosphate pathway to get

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:33.640
these two products is
conceptually akin to the Calvin

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.190
cycle.

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:38.070
But it's a Calvin
cycle in reverse.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:42.420
And so if we look at what really
happens in the Calvin cycle,

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:46.710
we start with a 5-carbon
sugar, we add CO2,

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:50.730
we reduce it with NADPH
and ATP, and we end up

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:54.010
generating a 6-carbon sugar.

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:56.790
And so the pentose
phosphate pathway

00:53:56.790 --> 00:54:01.320
is we're going to start
with a 6-carbon sugar.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:07.680
We're going to
oxidize to generate

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.120
CO2 and a 5-carbon sugar.

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.210
And if we oxidize, we're going
to end up-- those electrons

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.710
have to go somewhere.

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:20.970
And so we can put
those electrons and net

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:23.700
generate NADPH.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.270
The Calvin cycle is, of
course, doing reduction.

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:30.720
Remember, reduced carbon
is energy storage.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.870
Oxidizing carbon
is energy release.

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.930
And so the Calvin cycle,
we had to put energy in.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:39.240
That energy, of course,
came from photosynthesis.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:44.160
That's the magic of us
harvesting energy from the sun

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.050
in order to do biology.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:49.590
And so the light
products, the NADPH

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.030
came from
photosynthesis in order

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.100
to net run the Calvin cycle.

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:56.400
But just like we saw with
glycolysis and gluconeogensis,

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.440
if one direction of a pathway
requires energy input,

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.200
well the other direction
is going to be favorable.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.070
And so if we oxidize
a 6-carbon sugar

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:07.590
to make a 5-carbon
sugar and CO2,

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:11.590
that intuitively, hopefully
by now, should be favorable.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.500
And so we can use
that energy release

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:20.160
to charge up an NADPH to NDP
ratio that now gives the cell

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.050
a source of reducing power--

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:25.440
so energetically makes sense.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.630
Now, this pentose
phosphate pathway

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:30.000
is also sometimes
called a shunt,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.280
because really
the way this works

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.690
is as a branch of glycolysis--
a shunt of glycolysis,

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.360
if you will, because
it's an alternative way

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.900
to run glycolysis and get NADPH.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:50.250
And so the glucose
6-phosphate-- remember,

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:56.070
for glycolysis we
can isomerize to give

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:58.260
us fructose 6-phosphate.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:02.205
And then ultimately
in glycolysis,

00:56:02.205 --> 00:56:08.600
we can generate glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate down to pyruvate,

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:13.760
which can go to TCA cycle, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.250
Of course, glucose
is a 6-carbon sugar.

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:18.770
Fructose is a 6-carbon sugar.

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:23.990
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
is a 3-carbon sugar--

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:28.010
aldose, ketose, aldose.

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:30.950
So if we take our
glucose 6-phosphate

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:35.210
and we send it into
the pentose phosphate

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:38.460
pathway, the pentose
phosphate shunt,

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.060
and rather than
oxidize the glucose

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.090
as we did in
glycolysis, we oxidize

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:52.230
it to release CO2 and
generate a 5-carbon sugar,

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:56.310
like a ribose 5-phosphate.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:57:02.600
Now we have a way to get
5-carbon sugars pentoses

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:06.660
by oxidizing
glucose 6-phosphate.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.880
Those electrons have
to go somewhere.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:19.750
And so that ends up being
a way to generate NADPH.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:26.800
Once we get those
5-carbon sugars,

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.230
that's great if we want
to build nucleotides.

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:33.680
But it turns out
we could also run

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.400
a bunch of transketolase
and transaldolase reactions

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.580
and interconvert 5-carbon
sugars with 6-carbon sugars

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:44.730
and 3-carbon sugars, just as
we did in the Calvin cycle.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:46.250
And if we run it
this way, you can

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:49.430
see that I can now
make this effectively

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:51.620
an alternative version
of glycolysis--

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:52.910
a shunt, if you will.

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:55.010
Start with glucose
6-phosphate rather than

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:56.900
going the traditional way.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.330
First, go to make
5-carbon sugars

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:04.970
and then bring those
carbons back into glycolysis

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:08.390
that I can then further
oxidize to pyruvate

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:11.760
and oxidize in the
TCA cycle, et cetera.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.020
And so all of this--
so glycolysis happens

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.490
and the cytosol, the
pentose phosphate

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:21.580
pathway happens in the cytosol.

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:26.650
And really, this can be thought
of as two separate phases.

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:36.370
And so this glucose
6-phosphate going to a pentose,

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:40.210
like ribose
5-phosphate, plus CO2,

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:47.345
that is referred to as the
oxidative pentose phosphate

00:58:47.345 --> 00:58:47.845
pathway--

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.020
the oxidative pentose
phosphate pathway,

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:04.410
because it's using
oxidation of glucose carbon

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:07.950
to generate ribose
5-phosphate and NADPH.

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:18.760
Or, this swaps here
between 5-carbon sugars

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:22.450
and 6-carbon sugars and 3-carbon
sugars-- very similar to what

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:29.560
we saw in the Calvin cycle,
which is really interconverting

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:36.260
6-carbon and 3-carbon
sugars with 5-carbon sugars.

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:42.970
So that is referred to as
the nonoxidative pentose

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:43.780
phosphate pathway.

00:59:53.308 --> 00:59:54.100
And it makes sense.

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:57.250
All those transketolase
and transaldolase reactions

00:59:57.250 --> 01:00:00.670
that I just discussed
with you in great detail--

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:04.120
no electron movement,
no oxidation reduction,

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.340
nonoxidative PPP.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.650
Similar to the
Calvin cycle, it's

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:14.530
converting pentoses with
trioses and hexoses.

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:22.020
So this should be very clear
now that this is actually

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.260
a really useful
things for cells,

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:30.120
because having this
pentose phosphate pathway

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.920
work in these two different
ways, the oxidative

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.810
than the nonoxidative, gives
cells a lot of flexibility

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:41.910
to make pentoses when they need
ribose to make nucleosides, as

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:46.230
well as NADPH when
they need NADPH to deal

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:49.080
with, say, oxidative stress.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.580
Suppose you take a drug, causes
oxidative stress in your cells,

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.250
pentose phosphate
pathway can increase

01:00:56.250 --> 01:01:00.270
as a way to make more NADPH.

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:03.720
So if a cell needs NADPH because
there's oxidative stress,

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.470
it can run the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:09.900
if it also needs to
make ribose great

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.020
it has a source of
pentoses to make ribose.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:16.110
However, if it just needs
NADPH and not ribose, it

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:18.030
and then take those
ribose carbons,

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.360
re-enter them into glycolysis.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.070
So running this shunt allows
you to get NADPH as well as ATP

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:30.150
while oxidizing glucose carbon.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:34.080
However, if you need ribose
and you don't need NADPH,

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.190
well, forget the oxidative
PPP, just take sugars

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:41.580
from glycolysis and shunt
them over via the nonoxidative

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.770
PPP to make ribose.

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:47.730
And so you can run this
direction if you need NADPH.

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:53.610
And you can run this direction
if you just need ribose.

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:59.830
So this is great
because it gives cells

01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:05.440
a lot of flexibility.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:11.530
And so these two pathways,
really, can work together.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.480
Or, they can work
separately depending

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.910
on what the cell
needs, and can really

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:21.460
be tuned in a way to allow
the cell to get both ribose

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:24.550
and NADPH and match
it as demands.

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:27.430
And so in a lot of ways,
it's probably better

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:31.480
to think of them as
two separate pathways--

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:37.570
a so-called oxidative PPP, which
is really glucose 6-phosphate

01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:58.840
plus 2 NADP+, generating 2
NADPH plus pentose plus CO2.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:07.440
And a nonoxidative
PPP, which is really

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:21.890
interconverting 3 pentoses
with 2 hexoses and 1 triose.

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:26.030
So 3 times 5 is 15 carbons.

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:34.620
2 times 6 is 12 carbons
plus 3 carbons, 15 carbons.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.460
This reaction,
oxidative PPP, is only

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.595
going to be favorable
in one direction.

01:03:40.595 --> 01:03:41.970
You would need a
separate pathway

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:44.012
if you're going to run it
the opposite direction.

01:03:44.012 --> 01:03:46.870
That doesn't happen
in organisms.

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:50.430
So that's, under physiological
conditions, a one-way pathway.

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:53.700
You can only go one direction
through the oxidative PPP

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.840
in cells, whereas a
nonoxidative PPP is just

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:02.340
this interconversion of trioses
and hexoses with pentoses.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.960
This is very reversible,
just like the Calvin cycle

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.980
would be very reversible.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:12.300
And so while they can work
together as I described,

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.220
it's really useful to think
of them as separate pathways.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.120
And so let's go
through each of them

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.360
separately so you can
see how they work.

01:04:42.561 --> 01:04:46.940
So let's start first here with
the oxidative pentose phosphate

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:47.440
pathway.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:09.990
So this here, it would be
alpha-glucose 6-phosphate.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.800
So first step of the
oxidative pentose phosphate

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.070
pathway is we're
going to oxidize

01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:22.960
the 1-carbon of glucose.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.087
That's, of course, going
to have two electrons.

01:06:27.087 --> 01:06:28.920
So if we oxidize that
carbon, something else

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.740
has to be reduced.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:33.210
That hydride ion, those two
electrons can go to NADP+

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:34.560
to make NADPH--

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.650
a reaction that we've
now seen a million times.

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:43.350
That oxidizes the alcohol,
that carbon 1 to the ketone.

01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:45.240
And that gives us this lactone--

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.370
very similar to what we
saw as the first step

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.920
in the epimerase reaction,
when we described that,

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.900
to give us this molecule,
6-phosphogluconolactone.

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:59.850
Now, so, in essence,
what this did, remember,

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:03.510
is it oxidized--
remember, this 1-carbon

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:07.890
was the aldehyde of
glucose, this now becomes,

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:10.650
on this lactose, it's
actually an acid.

01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:15.480
And that becomes evident if
we break open this ring here

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.350
with water.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.596
That causes this molecule,
6-phosphogluconate.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.880
Oh, I forgot to mention
this first reaction here

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:11.450
is catalyzed by
this enzyme, G6PD--

01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:14.660
glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.479
Makes sense-- the oxidation
reduction reaction,

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:20.982
dehydrogenase, glucose
6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

01:08:20.982 --> 01:08:23.149
Just as an aside for those
of you who are interested

01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:26.960
in medical school, turns out
glucose 6-phosphate deficiency

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.100
in humans is actually a quite
common genetic disorder--

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.500
very common in
Mediterranean regions

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:38.420
because it is thought to have
evolved because it confers

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:41.160
some resistance to malaria.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.109
And so having less G6PD
means you deal less well

01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:46.580
with oxidative stress.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.069
And as a result,
some foods and drugs

01:08:49.069 --> 01:08:53.510
can cause increased
symptoms in those patients,

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:59.540
but also having that
means that the cells are

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.160
more resistant to
malaria infection

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.490
because the malaria
ends up killing the cell

01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:07.399
before it can establish
an infection because it

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:10.430
causes some oxidative stress.

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.970
Back to the pathway--

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:15.050
so if we open up this
lactone, what we have here

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:17.240
is this molecule,
6-phosphor gluconate.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.600
It's basically glucose
where the aldehyde has now

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.630
been oxidized to the acid.

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:26.479
That's how we generated NADPH.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:32.540
The next step is we're
going to oxidize carbon 3.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:45.279
So if we oxidize the
alcohol on carbon 3,

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:47.319
those electrons have
to go somewhere.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.320
Put them on the net plus.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.050
That gives us an edge.

01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:06.050
This is catalyzed by 6
phophogluconate dehydrogenase--

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:09.350
generates an NADPH.

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:16.501
And what ends up being
generated is this intermediate.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.520
If you look at
this intermediate,

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:42.190
this is a beta-keto acid.

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:49.330
So here's our acid that is
alpha beta to the ketone, so

01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:51.880
a beta-keto acid.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:58.240
Remember, decarboxylation of
beta-keto acids is favorable--

01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:12.120
same track that we
saw before and the TCA

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.310
cycle and other places.

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:40.890
And so remember that
generates this enol.

01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:46.710
And why it's so favorable
is because the enol prefers

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:56.125
to rearrange to the keto form.

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:32.020
And when we rearrange the
keto form, this, of course,

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:36.810
is the pentose
ribulose 5-phosphate.

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:43.740
And so ribose
5-phosphate, of course,

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.515
we saw in the Calvin cycle.

01:12:45.515 --> 01:12:47.390
So we started with
phosphorylation at the one

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:49.880
position,
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.480
So ribulose 5-phosphate
can be produced

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:57.710
by the oxidative pentose
phosphate pathway glucose

01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:58.400
6-phosphate.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.470
First oxidize the
1-carbon by G6PD.

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:05.900
That generates
6--phosphogluconate.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.820
Oxidized the 3-carbon.

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.520
That allows favorable
decarboxylation

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:15.560
to generate another NADPH
and ribulose 5-phosphate.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.260
Once you add that
ribulose 5-phosphate,

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:24.110
we can, of course,
use an isomerase.

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:43.410
And with an isomerase, we can
generate ribose 5-phosphate,

01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:47.060
which is now
available to be sent

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.690
to do a nucleic acid synthesis.

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:58.130
Or, we can use an epimerase.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:08.510
And if we use an epimerase, we
can change the stereochemistry

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:10.610
at this three position.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.940
And that gives me
xylulose 5-phosphate,

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:30.160
which was the ketose donor and
acceptor for the transketolase,

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.110
transaldolase reactions that
were so useful for entering

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:41.110
the nonoxidative pentose
phosphate pathway or basically

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.280
some version of
the Calvin cycle.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.850
And so we can get
ribose 5-phosphate,

01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:48.940
xylulose 5-phosphate,
ribulose 5-phosphate

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.540
all as products of the
oxidative pentose phosphate

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:57.430
pathway, which will allow us to
either generate ribose as a way

01:14:57.430 --> 01:15:02.890
to make nucleosides or have
carbon in the right form

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:06.460
that I can now run the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.130
and have it re-enter glycolysis.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:11.980
Great.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.960
So that's the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:20.640
Now, let's discuss the
nonoxidative pentose phosphate

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.930
pathway, which just
like the Calvin cycle,

01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:29.640
is interconversion of
3-carbon and 6-carbon sugars

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.190
with 5-carbon sugars.

01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:34.845
Basically it's the
Calvin cycle, same idea--

01:15:34.845 --> 01:15:36.660
transketolase, transaldolase.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:39.450
Obviously, it evolved
from the Calvin cycle,

01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:42.420
because photosynthesis
had to be first.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.990
So let me first put it
in context, how it works.

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:48.615
And then we can draw
it in more detail.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.540
So this here is glycolysis.

01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:12.132
If I run the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway,

01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:25.810
I can generate two NADPHs as
well as a ribulose 5-phosphate.

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:35.710
That ribulose 5-phosphate can be
turned into ribose 5-phosphates

01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:40.090
and xylulose 5-phosphates--

01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:44.650
aldose and ketose acceptors.

01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:49.840
I can then use these
5-carbon sugars.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.570
If I do a
transketolase reaction,

01:16:52.570 --> 01:17:00.580
I'll get a 3-carbon aldose
and a 7-carbon ketose--

01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:05.170
remember transketolase
moves two carbons

01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:09.580
from the ketose to an
aldose, giving you a shorter

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:12.640
aldose and a longer ketose.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:17.770
Now, if I run a
transaldolase reaction,

01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:19.780
I'll move three carbons.

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:25.900
That gives me a 6-carbon
ketose and a 4-carbon aldose.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:37.990
If I run another
transketolase reaction

01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:42.520
with this 4-carbon sugar
with this 5-carbon sugar,

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:48.070
I will then generate another
6-carbon ketose and a three

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:49.960
carbon aldose.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:57.530
These six carbon are
fructose phosphate

01:17:57.530 --> 01:18:02.150
and this 3-carbon aldose is
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:04.820
And I can re-enter glycolysis.

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:09.230
The stoichiometry works up
if I do this three times.

01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:13.940
So 3 times 5 equals 15 carbons.

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:19.580
So three ribulose 5-phosphates
from the oxidative PPP.

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:24.290
If I turn them into one
ribose 5-phosphate and two

01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:28.610
xylulose 5-phosphate, I can
allocate one here and one here.

01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:30.560
These two can come
together to give me

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.760
one fructose 6-phosphate and
one erythrose 4-phosphate.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.510
That erythrose 4-phosphate
can use the other xylulose

01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:41.690
5-phosphate to give me
another fructose 6-phosphate

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:44.450
and the glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:50.900
So [INAUDIBLE] I have two
hexoses and one triose coming

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:54.440
from my three pentoses--

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.790
and so total here,
again, of 15 carbons.

01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:03.540
And so like the
Calvin cycle, these

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.450
transketolase and transaldolase
reactions are all reversible.

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:10.020
And so if I don't want to
run the oxidative pentose

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:14.220
phosphate pathway, I can start
with fructose 6-phosphates and

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.530
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates
from glycolysis

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:19.890
and run it this direction
to generate riboses

01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:25.680
in order to make nucleosides.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:31.220
Just to be explicit about
this, hopefully this all

01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:33.110
makes sense after
the long discussion

01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:35.720
we had of the Calvin cycle
and how these reactions work.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.400
And you could work
this out yourself.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.620
But I'll close today by just
showing this and how it works.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.800
I'll actually show it in
the opposite direction.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.710
I described it here
moving from products

01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:52.580
of the oxidative PPP running
through the nonoxidative PPP

01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.440
to re-enter glycolysis.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.620
But I'm going to now draw it
for you, starting with products

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:00.560
of glycolysis, running
the nonoxidative PPP

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.650
in the other direction
to generate pentoses

01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:08.240
just because this is
so reversible, but also

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.720
point out to you how this
whole thing can work.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:33.640
So here is a glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate from glycolysis.

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:37.720
That's a aldose acceptor.

01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:15.810
Here's a fructose
6-phosphate from glycolysis.

01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:18.030
That can be a keto [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:29.990
And so if I run a
transketolase reaction--

01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:34.610
so remember, transketolase--
transfer two carbons

01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:38.300
from the ketose to the aldose.

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.680
What am I left with?

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:44.210
Well, I'm left with
a shorter aldose.

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:59.650
And this is a
erythrose 4-phosphate.

01:21:59.650 --> 01:22:03.055
And I'm left with
a longer ketose.

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:33.160
There is a pentose
xylulose 5-phosphate.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:43.000
Now I have my
erythrose 4-phosphate

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.220
and my fructose 6-phosphate.

01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:56.000
So if I now carry out a
transaldolase reaction--

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.730
so I'm going to move
three carbons now

01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:01.270
for my ketose donor,
fructose 6-phosphate,

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:03.730
to my aldose acceptor.

01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:05.810
And so what do I end up with?

01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:07.150
So I end up with a--

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:21.630
this becomes 3 carbons shorter,
so glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:25.890
Move the three carbons from the
ketose to the aldose acceptor.

01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:28.920
Now I end up with
a longer ketose.

01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:04.860
Now I have this 7-carbon
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:18.620
If I now, again, run a
transketolase reaction--

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:24.070
so two carbons here
transferred from the ketose

01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:27.970
to the aldose, what
I end up with now

01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:51.030
is a 5-carbon
xylulose 5-phosphate.

01:24:51.030 --> 01:25:01.710
And so aldose becomes a
longer ketose by two carbons.

01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:15.110
And our ketose becomes
a shorter aldose

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:31.930
by two carbons, which
is a ribose 5-phosphate.

01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:37.480
I can now have two
xylulose 5-phosphates

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.410
and a ribose 5-phosphate.

01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:45.510
I can take my
xylulose 5-phosphates

01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:51.810
and carry out an
epimerase reaction.

01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:55.050
If I carry out an epimerase
reaction, I, of course, get--

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:15.250
change the stereochemistry
at the three position

01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:20.890
to get a ribulose 5-phosphate.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:39.670
Or, I can carry out
an isomerase reaction

01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:45.070
to take my ribose 5-phosphate
to ribulose 5-phosphate.

01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:49.170
And so if you note
that I started

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:51.960
this time with
products of glycolysis,

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.400
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
fructose 6-phosphate,

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.450
did a series of transketolase
and transaldolase reactions,

01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:06.370
ultimately to generate
two fructose 6-phosphates,

01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:08.470
one glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate-- so

01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:12.160
that's 6 plus 6 plus
3 equals 15 carbons.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:18.160
I get three pentoses out,
a xylulose 5-phosphate,

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.350
a ribose 5-phosphate,
and a xylulose

01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:23.680
5-phosphate, which I can then
use epimerase or isomerase

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.490
reactions to give me ribulose
5-phosphate, which, of course,

01:27:27.490 --> 01:27:29.680
all could be shuttled
into ribose 5-phosphate,

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.290
giving me the flexibility
to start with products

01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:35.170
of glycolysis and
net generate ribose

01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:38.700
5-phosphate for
nucleoside synthesis.

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:42.840
If I run the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway,

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:46.470
I end up with
ribulose 5-phosphates.

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:49.140
I can take those
ribulose 5-phosphates,

01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:51.840
turn them into xylulose
5-phosphates and ribose

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.750
5-phosphates, run
the same series

01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:57.570
of transketolase and
transaldolase reactions

01:27:57.570 --> 01:28:01.050
in reverse and get
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates and

01:28:01.050 --> 01:28:02.790
fructose 6-phosphates.

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:07.260
Either direction, 15
carbons in, 15 carbons out,

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:09.720
can start with products
of the oxidative PPP

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.690
and put them back in glycolysis
or start with products

01:28:12.690 --> 01:28:15.690
of glycolysis and
generate pentoses,

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:19.710
such as ribose 5-phosphate
for nucleoside synthesis,

01:28:19.710 --> 01:28:21.660
giving cells a
lot of flexibility

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.930
to take carbohydrates
from glycolysis

01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:27.600
and make pentoses
for nucleosides,

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:32.820
as well as have a way
to generate NADPH.

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.690
I know there's a lot of
carbons moving around

01:28:36.690 --> 01:28:38.340
and a lot of swapping,
but hopefully

01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:43.020
after today how it works
and why it works this way is

01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.570
a little bit clearer
than if you just

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:48.300
sit down and try to
memorize these really

01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:49.215
confusing pathways.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.870
Next time we'll talk
about how one uses NADPH

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:56.720
as a source of reducing
power in all organisms

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:59.360
in order to synthesize
fatty acids.

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:00.910
Thanks.

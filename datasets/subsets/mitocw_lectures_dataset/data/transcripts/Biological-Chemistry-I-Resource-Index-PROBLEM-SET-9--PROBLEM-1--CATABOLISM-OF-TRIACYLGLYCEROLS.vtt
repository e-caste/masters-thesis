BOGDAN FEDELES: Greetings,
and welcome to 5.07

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.300
Biochemistry online.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.115
I'm Dr. Bogden Fedeles.

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:32.910
Let's metabolize some problems.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.320
I have a good problem
for you today.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.430
This is problem one,
from problem set nine.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.930
It is a problem in
which we're going

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.990
to calculate how much energy
we get from metabolizing

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.690
a molecule of fat,
more specifically,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.450
a molecule of triacylglycerol.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.640
Here is a structural
representation

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.770
of the triacylglycerol.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.950
Recognize the glycerol
molecule in the middle

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.080
here, that it's holding
together three fatty acids.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.820
Now notice, I picked a
short-chain fatty acid,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.310
a long-chain fatty acid,
and a fatty acid that

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.430
actually has a double bond.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.810
Now when this molecule
gets metabolized,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.970
it's going to be acted upon by
an enzyme called the lipase.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.480
It's going to hydrolyze the
molecule into its constituents.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.690
Obviously the lipase is
going to use water molecules,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.490
and it's going to break it
down into glycerol, shown here.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.980
Glycerol.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.710
Then, this fatty acid that has
two, four, six, C6 fatty acid.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.705
This fatty acid has two, four,
six, eight, 10, 12, 14, 16,

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:48.730
C16 fatty acid.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.350
And this one, it's an
unsaturated fatty acid,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.655
has a double bond, and
if you count the carbons

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:56.770
it should add up to 15 carbons.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.660
So not only it
has a double bond,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.480
but also it's an
odd-numbered fatty acid.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:11.230
In order to figure out how much
energy we can get from this one

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.100
molecule of fat, we will
look at how much energy

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.400
we get from each one
of these constituents--

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.910
namely, the glycerol and
the three fatty acids--

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.430
and calculate what is
the maximum amount of ATP

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.530
we can generate
when we metabolize

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.180
each one of these molecules
completely to CO2 and water.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.220
In order to keep track
of how much energy we

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.380
get from each of
the molecules, let's

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.320
make a handy table right here.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.570
So we're going to put glycerol
and the C6 fatty acid,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.090
and the C16 fatty acid,
and C15 fatty acid.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.210
All right.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.140
And each one of these, we're
going to follow the metabolism,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.610
and see how much ATP we're going
to need to put in or generate.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.450
Also, the redox cofactors
in ADH or FADH2.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.740
Also, for fatty
acids, we're going

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.700
to be dealing with
beta-oxidation.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.400
And pretty much every
single molecule,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.190
when it's going to
be born completely,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.840
it's going to generate
first acetyl-CoA.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.150
All right.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.300
And here, we're going to tally
up the total amount of ATP

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.770
for each one of them.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.720
And then we're going to tally
up for the entire molecule.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.190
So let's start with
the glycerol molecule.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.100
Now, if you have watched
the problem set seven,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.250
you might recognize
the following pathway.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.740
As we just discussed,
triacylglyceride

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.370
can be hydrolyzed
to form glycerol.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.000
And the glycerol, then,
is first phosphorylated

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.550
by glycerol kinase, and
oxidized by glycerol phosphate

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.290
dehydrogenase, to generate
dihydro acetyl phosphate, which

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.470
can then enter the
glycolysis, and follow

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.100
glycolysis all the way to
pyruvate, and then acetyl-CoA.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.740
From then, acetyl-CoA can
go into the TCA cycle.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.230
So let's tally up
how much energy

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.140
we can get from one
molecule of glycerol.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.630
Let's take a look
specifically at the steps

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.340
where we are generating ATP,
or generating redox cofactors,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.240
such as NADH or FADH2.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.260
First, we need to put in ATP.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.830
Neglect glycerol kinase.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.780
But we're going to
get back one ATP

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.900
in the phosphoglycerate
kinase step,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.360
and one ATP in the
pyruvate kinase step.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.680
So the net ATP formation is one.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.790
Now in the
glycolysis, we're also

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.300
going to generate one NADH,
in the pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.140
another NADH, and the
glycerol-3-phosphate

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.600
dehydrogenase will
generate also an NADH.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.730
Now, keep in mind,
this NADH is going

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.860
to be outside the
mitochondria, so we're

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.230
going to have to use a
shuttle to bring it in.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.450
But we're considering
that we're using

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.060
an efficient shuttle, that gives
us the full amount of energy

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.410
for this NADH.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.270
So, once again, the
total, it's going

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.630
to be three molecules of NADH.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.890
So, going back to
our table, we said

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.150
the glycerol is going to give
us a net one molecule of ATP,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.720
three molecules of NADH.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.570
There's going to be no
FADH2, no beta-oxidation,

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.480
and we're going to get one
molecule of acetyl-CoA.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.820
As you've seen by
this point many times,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.580
acetyl-CoA will
enter the TCA cycle,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.370
where it's going to be
completely oxidized to two CO2

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.280
molecules, and in the
process is going to generate

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.070
the equivalent of 12 ATPs.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.800
Let's take a look at where
those are coming from.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.350
Here is a schematic
of the TCA cycle.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.710
And one acetyl-CoA
molecule comes in,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.930
and it's going to generate one,
two, three molecules of NADH,

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.500
one molecule of FADH2,
and one molecule of GTP.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.040
Now, if we keep in mind
that for every FADH2

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.720
we generate about two
ATPs, and for every NADH

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.870
we generate three ATPs, that's
a total of, 3 times 3 is 9,

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.880
plus 2 is 11, plus a GDP
is equivalent to an ATP.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.110
That's about 12 molecules of
ATP per molecule of acetyl-CoA

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.920
that enters the TCA cycle.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.040
So now let's tally
up how much energy

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.570
we can get from one
molecule of glycerol.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.590
So we know we get
one ATP, three NADHs,

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.860
now each NADH is going to give
us three molecules of ATP.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.260
Now FADH2, we know these
give two molecules of ATP.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.330
We don't have any
beta-oxidation--

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.730
we're going to be talking
more about fatty acids--

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.750
and acetyl-CoA we just talked
about, we get 12 molecules

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.910
of ATP per acetyl-CoA.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.840
So, the total here
is 12 plus 9, plus 1,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.090
that's going to be 22 ATPs
from one molecule of glycerol.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.100
Now let's talk about
the fatty acids.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.870
In order to metabolize
them, first we

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.720
need to activate
them into thioesters.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.100
These are going to be thioesters
formed with coenzyme A, or CoA.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.530
Here's an overview of
the activation process

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.840
by which fatty acids become
fatty acid thioesters.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.240
Of course, this is written
for the C6 fatty acid,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.790
but would occur for
any other fatty acid,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.590
regardless of the chain length.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.190
Now this process is catalyzed
by acetyl-CoA synthetase, that

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:52.930
uses ATP to first generate
this mixed anhydride, with AMP.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.715
This process is
called adenylation.

00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:57.910
So this activates
the acid, which

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.950
then reacts with
coenzyme A shown here,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.710
HS-CoA, which will generate the
thioester of the fatty acid.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.440
Now, here we are using
one molecule of ATP,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.930
but we're breaking it into
alpha-phosphate to generate

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.860
pyrophosphate, which is
then broken down into two

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.420
inorganic phosphates.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.430
And the energy in this
reaction, catalyzed

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.450
by inorganic
pyrophosphatase, drives

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.330
the reaction towards the right.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.020
Now, since we're generating
AMP in the second step,

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.799
we need a second molecule of
ATP to convert this AMP back

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.909
to ADP.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.900
So, overall, this process
requires two molecules of ATP

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.039
to generate one molecule of
the fatty acid thioester.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.160
Once a fatty acid is
activated into a thioester

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.580
with coenzyme A, it can
now undergo beta-oxidation.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.750
This is a set of reactions in
which the fatty acid is broken

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.580
down into a shorter fatty acid
and one molecule of acetyl-CoA.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.010
The process then can
repeat over and over,

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.560
until the entire fatty
acid is broken down

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.910
into acetyl-CoA molecules.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.660
So let's take a look at
how beta-oxidation works.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.630
Here is an overview of
beta-oxidation pathway.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:16.240
We're starting with a fatty
acyl-CoA thioester that

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.370
has "n" carbons, and by
the end of the process,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.290
we're going to get a thioester
that has "n" minus 2 carbons,

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.540
and the remaining
two carbons are

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.690
going to be in the
form of acetyl-CoA.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.930
Now, this beta-oxidation
involves four steps.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.750
In the first step, we're
going to use a dehydrogenase

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.050
to oxidize this single
bond between the alpha

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.720
and beta carbons, and
make a trans double bond.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.410
So this is the alpha carbon,
this is the beta carbon.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.690
So these fatty acyl-CoA
dehydrogenases,

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.180
there are actually
several of them,

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.721
and they have
different specificities

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.730
for short, medium,
long, and very

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.730
long chain fatty acyl-CoAs.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.420
But regardless, there
will be some dehydrogenase

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.590
to act on any length
fatty acyl-CoA,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.060
and introduce this
trans double bond.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.040
In the next step, we
add one water molecule

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.670
to generate a
beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.630
is subsequently oxidized to
generate a beta-ketoacyl-CoA.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.020
In this oxidation,
we're going to use NAD,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.030
generating one molecule NADH.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:35.090
Finally, the thiolase, or
beta-ketoacyl thiolase,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.630
is going to break down this
bond between the alpha and beta

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.500
carbons, in a reverse
Claisen reaction,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.570
to generate one
molecule of acetyl-CoA.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:50.260
And the remainder of the fatty
acid is another thioester.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.930
So one round of
beta-oxidation is

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.520
going to generate one
molecule of FADH2,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.120
and one molecule
of NADH, as well

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.210
as one molecule of acetyl-CoA.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.260
Now let's update our table
with the information we just

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:05.980
learned.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.010
So, as we just said,
for every fatty acid

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.710
we need to expend
two molecules of ATP,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.410
to transform them
into the thioesters.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.590
That's why I put here minus
2 for each one of the three

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.000
fatty acids.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.160
We also learned that
in beta-oxidation, we

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.720
generate one molecule of FADH2,
and one molecule of NADH.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.650
So, for every beta-oxidation,
we generate the equivalent

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.120
of five ATP.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.940
Now we're ready to
calculate how much energy we

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.410
can get from each of the three
fatty acids in our problem.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:50.520
Now, for the C6 fatty acid
that's what's represented here,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.370
we discussed, we're
going to activate it,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.100
we're going to need to
use two ATP molecules

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:03.580
and coenzyme A. We're going
to form the thioester.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.841
And then we're going
to do beta-oxidation

00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:13.650
Now, for a fatty acid
that has six carbons,

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.530
we're going to do
the beta-oxidation,

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.520
and the molecule is
going to cleave there,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.440
and we're going to
do it one more time,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.840
the molecule is going
to be cleaved there.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.890
So we're going to do two
rounds of beta-oxidation.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.955
And each one of
these two carbons

00:12:31.955 --> 00:12:33.330
is going to become
an acetyl-CoA.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.200
So we're going to generate
three acetyl-CoAs.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.290
Now, similarly, for
the C16 fatty acid--

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:50.020
two, four, six,
eight, 10, 12, 14, 16.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:58.930
All right, it's going to first
activate two molecules of ATP

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:14.020
and coenzyme A to form the
thioester, with 16 carbons.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.690
And this will undergo
beta-oxidation.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.420
And we're going to do it one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.040
seven times.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:34.740
OK, so seven rounds
of beta-oxidation

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.630
is going to generate eight
molecules of acetyl-CoA.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.940
Now let's go back and put
in all this information

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.080
into our table.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.040
So for the C6 fatty acid, we
expended two molecules of ATP

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:53.320
to activate it, and then we did
two rounds of beta-oxidation,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.650
and we generated three
molecules of acetyl-CoA.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.020
For the C16 fatty
acid, again, we

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.670
activated then we did seven
rounds beta-oxidation,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.290
and we generated eight
molecules of acetyl-CoA.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.740
So for the C6 fatty acid,
we have a grand total of,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.740
3 times 12 is 36, plus 2
times 5, 10, is 46, minus 2,

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.600
is 44 molecules of ATP.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.740
For the C16 fatty
acid, well, 8 times 12

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:36.590
is 96, plus 35, minus 2,
that's 129 molecules of ATP.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.930
Now the C15 fatty acid is
going to be a little bit more

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.600
complicated, because on one
hand, it has a double bond,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.930
so we need to figure out
how to deal with that.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.350
On the other hand, it's
an odd chain fatty acid,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.420
and as you imagine, the
beta-oxidation breaks off

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.310
two carbons at a time.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.980
So the last time we
do beta-oxidation,

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.350
we're going to be left
with three carbons.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.120
That's called
propionyl-CoA, and we'll

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.202
have to figure out
what to do with that.

00:15:01.202 --> 00:15:02.660
Just as with the
other fatty acids,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.490
the C15 fatty acid
is going to need

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.640
to be activated into
a thioester with CoA.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.600
So this is going to cost two
ATP molecules, and, of course,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.600
we need to add the CoA.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.930
And now, this is the thioester
of our C15 fatty acid.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.810
Now, since the double
bond is pretty far away

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.550
from the business-end
of the molecule,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.730
we can do a number of
rounds of beta-oxidation.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:36.230
In fact, we can do
beta-oxidation once, twice.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.480
So two rounds of
beta-oxidation is

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.790
going to give us this molecule.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:50.710
Two rounds beta-oxidation.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.510
In each one of
these rounds we're

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.360
going to generate one
molecule of acetyl-CoA,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.010
so two acetyl-CoA.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.410
So we get this fatty
acid taiyo thioester,

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.860
which contains a
beta-gamma double bond.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.720
Now, it turns out
there is an enzyme that

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.130
can isomerize this double bond
into an alpha-beta double bond.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.440
So this is what is
going to happen next.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.830
The double bond moves from the
beta-gamma to the alpha-beta.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.160
Now, this looks a lot
like an intermediate

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.290
in the beta-oxidation.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.650
Once again, this reaction is
catalyzed by am isomerase.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.970
And this alpha-beta
unsaturated thioester

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.650
can continue in a manner
similar to beta-oxidation.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:50.860
So, first it's going to add
water to form a hydroxyl here

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.860
at the beta position.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.550
Then that hydroxyl is getting
oxidized to form a keto group.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.670
And the thiolase is going
to generate acetyl-CoA,

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.960
and another
thioester shown here.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.550
So, from here, we're going to
generate one molecule of NADH,

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.140
and one molecule of acetyl-CoA.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:17.710
All right, now
this is a thioester

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.800
of a completely
saturated fatty acid.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.900
Now of course, it's
still odd chained,

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.380
so we have one, six,
seven, eight, nine carbons.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.380
So we can do beta-oxidation
actually three times.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.930
So, three rounds
of beta-oxidation.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.960
And it's going to take us to
three molecules of acetyl-CoA.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.910
And the last portion
of the molecule

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:49.340
is going to be this molecule,
which we call propionyl-CoA,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.630
is a three carbon thioester.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:02.290
So far we have generated
two, three, and another three

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.370
here, six molecule
of acetyl-CoA.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.950
And we've done,
two, another three,

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.480
five rounds of beta-oxidation.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.850
And we also generated an
additional NADH molecule.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.134
So now let's update our
table with this information,

00:18:17.134 --> 00:18:18.550
and then we're
going to figure out

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.590
what happens to propionyl-CoA.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.720
As we just discussed,
the C15 fatty acid

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.900
is going to get activated,
so we need to ATPs there.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:32.420
Then it's going to undergo
five rounds of beta-oxidation.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.980
And we generated a total of
six molecules of acetyl-CoA,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.440
and one additional
molecule of NADH.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.830
Let's now take a look
at propionyl-CoA,

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.170
and see how we metabolize
it, and how much energy

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.370
we can generate from it.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.760
It turns out the first step is
to expand from a three carbon

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.530
molecule to a four
carbon molecule.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:58.460
This happens by adding one CO2.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.050
Of course, this
process will require

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.510
the expense of an ATP molecule.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.240
We generate this
methylmalonyl-CoA,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.690
which is a branched four
carbon chain molecule.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.100
And another enzyme,
racemase, is going

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.170
to interconvert
this stereocenter

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.110
from the S-configuaration
to the R-configuration.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.890
Finally, this
methylmalonyl-CoA is

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.980
going to undergo a
rearrangement of the groups

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.070
to generate a linear
molecule, succinyl-CoA.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.220
Now, this is one of the most
fascinating transformations

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.070
in the whole
biochemistry, and involves

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.460
an enzyme called
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.890
requires cobalamin, or
the coenzyme derived

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:41.860
from vitamin B12.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.010
This unusual
transformation catalyzed

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.560
by the methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase, the enzyme that

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.490
requires vitamin
B12 cofactor, it's

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:59.680
fascinating because it
involves a carbon skeletal

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.000
rearrangement of the molecule.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.782
And this reaction occurs
via a radical mechanism.

00:20:05.782 --> 00:20:10.850
The radical is obtained by
breaking a carbon metal bond.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.730
In this case, it's a
carbon-cobalt bond.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.400
Now succinyl-CoA is
a familiar molecule,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.840
you've encountered
it in the TCA cycle.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.720
However, we cannot use the TCA
cycle directly to completely

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.870
metabolize succinyl-CoA, as all
the intermediates in the TCA

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.080
cycle are in fact in
catalytic amounts.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.720
So, we're going to use
just part of the TCA cycle,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.230
to generate a molecule,
malate, which then

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.200
can be converted into pyruvate.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.730
And pyruvate can then
generate acetyl-CoA

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:45.410
to re-enter the TCA cycle and
be completely metabolized.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.160
Here is the TCA cycle,
to refresh your memory.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.440
And this is
succinyl-CoA that we can

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.220
generate from the
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.680
Now, as we said,
succinyl-CoA is going

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.720
to be converted to malate.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.660
Malate can then escape
the mitochondria

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.570
and continue its transformation
towards pyruvate.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.150
So, in this process,
succinyl-CoA

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.070
is going to generate
one molecule of GTP

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.950
to form succinate.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.490
And succinate to fumartate
is going to give us

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.770
one more molecule of FADH2.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.990
Then malate will escape
the mitochondria.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:27.570
So to summarize what
happens in the TCA cycle,

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.580
succinyl-CoA is going to
give us a molecule of GTP,

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.270
and then one more
molecule of FADH2.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.130
And it's going to
make it to malate,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.670
and then malate is going
to be converted to pyruvate

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.590
using the malic enzyme.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.040
Now, this is an oxidation
and decarboxylation

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.960
that happens in one step.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.550
For the oxidation,
we're going to need

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.420
NADP, instead of the usual NAD.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.381
So we're going to generate
one molecule of NADPH.

00:21:57.381 --> 00:21:58.880
Now for the purpose
of this problem,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.120
we're going to treat NADPH
as equivalent to NADH.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.290
So malate, via the malic enzyme,
is going to form pyruvate.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.035
And then pyruvate, in the
pyruvate dehydrogenase,

00:22:10.035 --> 00:22:14.620
is going to lose one
CO2 and form acetyl-CoA.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.890
In the process we'll also
generate one more NADH,

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.330
and now acetyl-CoA can
re-enter the TCA cycle

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.470
and be completely
metabolized, generating

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:31.080
in the process about
12 ATP equivalents.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.519
So now let's go back,
and update our table

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.310
with all this information
that we found out

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.720
about propionyl-CoA.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:42.070
So as we said, propionyl-CoA
required first the loss

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.780
of another ATP to activate it,
to form the methylmalonyl-CoA.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.180
But then methylmalonyl-CoA
converted to succinyl-CoA.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.850
Succinyl-CoA generated
one molecule of GTP,

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.290
so we're going to
put plus 1 back here.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.480
Then we're going to get
one molecule of FADH2

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.240
the generating
succinate, from going

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.460
from succinate to fumarate.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.960
And then, we're
going to generate

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.890
two more molecules of NADH,
one at the malate enzyme step,

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.020
and one at the pyruvate
dehydrogenase step,

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.120
so we have plus 2 here.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.400
And, of course, in the end,
we get one more molecule

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.400
of acetyl-CoA as well.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.740
So now we have a total of
seven molecules of acetyl-CoA,

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.770
five rounds of beta-oxidation,
one FADH2, three NADHs,

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:37.250
and at a loss of two ATPs.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:44.580
So this totals up to 118
ATPs for the C15 fatty acid.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:51.810
Now we can tally the entire
ATP yield of a molecule of fat,

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.420
of this triacylglyceride,
and that's

00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:01.180
going to be 313
molecules of ATP.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.696
Now that's a lot of energy from
one single molecule of fat.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.570
Now, this problem has
an additional question,

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.160
and it asked us to contrast how
much energy we get from a six

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.870
carbon fatty acid
and compare that

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.610
to how much energy would get
from one molecule of glucose,

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.581
which also has six carbons.

00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:24.080
Let's take a look
at our table here.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.240
The six carbon fatty acid
generates about 44 molecules

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.940
of ATP when completely oxidized.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.240
By contrast, one
molecule of glucose

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:41.340
would generate only about
34 to 36 molecules of ATP.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:48.450
If you want to follow the same
analysis that we did here--

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:54.450
remember glucose, well, we need
to spend two molecules of ATP

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.130
to activate it, but
then we're going

00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:00.460
to generate four molecules
of ATP going to pyruvate.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.910
And then there's going to be
two molecules of NADH generated,

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.540
one at the GAPDH step, one
at the pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.550
step, and finally,
we're going to generate

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.280
two molecules of acetyl-CoA.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.370
So the total is going to be, 2
times 12 is 24, plus 4 times 3

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:23.200
is 12, is 36, plus 2, is 38.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.980
So as you guys can
see, the C6 fatty acid

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.090
generates actually more ATP
than one molecule of glucose.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.440
And that's probably reasonable,
because the C6 fatty acids

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.030
have a lot more C-H bonds.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.260
In other words, the
carbons are more reduced.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.240
In glucose, we have
a lot of hydroxyls,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.790
so the carbons are in a
slightly higher oxidation state.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.770
Therefore, there's less
energy generated total.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.440
Of course, one
molecule of glucose

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.080
pales in comparison
with one molecule

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.370
of fat, which has
hundreds of ATP generated,

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.590
as we thought in part
A of this problem.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.510
Well, that sums up this problem.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:13.850
I hope it helped you realize why
fats, or triacylglycerides, are

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.600
so much more energy dense than
other nutrients, such as sugars

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.384
or amino acids.

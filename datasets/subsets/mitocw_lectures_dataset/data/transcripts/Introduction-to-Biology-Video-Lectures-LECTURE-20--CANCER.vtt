WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, when I first came to town, the
Red Sox hadn't won for 42 years.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now it's been 86 years, so the
whole town all of a sudden changes

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
its psychology. A time
for great celebration,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
at least for you Red Sox fans. At
the, after last lecture I had an

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
interesting conversation with one
of you. One of you came up to me and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
said very politely, Professor
Weinberg, do you have some

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
lecture notes that you have written
out what the important points of the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
lecture are that you could give
me or that you could give us?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I said, you know, I,
I'm not really interested in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
doing that. And the reason I'm not
really interested in doing that is

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that the main function of this
course is to enable you to listen to,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
when somebody is talking about
conceptually complex things and to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
distil what's being said and to
figure out in your own mind what's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
important and what is just another
piece of drivel coming out of my

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
mouth or Eric Lander's mouth.
In fact, speaking for him,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
if I will allow, can allow myself,
and myself, in the end we don't

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
really care that much whether you
know the difference between DNA and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
RNA or proteins and phospholipids.
What we're really interested in

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
doing is to use this course as a
vehicle for pushing you to get your

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
brains functioning even
better than they already are.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And, therefore, if you
learn in this course how to,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to think about very complex subjects
and figure out what's really going

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
on then this course will have more
than paid for itself in terms of the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
energy you put into it. So,
that's part of the reason why we

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
don't provide you with lecture
outlines. We want you to figure out

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
what's important on your own.
Being able to do so will itself be

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
a major triumph. At the
end of our discussion last

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
time we talked about the cell cycle,
the fact that it has, has four major

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
active phases. G1,
S, G2 and mitosis.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We talked about mitosis. And
we talked about the fact that

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
when cells emerge from mitosis,
from M phase in the absence of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
growth stimulatory factors
then they go into G zero.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And if they're provided with growth
stimulatory factors then they'll go

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
back into the active cell cycle.
And this G zero phase we talked

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
about is a quiescence
phase, it's a resting phase.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In fact, there are two kinds of
quiescent cells in our bodies.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Those that go into quiescence,
non-growth reversibly, and are able

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to reemerge back into the active
cell cycle, and those cells which

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
have irreversibly retreated
from the active cell cycle.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So, for example, there are many
cells in our brain where no matter

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
what you do to them they will never
be able to go back into the active

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
cell cycle. And they are, in
that sense, considered to be

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
post-mitotic. Post-mitotic
meaning that they will

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
never again grow. It's
really not clear which of the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
post-mitotic cells, which
tissues in the body harbor,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
harbor post-mitotic cells. We
used to think that most of the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
differentiated cells in our body
are post-mitotic. And when I say

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
differentiated, a topic we
will not get into for the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
moment, what I mean is that
different cells in different parts

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of the body have become
differentiated by becoming very

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
specialized to become neurons or
becoming liver cells or to becoming

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
skin cells and so forth. And
it is probably the case that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
there are many kinds of
differentiated cells in the body

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
which once they differentiate will
no longer enter into the active cell

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
cycle. Now, getting
back to this.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
As I also mentioned, if we
look at a Petri dish then and

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
we put cells like fibroblast,
connective tissue cells in the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
bottom of the Petri dish, as
I told you last time, if you

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
provide those cells with medium
which contains all the requisite

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
nutrients, these cells will sit here
happily for an extended period of

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
time but will not proliferate.
However, if you add to their serum,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
add their medium, you add serum
to this medium. Serum usually comes

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
from cows, so therefore
it's called bovine serum.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Then the serum, in addition
to the nutrients present

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
in the, in the medium will indeed
provoke these cells to proliferate,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and there are agents in the serum,
in fact there are agents which are

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
called growth factors which are
contained within the serum which are

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
responsible for inducing these,
these cells to begin to proliferate.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Well, it's instructive just for
a moment to step back and ask

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
ourselves what actually is
serum? How do you get serum?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And the way you get serum is you
take blood and you allow it to clot.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And when blood clots the
platelets in the, in the blood,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
platelets are small cellular
fragments, they have an intact

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
plasma membrane but they're just,
they're very tiny, they don't have a

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
nucleus, and these A, A nuclear
fragments, these platelets,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
when blood is induced to clot the
platelets aggregate with one another

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and you form a big clump, and
that, a clot settles to the

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
bottom of the test-tube. But
in the context of wounding,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
let's say you make a cut on your
skin, what happens is that blood

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
rushes into the site of, of
the, the cut or the wound,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
clotting occurs in order to create
coagulation. And why is there

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
coagulation? In order to staunch
the bleeding. In order to prevent

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
there to be further hemorrhage,
further loss of blood. But at the

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
same time, as the platelets
are aggregating to help form the

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
structure of the clot that, that
creates a physical barrier to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
prevent further bleeding,
simultaneously the platelets are

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
releasing a lot of growth factors
into the medium around them.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Why are they doing that?
Because what's happening

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
simultaneous with stopping the
bleeding is that the platelets are,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
are releasing growth factors
which are used in order to begin to

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
reconstruct and heal the site
of wounding. Consequently,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
what happens is that the
platelets release growth factors.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
These growth factors stimulate cells
right around the sides of the wound

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
which are still viable and have
not been destroyed to begin to

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
proliferate in order to
reconstruct and intact tissue.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
One of the most important of these,
of these, of these factors that they

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
release is platelet-derived
growth factor. Remember GF is

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
just growth factor. And
platelet-derived growth factor,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
or as it's called in the trade PDGF,
I mentioned it briefly last time, is

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
a very potent mitogen. A
mitogen is a growth stimulatory

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
agent. It's an important
mitogen for fibroblasts.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Fibroblasts, as you recall,
are the connective tissue, the

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
connective tissue cells that
are found throughout the body.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And, therefore, if you were to,
for example, add platelet-derived

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
growth factor, PDGF to
those fibroblasts that were

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
sitting there in G zero, PDGF
will stimulate the fibroblasts

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to begin to enter into the active
cell cycle, to exit from G zero,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
to enter into G1, and therefore
to complete a, a full cell cycle.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And, by the way, recall
what I said before,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that after the cells leave the
active, leave G zero and move

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
throughout the active cell cycle and
they have a lot of growth factors,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
they'll go all the way around the
active growth cycle to mitosis.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And when they emerge from mitosis,
once again they'll ask themselves

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the question whether it's a good
idea to continue to be in the active

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
cell cycle or whether they
should exit into G zero,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
perhaps doing so reversibly.
Interestingly, if you look at the

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
way that the cell cycle is organized
then what you see is the following,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
if I can draw the cell
cycle again. Here's G1.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Here's S phase. And
here's G2. And right at,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
at a distinct point toward the
end of G1 is something called the

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
restriction point,
which is going to be very

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
interesting shortly. And
what happens is after cells

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
emerge from G, from
mitosis and they move

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
throughout the, the most
of G1 they're continually

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
assessing their extracellular
environment to determine whether or

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
not there are enough growth factors
around to justify their continuing

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the rest of the cell cycle. And
ultimately they'll reach this

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
restriction point, or as
it's sometimes called the R

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
point, and here they will make
the final go versus no-go decision.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So, if there have historically
been enough growth factors from the

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
beginning of G1 all the way to
the R point then cells will commit

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
themselves essentially irreversibly
to going through the entire rest of

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
the cell cycle, through M.
Conversely, if cells reach up to

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
this R point and they
calculate that there are enough,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
there are not enough mitogenic
growth factors to justify

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
proliferation then they'll jump out
of the active cell cycle and go back

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
to G zero. What that means, in
effect, is as follows. Once the

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
cells have passed through the R
point and they're over here and they

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
are committed to complete the rest
of the cell cycle then you can take

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
growth factors out of their medium
and they don't care because they

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
only want to receive
these stimulatory signals.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
They only care about in this
window of time. Hereafter,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
they're committed essentially
irreversibly to go through the rest

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
of the cell cycle. There
are, as it turns out,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
also growth inhibitory factors.
So, here we've been talking about

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
mitogens, the growth inhibitory
factors. So, an important growth

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
inhibitory factor is,
for example, TGF beta.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And TGF beta works exactly opposite
to PDGF because it is a single which

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is present in extracellular space
and tells the cell it should stop

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
proliferating.
And, therefore,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
TGF beta, if it's present in large
amounts in this part of the cell

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
cycle, if the cell experiences
it in large amounts,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that will influence the cell not to
move through the restriction point.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Conversely, if it's absent then
obviously PDGF can have the,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the undiluted tensions of
the cell. And, therefore,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
what I'm trying to convey by this is
to tell you that cell balances both

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
its growth stimulatory and growth
inhibitory signals that it's

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
receiving from extracellular space,
these decisions are weighed, and

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
finally down here the cell with make
the, the binary decision to go ahead

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
or not to go ahead, depending
on historically how many

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
of these factors its recruited
in this specific window of time.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Recall, as we said last time,
that once a growth factor like PDGF

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
goes to the plasma membrane it
encounters a receptor on the surface

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
which let's say we call the PDGF
receptor. And I'll just draw it

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
like this for the moment.
It's a transmembrane protein.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
The extracellular domain is on the
outside. And I'm drawing two copies

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
of the PDGF receptor here
for reasons that will become

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
apparent in a moment. And what
happens is that PDGF which,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
for example, can be itself a dimer-,
it can be a dimeric growth factor.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So, it has two distinct subunits
in it. They're both essentially

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
equivalent to one another but it is
dimeric. And this dimeric structure,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
PDGF, allows it to bind to
two growth factor receptors

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
simultaneously. Well,
why is that interesting?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It's interesting for
the following reason.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
These transmembrane PDGF receptors,
like the ones I've indicated right

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
here, they're anchored in the plasma
membrane because there's a portion

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
of their sequence right in here
in the transmembrane domain,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I'm indicating it here in the orange,
which contains highly hydrophobic

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
amino acids. And those hydrophobic
amino acids obviously love to be in

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
this hydrophobic environment
of the lipid bilayer and their,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
by they don't, they have no effect
at all on whether the PDGF receptors

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
can move, can traverse in the
plane of the plasma membrane.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So, the PDGF receptors can move
across the face of the plasma

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
membrane. These ones can
move to the right or the left,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
but they're not going to come in or
out because they're anchored in this

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
lipid bilayer by this stretch
of hydrophobic amino acids.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Now, what happens interestingly
when PDGF, the dimeric receptor

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
binds to two of these PDGF
receptor molecules, which,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
as I told you, have lateral freedom
to translate laterally on the plane

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
of a plasma membrane, what
happens is it will bind two of

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
these receptors.
And, in so doing,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
it will pull the two receptor
molecules next to one another.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Previously, they were just floating
around in the plane of the plasma

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
membrane having bound their ligand,
recall that PDGF is considered a

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
ligand for the PDGF receptor,
having, it will cause these two

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
receptor molecules to now become,
become pulled very close to one

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
another. So, I'll
redraw it now like this.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Now these two receptor
molecules look like this,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
they're right, they're cheek by jowl,
they're right next to one another,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and this has some interesting
consequences. Of great interest

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
here is the affect this has on the
ability of the PDGF receptor to emit

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
signals into the cytoplasm.
Because recall that the end game

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
here is always how does the, how
does the intracellular part of

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
the cell know that this, there's
been an encounter with the

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
growth factor in the
extracellular space?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And this signal-emitting power to
PDGF receptor comes from the fact

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
that once these two domains
are brought together,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
each of these two domains is able
to modify the other and change the

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
other, i.e., subunit A modifies
subunit B, subunit B modifies

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
subunit A. And how is
this modification achieved?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
For the follow, it is
achieved in the following way.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
That the, this domain,
which I've been calling,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I've just been writing like this,
as a rectangle, is actually a

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
catalytic agent. It's
actually a tyrosine kinase.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So, it's an enzyme. And a tyrosine
kinase is an enzyme that takes the

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
gamma phosphate from ATP, the
high energy phosphate from APT,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
ATP and transfers it to tyrosine
amino acids that are present

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
on substrates. So, if
here is an amino acid

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
sequence in the single letter,
letter code, and if we admit that Y

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is the, is the code for tyrosine
then if here's a protein that it

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
functions as a substrate
for a tyrosine kinase,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
a tyrosine kinase will add a
phosphate group to the side chain of

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the tyrosine, which I'm not drawing
here, but tyrosine has a hydroxyl

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
group in its side chain and,
therefore, it will phosphorilate

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
this tyrosine. That is
to say will tetraphosphate

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
group do it? It will
phosphorilate this tyrosine.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So, these two rectangles are, in
fact, tyrosine kinases. And what

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
happens, after the two subunits
of the receptor have been brought

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
together, is thereafter, what
one finds is that each of these

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
receptor subunits becomes
multiply phosphorilated.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And each of these lollipops that
I'm indicating here are sites where

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
there, a tyrosine residue
has become phosphorilated.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
In fact, there's a tail of the PDGF
receptor that extends even further

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
to the cytoplasm which also acquires
a number of different phosphates on

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
it. And, again, I'd
remind us that this

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
phosphorylation is really what's
often called transphosphorylation

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
because each receptor molecule
phosphorilates the tyrosine residues

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
on the other. Obviously, when
these two receptor molecules

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
are far apart in the plain
of the plasma membrane,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
this transphosphorylation
cannot occur.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But once the two tyrosine kinase
residues, once the two tyrosine

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
kinases have been brought together,
pulled together by the dimerization

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
of the receptor, now this cross-phosphorylation,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
on each phosphorylating the other
can occur, and soon the receptors

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
are highly phosphorilated.
All of these phosphate groups,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
to repeat myself, being attached
to tyrosine residues in their

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
cytoplasmic domains.
And this, in turn,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
creates interesting docking sites
for a variety of other cytoplasmic

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
signaling proteins. And we'll
talk about some today and

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
next time, but what I want to leave
you with is the following impression.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
That after this phosphorylation
actually occurs there are a number

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
of molecules in the cytoplasm,
signaling molecules that have

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
affinity for binding
these phosphotyrosines.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
When I say phosphotyrosine,
obviously, I'm referring to the

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
phosphorilated form of tyrosine
that's been created by a tyrosine

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
kinase enzyme. So, here's
one molecule that can

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
bind. Here's molecule A combined
to one of these phosphates,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
another one combined to
this phosphate specifically,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and each of these molecules,
once they're attracted to this

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
phosphorilated receptor, can
then emit downstream signals,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
send a variety of signals into
the cell that ultimately end up in

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
persuading the
cell to proliferate.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And so these effects here of growth
factors in the G1 phase of the cell

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
cycle are mediated by this
transmembrane signaling,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
by the activation of these, of
this PDGF receptor, for example,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and by the resulting a release of
downstream signals into the cell

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
which pursued the cell to
proliferate or not to proliferate.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
To be sure the,
when platelets clot,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
when platelets aggregate and they
release PDGF, they also release

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
other kinds of growth factors.
For instance, there's another

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
growth factor that's called IGF1,
insulin-like growth factor, and that

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
has its own receptor on the
surface of cells. And there are,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
on a cell, hundreds to thousands
of these PDGF receptors,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
there are IGF receptors,
there are EGF receptors.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And a cell often will require
several distinct kinds of growth

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
factor activations in
order to proliferate. So,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
this is only a minor part of
the entire exposure that a cell

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
experiences in the G1 phase of the
cell cycle. To elaborate on a point

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
that I made last time, an
important biological distinction

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
between normal cells and cancer
cells is the fact that cancer cells

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
require relatively little growth
factors or in the medium in order to

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
proliferate. Normal
cells have a very strong

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
requirement for growth
factors in their medium. And,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
therefore, what we can already
imagine is the following kind of

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
scenario. That cancer cells have
someone deregulated this signaling

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
pathway. Somehow they have become
independent of the stimulation that

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
is normally required,
usually required for cells to

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
proliferate. And, in
fact, we know of several

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
different ways by which cancer
cells can acquire this independence.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
One of the most important ways,
it's, it a really interesting one,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
is here's a cancer cell, which
we'll talk about very shortly.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And what you find in certain kinds
of cancer cells is that the cancer

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
cells themselves release
growth factors into the medium.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
So, there are certain kinds of
cancer cells that will release,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
let's say, a growth factor that's
like EGF into the medium around it,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
around themselves. Well,
you'll say that's kind of

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
amusing. But so what. The
important part here is that

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
these same cancer cells
have receptors for TG,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
for EGF on their surface.
So, they're producing a growth

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
factor and they can also respond
to the same growth factor.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
And, therefore, this EGF, once
it's released, can swim over

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
here, activate the receptor
and pursued the cell to start

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
proliferating. This
is, if you will,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
a positive feedback loop. But
note here importantly that this,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
the growth of this cell is not being
controlled by growth factors coming

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
from cells elsewhere in the tissue
or the body. Here we're not talking

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
about different cells talking to one
another. Here we're talking about a

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
monologue where this cell is talking
to itself. This is sometimes called

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
autocrine signaling and refers
to the fact that certain kinds of

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
cancer cells are able to make growth
factors to which they can respond.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
In fact, in normal tissues it's rare
for a single cell type in a normal

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
tissue to be able to make a growth
factor and to be able to respond to

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
the same growth factor. Why
can it normally not respond to

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
that growth factor? Because
it won't make the receptor

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
for the growth factor. For
example, epithelial cells like

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
the cells in your skin or
the cells lining the gut,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
they can release PDGF, but
they don't have a PDGF receptor

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
on their surface.
And, therefore,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
even though they release
copious amounts of PDGF,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
that will not result in this auto
stimulatory proliferation and,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
therefore, you don't have this
decontrolled self-proliferation that

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
you see often in cancer cells,
this autocrine loop. In many kinds

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
of cancer cells you have another
alteration of this growth factor

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
signaling pathway. And
here what we see is the

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
following. Instead of there being
a small number of growth factor

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
receptors on the cell surface, now
there are ten or twenty or fifty

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
times more than are normally
present on the cell surface.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
In other words, this
growth, the growth factor

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
receptors are what is
called overexpressed.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And, therefore,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
a delicate balance is
disrupted because normally,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
let's say, a cell with have on
its surface 500 EGF receptors,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
but in many kinds of cancers
probably 30% or 40% of all

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
carcinomas, carcinomas are the
tumors from epithelial tissues,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
you'll find overexpressed
EGF receptor. Well,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
why is that interesting? It's
interesting for the following

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
reason. I told you before that the
activation of a receptor depends on

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
its ligand to persuading two
receptor subunits to come together

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
and start firing,
as we just discussed.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
But if now all of a sudden the
cell contains large amounts of this

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
growth being expressed, of the
growth factor receptor being

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
expressed on the surface, ten
or a hundred times more than

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
normal, then these growth factor
receptors are going to be rather

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
densely packed on the cell surface.
And now they may just come together

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
because they happen to bump
into each other very frequently.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
They don't need the growth factor
to pull them together just because

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
there are so many of them. So,
there's random interactions,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
random bumping together
And these two growth factor

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
receptors may just bump together and
thereby send signals into the cell

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
persuading the cell that there's
been some kind of growth factor in

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
the extracellular domain
that's been encountered when,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
in fact, all that's happened is that
there are so many of these growth

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
factor receptors around that they're
constantly bumping into each other,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
and while they've collided with one
another they can activate signaling

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
and release growth stimulatory
signals into the cell.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
There's another kind of, of
alteration of growth factor

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
receptors that's also seen
in many kinds of human tumors.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
For example, in, in glioblastomas,
which is a brain tumor. And a

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
glioblastoma has the following
kind of, of receptor on the surface.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
It has truncated forms of the EGF
receptor on the surface where a lot

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
of the ectodomain is simply not
present. So, here's the normal EGF

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
receptor, here is a truncated
EGF receptor where a lot of the

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
extracellular domain, which
I'm calling the ectodomain,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
has simply been lopped off.
How has it be lopped off?

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Well, there's been a mutation
it the gene which has,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
in effect, deleted segments
in coding the N-terminus of the

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
receptor protein, which
normally sticks its head out

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
of the cell. And now you have
these truncated receptors.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
And such truncated EGF receptors
are able to fire constitutively.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Constitutively implies that these
receptors are able to fire in a

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
fashion that is no longer
regulated by physiologic signals.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
It's a high steady rate. So
now these receptor molecules,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
these truncated receptor molecules
flood the cell with growth

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
stimulatory signal and, for
reasons that aren't really clear

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
to this day, these two, these
receptor, truncated receptor

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
molecules can dimerize, they
can come together even if

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
there's no extracellular ligand
present, even if there's no growth

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
factor in the extracellular
space. And we now realize,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
for example, that there are a
variety of structurally altered

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
receptors that fire constitutively
into a cell in many kinds of human

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
tumors. And in each case the cancer
cell is deluded into thinking that

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
some growth factor has been
encountered out here when,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
in fact, there's not at all.
Once again, what we see is a

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
situation in which the cell,
the cancer cell is being deluded

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
into thinking there's growth
factors present, extracellular space.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
None has been present at all.
There have been a variety of drugs

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
developed against, for
example, lung cancer.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And there are a variety of
different kinds of lung cancers.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
One is called non-small cell lung
carcinoma. We don't have to deal

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
with the subsets of lung cancers.
And it turned out, it turned out

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
that one of these drugs, it's
called Iressa, had very mixed

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000
effects on patients.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
In about 90% of these, of
the class of lung cancers,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
patients that were treated, the drug
Iressa, used over the last several

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
years, had almost no effect on the
tumor treatment and the patients

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
continued to, to proceed
to their death. It had,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
it really had no effect. But
in 10%, in fact, there was some

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
dramatic responses
and tumors shrunk down.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Now, normally a 10% response rate
would be enough to cause a drug

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
company to abandon all further
development of the drug because it's

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
just too low a response and who
wants to take a drug where the

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
chances of having a good
response are as low as 10%?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
It's just not a good situation.
But then some geneticists here in

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Boston, one group at the MGH and
another over at the Dana Farber,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
began to look at the lung
cancer cells that responded,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
i.e., from tumors of patients that
responded and shrank in response to

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
the drug and the lung, and
the lung cancer cells of

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
patients who didn't. It
turns out that Iressa is an

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
inhibitor of the tyrosine
kinase of the EGF receptor.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
That's how it was designed. In
other words, this drug, it's a

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
low molecular weight drug and it
goes into the tyrosine kinase domain,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
that rectangular thing I showed
you before very schematically,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
and it shuts down the
firing of the receptor.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
That was the motivation
behind creating this drug.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
So, Iressa shuts down the EGF
receptor and 10% of lung cancer

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
patients, their tumor shrank,
the other 90% didn't, weren't

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
effected at all. And
what these two groups of

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
geneticists found over the last
three or four months is that the

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
patients whose tumors responded had
tumor cells where the EGF receptor

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
was mutated and therefore firing
in a constitutively active fashion.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
That is to say there were actually
structural alterations in the

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
receptor. This is a massive
structural alteration of the

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
receptor here,
this truncation.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
But, in fact, in certain patients
the 10% of patients that responded,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
there were much more subtle changes
in the cytoplasmic domain of the

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
protein which allowed these
receptors to constitutively dimerize,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
once again, in a ligand
independent fashion.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
So, these subtle mutations mimic,
in effect, the consequences of

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
deleting or truncating the
extracellular domain in that in both

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
cases one gets a ligand independent
receptor. In those cases where

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
these, where the patients
had a mutant EGF receptor,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
structurally altered EGF receptor
that was firing constitutively,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
there were dramatic
responses to the Iressa drug.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
In the 90% of patients where there
was no effective response to the

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
drug, the EGF receptor was wild-type,
it was present in a wild-type

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
configuration. It
might have been slightly

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
overexpressed but it wasn't,
but it continued to, to function

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
essentially as a normal EGF receptor.
And this represents a major advance

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
in cancer therapy because it
suggests that one has to begin to

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
understand what subsets of patients
one should treat with a drug which

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
can, on its own, have
quite toxic effects on the

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
patient. And,
from now on,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
to state the obvious, when
one gets lung cancer patients

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
one will check quickly using various
reactions, like the PCR reaction,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
to see whether or not their cancer
cells have a mutated EGF receptor.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
And, if they do, they will be
candidates for Iressa treatment with

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
the expectation that 60%, 80%
or even 100% of them will have

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
tumors that respond. And
if they don't have a mutated

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
EGF receptor then they will
not be subjected to a treatment

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
by this drug. This is
the beginning of a new era

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
of cancer drug treatment. It's
called rational drug design,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
or rational treatment, where you
don't just lump all the patients

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
with a certain disease together and
say let's give them all this drug

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
and throw things up in the
air and see what happens.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Here one begins to do a genetic
diagnosis of the genomes of the

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
patient's cancer cells in order to
determine whether or not they have

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
certain mutated genes. In this
case we're referring to one

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
of these growth factor receptors.
By the way, we're talking about lung

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
cancer today, right?
If you are smoking now,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
I always ask the class how
many people are smoking,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
and nobody has the, has the moral
fortitude to raise their hands.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
But if you are smoking now and you
started at this age and you continue.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
And, by the way, if you
start at your age and you

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
continue smoke, stopping
smoking is actually a bit

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
more difficult, quite a
bit more difficult than

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
stopping heroine. That's
pretty interesting,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
right? So, if you continue to smoke
now you will be healthy for a pretty

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
long period of time, probably
another 20 or 30 years.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And for you that sounds like
forever, but when you get to be

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
about 40 or 50 things are
going to start falling apart.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Soon you won't be able to be very
athletic, soon your lungs are going

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
to be able, are going to degrade,
and by the time you reach your

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
fifties, sixties or seventies
what's going to happen is you will,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
on average, have a six to eight
year shortened life expectancy.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Now you say six to eight
years is not that much,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
but it really is. You know,
when you get to be 70 and

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
you think you're going to die next
year or you're going to die in six

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
or eight years it makes a big
difference. Six to eight years is

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
an enormous difference in life
expectancy. 20% of all people who

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
died last year in this country,
20% of all deaths came from

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
cigarette smoking. Imagine that.
And when you die from cigarette

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
smokes, smoking sometimes you get
lung cancer. There probably were,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
I think, 600,000 people who
died from smoking last year.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Six hundred thousand. There were
55,000 American soldiers who died in

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Vietnam in the whole war, there
were 220,000 American soldiers

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
who died in all of World War II,
and last year in this, and there

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
were 3,000, or 2, 00
people who died in the World

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Trade Center. All right?
Got all those numbers?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
So, last year 600, 00
people died premature deaths

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
because they were smoking. How
many people died last year from

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
smoking marijuana?
Maybe two or three,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I don't know. [APPLAUSE] Am I
urging you to do any kind of smoking?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I'm not saying marijuana smoking is
good for you, but I just want you to

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
get these things in
mind, the perspective.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
If you smoke, you know, in
many countries, including this

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
one, there isn't much tension
by, given by the government to,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
dissuading people from smoking,
and here's the reason why. If you

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
smoke, and you going to get, get
sick eventually, eventually the

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
country is always going to have
to pay for your medical costs,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
right? Sooner or later we all have
to pay for the costs of people who

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
get sick. It's all shared
in one way or another.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
But it's not such a big problem
for a government like the

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
American government. Because
if you smoke you're going to

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
die early enough that you
won't draw on social security.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
And, therefore, the government
actually saves money by your smoking,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
because by the time they add up how
much they get on the tobacco tax and

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
how much they earn by your not
living long enough to draw a pension,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
it's much better, it's much
more money than how much

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
it's going to cost to take care
of you while you're dying from

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
emphysema or bladder cancer or
lung cancer or heart disease.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Many more people die from heart
attacks due to smoking than die from

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
lung cancer, in fact.
So, think about this.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Think about this. If you smoke
it's probably a good time to stop

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
because if you continue at your age,
especially if you're women, which is

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
women, for some reason women have
a harder time stopping than men,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
they can't say why. It's
probably some physiological thing.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
If you, if you continue now at your
age, it will be almost impossible to

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
stop. If you live with smokers
ask them to leave. [LAUGHTER]

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
If you live at home with your
parents and they smoke tell them

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
it's time for them to leave.
Throw them out of the house.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Smoke, second-hand smoking
killed probably between 60,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
00 and 80,000 people last year in
this country. Second-hand smoke.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
And, by the way, if you want to
see an interesting phenomenon,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
go to a veterinary hospital because
there they with great frequently,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
frequency treat dogs who have
lung cancer. And why do they

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
have lung cancer? Not
in 99% of the cases,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
in 100% of the cases these
dogs live with owners who smoke.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
An average tobacco smoker goes
through six or eight dogs in his or

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
her lifetime. [LAUGHTER] It's
true. It's absolutely true.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
So if you, if you think the dogs,
if that's a fact for the, for the,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
for the dog owners, think
about what's happening to the

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
inside of your lungs. And so
I'm going to take back what

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I said before. Before
I told you that the most

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
important thing for you to do in
this course is to learn how to think

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
clearly and to assess and to distil
conceptually complex material,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
there's actually one more thing
that's even more important to get

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
out of this course, if
you do, and that is to stop

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
smoking. If you do that, if
you do that it'll be vastly more

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
important for the rest of your
life than anything you learn here.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
So, write that down, vastly more
important. You may think it's

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
glamorous, you may think it's
exciting, but keep in mind,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
people who stop smoking have vastly
greater effects on reducing the

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
morbidity and the mortality in this
country than anything that cancer

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
researchers can do.
Keep that in mind.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And if you start smoking now and
you think that somehow the cancer

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
researchers are going to be able
to come up with some miracle cure by

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
this time you start coughing
and start spitting up blood,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
don't be so certain. They
may not be able to save you,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
to pull your fat out of the
fire. So, I don't know whether I,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
I gave this message in a very subtle
way or I hit you over the head with

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
it. [LAUGHTER] But think,
think about that. Now, now we're

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
going to focus on lung cancer,
we're going to focus on cancer

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
because it's one of the
consequences of cigarette smoking,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
but it's a disease we want to talk
about both this time and next time,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
and we want to relate it
here to the cell cycle and,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
and how the growth of
cell proliferation occurs.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
I told you last time that a human
tumor is roughly-speaking about,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
a human body roughly carries three
times ten to the thirteenth cells.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
So, that's quite a few cells.
That's how many cells there are in

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
the human body, plus or
minus. A human tumor of one,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
let's say one cubic centimeter
is roughly ten to the ninth cells.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
So, a tiny tumor this way
already has a billion cells in it.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And what I want to say is
that those billion cells,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
or if the tumor grows larger to
ten to a hundred billion cells,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
it's still not that much compared
with the overall size of the body.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
But tumors of that size can kill
you. And one, an interesting and

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
important thing to realize about all
the cancer cells in that tumor mass

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
is that they all descend
from a single progenitor.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
In other words, if we imagine a
situation where here are a whole

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
bunch of normal cells and here's
the boundary between normalcy up here

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
and malignancy, malignancy
obviously refers to

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
cancer, we could imagine where there
are many cells which independently

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
cross the boundary from one to the
other and become the progenitors of

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
a vast tumor mass. But
that's not what happens.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
What happens, in fact, is that only
one cell gets converted or becomes,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
as one says here, it becomes
transformed from a normal cell into

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
a cancer cell. And this
transformation causes this

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
one cell to become the progenitor,
the ancestor of all the cells in the

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
tumor mass. So, one
important realization we have

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
about looking at different tumors is
that cancers are monoclonal growths,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
i.e., they form clonal populations.
They're monoclonal in the sense that

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
they all are genetically derived
from a single common ancestor rather

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
than being polyclonal. What
else can we say about cancer

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
cells or the cells in a tumor? If
you take cells out of Petri dish,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
out of an animal or a human
and put them on a Petri dish,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
excuse me, and you put them there,
then what you'll see is following

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
interesting behavior. If you
put normal cells in a Petri

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
dish they'll grow across the bottom
of the Petri dish until they cover

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
the entire bottom
of the Petri dish.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
So, you can put a hundred cells in
and they'll continue to proliferate.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Let's look at the Petri dish from
top down, so you might have a small

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
number of cells here and here,
and normal cells will continue to

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
proliferate until they
begin to touch one another,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
and then they'll stop growing.
And this stopping of growing is,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
is the phenomenon that's
called contact inhibition.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
So, a normal cell will
indicate contact inhibition.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And to state, to state the obvious,
this phenomenon or this behavior of

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
contact inhibition creates what's
called a cell monolayer because if

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
the cell stopped growing once they
touch each other they're not going

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
to be two or three or four
layers of cells in the Petri dish.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
So, here we're looking at this
Petri dish in cross-section and

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
there's a monolayer
of normal cells here.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
If you put a cancer cell in the
Petri dish, or let's put here a

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
cancer cell, we'll seed it amidst
normal cells, what will happen is

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
that the cancer cell lacks,
has lost contact inhibition,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
and the cancer cell will continue to
proliferate even after it's touched

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
its neighbors. So,
it has lost cancer,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
it has lost contact inhibition
and will start growing on top of,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
the cancer cells will start growing
on top of each other because they

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
don't mind growing in spite of
their having intimate contact with

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
neighboring cells. And,
in fact, what you can do is

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
the following experiment. You
can put cells in a Petri dish

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
like this, a whole bunch of
normal cells in a Petri dish,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
and then you can put into them
some kind of transforming influence,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
which we'll talk about very shortly,
i.e., you can influence some of

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
these cells to become transformed.
And how we do so we'll tell, we'll

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
hold in abeyance just for a moment.
So, we'll have this cell. We'll do

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
this cell to become transformed
and this cell to become transformed.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
And what will happen is that those
cells will begin to form a very

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
thick clump of cells, these
blue ones, the ones that are

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
transformed. Whereas, all the
other cells will grow until

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
they form a monolayer at which
point they'll stop proliferating.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
So, the cancer cells keep piling
up and the transformed cells,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
transformed by one or another
agent, we won't talk about that yet,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
continue to proliferate long
after the normal cells have stopped

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
proliferating. The normal
cells having stopped

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
proliferating because
they're contact inhibited.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
And, therefore, they'll form this
clump of cells which we'll call a

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
focus. And if you hold the Petri
dish up to the light and you look at

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
it and there are some
transformed cells present,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
you can see the foci,
they're very thick. Whereas,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
the thin monolayer of cells will
just look pretty transparent.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
But this focus will look highly
opaque by virtue of the multiple

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
layers of cells that
are involved in it.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Now, in fact, we can begin to ask
the question of how and why cells

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
like this become transformed
and exhibit this behavior.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
In fact, until the 1980s there
wasn't really a clear understanding

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
about how that happened. I've
already given you some clues

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000
because I've already told you the
fact that certain cancer cells carry

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
mutant genes. What
kind of mutant genes?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Well, I gave you, in
anticipation of discussion,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
the fact that certain cancer cells
carry mutant genes that specify

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
mutant growth factor receptors.
And these mutant growth factor

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
receptors, as I indicated,
begin to push the cell the

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
proliferate. And so that already
anticipates a conclusion we're about

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
to make, which is that the reason
why cancer cells behave abnormally

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
is that they carry mutant genes.
Now, let's talk about the nature of

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
these mutant genes because, if
you look at these mutant genes,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
invariably they are the consequences
of what we call somatic mutations.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
By that I mean, I mean the
following. Let's say we all start

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
out with a really good set of genes.
And, thank the good Lord, we all do.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
But as we go through life through
accidents or through intent we can

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
damage these genes. We can
muck them up in different

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
ways. And these genes, this
damage may occur to cells in

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
the skin, they may occur to cells in
your belly, they may occur to cells

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
in the brain, and these are called
somatic mutations in contrast to the

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
germline mutations that affect
one's offspring. Because,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
as you must realize by now, the
only way you can have mutations

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
that affect your descendents is if
those mutations strike in the gonads

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
and affect the genomes
of either sperm or egg.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
But the mutations occurring
everywhere else in the body outside

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
of the gonads,
because they occur in,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I think I, this is somatic, excuse
me, because they occur in the

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
soma, the soma is defined as the
entirety of the body outside of the

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
gonads, outside of the germi,
these somatic mutations might affect

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
the tissues around them but they
will not be transmitted from one

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
organismic generation to
the next. And, accordingly,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
we begin to imagine, in
fact, correctly we begin to

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
construct this model that one of
the most important mechanisms of

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
creating a cancer cell is
to damage its genome. So,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
I'll tell you a story now,
which I'm only going to finish on

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Monday. We have, let's
imagine, a 55-year-old,

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
this is a true story, 55-year-old
man who's been smoking since he or

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
she, he was 15 years old. So,
he's been smoking for 40 years.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
And during those periods of 40 years,
by the way, I'm not saying whether

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I'm for or against smoking,
you understand that. During that

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
period of 40 years this person has
been introducing large amounts of

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
tobacco smoke compounds into his
lungs. Now, it turns out that these

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
compounds, this tobacco smoke
compounds are carcinogens.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
You know carcinogen means it causes
cancer. But it happens also to be

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
the case that a lot of carcinogens,
cancer-causing compounds are also

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
mutagens. That is to
say they can mutate DNA.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
So, here we have a scenario that
we're going to set up for next time.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
55-year-old man. Smokes for 40
years. Dumps a lot of carcinogens

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
into his lungs. The
carcinogens which are highly,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
which induce mutations very potently
are passed from his lungs into his

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
blood and there go from
the blood into the kidneys.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
And from the kidneys they are
excreted into the urine and then

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
they sit around in the bladder for
a while. And let's imagine now that

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
the urine of this man has all
of these highly mutation-active

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
carcinogens in his urine, which,
in principle, can begin now

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
to strike out and attack the genomes
of the cells lining the urinary

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
bladder. In other words, by,
by smoking cigarettes you can

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
actually mutate the genomes,
somatic mutation, the genomes of

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
cells lining the bladder of the,
the urinary bladder, or, of course,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000
to state the obvious, you can also
mutate the genomes of the cells

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
lining the alveoli in the lungs.
That's why you get lung cancer.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
And a consequence of this can be,
with serious probability, that now

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
some of these cells become
mutated and that, in turn,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
will lead to a life-threatening
tumor. So, on this very cheerful

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
note and your having heard two
major take-home lessons, have

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
a great weekend. See
you on Monday. Enjoy

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
the parade tomorrow.

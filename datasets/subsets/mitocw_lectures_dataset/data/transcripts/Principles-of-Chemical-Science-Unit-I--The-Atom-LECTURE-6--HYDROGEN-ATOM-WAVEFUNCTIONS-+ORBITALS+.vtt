00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.100
PROFESSOR: All right, let's
just take 10 more seconds.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.540
All right, so someone
want to explain

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.650
why this is the correct answer?

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.260
And we have a
syringe highlighter.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.046
You probably never had
something like this before.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.690
AUDIENCE: OK, so the fourth
excited state is n equals 5.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.460
And then IE is opposite of
the negative number shown.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.532
So it would be a
positive reaction.

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:29.240
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.220
So IE is always
going to be positive.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.600
And you have to pay attention
to what n equals when

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.390
you're in the excited state.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.750
So we've been talking about
the hydrogen atom and binding

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.600
energies.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.950
What comes out of the
Schrodinger equation?

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.020
We have the binding
energies that come out.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.914
And we also have wave functions.

00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:53.330
So today we're
going to be talking

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.040
about wave functions,
which are often

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.500
referred to as
orbitals in chemistry,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.130
for the hydrogen atom.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.820
So when you solve the
Schrodinger equation,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.880
you get out this information
about wave functions.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.610
And what comes out of it
is these quantum numbers.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.170
And we already saw quantum
number n coming out.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.860
But there are three
quantum numbers

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.640
that are going to come out
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.620
And those three
quantum numbers are

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.280
necessary to describe the
wave function or the orbital.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.650
So we have n, the
principle quantum number.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.950
We've already talked about that.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.750
And we've already seen
that n is an integer.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.930
So I'll just put that down here.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.760
So n can equal 1, 2,
3, on to infinity.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.620
So this describes the
energy level or the shell.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.650
Then we have l, which we
haven't talked about yet.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.870
So that's the angular
momentum quantum number.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.440
So it tells you about
the angular momentum.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.260
It also tells you
about the subshell

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.990
or the shape of the orbital.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.760
And so l is related to n.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:22.580
And it can be 0, 1, 2,
3, onward to n minus 1.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.340
So its biggest
number is n minus 1.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.150
Then we have m, the
magnetic quantum number.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.065
And we often see this
also listed as m sub

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:43.040
l because m is
related back to l.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.150
And this is equal to minus
l, dot, dot, dot, to 0,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.190
dot, dot, dot to plus l.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.370
And m describes the behavior
in a magnetic field.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.150
It also describes
the orientation

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.380
of the orbital with
respect to an axes.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.540
And it tells you about the
specific orbital in question.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.209
So we need all three of these
to describe any orbital.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.410
All right, so let's look at
this in a slightly other way.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.220
So we're going to have lots of
different sort of nomenclatures

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.870
for the same thing.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.761
So to describe an orbital,
we need those three quantum

00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.260
numbers.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.490
We need n, l, and m.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:43.360
And this can also be expressed
as our wave function sub nlm.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.370
And again, we talked
about this last time.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.400
We're going to
talk more about it.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.970
So our wave function
is also described

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.560
by r, the radius, and theta
and phi, which are two angles.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.450
And we're going to talk
a lot about those today.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.900
So the wave function
for the ground state

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.950
is abbreviated wave
function sub 1, 0, 0.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.540
Because it's the ground state.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.330
So n equals 1,
and l and m are 0.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.450
So what you see down
here, the 1, 0, 0,

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.940
refers back to what is
n, what is l, what is m.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.320
And this also has another name.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.150
So in the terminology
of chemists,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.910
we call the wave function 1,
0, 0 1s, or the 1s orbital.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.800
So let's look again
now at the same things

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.200
we just talked about,
but going through kind

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.360
of chemistry lingo.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.380
So again, n describes the
shell or the energy level.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.930
Again, it's integers,
1, 2, 3, et cetera.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.630
l in chemistry lingo,
the subshell or the shape

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.930
of the orbital.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.960
And instead of
listing it this way,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.890
we have another way to
list it if we're a chemist,

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.120
and that is s, p,
d, f, et cetera.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.810
So chemists like numbers, but
we also throw in some letters

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.890
every once in a while.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.310
And then m, again, designates
this orbital orientation

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.700
or the specific orbital.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.920
So for s, there's only s.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.620
It doesn't have any
other designation,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.090
as we'll talk more about later.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.200
But for p, we start
having suborbitals.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.030
And there is a
difference in terms

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.550
of the orientation of this.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.870
So we have px, py, pz.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.740
So that's what m tells us about.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.020
So if we have all
three of these numbers,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.570
we get down to the
specific orbital,

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.220
we can say oh, that's
pz, for example.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.880
So we need all of these three
numbers to define the orbital.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.370
And this is in then
the chemistry lingo.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.010
All right, also a little
bit more chemistry lingo.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.090
So here we have l equals 0.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.053
So that is the s orbital.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.810
When l equals 1,
that's the p orbital.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.020
l equals 2 is the d orbital.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.880
And l equals 3 is the f orbital.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.460
And frankly we don't
really go much beyond that.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.010
And in this part of
the course, we're

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.680
really only going to be talking
mostly about s and p orbitals.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.390
We get to d orbitals
around Thanksgiving time.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.050
So you can look forward to that.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.770
And pretty much we're not going
to really talk about f orbitals

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.279
very much at all.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:55.070
You'll need to know
some things about them,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.670
but we're not going to go into
them in any kind of detail.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.640
All right, so if
we keep going then,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.340
we can think about l
equals 1 or our p orbitals.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:15.260
And then when l equals 1, then
m can equal 0 plus 1 or minus 1.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.710
And when m equals 0, that's
by definition the pz orbital.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.910
So when you see m equals
0, that's going to be pz.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.370
And when m is plus
1 or minus 1, those

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.530
are the px or the py orbitals.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.090
And this is just something
that you need to remember,

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.330
that z is the one
that's special.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.940
It's the one that
has m equals 0.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.630
All right, so we can take
all of the nomenclatures

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.660
now and use it to fill
in this awesome table.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.340
So this will help
you kind of keep

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.360
track of all the
different ways you

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.810
can designate the same things.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.460
And we'll fill this in.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.470
So first, state label.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.234
What do I mean by this?

00:09:03.234 --> 00:09:10.610
By this I mean this one 1, 0, 0
to generate this wave function

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.680
where we have this 1, 0, 0
listed below the wave function

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.380
here.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.490
And so now this is just
a little color coding.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.460
But it's blank in your handout.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.380
So n equals 1, so n is first.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.520
l is the second number.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.030
And m is the third here.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.640
So 1, 0, 0, and what
kind of orbital is this?

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.316
You can just yell it out.

00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:36.150
AUDIENCE: 1s

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.250
PROFESSOR: Yep, so
that's the 1s orbital.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.070
And so the 1, n
equals 1, that's 1s.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.600
And now we have our
binding energies again.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.550
And so we can write those
in two different ways.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.260
So we saw for the
hydrogen atom before what

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.430
comes out of the
Schrodinger equation,

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.440
that the binding energy of
the electron for the nucleus

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.340
is minus the Rydberg constant
RH, divided by n squared.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.590
And here n is 1, so
divided by 1 squared.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.700
So this is just the value
for the Rydberg constant,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.910
the negative value.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.140
And binding energies,
again, are always negative.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.000
So we have our first one down.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.920
So now for the
second, what number

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.120
am I going to write here
for the state label?

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.858
You can just yell it out.

00:10:27.858 --> 00:10:30.720
Yep, 200 or 2, 0, 0.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.880
And then you would
put it this way

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.210
where the state label
is by the wave function.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.740
What orbital is this-- 2s.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.120
And then we also know the
binding energies for this.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.670
So here we have minus
RH over n squared

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.900
where n is 2, 2 squared.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.840
And we saw this
number last time.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.220
So we can keep going.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.390
Now we have 2, 1, 1.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.330
So we can write that down.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.240
We can write it both ways.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.876
What orbital is this?

00:11:02.876 --> 00:11:06.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.440
PROFESSOR: So it's a 2p.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.522
And because n is plus 1 and
not 0, it's either x or y.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.940
Do we have a different or
the same binding energy here?

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.830
We have the same, right, because
it's just over n squared.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.790
We're still talking about
n equals 2, so 2 squared.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.020
So it's the same value here.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.090
Now we have m equals 0.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.760
So we write 2, 1, 0.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.080
And now what is that orbital?

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.870
PROFESSOR: 2pz, right,
because that's m

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.630
equals 0, by the
definition I gave you.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.380
So we know that one for sure.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.210
And again, the energies
are going to be the same.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:01.400
And then the last one, so
now we write 2, 1, minus 1.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.930
And now it's again a 2p orbital.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.180
And it's either y or x.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.780
And the energies are
going to be the same.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.550
So these are just
a table that kind

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.600
of interconverts
different ways that you

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.210
will see things written.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.320
And you'll know if you
see it one way, what

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.860
orbital to put down.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.680
And we can also think
about the binding energies

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.410
for those particular
orbitals, or for electrons

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.600
in those particular orbitals.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.383
All right, so why don't you
try a clicker question on this?

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.600
10 seconds.

00:13:24.442 --> 00:13:26.520
Ah, excellent.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.380
Right.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.230
So you're getting
the hang of this.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.840
It's great.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.140
Some things, it's
always nice when

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.306
there's some things that
are pretty straightforward.

00:13:33.306 --> 00:13:35.350
So n equals 5.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:40.160
l equals 1, which means
p orbital and m equals 0,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:40.914
means pz.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.950
So let's think now about
these orbitals again.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.470
And we looked at
that table and saw

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.730
that if we were talking
about n equals 2,

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.050
they all seem to
have the same energy.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.240
So for a hydrogen atom-- and
it will get more complicated

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.780
when we start
talking about things

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.350
with more than one electron.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.930
But for a hydrogen atom,
orbitals that have the same n

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.730
value have the same energy.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.180
So here we have n
equals 1, l equals 0.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.600
This is our 1s.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.550
We have n equals 2, our
2s, and our 2p orbitals.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:28.660
n equals 3, we have
our 3s, 3p, and 3d.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.840
And in this case,
all these orbitals

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.220
are what's known as degenerate
with respect to each other.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.680
They have the same energy.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:46.290
And so for any n with a hydrogen
atom, or any one electron

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:51.650
system, for n shells,
there n square degenerate--

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.370
or for any n there are n
squared generate orbitals.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.220
So they're all going
to be the same energy.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.420
And that changes when we go
to more complicated systems.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.770
But for hydrogen, this holds.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.770
So now I'm going
to tell you why you

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.630
should care a little about
these energy levels again.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:15.110
And today you're going to
hear in their own words

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:20.790
from a graduate student in the
physical chemistry division.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.456
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:23.940
- My name is
Benjamin Ofori-Okai.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.870
I'm entering my third
year of graduate school

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.380
in the chemistry
department here at MIT.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.880
And the work that
I've been focusing

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.546
on for the last couple
of years involves

00:15:31.546 --> 00:15:35.680
nanoscale magnetic resonance
imaging or nano MRI.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.332
When you think of
typical MRI, what

00:15:37.332 --> 00:15:39.540
comes to mind for most people
is the image of a brain

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.930
scan or a heart scan
or some sort of organ

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.930
scan inside the human body.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.570
The way that MRI works
now, the way that you

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.515
take a picture of anything in
your body is you use water.

00:15:50.515 --> 00:15:51.890
And the reason
that you use water

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.660
is because it's made up of
hydrogen atoms and oxygen

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.390
atoms.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.370
And hydrogen atoms actually
generate a magnetic signal.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.030
And so you can take
a picture of that.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:06.290
The idea behind nano MRI is
that you want to take a picture.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.060
You want to do the
same kind of imaging,

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.480
but on a considerably
smaller scale.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.350
We have this probe
which is sensitive

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.432
to local magnetic fields.

00:16:16.432 --> 00:16:17.890
And the way that
the probe works is

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.610
that you have these electrons.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.540
There's a ground state
for these electrons

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.230
and two excited states for these
electrons, which are actually

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.490
degenerate with each other.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.250
And degenerate means that they
just have the exact same energy

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.460
level.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.430
As you move the probe
around, anything

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.060
that's in the environment that
generates a magnetic field

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.900
will change what
the energy levels

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.350
of these two excited states is.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.180
So when you're far
away, there's no change

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.456
and they're exactly the same.

00:16:41.456 --> 00:16:42.830
And as you get
closer and closer,

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.120
these levels start to split.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.832
And what we actually
care about is

00:16:46.832 --> 00:16:48.790
what is the splitting
between these two levels,

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.650
because that's what tells us
what the magnetic field is.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.550
In traditional MRI,
the probe that we

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.530
use, the thing that
measures the fields,

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.850
itself is very, very big.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.790
It's person sized.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.430
The probe that we're
using in this nano MRI

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:04.995
is nanometer sized.

00:17:04.995 --> 00:17:07.119
So this gives us the ability
to look at things that

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.750
are on the nanometer scale.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.660
And to give you a sense of size,
that's like 1/10,000 the width

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.410
of a human hair.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.990
So that includes viruses,
cells, parts of proteins,

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.480
not just the entire protein.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.481
And on top of that, we'll be
able to look within objects.

00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:24.730
So you're not just sensitive
to what's on the surface.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.869
You can actually
see how are things--

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:27.869
what's the constitution?

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.220
What's the makeup of things
within the object that you

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.330
want to image?

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.550
So the long term
goal, the one thing

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.820
that I'd really love to see
this technology be able to do

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.910
is say, OK, we've
got this virus.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.450
Let's just see how it works.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.280
Let's watch it in real time.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.990
Let's see if we can see
how it attaches to cells

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.270
and invades them and
ultimately kills them.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:51.580
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.470
PROFESSOR: OK, so I always think
this is a great time of year

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.210
to show this video because
pretty much viruses, I think,

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.970
start to be on people's minds.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.320
Everyone has sinuses and colds
and other things going on.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.310
And so understanding,
we're still very far away

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.550
from having a real cure
for the common cold.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:19.430
So I think it's very
timely to be talking about,

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.620
talking about this research.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.000
I'll also use this to
remind myself to tell you

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.430
that if you qualify for
extra time on the exam,

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.410
you should get me your
form for the exam.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.420
And it reminded me to
say that because Ben,

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.010
who is a former
TA for this class,

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.100
always proctors the
extra time folks.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.340
So you'll get to
meet him in real life

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.830
if you qualify for
extra time on exams.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.560
So hydrogen is in
fact important.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.590
I'm excited to get
on to elements that

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.550
have more than one electron.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.530
But hydrogen actually does turn
out to be extremely important.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.677
A lot of imaging, as you heard
from Ben, is based on hydrogen.

00:18:59.677 --> 00:19:01.510
So we're spending a lot
of time on hydrogen,

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.500
but hydrogen really, really
is an important element.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:11.320
So continuing on now,
what is the significance

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.583
of this wave function?

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.780
Why do we care about this?

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.120
And so really, we're
interested in trying

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.010
to understand not just how
tightly the electron is

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:27.420
bound to the nucleus, but kind
of how the electrons exist

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.700
around the nucleus.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.250
And so the wave function
really gets at this.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.470
It gets at the probability
density, the likelihood

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:41.150
that you'll find an electron
at a certain location,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.970
the probability per unit volume.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.820
And again, this is a
three dimensional problem.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.840
So our wave function
depends on a radius r.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.510
But it also depends on two
angles, the theta and phi.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.510
And so you can kind of think of
those as latitude and longitude

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.350
if you will.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.640
And so we want to know
what the probability is

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.760
that an electron will be at
a certain r, theta, and phi

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:13.350
position in a particular small
unit volume in that area.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.840
How well can we understand
where the electron is?

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.900
And this gives rise to a lot of
the properties of the elements.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:27.380
So probability density,
density per unit volume.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.590
So really, when we're talking
about where electrons are,

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.170
we're thinking about
a shape of an orbital,

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.670
a shape of a probability density
of where that electron might

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.620
be.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.500
So now we're going to
think about shapes.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.120
So we can define a
wave function in terms

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.250
of two properties, a radial wave
function and an angular wave

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.030
function.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.270
So again, the wave function
has these three things.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.220
We are considered with a
radius and these two angles.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.990
So we can rewrite
this, breaking up

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.240
these two different components--
the radial component that

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.510
depends on the radius-- so
that's easy to remember,

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.750
radial, radius-- and
the angular component

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.930
that depends on the angles.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.860
So the nomenclature
here is pretty good.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.870
All right, so we have
these two components.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.140
So now I'm going to
show you a table that

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.540
is largely from your book.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.040
Don't let it scare you.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.210
You do not need to memorize
any of these things.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:28.930
And I'm showing this
to you because I

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.800
want you to believe me about
certain properties of these two

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.490
functions.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.610
So here they are solved.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.020
You can look them up.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.840
Actually I think we just
typed a new copy of this

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.070
so it was easier to see.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.002
If you find any typos,
please let me know.

00:21:44.002 --> 00:21:45.710
But there's a couple
of important points.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.380
So on this side, we have
the radial wave function,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.620
and over here we have the
angular wave function,

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.070
for various values of n and l.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.010
So again, not an
exhaustive list here.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.890
And a lot of these are
written in terms of a0,

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:09.960
which is the Bohr radius, which
is a constant, 52.9 picometers.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.750
All right, so now let's just
consider the ground state.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.990
So we'll start with
that lowest energy

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.860
state or most stable state,
the 1s orbital for the hydrogen

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.640
atom.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.360
So we have our wave
function 1, 0, 0 here.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.700
And this is 1s up here.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.990
Again, n equals 1. l equals 0.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.960
So that's 1s.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.520
And z for hydrogen atom is 1.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.280
So I've gotten rid of all z's
to make it a little simpler.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.470
So here we have the
radial wave function

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.730
times the angular wave function,
which is listed up here.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.590
And the thing that I
really want you to notice

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:52.440
is that for all of the s
orbitals, this is a constant.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.590
So this is always the angular
component for all s orbitals.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:03.630
And in fact, there are no
angular components in there.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:09.390
So all 1s, 2s, 3s, all
have this same constant.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.890
And that leads to a
very important property

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.270
of s orbitals, which
is that they're

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.800
spherically symmetrical.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.580
In other words, they're
independent of those angles,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.950
of theta and phi.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.010
And so that means that
the probability of finding

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.470
the electron away
from the nucleus

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.170
is just going to depend on r.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.680
There's only r in this equation.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.070
The angles are not
part of the equation.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.250
So s is spherically symmetrical.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.250
The probability of
finding the electron

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.480
just depends on the radius.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.650
So we can draw a picture,
or multiple pictures,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.060
of what that could look like.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.060
And these are
three common plots.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.020
So I'll tell you
that on your handout,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.030
the plots are
listed on one page,

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.670
and then the plots are
shown on the next page.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.010
And I'm going to kind of go
back and forth between things.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.360
So the plots-- don't
have to write this down.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.540
They're on the other page.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.230
But if you want to pay
attention to which kind of plot

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.280
goes with which plot.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.310
So these are three different
ways to, quote, visualize.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:24.100
And some people say, can you
give me another visualization?

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.130
We're really just trying to
think about probabilities

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.880
of finding electrons here.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.224
And so you can't sort of
take a picture of an orbital.

00:24:32.224 --> 00:24:33.890
So these are just
different ways to help

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:38.370
people think about that possible
distribution of electrons

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.850
around the nucleus.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.880
All right, so one thing that
everyone's feeling pretty good

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.410
about is that it should
be spherically symmetric

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.710
hole for an s orbital.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.700
And so we have a circle.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.270
And so the probability
density, which

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.670
is shown in this plot-- and
the probability density parts

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.480
are basically just dots
where the more concentrated

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.550
the dots are, the
higher the probability

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.930
density for that
particular-- the probability

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.470
for that particular
volume exists.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.190
So in here there are sort of
more dots and then less dots

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.660
as you come out.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.450
And so that is a
circle, which is what?

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:18.950
It's symmetrical.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.710
So you can always
recognize a 1s.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.650
You have this symmetrical thing.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:29.240
So this is the wave function
squared, is this probability

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.000
density plot.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.180
Another kind of plot
that you can see

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.770
looks at the radial
wave function

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.750
plotted against the
distance r here,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.120
distance from the nucleus.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.800
And then a third kind of plot
is another probability plot,

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.290
like this one up here.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.850
But instead of the dots
indicating the higher

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.300
probability density, you
have a radial probability

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.750
distribution.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:01.490
And so at the nucleus,
at 0, well then

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.960
the probability goes up.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.410
The electron is not going
to crash into the nucleus,

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.860
so it won't be right
on top of the nucleus.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.350
But as you get out a
little bit farther away,

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.560
there's a high probability
that it's there.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.630
And then that decreases again.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.380
So the top one
and the bottom one

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.900
both talk about the probability
of finding an electron

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.920
in a particular unit.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.880
And I'll give you just a
little more definition of this.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.830
And this is on the same page
above those different plots.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.470
So the radial
probability distribution

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.470
reports on the
probability of finding

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.750
an electron in the
spherical shell

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.410
at some little distance
dr from the origin.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.100
And one thing that
comes out of this,

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.670
which is pretty important,
is the most probable value

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.980
for that distance
r, which is denoted

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.890
rmp, so most probable distance.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.930
And for a hydrogen atom,
this is a0, the Bohr radius.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:06.190
And you can see it expressed
in different units over here.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:11.080
And from the plot, that will
be the top part of the plot,

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.080
the most probable distance.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.190
In this case, that's the Bohr
radius for the hydrogen atom.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.760
So we have now these
three different kinds

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.670
of plots that you'll see.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.990
And I want to point out that
they're different plots.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.270
Sometimes people are thinking
that there is sort of one plot

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.260
and they're trying to read one
of them as probability density,

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.220
and that's not what it is.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.100
So we'll look at these again.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.260
All right, so going
back and we'll just

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.070
look at them again now that
we sort of talked about what

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.580
all of them are,
again, we have our sort

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.800
of dot density, probability
density plot, our wave function

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:54.240
plot, and our radial
probability distribution plot.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.990
And for 1s, we have the dots
closer to the nucleus here.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.250
Probability goes
up and goes down.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.910
And here, you're
thinking about this

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.870
as the amplitude of finding
an electron as you move away

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.710
from the nucleus.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.380
So 1s is pretty simple.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.120
And I think these plots are a
lot more meaningful when we go

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.890
on to look at other orbitals.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.130
So let's think about
those other orbitals.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.390
And we'll finish
the other plots.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.256
So this is just-- you can
actually stay, in this case.

00:28:30.256 --> 00:28:32.130
So we're going a lot of
back and forth today.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.250
So here is your table
that we had before.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.770
And here's 1s.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.030
Here's 2s.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.340
Here's 3s.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.770
These terms are in fact
different, as you can see.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.370
But the angular term,
as we mentioned before,

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.580
is still the same.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.370
So that means 2s and 3s
are still symmetrical.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.430
So we're still thinking
about the probability

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.440
of finding an electron
in some volume

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.300
as just going out
as a distance of r.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.860
So let's look now at the three
plots, and compare those plots.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.260
And this is the one on
your handouts we looked at.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.200
I showed you this.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.750
And now we have all of these
three plots together here.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.970
And in the comparison
of these three,

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.220
I think it helps
differentiate what

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.940
you're seeing in these plots.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:27.000
So important point,
they're spherical.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.280
1s, 2s, 3s, they're
all spherical.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.760
And here we see the
dot density increase.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.930
And then the dot
density goes to 0.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.250
And that's known as a node.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:46.210
So a node is a value
of r or theta or phi

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.810
for which the wave
function and wave function

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.730
squared, or the
probability density, is 0.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.760
And in this particular case, the
type of node that we're seeing

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.050
is a radial node.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.730
And so that's a value of r
for which the wave function,

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:08.450
wave function squared
probability density is 0.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.250
So it goes to 0.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.050
We have a node, a radial node.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.490
Then there's more probability.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.310
And then it increases, and
then starts decreasing again.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:24.510
And so if you plot this with the
radial wave function versus r,

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.530
you see it go down.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.590
And it crosses the
zero line here.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.120
And that's the node.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.200
And that's at 2a0.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.780
And then it goes back up.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.650
And this plot often
bothers people.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.770
They're saying, what, there's
now negative probability?

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.610
No, these are not the
probability diagrams.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.260
This is thinking
about the amplitude

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.880
of finding an electron.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.940
So we don't have to worry.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.550
It can have a positive or
a negative phase to it.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:58.220
And if you look at this
plot, the radial probability

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.650
distribution plot,
then you'll see

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:04.610
that actually the radius,
the most probable radius

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.060
is in this region over here.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.560
And you see that this is
concentrated dots up here.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.130
So if we think about these two,
which are really probability

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:18.080
distribution diagrams, we're
thinking about the probability

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.690
of finding an electron.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.840
You have a probability in
here close to the nucleus.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.420
Then you get a node.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.520
And then you have another
probability, high probability

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.140
of finding the electron.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.930
In fact that's the most
probable radius here for 2s.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.730
And then it decreases.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.330
So this line shows
you what a radial node

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.160
looks like in all three plots.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.760
In this probability
diagram, wave function

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.650
squared plot, it looks like
there's just an empty space,

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:52.930
no dots at all.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.050
Down here, it's where
it crosses the line.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:00.430
And in the bottom plot, it
is where you go up and down

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:04.080
and again touches the
line before going back up.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.410
So you should be able
to look at these plots

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:10.610
and think about what they mean.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:14.140
For 3s, we see the same thing.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:20.210
But now we have an intense spot
in the middle near the nucleus.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.540
That is indicated down here.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.130
There is probability of finding
the electron near the nucleus.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.510
Then there's a node.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.220
And that's in this plot
where it crosses the line

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.710
and in this plot where
you have the empty space.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.360
Then you have more probability
of finding the electron.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.850
You have another bump here.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:44.210
And then we have another node,
indicated by touching the zero

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.920
line here, touching here.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.090
That's at 7.1a0.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.730
And then we have
more probability

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.500
of finding the electron.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:33:00.560
And this is where the most
probable radius is at 11.5.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.630
So again, you need to be able
to look at these diagrams

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:07.050
and recognize what
constitutes a radial node.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.660
And a node is a
place where there

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.490
is no probability that you're
going to find an electron.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.820
So now let's think about
how many nodes, or radial

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.020
nodes you should
have when you have

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.890
different types of orbitals.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.710
And this is just a similar
diagram to what I just showed.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:35.730
This is the wave function
squared, probability diagram.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.170
And now instead of blue
you have orange dots,

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:43.900
but otherwise should be the
same-- so for 1s, for 2s,

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.980
and 3s.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.680
So for the 1s orbital,
we can calculate

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.700
how many radial
nodes that we should

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:57.540
have by using this handy
formula, n minus 1 minus l.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.430
So for 1s we have 1 minus 1.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.230
And l is 0.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.990
So we have zero radial nodes.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.290
And we can see that
from that diagram

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.040
there are zero radial nodes.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.790
2s now-- 2, n is 2.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:19.139
Minus 1, minus 0-- so
that's one radial node.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:22.040
And the radial node, again,
in this kind of diagram

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.810
is the empty space.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.330
And that radial node is at 2a0.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:37.010
For 3s, we have n equals 3 minus
1 minus l, which is still 0.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.070
So we have two radial nodes.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:44.630
And so again, the empty
space here at 1.9a0 and then

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.070
at 7.1a0.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.469
So why don't you
give this a try now

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:55.210
and tell me what kind of radial
nodes you would expect for 4p.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.377
OK, 10 seconds.

00:35:21.377 --> 00:35:22.293
These are pretty fast.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.470
Yep.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:44.240
So again, we have to do
n, which is 4, minus 1.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.530
And then what is l
in this case-- 1.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.250
So that gives you 2.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:58.674
All right, so 4 minus 1
minus 1 or 2 radial nodes.

00:35:58.674 --> 00:36:00.340
All right, don't put
your clickers away.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.300
Let's try something else.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:10.120
So now tell me which of these
is correct both in terms

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.080
of the indicated
number of radial nodes

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.940
and in terms of the
plot for a 5s orbital.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.436
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:30.310
We're varying it up
in terms of the plots.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:40.970
So maybe someone want to say
what the right answer is here?

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:41.470
Yeah?

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.960
AUDIENCE: So by the
formula we just did,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.270
that has four radial nodes.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.060
And if you look at the
graph of one, there's three,

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.260
and then there's another
one at the origin.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.110
So that's four radial nodes.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.040
Right?

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.400
Right?

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.730
PROFESSOR: Actually,
I just realized

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.650
that-- let me count here.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:12.300
So this answer here, we
should have four radial nodes.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.960
That is correct because
we have n minus 1 minus l.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.000
Actually, I think this
is going to this--

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.500
this should be going
to this answer,

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:27.250
because if we count 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.700
Sorry, the new plot
is highly confusing.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.930
I have to count.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.855
So the one at the origin
should actually not count.

00:38:33.855 --> 00:38:34.980
AUDIENCE: It doesn't count?

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.526
PROFESSOR: This is not a node.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:45.835
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, should
be our four radial nodes.

00:38:45.835 --> 00:38:49.640
Because that's a nucleus,
and there isn't one there.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.450
But that doesn't
count as a node.

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.780
So this should be here.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.360
I guess that's-- right.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:03.220
But thank you very much,
and [INAUDIBLE], here.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.049
You were brave enough to answer.

00:39:10.049 --> 00:39:11.090
Yeah, there's a question?

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.490
AUDIENCE: Should there also
be a certain number of peaks

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:22.044
in the graph as well as nodes?

00:39:22.044 --> 00:39:22.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:28.840
So if you look at the peaks,
these are really hard to draw.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.420
And I think that's partly
what the problem is.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:36.450
But when we look
later in the handout

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:41.070
where they're drawn a
little bit more carefully,

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.650
it does increase.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.590
So there are different numbers.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.940
So we'll have nodes
going down here.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.080
But then we'll have
more distributions.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.250
But often the ones
as you go along,

00:39:55.250 --> 00:40:00.370
it does indicate where the
most probable radius is

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:05.660
as the taller ones, and that
it's usually drawn at the end.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.960
So we have some plots and
I'll point this out later.

00:40:12.272 --> 00:40:14.230
We're going to look at
more plots, don't worry.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.900
So if anyone's good
at drawing those,

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.571
let me know, because
they're really hard to draw.

00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:27.320
So a lot of them are
copied from the book,

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.760
but then they don't
copy very well.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.740
So let's consider
other kinds of nodes.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.180
And we're going to come
back to radial nodes.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.030
All right, so what
about p orbitals?

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.730
So here we have our table again.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:42.270
These are our p
orbitals over here.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:51.880
And we have our n equals 2
cases here and our l equals 1.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:58.460
So these are x, y, and z--
so our 3p orbitals over here.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.120
And the important point
is not to memorize

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.580
what these values are.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.220
But now all of a sudden we
have dependence on angles.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.400
So we're going to have an
angular component to these.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.480
And that means the
probability density

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.150
as you go out from the
nucleus doesn't just

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.830
depend on r anymore.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:22.260
It depends on theta
and phi, which

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:29.530
are sort of the equivalent
to latitude and longitude,

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.280
if you're thinking
about geography.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.500
All right, so let's see
what that looks like.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.420
So that means then
the p orbitals

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:42.870
are not spherically symmetric,
because it depends on angle.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:47.080
So you just don't go out and
have the probability depend

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.960
on the radius and
it's symmetrical

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.642
in all the different directions.

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:53.350
And here are what some
of them look like.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.930
These figures are
in your handouts.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.122
Here are some other figures.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.060
So the orbitals
consists of two lobes.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:07.740
So you could view this as a lobe
up here and a lobe down here.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:11.900
Or you have these lobes as these
two different colors over here.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.710
And the lobes are
separated by a nodal plane.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.630
And the nodal plane is a
plane on which the probability

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:23.550
of finding the electrons is 0.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.200
So in the top drawing, the
nodal plane is drawn as a plane.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.670
And in the bottom drawings,
you don't see a plane.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.130
You just see an empty
space between the lobes.

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:36.550
So empty space here, empty
space here, empty space there.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.680
And so if it helps
you to kind of think

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.570
about an actual plane
in between, that's good.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.990
Or you can just
think that there's

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:47.370
a break between these nodes.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.960
And again, the
nodal plane, there's

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:55.300
no probability of finding an
electron in the nodal planes.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.990
And the nodal planes
are at the nucleus.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.360
Therefore, there
is zero probability

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.440
of finding a p electron
at the nucleus.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.560
s can get pretty
close to the nucleus.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.980
But with a p orbital,
there's a nodal plane there.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.530
No electrons are going
to be at the nucleus.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:18.350
So now if you're going out from
the nucleus, the probability

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.280
of an electron,
finding it, if you're

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.660
going out in this
direction, you're

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.010
not going to do very well.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.700
If you're going
in this direction,

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.110
you should do a lot better.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.560
So here the angular
components really matter.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.960
That defines the
shape of the orbital.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.110
And where you're going,
what direction you're

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:36.810
going in, what
angles you're going

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.250
in matters in terms of
whether you're going

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:43.020
to find that electron or not.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.680
So another way to
think about this

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.140
in sort of these nodal
planes-- so here we'll

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.860
just define what plane it is.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.120
So we have our pz orbital.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.790
That's a nodal plane
then in x and y.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:01.680
And so x and y are over here.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.620
Our px orbital is
going to be in--

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:10.070
or the nodal plane is going to
be in yz plane, so over here.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:15.410
And py will be in xz plane.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.300
So again, these
nodal planes, there's

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.300
no electron density there.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.330
And these arise from
these angular nodes

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.190
in the wave function.

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:28.090
So angular nodes
then or these angular

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:32.440
nodal planes are
values of theta and phi

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:38.060
for which the wave function,
wave function squared are 0.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.060
So this is very
different from the s case

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.810
where we only had radial nodes.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.990
But now, when in
the p orbitals where

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:51.870
the angular component matters,
they're angular nodes as well.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:56.820
So we can think about how to
calculate the angular nodes.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:02.990
So total nodes is going
to be equal to n minus 1.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:06.870
The angular nodes is l.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:15.840
And as we saw before, the radial
nodes are n minus 1 minus l.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.310
So let's have more practice
in calculating these.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.200
And then we'll look
at some more diagrams.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.410
So for 2s, total nodes-- and
you can just yell this out.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.910
Total nodes will be what?

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.180
AUDIENCE: 1

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.460
PROFESSOR: 1-- 2 minus 1 or 1.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.200
Angular nodes are?

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.260
AUDIENCE: 0

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.300
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.780
For 1s, there is none.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.510
And if you forget,
l equals 0 there.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.530
Radial nodes is going to be?

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.530
AUDIENCE: 1

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:51.800
PROFESSOR: Right, 2
minus 1 minus 0, or 1.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.830
All right, let's try 3--
or sorry, 2p is next.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:00.000
Total nodes?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.520
1 again, so 2 minus 1 or 1.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.620
Angular nodes?

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.850
1-- l equals 1 here.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.840
And radial node?

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:14.920
Right, 2 minus 1 minus 1, or 0.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.370
So since there's
only one total node,

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.450
if you figured out there
was one angular node,

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.650
you could even realize that
there had to be zero there.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.990
It's a way to check
maybe your equations.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:29.840
All right, so let's
try for 3d now.

00:47:03.192 --> 00:47:03.900
How are we doing?

00:47:16.454 --> 00:47:18.162
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:43.220
And let's just work
that out over here.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:51.390
So total nodes for 3d,
we have 3 minus 1 or 2.

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:56.650
Angular nodes, l equals 2 for d.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:04.450
So radial nodes, we have
3 minus 1 minus 2, or 0.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:07.890
All right, so bring these
handouts on Wednesday

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:11.310
because we need to go back and
look at more radial probability

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:12.480
diagrams.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.150
And talk more about nodes.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:38.320
All right, let's just
do 10 more seconds.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.070
OK, good job everyone.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.330
Let's look through
this a little bit.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:08.420
And you can sort of--
everyone can help.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.330
Yell out some responses.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:12.380
So this was 2s.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.500
And that was the correct answer.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:20.540
Which type of
orbital is this-- 2p.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.780
And if you couldn't read
this information here,

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.140
you should have been able
to read the information

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.000
about the nodes.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.340
What equation is that for nodes?

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:36.010
Yeah, n minus 1 minus l,
for what kind of nodes?

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.840
AUDIENCE: Radial.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.210
PROFESSOR: Radial nodes, right.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:43.710
So if you know what it means if
l equals 0 versus l equals 1,

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:45.580
and you knew this
was l, then you

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.840
could tell if it was an
s orbital or a p orbital.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.970
And then whether it was
2 or 3p is from the n.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:55.570
So even if you
couldn't read this,

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:59.350
if you knew that expression,
then you were OK.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.440
What kind of orbital
was in plot C?

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.610
This was a 3s.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.680
l equals 0.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.205
And then this is a what, 3p and?

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.390
l equals 2.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:18.730
Louder.

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.260
D, right?

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:27.960
So do 3px, 3py, and 3pz
have different plots?

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.830
No, they wouldn't
have different plots.

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:35.470
So we'll continue
to look at this.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.210
And we're going to be
starting with the handout

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:39.370
from last time.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:41.710
And so let's
continue with Monday

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:48.650
and continue with these radial
probability distributions.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.210
So this is again
from Monday, page 6.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.400
We're talking
about orbital size.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.920
And we've already looked
at this a little bit today.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.700
So we should be able
to go through this now

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.040
in a little bit more detail.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.960
You've already thought about it.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.110
So here we have the 2s orbital.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.400
And we're going to
have one node using

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.920
our equation that you just
told me, n minus 1 minus l.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:19.690
And when we go from 2s to 2p,
here we have no radial nodes.

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:23.090
And we can look
at r and p, which

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:26.940
is the radius of the maximal
probability of finding

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.250
an electron.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:33.480
And you can note that when
you go from the 2s to the 2p,

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.300
the radius actually decreases.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:42.090
So the most probable radius
for 2p is less than that of 2s.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:47.020
Now let's consider
the 3, n equals 3.

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:52.200
So we have the 3s
situation over here.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.710
And so l equals 0.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.290
We have two nodes here.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:52:00.730
And now if you look at the
radius, the axis over here,

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:03.610
you'll see that the
most probable for 2s

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:08.450
is close to 5a0, where
a0 is the Bohr radius.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:12.470
And over here you're
talking between 10 and 15.

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:16.660
So we see an increase
in size going this way.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:23.590
And then when we go from 3s to
3p-- so here we have 3 minus 1

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:25.690
minus l, which is 1.

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:33.400
So we have one node, down to 3d,
3 minus 1 minus 2, zero nodes.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.910
And you see that there
is a decrease here

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:40.320
in the most probable radius.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:43.960
So, OK, interesting.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:51.540
All right, so 3d has the
smallest, next 3p, next 3s.

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.700
So there's two different
trends we're seeing.

00:52:54.700 --> 00:53:00.330
One, as we increase l
within the same n number,

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:06.440
and one going from a smaller
value of n to a larger value,

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.950
and then again within
the 3, within the n value

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.040
as we change l.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.580
So again, to say the same
thing in a different way,

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:24.930
as n increases from 2 to 3, the
radius, most probable radius

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:27.300
or the size increases.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.040
So from here to here we
have an increase in size.

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:35.550
I just want to make
sure people have

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:41.560
time to kind of get all of this
down, but it should be good.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.490
I have a little
picture that just shows

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:46.200
they're very different in size.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.260
So we'll go back to this again.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:54.220
And then as I also said, as
l increases for a given n--

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:59.090
so from l equals 0
to l equals 1 here,

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:02.880
then we have a
decrease in the size.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.060
So you can see the most
probable radius moves over.

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.615
And then here is
another within n.

00:54:09.615 --> 00:54:11.670
And n equals 3.

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:15.870
We see, again, this decrease.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.300
So those are the
two trends that you

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.740
observe when you look at
these radial probability

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.010
distributions.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.130
So for exam one next
week, you should

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:27.790
be able to draw
distributions like this.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:30.470
You should be able to
tell me how many radial

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:34.430
nodes you have for
different types of orbitals.

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:37.230
And you should know
these trends in size.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.740
So I think in the
exam instructions

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.700
it says up to a 5 case.

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.060
You don't have to go on forever
to be able to draw them,

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.685
but you should be
able to look at these

00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:51.440
and tell what kind of orbital
it is and where the nodes are,

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.760
be able to draw where the
nodes are-- one node here,

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.020
one, two, one node here.

00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.870
This kind of thing will
be on the exam next week.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.500
So there's something that's a
little counterintuitive when

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.870
it comes to this size issue.

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:09.220
And that has to do with
how this correlates

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.320
to the amount of shielding,
and as we see later,

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.160
to the energy levels.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:18.020
So only electrons
in the s state here

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:21.190
really have any kind of
substantial probability

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:23.330
that they'll be
close to the nucleus.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:26.550
So we have this
little blip over here

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.840
that is close to the nucleus,
that at are very small

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.120
radii, very small values of r.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.990
Even though the most
probable is out here,

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:40.380
if we compare 3s to 3p and
look at where the electrons are

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.590
that are closest to the
nucleus, they're quite a bit

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:46.210
farther away than in the 3s.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:48.820
Or there's more
probability that there's

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:50.690
going to be some closer here.

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:54.530
And then the closest probability
over here for these electrons

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:56.340
is quite a bit farther away.

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:59.070
So we see these circles
kind of move out.

00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.900
So even though the
overall radius,

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.310
the sort of size of the
whole thing is decreasing,

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:06.860
the probability
that there are going

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:10.190
to be electrons really
close is actually

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:12.420
going in the opposite direction.

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:15.840
And so what this means
is that s electrons

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.980
are the least shielded
because there's

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.100
higher probability that they'll
be some close to the nucleus.

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.500
There's more penetration
close to the nucleus.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.202
So s electrons are
the least shielded.

00:56:30.202 --> 00:56:31.910
And we're going to
come back to this when

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:34.120
we move on to today's handout.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.020
This is really important
in terms of thinking

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.400
about the energy levels.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.280
And I'm going to
have these diagrams

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.230
on the handout for today.

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:44.350
So we'll see them again.

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.960
All right, so before we
move to that handout,

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.740
we've got to finish
our quantum numbers

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.500
and talk about electron spin.

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.830
So the fourth quantum
number describes

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.130
the spin on the electron.

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:03.460
And we already saw the
magnetic quantum number m.

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.310
We saw m sub l.

00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:07.790
And now we have m sub s.

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.470
And the s stands for spin.

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:15.250
So there's some nomenclature
that actually makes sense.

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:20.550
So there are two possible
spin values for an electron.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:27.580
And s can equal plus 1/2, spin
up, or minus 1/2, spin down.

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.870
And here are some
little pictures of that.

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:38.050
So this ms term, this spin
magnetic quantum number,

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:41.140
completes the description
of the electron.

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.980
But it's not dependent
on the orbital.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:46.280
To describe an
orbital completely,

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.330
you only need three
quantum numbers.

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:52.720
But to describe the
electron, you need four.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.990
And that is shown, again,
here on this picture,

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:57.070
or on this slide.

00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:58.670
You need three quantum numbers.

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:04.410
You need n, l, and m sub l to
describe the quantum number,

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:07.200
describe the orbital completely.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.710
But you need a fourth
one, this m sub

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.310
s to describe the electron.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:16.840
So if you see wave
function n, l, m sub l,

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.930
you say that's telling
me what the orbital is.

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:23.580
And if we add the m sub
s, then you look at that

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:25.450
and say oh, that's
going to tell me

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:29.350
all the way to the
electron what is going on.

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:37.260
So this final quantum
number led to what

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:42.490
we know as Pauli's
exclusion principle, which

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:47.300
is that no two electrons can
have the same four quantum

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.250
numbers.

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:51.760
They can't have the same--
no two electrons can have

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.910
the same spin, in other words.

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:58.940
So if we are drawing a
configuration for neon

00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:02.200
with 10 electrons,
we are going to have

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:06.130
with one electron being
up spin, the next one

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:07.910
is going to be down.

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:11.100
Because if we had two
of these both going up,

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.700
they would have the same
four quantum numbers.

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:18.780
And that's not allowed by
Pauli's exclusion principle.

00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:22.440
So when you have two
here, one spin up,

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.460
one spin down in
an orbital, then

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.840
we say that those
electrons are paired.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.250
And an important thing that
kind of comes out of all of this

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:35.270
is that one orbital can't
hold more than two electrons.

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:38.550
If it did, there'd
be another electron

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.770
that would have the same
four quantum numbers.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:43.470
Because you need three
quantum numbers to describe

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:45.580
the electron, or the orbital.

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:50.180
We need three to describe, say,
that it's n equals 1, and then

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.990
its s state.

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:55.190
So we need those other ones to
describe the orbital and then

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:56.820
the fourth one to
describe the spin.

00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:58.540
So if we add another
electron, you'd

00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.100
have two that were spin up, say.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.500
And that just wouldn't work.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:06.050
So you cannot have more than two
electrons in the same orbital.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.760
And this makes a
lot of sense when

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.670
you think about why you would
be putting electrons in orbitals

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:12.650
that are higher energy.

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:16.820
Why not just keep putting him
in the low energy orbital?

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.540
And it's because
you can't do that.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.670
You can't put more
than two electrons in.

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:24.610
And so therefore once you've
filled a lower energy orbital,

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:28.990
you've got to move up to the
next lowest energy orbital.

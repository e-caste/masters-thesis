WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
OK.  Today we're going to get into
some stuff where we're kind of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
peering way back in evolution about
how life first learned to make

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
energy.  But before we do that I
just want to finish up talking a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
little bit more about enzymes,
the biological catalysts that are

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
critical for life to exist and about
how energy is stored.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I want to clarify a point that
clearly confused a couple of you in

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the last lecture.
So the Gibbs free energy that we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
talked about can tell us that a
reaction could go and,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in this case, would actually release
energy if it occurred,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
if these reactants were converted to
these products.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But the problem for most reactions
is that in order for the reaction to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
take place there's a state in the
middle, some chemical state known as

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the transition state which is
energetically less favorable than

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
either the reactants
or the products.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And if A and B are going to convert
to C and D they have to probably

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
start coming together in some kind
of way, and that becomes

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
energetically unfavorable.
And this gives this activation

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
energy --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
-- or delta G00.
And if the cell wants chemical

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
reactions to take place at 25
degrees Centigrade aqueous solution

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it has to do something about that,
and so it employs biological

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
catalysts.  And what a catalyst does,
as you've heard in chemistry,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
is it lowers the activation energy
in some way so that the molecules

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
have enough energy just within their
normal energy distribution at that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
temperature to get over the hump.
These biological catalysts come in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
two flavors.  As I said there are
enzymes which are made of protein

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
with all of those amino acids,
the side chains that we talked about

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
when the thing folds up in
3-dimensional space form a little

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
chemical environment that enables
that activation energy to be lowered.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There are also few --
Not so many.  But we now know that

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
there are catalysts made out of RNA.
These are called ribozymes.  There

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
are not so many of them but they're
important.  Now,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the characteristics of these that
are important is the specificity --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Each enzyme or ribozyme is highly

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000
specific for a given reaction.
So that means the reaction probably

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
will barely go unless that enzyme or,
in some cases,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
ribozyme is present.
And so that's really the secret to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
how cells control all of these many,
many, many hundreds or thousands of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
chemical reactions that take place
that are necessary for life.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Because what they need to do,
and if they want to control whether

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
reaction takes place or not is they
control the availability or the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
activity of an enzyme.
And when we talk about gene

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
regulation you'll see,
for example, one way a cell might do

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
it is to not even bother to make the
enzyme unless it wants a particular

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
reaction to take place.
Or it could take an enzyme that's

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
there and put little bells and
whistles on it that make it more

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
active or less active.
And we'll see an example of that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
pretty soon.  That is the secret to
how cells are then able to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
regulate metabolism.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And these biological catalysts use a
whole variety of different molecular

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
mechanisms, although all of them
follow this principle of what

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
they're trying to do is lower the
activation energy.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So I'll just give you an example.
I showed you of how one particular

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
enzyme does it just in sort of
cartoon form.  I gave you the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
example of glutamate being converted
to glutamine.  Now,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
both of those are amino acids that
are critical for making proteins.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The cell has to make both of them.
But as I showed you converting

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
glutamate to glutamine is
energetically unfavorable.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
It's got a delta G plus 7.
And then I showed you if you had an

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
ATP going to ADP at the same time
you could actually drive the whole

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
reaction forward because there was a
net gain.  But how is that actually

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
accomplished?  And it's the enzyme
that carries this out.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And I'll just show you,
as I say, in sort of cartoon form.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The way the enzyme works it has one
binding pocket for glutamic

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
acid or glutamate.
It fits in here.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It makes lots of specialized
contacts, all those sort of

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
molecular interactions we're talking
about.  And it also binds this

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
molecule adenine triphosphate or ATP
which is an adenine,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
a ribose and then three phosphates
joined together.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And it makes interactions along
here that enable it to bind very

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
specifically.  Now,
by providing all this binding energy

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
for ATP and for glutamic acid what
the enzyme has done is positioned

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
the carboxyl group of glutamic acid
right next to the last

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
phosphate on the ATP.
This enables this to form a bond

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
here which liberates ADP and leaves
you now with the glutamic acid with

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
a phosphate on.
That reaction goes forward because

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
you broke the bond of ATP,
but this is still a pretty unhappy

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
molecule.  It's got a lot of oxygens
at very close proximity.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So the enzyme has another binding
pocket that's absolutely specific

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
for ammonia.  It won't fit water
which is very close,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which is a good thing because that
would just reverse the process.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Ammonia gets in there and then it
attacks here and liberates the

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
phosphate.  And that then gives you
glutamine and the inorganic

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
phosphate.  So the enzyme has
provided this binding surface that

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
makes the reactions go under
biological conditions.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But it's also managed in the same
process to have it go by a mechanism

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
in which it sort of temporarily
captured that energy that's in the

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
ATP bond and then used it to drive
the rest of the reaction.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I mean it's the magic of how all of
this developed.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It's really amazing but that's how
every single biochemical step in

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
your body takes place.
Virtually of them require an enzyme

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that in some way is highly tuned to
do just the one single reaction.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
As I said, the principle of how
these enzymes work is they lower the

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
activation energy.
And the way they do that in general

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is they provide a binding pocket
that resembles the transition state.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So as things approach here then it
fits best into the pocket and

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
therefore you get some energy back
and kind of lowered the energy hump

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that's necessary to go over.
And here's a reaction I'll be

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
showing you in today's lecture.
It's going to involve the transfer

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
of a phosphate to a glucose.
And the first thing that happens is

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
this enzyme interacts with ATP and
takes one of the phosphates and

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
attaches it to one of its aspartic
acid carboxyl groups.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So you've got actually a mixed in
hydride if you know chemistry.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But again it's captured that
phosphate.  This is a very unstable

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
bond.  And so if you break it you
will release energy.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And what the enzyme does is it
allows the hydroxyl of here to come

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and attack this phosphate,
and that then releases the aspartate

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
of the enzyme and you end up
affecting the transfer of the

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
phosphate that began life on ATP.
And now it ends up on the glucose.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
But, as you can see here, phosphate
interacts with four atoms.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But as this hydroxyl comes in it
has to attack the phosphate.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And somewhere in the middle there's
an intermediate where all of these

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
things are interacting.
And some crystallographers actually

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
managed to capture that in a crystal
structure.  And here you can see

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
this is the oxygen coming from the
sugar, this is the oxygen of the

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
aspartate and here is the phosphate
where it's now,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
as the attack is taking place the
thing is sort of pushed out,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and it's caught right at that
transition state.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And that's what the enzyme is
providing a binding pocket for and

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
thereby lowering the activation
energy.  It's a really beautiful

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
piece of structural work.
The second thing then I want to

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
clarify was this molecule ATP which
is, as I say, like energy money for

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
the cell.  When there's a reaction
where it can extract energy it tries

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to make ATP.  And when there's a
reaction that doesn't want to go it

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
will somehow figure out a way to
spend that energy and make the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
reaction go forward.
And the molecule, just to put it

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
again, because it's a pretty
important one in biology.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
That's adenine which you already saw
when we talked about nucleic acids.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And it's got three phosphates like
this.  You can see it's probably a

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
pretty unhappy molecule because it's
got all of these oxygens stuck

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
together.  And if you break this
bond then you release some energy.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So you could think of it in this
kind of way.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
That if we have ADP,
which is adenosine diphosphate plus

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000
inorganic phosphate,
and ATP is here.  And if you were to

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000
break the bond and make it back into
ADP and inorganic phosphate then you

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
would have gone energetically
downhill.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
But in order to make this you could
think of it as taking an inorganic

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
phosphate ion and this ADP,
if you start pushing them together

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the negative charges are going to
repel and you kind of go up an

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
energy hill.  But if you ever get
them close enough then they start to

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
share electrons and they fall into
this sort of energy well.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And this is what ATP is.
And so it's sort of like taking a

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
spring and pushing it together.
And then when you form the bond

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
it's like you put a little hook on
it.  And now you've got this spring

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that's compressed.
And it's stable, it won't do

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
anything, but there's energy stored
in there that you can use.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And it's the same principle in
terms of how the cell stores energy

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
within ATP.  And this
energy is stored --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
-- if you think of it in bundles of

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
about 12 kilocalories per mole.
That's about how much energy is

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
released under physiological
conditions when you hydrolyze that

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
bond.  So hydrolyzing ATP to give
ADP plus inorganic phosphate will

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
have a delta G of minus 12
kilocalories per mole under

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
physiological conditions.
Now something in terms of evolution,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
which I know a number of you said
you were interested in,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
here's a really interesting thing.
This is the main energy storage

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
molecule for the cell,
but you've heard about it before

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
because adenosine,
that's the nucleotide that we find

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
in RNA.  And, in fact,
ATP is also the precursor,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
as we'll learn, for making RNA.
And one of the things that puzzled

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
scientists for many years is how did
life ever get started

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
in the first place?
There seemed to be a chicken and an

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
egg issue that proteins did the work
and DNA stored the information and

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
RNA was kind of a messenger in
between, and we'll talk a lot about

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that in between.
So how could you ever get life

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
started?  So the current thinking is
that sometime,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
if you remember in that first
lecture, we had about 4.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
billion years ago the first
organism, something like today's

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
bacterium showed up here about maybe
3.8 billion years ago.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
That somewhere in between there was
what people are now thinking of as

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
an ìRNA worldî where RNA managed to
act as a ribosome and catalyzed

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
chemical reactions,
but it also had the capacity to

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
store information.
But it's sort of intriguing,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
although no one has proven that.
It's just a hypothesis.  We also

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
see that the major energy storage
molecule found in all living things

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
is also a building block of RNA.
It certainly sort of fits with that

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
kind of idea.
Now, there's one other kind of

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
reaction I'm going to have to tell
you about.  Penny will talk quite a

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
bit about this when you're thinking
about how organisms make living.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But this is a set of reactions
known as ìredox reactionsî.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So the loss of one or more

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.000
electron(s) is called an oxidation.
And the gain of one or more

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
electron(s) is called a reduction.
If you're going to take away an

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
electron somebody else has to get it.
So these things always happen

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
together.  And therefore they're
given the term redox reactions where

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
electron(s) from somebody goes to
somebody else.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So somebody gets oxidized and
somebody gets reduced in

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
the same reaction.
And you can think of them as a

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
transfer of hydrogen atoms,
not hydrogon ions.  And the most

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
familiar kind of sequence that you
will see over and over again in

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
biology is the sequence you go from,
let's say, a methyl group to an

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
alcohol with a hydroxyl to an
aldehyde or a ketone with the double

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000
bond oxygen to a carboxyl group.
You go one more step then it's CO2.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
So going in this direction it's an
oxidation.  If it's going in that

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000
direction the molecules are getting
reduced.  Just the same way that the

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
cell and life have molecules that
store energy in ATP,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000
they also have an important molecule
that stores electrons.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And that molecule is known as NAD or
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:37.000
NAD+.  And its structure is,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000
let's say a ribose, a five carbon
sugar.  And it's got this entity on

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:55.000
it.  This is in your book so don't
worry if you don't get

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000
the structure down.
There's a positive charge on the

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000
nitrogen here.
And it's joined through a

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000
diphosphate linkage to,
guess what?  Another molecule of

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
adenosine.  Here we find again a
piece of a thing we find in RNA is

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:35.000
now part of this system
for storing electrons.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And the way this works is if you
have two hydrogen atoms transferred

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:55.000
to here then this entity right here
goes to this plus a hydrogen ion.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And this we would know is NADH.
I left out an oxygen here.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Somebody picked it up.  [LAUGHTER]
Just too excited by the annual

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Valentine's Day visit here.
I wish the rest of you had a song

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
for you, too, but we didn't have
time to set that up.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
So there's an important thing here,
too, because actually a lot of

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
energy is stored in there.
This is a bundle of energy in this

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
molecule that's actually about 50
kilocalories per mole.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And especially when we get to next
week's lecture you'll see how cells

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
go about extracting the energy out
of that and making that energy into

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
ATP, which is sort of a universal
currency the cells can spend.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Now, somebody asked about
memorizing all of these structures

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I mean really,
As Julia says in her thing,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
we're trying to get you to focus on
the concepts here.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
You won't have to memorize the
structure of everything.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
It would be helpful if you
recognized that glutamine and

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
glutamate are of the 20 amino acids,
but we'll give you the structures

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
and we'll give you the structures of
something like NADH if you needed to

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
do something with it.
But the important thing is to

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
remember that energy is stored in
that high energy bond of ATP,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
that electrons are stored in this
NADH, and they can be used in

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
reactions that oxidize or reduce.
NAD and NADH can be used in

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
reactions that remove or give
electrons to biomolecules.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Now, the same thing goes for what
I'm about to tell you now because

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
one of the first things that had to
happen as life evolved was there had

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
to be some mechanism of getting
energy made.  And the reaction I'm

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
going to tell you about
is called glycolysis.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And it's a way of taking a molecule
of glucose through a whole series of

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:15.000
biochemical transformations and to
end up yielding --

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:26.000
-- two molecules of something that's

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
known as pyruvate.
And it also makes two molecules of

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
ATP and two molecules of NADH.
So it's a way that was invented in

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
evolution of making ATP by carrying
out a chemical transformation.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And this is basically the same
chemical transformation that we've

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
been talking about that Lavoisier
and Pasteur studied except that,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
as I'll show you, you do a little
bit to convert it either to lactate

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
or to ethanol.
I'll get to that in a few minutes.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Remember the point, also just to
remind you, the reason I gave you

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
that historical thing is because
what it turned out when people

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
started out to study something,
was winemaking of great interest to

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
French scientists,
was what they actually learned was

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
how cells made energy.
And, in fact, here we're looking at

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
a sort of biochemical fossil in a
way because this pathway of

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
glycolysis, which you'll
see is kind of awkward.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
It's got ten different biochemical
steps, it needs ten different

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
enzymes, and what the cells got out
of it is two molecules of ATP.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
But this system developed
apparently way,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
way back in evolution before life
forms got into these various

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Kingdoms because it's in virtually
in every living creature no matter

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
what it is and it's essentially
biochemically identical.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Now, it's possible we could go back
nowadays and devise a better method,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
but once that something like that
gets fixed in evolution,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
if something mutates to try and
change it most of the time it's a

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
disadvantage.  And so if something
gets locked in,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
and this is true of many,
many of these very complicated

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
biochemical pathways.
So you won't have to remember all

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
these structures I'm going to put on
the board, but try and stay with me

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
because I want to sort of show you
one of these.  This is probably the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
most ancient of these pathways.
And it's still in all of us.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
It's in the bacteria in our guts.
It's in the plants in the field.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
If you go out in the open ocean
organisms still can carry out

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
glycolysis.  So one thing,
though, I want to try and put it in

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
this way, if I came to you and said
I've got the greatest idea.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
This is going to be how we're going
to make energy and evolution as part

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
of this entrepreneurship,
I think you'd be right to be

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
skeptical so I'll probably sort of
tell you in that way.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
So I've already shown you how to
write glucose in a linear form,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
although I then told you that most
of the time in solution it's

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
cyclized into a pyranose ring,
a six membered ring.  But for the

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
moment we can think of glucose as a
stick.  And I'll get you to just

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
focus on the one position,
the two position and the six

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
position in that linear thing.
If you look back at your notes you

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
can see what the full structure of
glucose looks like.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000
But this is how the process of
glycolysis starts.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000
This is if your body is going to
take a molecule of glucose and make

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:55.000
energy out of it,
this is the first thing it does.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000
It takes an ATP.  It converts it to
an ADP.  It puts the phosphate down

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
here to give glucose-6- phosphate.
That's the only thing that changes.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Isn't this just like most young
entrepreneurs?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Give them some venture capital.
The first thing they do is spend it,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
buy a nice potted plant for the
company they're building.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
It doesn't seem to be, if you want
to make energy,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
starting out here spending energy is
the first thing that the cell is

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
doing.  It's using up an ADP,
although the overall goal is to make

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
ADP.
It then does a little shuffle,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
reverses the position of the double
bond and the hydroxyl.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
This is an energetically something
without much cost,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
but this sugar is different because
this is now fructose-6-phosphate.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
It's got a little bit different
arrangement of the double bond and

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
the hydroxyl, but energetically it's
pretty much the same thing.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Then the next thing that happens the
cells spends another molecule of ATP.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:25.000
It gives now --

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
-- fructose-1,
, this is the sixth position,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
the one position to two position,
1,6-diphosphate.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
It doesn't look like we're on our
way to make energy yet.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Cells invested two molecules of ATP
and what it's done is it's got this

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
glucose transformed to fructose 1,
-disphopshate.  Well, what happens

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
now then is the cell splits this
into two three carbon units.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
There were six carbons in glucose.
Yeah?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Well, it's a linear molecule.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
There's a phosphate here and a
separate phosphate down there.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
They should be.  Yeah.  I'm
probably dropping charges and

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
hydroxyls, OK?
But check your book if you notice

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
something like that.
So what we get --

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
What the cell gets out of this then
are two three carbon units,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:45.000
one of which is this --

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
-- known as dihydroxyacetone
phosphate.  And you can find these

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
names in your book.
You don't have to, as I say,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
remember the structures.
What I've done is basically taken

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
this molecule and I've flipped it
over so that the phosphate will be

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
down.  And you'll see why I've done
that in a second.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
And from the bottom half of the
molecule then we get --

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:37.000
This is glycereldahyde-3-phosphate.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
So this is three carbons.
This is three carbons.  This was

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
six carbons.  So the cell has split
it into these three carbon units

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
that are very similarly related
except where the double bond is.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
And there's an enzyme that actually
catalyzes the conversion of those

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
two.  It's a catalytically perfect
enzyme that goes.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
It's just limited by the rate of
diffusion.  And it can do something

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
of the order of ten to the eighth
molecules a second.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
It's a really, really efficient
catalyst.  So what happens then is

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
this, since these are in equilibrium
the cell is going to now

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:24.000
start to pull these --

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
This.  But these will be converted
into that and will be able to get

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
here.  So we're going to follow the
fait then of these --

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:46.000
-- two glycaraldahyde-3-phosphate

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:56.000
molecules.  Excuse me.
Sorry.  OK.  Now, at this point the

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.000
cell is at the aldehyde stage.
And it's going to carry out an

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
oxidation reaction.
So it's going to take a couple of

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
electrons away from here,
and it's going to therefore be

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
carrying out an oxidation.
If the molecule is getting oxidized

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
something else has to be reduced.
What's going to get reduced is NAD+.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
We'll need two molecules of that
because we've got two molecules of

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
glyceraldehydes phosphate.
So we end up with two molecules of

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
NADH plus a hydrogen ion.
And this is an energetically

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
favorable reaction.
So the cell is able to sneak a

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
phosphate in and make a molecule and
still have the reaction go forward,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
have a molecule that's not very
stable, but it can make it because

00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:00.000
the overall thing goes forward.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And there are two of these.
And what we have now is

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
1,3-phosphoglycerate.
What the cell has basically managed

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
to do is to get two phosphate groups
very, very close together.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
So you're probably getting,
hopefully, the concept that if you

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
stick a bunch of negative charges
together and hold them together that

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
molecules, if you break one of those
bonds are going to go energetically

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
downhill.
And you can do work.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
And the way it does that then is in
breaking this bond it uses it to

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
make two molecules of ATP.
So you've now got, this is up at

00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:02.000
the acid level or a carboxyl group.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
And we've got three
phosphoglycerates.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
So at least from the point of view
of this as a plan for making energy,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
we've now managed to get back those
two ATPs we invested.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
So up until now we've got our,
the venture capital money we put in

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
has be recovered,
and we've got a couple of molecules

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
of NADH out of it.
But what the cell now does is finish,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
to carry out some more steps that
let it make a couple more molecules

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
of ATP.  So the first step then is a
kind of just a switcheroo between

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
where this hydroxyl is and this
phosphate is.  So it brings the

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
phosphate up to here.
As you might guess this is

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:04.000
energetically not much of a change.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
However, what it does now is it
enables the cell to eliminate a

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
molecule of water from here so we
get two molecules of water come out

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
because we had all along here we're
carrying on two molecules from up

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
there because we have two of these
three carbon units.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Then the molecule that
we then get here --

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:44.000
-- is this molecule which is known

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:52.000
as phosphoenolpyruvate.
And several of you are saying you

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.000
don't remember much from chemistry.
So this is a keto group, which I

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
know you were introduced to.
But it's in an equilibrium with

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
what's termed an enol form where you
have an OH here,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
a double bond like that,
and that's known as an enol.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Now, this is energetically greatly
disfavored.  So normally most of the

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
time you find something in a keto
form, but occasionally you find it

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
in an enol form.
And what's happened here really is

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
the cell has trapped what would like
to be a keto at this position in an

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
enol form.  Again,
this is a very energetically

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
unstable molecule.
You've got all these oxygens

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
together, two of these,
and so the cell is once again able

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
to take ADP and make two molecules
of ATP.  And we end up with --

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:05.000
-- two molecules of pyruvate.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:13.000
And extraordinary amount of work.
What do we get out of it?  Well,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000
we've got a total of four ATPs now
plus two NADHs.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:29.000
What did we invest?
Two ATPs.  So the net yield from

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000
this reaction is two ATPs
plus two NADHs.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
So strange as it seems this was one
of the first sequences of

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
biochemical steps that were put
together in a pathway that we're

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
capable of letting an organism
generate molecules of ATP,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
or sort of form of energy money,
but metabolizing something it could

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
find like a molecule of sugar.
There are two enzymatic steps.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
That means that there has to be a
separate enzyme for every step in

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
the pathway.  Now,
the ATPs, as I said,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
have energy in bundles of about 12
kilocalories per mole.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
There's a lot of energy here in
NADH.  And in the next lecture I'm

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
going to talk to you about
respiration, which is something

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
you're aware of.
You know we respire,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
but chemically what that we'll see
means is basically it's a way of

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
extracting the energy that's in the
NADH by transferring electrons to

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
oxygen.  And that's a wonderful way
to make energy.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
It's far more efficient than this
ancient pathway,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
but at the time life started there
wasn't any oxygen in

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
the environment.
And, in fact, it didn't reach,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
as I said, I think it was something
like 20% of today's levels until we

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
were about a half a billion years or
so ago in evolution.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
So organisms had to learn to make
energy without oxygen being around.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
And this was the way that they did
it.  And it was such a success in

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
evolution that our bodies do,
the bacteria in our gut do it and

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
just virtually all living forms.
So it's sort of a biochemical fossil

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
but it was so successful it took
hold.  It's sort of like legs.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Those appeared in evolution.  And
there are all sorts of organisms now

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
that use legs,
and they've evolved into wings and

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
everything, but it's all the same
basic idea.  You could imagine a

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
life form that started with wheels.
And maybe if it had been the first

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
thing to do maybe there'd be some
sort of organisms with wheels,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
but legs were such a success at some
point that that's what got used and

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
then evolution made various
embellishments on it.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
But there is a problem here.
I don't know if anybody can see

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
what it is.  If I'm going to be able
to use ATP to make energy and I want

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
to keep generating more and more
molecules of ATP so I can build

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
stuff, I cannot give those electrons
in NADH to oxygen.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
So what would happen if I just kept
running this system?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Anybody see what the problem would
be?  Yeah.  You'd run out of NADH,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
exactly.  We need to somehow recycle
that NAD so it can take place.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
If we could give it to oxygen,
oxygen as I've told you in

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
respiratory, that would be cool.
But organisms didn't have that

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
option.  And so they worked out ways
of doing things with pyruvate.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
And this is where you'll see this
coming together with what we talked

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
about the other day.
So let's take those two molecules of

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
pyruvate.  And there are basically
two strategies,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
two major strategies you find in
nature.  One is to take the two

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
NADHs plus two hydrogen ions and
convert it to two molecules of NAD+

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
so that regenerates it.
And what do you get if you do that?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:31.000
You end up with molecule.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Two molecules of that which I
introduced you to the other day.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
That's lactic acid or lactate, the
organisms that make yogurt carry out.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
That's what they do.
That's why yogurt goes sour.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
What the organisms are doing when
they're making the yogurt that you

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
had for lunch,
I love those pictures.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
I found them on the Web and put
them in.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
What they're doing really is they're
getting rid of that NADH so that

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
they can do another cycle and make
more energy.  Now,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
I mentioned that this happens to us,
too.  And this happens in athletic

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
events where you exercise really,
really hard, you know, like sprints

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
or speed skating or something like
that.  Because what happens is

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
you're exercising so hard that you
use up the oxygen in your muscles

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
faster than your bloodstream
can bring you more.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
So what you're doing is you're
making your muscles go anaerobic.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
It's like you're going back way,
way in evolution when there's was no

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
oxygen around.
And your muscles have to keep

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
working, so what they do,
since there's no oxygen around,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
they stick it on pyruvate and you
get lactic acid in your muscles.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
So if you go out for the track team
in the spring and you haven't

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
exercised and you run a whole lot of
sprints and, God,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
your muscles are so sore,
they're all full of lactic acid.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
So you don't have to worry about it
accumulating in your muscles from

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
eating yogurt,
but it does show up in this kind of

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
way.  And the other thing then that
the way nature has found to recycle

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
these NADHs is to it this way,
to carry out a transformation where

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
you get two molecules of carbon
dioxide and two molecules

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:30.000
of acetaldehyde.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And this can be converted to the two
molecules of carbon dioxide and two

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:44.000
molecules of ethanol.
So this is the fermentation that we

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000
talked about.  And so when those
yeasts that we saw growing the other

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:58.000
day are busy metabolizing sugar into
ethanol and carbon dioxide,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000
the reason they're doing it is they
need to get energy to carry out all

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
the biosynthetic reactions that they
need to make more biomaterial.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
But what's happening to the whole
system is that you're generating

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
carbon dioxide and making stuff into
ethanol.  So it doesn't matter if

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
people are making wine or beer or
something they're going to distil to

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
make whiskey or brandy or something.
It's all the basic thing.  The

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
yeast take the sugars,
make it into carbon dioxide and to

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
ethanol.
But when you're making bread you're

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
only really interested in the carbon
dioxide because those little bubbles

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
then expand when you heat it up and
that's what makes bread rise.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And that was an open fermentation,
as you can guess, like in making

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
wine.  People like to have a closed
system so that,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
for example, a lactic acid bacteria
doesn't get in and turn your whole

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
set of grapes into something that
would be sour.  Sour wine.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
So that's where we'll stop today,
the most ancient of these

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
energy-producing things.
Again, you don't have to memorize

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
all this, but I think,
hopefully if you think about,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
you'll see some really, really
important concepts that are critical

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
to understanding how life works.
OK?  See you on Wednesday.  Happy

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Valentine's Day.

[RUSTLING] [CLICKING]

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.450
PROFESSOR: OK, good morning.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.740
So today, we're going to begin
our discussion of nitrogen

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.900
metabolism, which
is really going

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.490
to continue over the final
three lectures in the class.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.360
Now, nitrogen, of course,
is critical for life.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.850
You need nitrogen to make RNA
and DNA, as well as protein.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.620
And so what we will see
is that as we discuss

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:49.510
the metabolism of amino acids,
and nucleic acids, not so

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.860
much how they contribute
to protein and RNA and DNA

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.400
but rather how they
interface with other pathways

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.730
and metabolism to lead to
how these molecules are

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.890
synthesized, how
they're broken down--

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.090
and what you will see as we
go through these discussions

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.450
is that understanding the
metabolism of these molecules

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.130
really is all about how
organisms handle nitrogen.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.790
Now, of course, we've spent
much of the class talking

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.650
about how fat and sugar can
be oxidized as a way for cells

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.240
to get energy.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.160
And of course, that's
very important.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.970
A major role of fat and
sugar is energy transduction.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.550
But of course, cells are
mostly made out of protein.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.430
And so roughly 50% of a
cell by mass is protein.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.790
And protein, therefore, is
a key part of our diets,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.490
and really, any animal's diet
that eats other organisms.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.670
So anything that's
nonphotosynthetic

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.260
has to be taking
in a lot of protein

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.200
because it's eating
other organisms in one

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.980
way or another.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.880
Now, you will, of course,
know that nucleotides

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.320
are central for and the
heritability of life, and so

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.199
life couldn't exist, at
least in a heritable form,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.039
without those.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.990
And often, we equate
things like amino acids,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.860
and nucleic-acid metabolism,
nitrogen metabolism as all

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.900
about energy and weight-lifting,
so weightlifters--

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.680
all the supplements that are
sold to help people get huge--

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.050
all of those things
usually involve

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.260
heavy loads of nitrogen-- so
creatine-- we talked about

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.760
that earlier in the course.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.120
Leucine is a very common
weightlifting supplement.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.432
These are all
nitrogen-containing compounds,

00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:41.890
and it makes sense because if
we're going to build new mass

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.370
for cells, we certainly need
nitrogen to build the protein--

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.110
that's what half the cells are--

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.150
as well as the
nucleic acids that

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.640
enable cells to go on
and build new cells.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.520
And in fact, roughly 50%, as
I said, of the mass of a cell

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.880
is protein, and another
10% is nucleic acid.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.360
So really, a large chunk
of what our cells are

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.750
comes from these
nitrogen-containing compounds.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.120
However may be something you
don't think about as much

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.690
is that we also, because we
have to eat other organisms,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.940
consume a lot of
protein in our diet.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.720
And therefore, protein
and particularly,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.150
different amino
acids, also end up

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.730
being a very important nutrient.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.800
And in fact, our
muscles and our liver

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.830
are storage organs, if
you will, for amino acids.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.130
And so our muscles are always
getting bigger and smaller,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.220
breaking down,
rebuilding each other

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.630
as we go through life as
they really participate

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.550
in our body's metabolism.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.620
In fact, you have tons of energy
built up into your muscles.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.670
And if you starve
yourself, stop eating,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.240
you can live off of muscle
tissue for quite a lot of time.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.910
And that is really using
the amino-acid breakdown

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.670
from our muscle tissue,
really, there as a way

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.500
to keep glucose
in our blood high

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.580
and keep our brain
thinking right.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.190
That's why we talked last
time about the keto diet.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.727
When we talked
about the keto diet,

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:22.060
remember, if you're going to
do this properly and really

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.420
be ketogenic, you can't
eat glucose, of course,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.450
but you also can't
eat-- or carbohydrates.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.180
But you also can't eat
protein, and the reason

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.390
is because the liver will
turn your amino acids back

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.180
into glucose.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.400
And that's true whether
those amino acids come

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.110
from the diet or
those amino acids

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.800
can come from the
breakdown of muscle.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.120
All right.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.060
So if we use amino acids
as a source of energy

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.280
as a way to support
gluconeogenesis

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.580
to keep our carbohydrates
available for our brain,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.890
we need a way to metabolize
those amino acids.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.800
And if we metabolize
those amino acids,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.360
we also then need a way to deal
with all the excess nitrogen.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.340
And so, indeed, we already
introduced how this works.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.260
And if you remember
back when we talked

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:23.840
about the malate-aspartate
shuttle, which you'll

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.620
recall was a way for us
to transfer electrons

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.530
from the cytosol
into the mitochondria

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.840
and involved this convoluted
swaps between aspartate,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.350
and oxalacetate, and glutamate,
and alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.080
and at the time, we
introduced how amino acids are

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.810
related to alpha-keto acids.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:53.980
And so I draw out how
oxalacetate, an amino acid,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.590
is related to the
alpha-keto acid--

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.440
sorry-- how the amino
acid aspartame is related

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.310
to the alpha-keto
acid oxalacetate,

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.420
as well as how the
amino acid glutamate

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.310
is related to the amino
acid alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.030
Just to be very explicit remind
you what I meant for this,

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.740
and so here is the
amino acid alanine.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.370
This is the amino acid alanine.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.840
It is related to the
alpha-keto acid pyruvate.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.860
And again the same relationship,
if you look back in your notes

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.020
when we discussed the
malate-aspartate shuttle--

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.430
glutamate to
alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.320
aspartate to oxalacetate.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.400
Really, the keto group,
the alpha-keto group,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.340
is being replaced
with the amino group.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.730
And what should be clear to you
now is that if you can convert

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.520
an amino acid into
an alpha-keto acid--

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.850
that is dispose of the
nitrogen, get the ketone back--

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.430
it should be very
clear how you can then

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.360
oxidize pyruvate, oxidize
oxalacetate, oxidize

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.120
alpha-ketoglutarate-- as a
way to get energy directly,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.230
burn it in the TCA cycle,
get ATP, NADH that way,

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.070
or turn it into glucose
by gluconeogenesis.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.460
However, if we're
going to do this,

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.870
obviously, these nitrogenous
have to go somewhere.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.940
And if you're going
to build amino acids,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.860
those nitrogenous have
to come from somewhere.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.370
And that's really why
the pathways that we're

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.540
going to discuss really, are
about nitrogen metabolism

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.320
and how cells deal with
either the excess nitrogen

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.340
from breaking down amino
acids and nucleic acids

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.700
or how cells obtain
that nitrogen as a way

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.300
to build these molecules.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.880
Now, by way of introduction,
we have to discuss also,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.900
where is it then that nitrogen,
for biological systems,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.030
really comes from
in the first place?

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.260
Now this is almost never
an issue for animals,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.919
and that's because we and other
animals eat other organisms.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.830
And so we eat other
organisms-- usually,

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.400
we have a problem of dealing
with too much nitrogen.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.210
However, for photosynthetic
organisms, how to get nitrogen

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.620
ends up being a real problem.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.130
And so any of you who
have done any gardening

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.190
know that you need to add
fertilizer to your plants.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.330
What is fertilizer?

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.240
Well, it's primarily
a source of nitrogen,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.840
as well as phosphorus.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.080
And really, it's the nitrogen
in the fertilizer that's

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.660
helping solve the
problem of where

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.400
the photosynthetic
organisms are going

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.370
to get the nitrogen
that they need to grow.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:17.680
Now, of course, there's a lot
of nitrogen, nitrogen gas,

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.900
in our atmosphere, all right?

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.320
But nitrogen gas is
incredibly inert.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.870
You use nitrogen
gas is an inert gas

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:31.300
to basically stop things that
are too reactive from reacting

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.550
with the air in the lab, OK?

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.130
Nitrogen gas as a
very stable molecule

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.640
is not at all useful to biology.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.460
However, if we take this
nitrogen gas and we reduce it--

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.820
that is we add a
bunch of electrons--

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.400
what we end up with
now is we end up

00:09:51.400 --> 00:10:00.300
with all of these
reduced nitrogen groups,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:06.570
these amino groups that are
incredibly useful for biology.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.040
These come up over
and over again.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.010
These are the side chains
of our amino acids.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.140
They're found on
all the cofactors.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.300
They're forming
the hydrogen bonds

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.300
between our different
nucleosides, OK?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.330
And so enzymes work.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.470
Genetics happen.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.440
Hydrogen bonds
form because of all

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.280
of these nitrogen-containing
compounds.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.820
But you need a way to get
from this nitrogen gas

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.230
down to this reduced
nitrogen. And that is really,

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:49.280
so-called nitrogen
fixation, which is basically

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:55.170
taking nitrogen
gas and reducing it

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.460
to be a compound like
ammonia, which involves adding

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.560
electrons, that ends up
being one of the things,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.480
the magic of biology, that
really makes life possible.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.010
Now, you don't often think about
nitrogen fixation very much,

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.490
so obviously, we all
know that photosynthesis

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.490
is really central to
what makes life happen.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.990
And we spent a lot of time
talking about photosynthesis.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.580
Apart from
photosynthesis, which,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.410
of course, takes the
energy from the Sun

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.030
and gives us a way
to get reduced carbon

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.020
that all life depends on--

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.900
nitrogen fixation is a
way to take nitrogen gas

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.740
from the atmosphere and turn
it into ammonia, a useful form

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.140
of nitrogen for life to use.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.910
And what you may not realize
is nitrogen fixation really

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.230
only occurs in a select group
of prokaryotic organisms.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:04.690
So these are really the
unsung heroes of life,

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.110
or at least the unsung
heroes of metabolism.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.608
It's probably the most
central topic to life

00:12:10.608 --> 00:12:12.400
that we're not going
to spend a lot of time

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.940
talking about in 705 simply
because we don't have time.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.400
But it's basically redox
chemistry to take nitrogen gas,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.830
add electrons to it, and end
up with reduced nitrogen.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.700
This is very energy intensive--
requires on the order of 16 ATP

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.690
molecules.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.780
It's covered well
in various textbooks

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.640
if you're interested in
reading about this further.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.310
But I really want
you to appreciate

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.330
that this is something
that really has to happen,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.060
and it's really
relatively few organisms

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.870
that allow this to happen for
all other life on the planet

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.970
to be dependent on.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.090
This is really why
fertilizer ends up

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.610
being the thing that
you add to your garden.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.970
So in the wild, nature would
set up symbiotic relationships

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.480
with other organisms, with
these nitrogen-fixing organisms,

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.610
in order to get the
nitrogen they can get.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.430
However, we can help
that process along

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.760
by giving fertilizer.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.390
If there's a lot of fertilizer
runoff, you get algae blooms.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.180
That's really because
all this nitrogen now

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.380
gets dumped into the water.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.210
That ends up being
rate-limiting, often,

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.090
for photosynthetic organisms,
like algae, to grow.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.315
And so this ends up being
a really important topic

00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:30.190
if you're interested in
environmental science

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.380
or if you're interested
in agriculture.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.880
And it's at least
something I want

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:39.760
to make you aware of from
this introductory course.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.270
All right.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:49.360
Now, for most organisms, we
get, from either our diet

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.510
or from the environment,
fixed nitrogen.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.200
And the two forms
of fixed nitrogen

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.510
that we need to discuss
is ammonia, as well as

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:06.220
the conjugate base of
ammonia, which is ammonium.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.820
Now, fertilizer is, of
course, very rich in ammonia.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.230
And animals that eat other
organisms get lots of nitrogen

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.090
from breakdown of proteins.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.440
And that is a source of
ammonia or ammonium ions.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.150
And so photosynthetic
organisms have

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.470
the problem of getting these.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.620
Animals off and have the problem
of, how do we get rid of this?

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.150
Now, if you've ever
cleaned with ammonia,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.800
you know that it's pretty nasty.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.760
It smells bad.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.080
It's a cleaning agent.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.640
It's very toxic to
lots of organisms

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.290
at high enough levels.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.700
And so animals really need
strategies-- or, all life,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.850
really, cells need
strategies about how they're

00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:02.530
going to handle and deal with
these nitrogen-containing

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.610
compounds, either to incorporate
it or to get rid of it.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.280
Now, I'm going to spend a lot
of time today talking about how

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.310
animals who take in a lot of--

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.130
eat other organisms,
take in a lot of nitrogen

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.410
have to deal with
the nitrogen excess.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:22.600
And it turns out that you can
deal with the ammonia that's

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.320
generated from the breakdown
of your amino acids

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.000
in lots of different ways.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.750
And basically, there
is no one solution

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.080
that life uses that's
universal for how you deal

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.180
with the excess
nitrogen. Really,

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.430
different strategies
have been involved

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.670
incorporating the
metabolism of amino acids

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.880
and nucleic acids
that fit the lifestyle

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.190
of different creatures.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:57.960
And so fish and
other aquatic life

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.800
really deals with nitrogen
because they can just

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.840
excrete ammonia directly.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.000
They live in the ocean--

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.300
lots of excess space
into the ocean.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.950
Just take the ammonia.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.420
Send it off into the ocean.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.360
The large volume of
water in the ocean

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.460
means dealing with ammonia
is not such a big problem--

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.390
literally pissing into
the ocean to get rid

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.700
of their excess ammonia,
their nitrogen waste.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.545
Now, terrestrial animals--

00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:44.870
I'll just say
terrestrial creatures--

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.600
have a different
problem to deal with.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.470
And that is they can't tolerate
the high concentrations

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.080
of ammonia that would be
necessary to just release it

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.350
into the environment, so
they need another solution.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:02.690
And of course, our solution is
to excrete our excess nitrogen

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.440
as urea.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.240
So that's urea.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.490
This is why we make urine.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.829
And really, our solution to
eliminate excess nitrogen

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.740
is to concentrate that nitrogen,
rather than excreting it

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.570
as ammonia--

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.330
but to make urea, put
it into our urine,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:38.090
and eliminate it
through urination.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:42.350
Now, not all animals make urea.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.040
Things like reptiles
and birds, which--

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.560
turns out making urea requires
access to lots of water.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.380
Reptiles don't always have
access to lots of water.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.180
They live in dry climates.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.710
Birds don't want
to have to carry

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.340
around all the extra water
weight of dealing with urea.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.210
So instead of urea, it
turns out that they excrete

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.460
their nitrogen as uric acid.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.545
So what's uric acid?

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.815
So this here is uric acid.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.600
So uric acid is
basically a purine.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.230
So it should look very similar
to the adenine and guanine

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.730
rings that you saw
earlier in the class.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:50.650
And so they basically
generate uric acid,

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:56.230
which allows them to excrete
more nitrogen with less water.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:00.310
And so bird poop-- birds
don't urinate-- the bird poop

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.040
that you get, that
slurry of material,

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.580
is basically a mixture of
solid waste and uric acid.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.790
And that's how birds eliminate
their waste all in one

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.980
go as a way to save
some water as they deal

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.530
with their excess nitrogen.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.620
All right, the fact that
different terrestrial

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.490
creatures-- some, like us, make
urea-- some make uric acid--

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.250
really deals with,
shows that urea--

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.590
you will see today is from
amino-acid metabolism--

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.213
uric acid is, of
course, from purine,

00:19:35.213 --> 00:19:37.630
from purine metabolism-- we'll
talk about that in the last

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.160
lecture of the course--

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.580
they really illustrate
how the metabolism

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.040
of amino acids and
nucleic acids is really

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.920
about the metabolism of nitrogen
and how these pathways are

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.890
really set up in a way that
allows exchange of ammonia

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:11.310
with amino acids, as well
as with nucleic acids,

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.610
as the nitrogen can
really flow between all

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.150
of these different
biological molecules.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.860
And along the way,
well, this allows

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.950
a way to excrete nitrogen.
It also, obviously, involves

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.000
ways to incorporate it and
is really the pathway cells

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.930
use to both make and break
down these compounds.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.160
All right.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.970
Now, as humans,
we, of course, eat

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.580
a diet that's high in protein--

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.870
higher in protein.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.260
Now the current fad is to
eat high-protein diets.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.050
That's the latest
trend that's healthy.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.880
And this involves lots
of nitrogen excess,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.700
and so we have to,
as humans, urinate

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.320
several times a
day because we need

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.970
to excrete lots of nitrogen.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:07.610
Now, that's really our
amount of urea out.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.610
So that urea out,
really, in a healthy

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:21.920
person is balanced with the
nitrogen in from the diet?

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.510
Makes sense?

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:29.230
If we are not growing and we
eat a certain amount of protein,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:35.310
if we eat more
protein, that means

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:41.570
we need to excrete
more nitrogen.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:53.680
If we eat less protein, then we
need to excrete less nitrogen.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.530
And so the nitrogen in and
out should be balanced.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.250
Now the reality is that
not all of our nitrogen

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.010
is excreted as urea.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.330
Some of it ends up in the
stool as other compounds.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:13.860
And so for a healthy
person, nitrogen in

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:23.050
is greater than nitrogen
out in the urine, the urea.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.990
Nitrogen is really
greater than nitrogen out.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:31.265
And this is what is referred to
medically as positive nitrogen

00:22:31.265 --> 00:22:31.765
balance.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.340
So if I collect all of
your urine for 24 hours

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.640
and keep track of all the food
that you eat, and I measure

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.790
all the nitrogen in the unit
and all the nitrogen in the food

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.830
you eat, there's
going to be more taken

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.320
in than I measure
in the urine, that's

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.790
positive nitrogen balance.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:58.870
And that is what is standard,
healthy for most humans.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.620
Now, if there's positive
nitrogen balance,

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:12.050
it means you can also have
negative nitrogen balance,

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:16.760
which really means that
the amount of nitrogen

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.260
in is less than the
amount of nitrogen out.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.130
That is you are losing
more nitrogen in the urine

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.260
than you're taking in.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.040
Medically, this is
a very bad thing.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.220
When does this occur?

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.170
Well, it occurs during
periods of starvation.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.250
Make sense?

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.410
If you're not eating
any food, you still

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.110
need to get energy
from somewhere.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:45.200
You'll catabolize your glycogen,
you'll catabolize your fat,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.010
but you'll also catabolize the
amino acids in your muscle.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.790
Those amino acids will generate
excess nitrogen, more nitrogen

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.230
out than you've
taken in the diet.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:02.420
This also occurs
during some illnesses--

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:10.610
famously, cancer, AIDS, sepsis,
all of these really horrible

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.970
conditions that some people--

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.830
can be very life threatening.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:21.800
Many of these lead to a
phenomenon known as cachexia.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.750
So what's cachexia?

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.710
You waste away, lose all
of your lean body mass.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:33.080
This is also basically a state
of negative nitrogen balance.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:39.230
And why this is
really, a current topic

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.840
that lots of people are
trying to figure out.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.690
But it's really a case
where you are breaking down

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:49.370
more of your muscle protein,
more amino acids, and losing

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.580
that nitrogen than
you're taking in.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.950
And treatment of the
underlying condition

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.330
is really required for
this to get better.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.320
All right.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.470
Now, it turns out I
can experimentally

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.730
cause negative nitrogen
balance in an animal

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:13.820
if I remove certain amino
acids from your diet.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.910
Why is that?

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:28.460
Well, it's because
prokaryotes, plants, yeast,

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:35.510
lots of organisms, many
organisms, can make all 20

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:42.200
of the amino acids that are
required to build protein.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:50.110
But it turns out that
animals, including humans,

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:59.395
cannot make all 20 amino acids.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.010
It's a quirk of our physiology.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:11.610
But it turns out some of the
20 amino acids that are needed

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.800
to build protein are essential.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.688
That is they have to come
from external sources.

00:26:17.688 --> 00:26:19.230
So remember, there's
lots of vitamins

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.790
out there that we can't make.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.290
We have to get
those from our diet.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.670
There's essential lipids.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.730
We talked about that
last time again--

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.500
have to get those from our diet.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.250
And some of the amino acids
that we need to live also

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.410
have to come from
an external source.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:38.490
And in the 1950s, experiments
actually done on humans,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.770
on medical students,
actually found

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.760
that if you take these essential
amino acids out of the diet,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.840
what happens is that you can
shift those medical students

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.450
into a state of negative
nitrogen balance.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.050
And that's because they're
unable to synthesize protein.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.680
You're always synthesizing
and breaking down protein.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.680
If you don't have the essential
amino acids to resynthesize

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.200
your protein, you now
break down more protein

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.970
than you synthesize,
and you end up

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.200
with negative nitrogen balance.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.370
So what are these
essential amino acids?

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.170
Well, I post them
here on this picture.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.890
And so here's the
essential amino acid.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.900
They have to be
obtained from nutrition.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.450
Here's the non-essential
amino acid.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.600
These can be obtained
from the outside,

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.280
but we also have the pathways
in order to make them.

00:27:39.392 --> 00:27:40.850
If you count these
up, you will see

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.510
that there are nine
essential amino acids and 11

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.040
non-essential amino acids.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.110
It turns out that two of the
non-essential amino acids

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.448
require essential
amino acids to make,

00:27:53.448 --> 00:27:55.240
so they're sort of
conditionally essential.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.200
From a trivia
standpoint, I guess,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.440
the answer is that there's
nine essential amino acids,

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.395
and they are--

00:28:09.395 --> 00:28:11.840
I'll use the one-letter
abbreviation.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:21.250
So there's lysine, histidine,
isoleucine, leucine, valine,

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:29.380
threonine, tryptophan,
phenylalanine, and methionine.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.420
Now, there's two other ones.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.850
If you have enough
phenylalanine,

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.040
we can synthesize tyrosine.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.990
And if you have
enough methionine,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.450
we can synthesize cystine.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.050
But it turns out that
tyrosine and cystine

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.630
because they require
phenylalanine and methionine,

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.980
for all intents and
purposes, are also essential.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:29:04.680
So really, 11 of the 20 amino
acids come from our diet,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.280
either directly or
indirectly in the case

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.980
of tyrosine and cystine.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.070
Now, of course, our diets
involve lots of proteins.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.410
We eat other animals,
and so rarely is it

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.020
an issue that we need these,
which is probably how evolution

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.420
was able to lose the
ability to make them,

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:26.910
because we take in lots of
amino acids all the time anyway.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.470
And these are amino acids that
are primarily important only

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.850
for making proteins.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.840
But this also really
illustrates that proteins

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.440
are a large reservoir of
the nitrogen we take in,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:50.760
and we just take it in premade
already as these amino acids,

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.750
even though we can synthesize
the remaining nine.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.708
All right, now of the
remaining nine amino acids--

00:29:59.708 --> 00:30:01.750
these are the ones that
we can synthesize-- these

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:06.940
are really largely ones about
how we move nitrogen around

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.333
through biological systems.

00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:10.000
We'll see that as we
go through the rest

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.990
of the lectures on
the pathways involving

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.880
amino-acid metabolism.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.060
And where I want
to start with this

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.280
is how we're going to deal
with ammonia, which is really,

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:37.160
exchanged in and out of
the biological molecules,

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:44.330
mostly the two of the
remaining amino acids.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:48.620
And those two are
glutamate and glutamine.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.510
So I'll just remind you
because this is important--

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.550
E is the one-letter
abbreviation for glutamate.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:59.630
Q is the one letter
abbreviation for glutamine.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.330
And glutamate and
glutamine are really

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:07.790
central to exchanging ammonia
in and out of molecules.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.030
Just to remind you
what these look like--

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:33.330
so this is the alpha-keto acid,
alpha-ketoglutarate, ketone,

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.720
alpha to the carboxylic
acid, alpha-keto acid,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.120
alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:55.200
So remember, it differs from
the amino acid glutamate.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.860
So exchange that alpha-keto
group for the amino group.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.330
Now I have glutamate.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:10.110
And glutamine is, rather
than carboxylic acid

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:22.500
on the side chain, you add
this second nitrogen group.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.000
And so what you will see as
we go through the lectures,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.010
that glutamate is really--

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.320
the major glutamate,
alpha-ketoglutarate

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.620
is really the major
nitrogen donor and acceptor

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.280
to get nitrogen in and
out of other amino acids.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.860
In the last lecture,
you'll see that glutamine

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.450
is an important nitrogen donor.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:47.810
This nitrogen on the
side chain ends up

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:55.550
being important for getting
nitrogen into nucleic acids.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:33:01.040
Now, a really key enzyme
to getting these nitrogen

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.800
in and out is the one that
catalyzes this step right here.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:14.746
This is catalyzed by an enzyme
called glutamate dehydrogenase.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.170
And glutamate
dehydrogenase really

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.315
carries out the
following reaction.

00:33:35.142 --> 00:33:37.355
There's alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:50.380
So this can pick up
an ammonia molecule.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.610
OK.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.469
So with this intermediate.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:35:04.740
And now we have two electrons
here as a hydride ion,

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.040
which, of course, we're
donating two electrons.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.490
That's why it's a dehydrogenase.

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.890
It Involves
nicotinamide cofactor.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:20.850
So these can come from
either NADPH or NADH,

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:26.920
generating NAD+ or NADP+.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.490
And so reduce this molecule--

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:37.090
oxidized NADH, or
NADPH, NAD+, or NADP--

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:53.800
and you get the
amino acid glutamate.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.770
And so here's a
reaction catalyzed

00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:00.670
by glutamate dehydrogenase
that can convert

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.250
the alpha-keto acid,
alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:07.630
into the amino acid glutamate.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:16.270
This reaction, which
effectively is ammonia plus

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:27.970
alpha-ketoglutarate plus NADH
or NADPH can reversibility

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:38.750
generate glutamate plus
NAD+ or NADP+ plus water.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:53.770
So this reaction, again,
glutamate dehydrogenase--

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:06.000
very reversible reaction--
can use either NADH, or NADP,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.180
or NAD+, or NADP+.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.510
Either factor works,
and it's a key reaction

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.320
to convert the alpha-keto
acid, alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.540
with the amino acid glutamate
and get ammonia in and out

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.500
of the amino-acid pool.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:31.640
All right, so I
mentioned glutamine

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:36.170
is the other major
nitrogen carrier.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.720
And so how is this made?

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.380
Well, you can make it.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:46.480
So if you start with glutamate,
and you phosphorylate

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.630
that glutamate with ATP--

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:13.250
so that's now a phospho acid
on the side chain of glutamate.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.100
Lose the inorganic
phosphate, and now we

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.990
end up with glutamine--

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.130
glutamine.

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.400
All right, this is
carried out by an enzyme

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:47.450
called glutamine synthase.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:52.430
And it's basically another
way to pick up ammonia.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.170
This process can be reversed.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.950
So we can take glutamine.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.915
So I'm going to draw
out the whole molecule.

00:38:59.915 --> 00:39:03.390
I'll just draw here
the side chain.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.390
So this here would be the
side chain of glutamine.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:23.280
Can just use water to remove
the ammonia and regenerate

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:28.480
glutamate carried out by an
enzyme called glutaminase--

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:37.280
so glutamate to glutamine,
glutamine to glutamate--

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.610
glutamine synthase--

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.600
glutaminase.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.290
Notice, just like any
other reaction or pathway

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.410
we talked about, one
direction is favorable.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.120
The other direction is not.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.840
So this direction requires
energy input for it to work.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.960
ATP is used in
glutamine synthase.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.710
Glutaminase doesn't require
ATP because it's favorable--

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.170
makes sense with all the
other stuff we talked about.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:08.050
And so as animals, the way
our tissues deal with nitrogen

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.700
is that if we catabolize an
amino acid in our tissue,

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.680
we end up generating ammonia.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:19.930
That ammonia ends up
either in glutamate

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.690
via the glutamate
hydrogenation reaction,

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.200
or it involves in glutamine.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:32.920
And then we carry that nitrogen
as glutamate or glutamine

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.940
in our blood.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.270
It gets transported to
our liver and kidneys,

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:41.320
and our liver and kidney
handle that excess nitrogen by,

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.420
in our case, turning
it into urea.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.810
Other organisms might turn
it into something else

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.000
in specialized tissues,
where it can then

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.280
be excreted, all right?

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.180
And again, it also
ends up being that

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.580
glutamate-- if we're going
to make amino acids-- ends up

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.490
being a good source of nitrogen.
And glutamine, if we're going

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.010
to make nucleic
acids, end up being

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:07.570
a good source of nitrogen. And
so for catabolizing amino acids

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.900
for energy, we can
release ammonia

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.510
via the glutamate
dehydrogenase reaction moving

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.380
in this direction, or we
can incorporate ammonia

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.210
by running in the
opposite direction.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:25.090
And so what you will see
then is that the synthesis

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.790
and breakdown, now
focusing on amino acids,

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:31.630
is really going to
involve exchanging

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:36.220
the nitrogen between alpha-keto
acids and amino acids

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.460
and glutamine and
glutamate as we

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.690
described for the
malate-aspartate shuttle, OK?

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.560
So let's just show
an example of that.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.810
So this is what was involved in
the malate-aspartate shuttle.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:56.440
OK, so here's oxalacetate.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.900
So alpha ketone to the
acid-- so alpha-keto acid.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:16.080
This here is the
amino acid aspartate.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:22.220
Remember, in the
malate-aspartate shuttle,

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:27.980
we basically exchanged the
amino group and aspartate to be

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:32.690
glutamate and the alpha-keto
acid, oxalacetate,

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:35.540
for alpha-keto glutarate--

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.450
so alpha-keto acid, amino
acid, alpha-keto acid,

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.260
amino acid balanced
on both sides.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:47.780
And nature can basically use
this system to now get nitrogen

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.120
in and out of systems, OK?

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.630
So take an amino acid alanine.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:57.840
It's related to the
alpha-keto acid pyruvate.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.170
You can exchange
that amino group

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.900
onto alpha-keto glutarate, OK?

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:09.324
That will generate glutamate.

00:43:09.324 --> 00:43:16.690
You can use that glutamate.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:21.010
Transfer the amino
group on to oxalacetate.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.800
That can generate aspartate.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:28.240
And so really, here, you have
a system where you can use

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.980
transfer of these amino acids
between alpha-keto glutarate

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:37.390
and glutamate and
really, any alpha--

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:49.900
or sorry-- any amino acid
and any alpha-keto acid, OK?

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:55.870
And so if we're going to
catabolize an amino acid, say,

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:59.380
alanine, give the nitrogen
to alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.780
now it ends up on
glutamate-- that glutamate

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.990
can go off in the blood.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:07.040
It can be used elsewhere
to synthesize aspartate

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:12.100
from oxaloacetate or
some other amino acid

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.370
from some other alpha-keto acid.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.520
Or you can just
stay on glutamate,

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.320
go here to the
glutamate-dehydrogenase

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.170
reaction and generate ammonia.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.860
And so for catabolism
of amino acids,

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.430
the first step involves
transferring the nitrogen

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:35.830
to alpha-ketoglutarate, and that
generates glutamate, as well as

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:39.820
the alpha-keto acid, which
can then be metabolized.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.220
If we're going to
make an amino acid,

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.770
we can start with
the alpha-keto acid

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.980
and transfer the
nitrogen from glutamate.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.680
And that's a way, then,
to make the amino acid.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.910
And so glutamate dehydrogenase
lets you get ammonia in and out

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:59.620
of the system, and then
this basically transferring

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.870
of nitrogen between
alpha-keto acids

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.740
and amino acids
involving glutamate and

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:16.110
alpha-ketoglutarate now
allows you to move nitrogen

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.860
around the system.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.030
And so that's basically,
in a nutshell,

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:25.140
how you synthesize and
break down many amino acids,

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.020
although, of course,
there are some exceptions.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.400
And so glutamine
we just described.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:38.310
It's the glutamine synthase
and the glutaminase reaction.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:41.220
Obviously, that's how you
synthesize and break down

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.140
glutamine relative to glutamate.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:53.380
Asparagine is like glutamine.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.740
Remember, asparagine--
also, it's

00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:00.750
aspartate with an amino
group on the side chain,

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.890
just like glutamine.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:08.670
And so its metabolism
is similar to glutamine.

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:13.080
Arginine-- arginine is
a special amino acid

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.120
with three nitrogen molecules.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.720
We'll discuss that at
length in a little bit.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.110
Prolene-- if you look up
the structure of prolene,

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:26.670
what you'll find is that it's
glutamate that's been cyclized,

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:27.840
then reduced.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.690
And so prolene is also
a little bit different.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.150
You make glutamate,
cyclize it, and reduce it.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.800
That's how you get prolene.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.700
And then glycine, it turns
out, is generated from serine.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.310
And we'll discuss that at
length in the next lecture.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:43.800
But for the other--

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.980
most of the other amino
acids, reactions really

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.090
involve interconversion
between the alpha-keto acid

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:54.240
and the amino acid and
glutamine-glutamate

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.090
via series of reactions
referred to as transamination.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:06.660
OK and so
transamination is really

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.770
these reactions that allow
this swapping of nitrogen

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.380
between amino acids
and alpha-keto acids

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.710
and alpha-ketoglutarate
and glutamate.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:20.298
Some of these are very famous.

00:47:20.298 --> 00:47:22.740
Many of you want to
go to medical school.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.770
You're going to do
liver-function tests, where you

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.370
measure levels of ALT and AST.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:34.980
These are the liver-function
enzymes, or the transaminases,

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:35.850
all right?

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:38.640
They're basically
the transaminases

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.240
that catalyze the exchange
in the case of ALT

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:53.070
between alanine pyruvate and
glutamate alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:59.940
AST is the transaminase that
catalyzes the exchange between

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:06.980
aspartate oxalacetate and
glutamine alpha-ketoglutarate--

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.130
very active, highly
reversible enzymes,

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:12.200
very abundant in the liver.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.450
The liver is important
to get nitrogen

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.910
in and out of across
different amino acids--

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.730
high levels in the liver cells--
so when the liver is damaged,

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.840
they leak out, and they
measure in the blood,

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.890
and that's a sign
of liver damage.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:30.140
And so again, just to
drive this point home,

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.990
so you have alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:38.330
Alpha-ketoglutarate can
be converted to glutamate.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.340
This is the
glutamate-dehydrogenase

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:46.352
reaction, so it involves a
redox step with NADH or NADPH.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:49:01.190
That allows you to
interconvert the ammonia,

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:05.210
basically, take nitrogen in and
out of the system as ammonia.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:08.470
And then once it's
in the system,

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:12.250
now you can do
transamination to move

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.790
the nitrogen between
glutamate alpha-ketoglutarate

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:26.430
with any other alpha-keto acid
and amino acid, all right?

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:30.180
And so if you're going
to catalyze amino acids,

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.560
you go in that direction.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.370
And you're a fish--

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:44.550
you go this direction,
release it as ammonia.

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.800
Or you can come
in this direction,

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.800
and that is anabolism.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:55.780
That allows you to build
amino acids, all right?

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:56.280
OK.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.980
So these transamination
reactions then

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:03.250
become very important, and we
need to discuss how they work.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:07.110
So Transamination itself
requires a cofactor.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:15.330
This cofactor is called
pyridoxal phosphate, OK?

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:19.920
It's derived from a vitamin,
like many cofactors.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:25.230
In this case, it's
vitamin B6, also referred

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:31.750
to as pyridoxine, vitamin B6.

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.135
Vitamin B6 looks like this.

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:52.940
OK, so that's pyridoxine.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.800
That's vitamin B6.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.800
Turns out we eat vitamin B6.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:21.780
And the active form in
the cell is this molecule,

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:30.160
where this alcohol has been
oxidized to the aldehyde.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:42.620
And this Coke factor is referred
to as pyridoxal phosphate

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:50.400
and abbreviated PLP,
for Pyridoxal Phosphate.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.000
All right.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:21.440
All right, now let's go over
now pyridoxal phosphate allows

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.640
these transamination
reactions to occur.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:37.490
So let's start off here with
just some generic amino acid,

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:38.450
OK?

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:45.490
And so the transaminase has--

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.400
so here's pyridoxal phosphate.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.820
I'm not going to draw the whole
molecule-- just a skeleton

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.180
of the pyridoxal phosphate.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.280
So it reacts with
the amino acid.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.610
OK?

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:35.270
So that's that middle
part here of the molecule.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.160
OK?

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.405
Generate the shift base.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.920
Just draw the top part here.

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.380
OK, so here now we generate
the alpha-keto acid.

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:27.800
And this alternative version
of pyridoxal phosphate called

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:38.385
pyridoxamine, which is
also abbreviated PMP--

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:51.750
and so basically, I've
exchanged the amino acid,

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:57.960
transferring the nitrogen
onto PLP to make PMP

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:02.040
and generating the
alpha-keto acid.

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:19.810
That PMP can now react with
some other alpha-keto acid.

00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:36.400
So here's our PMP.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:40.960
And basically, if I just reverse
all of those exact same steps

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.890
that I just did--

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:21.840
so I'll do, for the
sake of brevity here,

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.640
I'll do two steps in one.

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:35.490
OK, so I broke this up here
into two different steps before,

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:40.200
but to save me some drawing,
I'm just going to do one here.

01:02:36.467 --> 01:02:41.020
And all I did is just
run the same mechanism

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.520
in the opposite direction.

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:49.180
And now I've taken
my alpha-keto acid,

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.700
got the nitrogen from PMP,
regenerated now a new amino

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.830
acid, as well as--

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.570
I'm not going to
draw it all out,

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:07.410
but regenerated
pyridoxal phosphate.

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:11.300
And so pyridoxal
phosphate ends up

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:15.080
being this really
useful cofactor that

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.440
enables this transamination
reaction that

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.910
is this interconversion
between an amino acid

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:30.330
and alpha-keto acid and another
amino acid or alpha-keto acid.

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:35.540
And so pyridoxal phosphate is
a co-factor that also useful

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.410
for other amino-acid-containing
reactions--

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:42.890
basically enables
this sort of chemistry

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:47.610
that enables nitrogen to--

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:51.200
this sort of chemistry
to facilitate reactions

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.640
with amino acids.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.640
We will see in the
next lecture that we

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.400
will use pyridoxal phosphate
in a slightly different way

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.120
to convert serine to glycine
plus a one-carbon unit

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.460
that we can use
for something else.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.790
I don't have time
to go into them

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:11.900
in this introductory course,
but pyridoxal phosphate

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.910
is also involved in other
amino-acid reactions.

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:17.910
So last time, we
discussed ethanolamine.

01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:20.000
And remember,
ethanolamine is an alcohol

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.450
that's found in phospholipids,
phosphatidylethanolamine.

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:26.720
Serine is used to
generate ethanolamine.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.000
And pyridoxal
phosphate basically,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.430
enables decarboxylation
of serine

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:33.950
to generate ethanolamine.

01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:36.750
Serine can also be turned
into pyruvate and ammonia.

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:39.830
It's an alternative way
to generate ammonia.

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:42.205
That also involves
pyridoxal phosphate.

01:04:42.205 --> 01:04:43.580
And if you're
interested, you can

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.580
look up these reactions
and their mechanisms

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.640
and see how pyridoxal
phosphate is repurposed

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.360
for those reactions, all right?

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.900
But for today's purposes, this
is what pyridoxal phosphate is.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.420
This is how it allows
transamination.

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.520
And so now it
should be very clear

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.220
how it is that fish
can eat a bunch

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.730
of protein-containing
food and excrete nitrogen

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.270
into the ocean, all right?

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:16.660
And that is they can take
whatever, some amino acid.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:21.130
They can do a
pyridoxal-phosphate-containing

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:26.920
transamination reaction and
generate the alpha-keto acid

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:32.110
with the nitrogen going
on to alpha-ketoglutarate

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:35.230
to generate glutamate.

01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:41.120
This alpha-keto acid
can now be oxidized.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.230
That's favorable.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:47.730
That can be used to generate
ATP and allow the fish to get

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:51.420
the energy it needs to swim.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:56.290
That glutamate can now
basically carry out

01:05:56.290 --> 01:06:01.360
the glutamate-dehydrogenase
reaction, generating ammonia,

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.770
regenerating alpha-ketoglutarate
to accept the next nitrogen

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:10.420
to allow oxidation of the carbon
backbone in the amino acid.

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:15.310
And the ammonia can
float off into the ocean

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:17.920
where it doesn't
hurt anybody and be

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:21.220
fertilizer for some algae.

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:21.790
All right?

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:26.380
And so there is a way to take
catabolism of amino acids,

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:31.090
get energy, and excrete
the nitrogen as ammonia,

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:42.390
basically involving
transamination,

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:50.100
which requires pyridoxal
phosphate and glutamate

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.270
dehydrogenase.

01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:58.560
All right.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.180
Now, it turns out
tadpoles do the same thing

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:04.860
because they live in water.

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:09.410
But when a tadpole becomes a
frog or if you're a mammal,

01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:13.550
you don't do this anymore
because now you don't have

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:15.980
infinite water to excrete into.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.400
And so instead, as I
said earlier, we're

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.350
going to generate urea
as a way to excrete

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:26.850
nitrogen. And of course,
I mentioned earlier--

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:29.570
I'm not going to draw it
again, but birds and reptiles--

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:33.890
because you'll see making
urea requires a lot of water--

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:36.980
you can save even
that water by making

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.260
uric acid appearing instead.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.670
Now, how you make
purines will be

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:42.180
discussed in the last lecture.

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.120
You'll see how you
make uric acid there.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:52.200
But for now, I want to discuss
how we generate urea as a way--

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.990
an alternative way to deal
with amino-acid metabolism

01:07:56.990 --> 01:08:00.620
and excrete nitrogen.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:07.700
Turns out that as we discuss
how you synthesize urea also

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.490
discusses how we're going
to make and break down

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:14.990
arginine, one of those
exception amino acids.

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:20.270
And you'll see why arginine
and urea are really

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:24.899
tied to metabolism
in the way they are.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:31.020
And so let me just remind
you what arginine looks like.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.250
OK?

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:12.580
So this here is the amino
acid arginine, all right?

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:16.390
I'm going to redraw
part of this side chain

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:17.590
here in a different color.

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:29.159
OK?

01:09:29.159 --> 01:09:31.660
And I did it that way
because I want to show you

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:36.850
how this is related to urea?

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:37.795
So if I take water--

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:32.110
taking off of that end
of the arginine molecule

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:36.960
generates urea, all right?

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:43.730
And so what we're
left with after we

01:10:43.730 --> 01:11:01.310
do that is this
other amino acid,

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:06.250
which is not found in protein
but is found in metabolism.

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:12.710
And it is an amino
acid called ornithine.

01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:20.030
And so basically, if you break
down arginine into ornithine,

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:22.340
you generate urea.

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:25.100
And so it should be
clear that if I can now

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.980
create a cycle where
I take ornithine,

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:31.550
pick up a couple of nitrogen
and regenerate arginine,

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:37.800
now I have a way to basically,
produce urea because then I

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.120
can cycle arginine to ornithine,
make urea, pick up two more

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.420
nitrogen, regenerate
arginine, and that's

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:49.080
a way to generate urea.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:56.340
Now, this series of
reactions occurs via cycle

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:59.880
called the urea cycle.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.430
And the urea cycle
was also described

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.900
by our old friend, Hans Krebs.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.640
So remember, Hans Krebs
described the TCA cycle.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.120
Turns out the urea cycle
was described by Hans Krebs

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.950
before the TCA cycle and
is really the first cycle

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.190
described.

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:21.390
And so part of the
inspiration for the TCA cycle

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.210
came because Hans Krebs
already had cycles on the brain

01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:27.120
from describing
their urea cycle.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.860
Now, it is a common
misconception

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.690
that all cells do
the urea cycle.

01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.610
That is absolutely not true.

01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:34.590
Lots of cells
carry out reactions

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:36.900
that involve the urea
cycle because it's also

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.390
involved in arginine
metabolism, all right?

01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:43.740
But the urea cycle, as
we're going to describe it,

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.820
is really, at least in us,
selective for our livers

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.810
and our kidneys because this is
really the series of reactions

01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:55.170
that we run to
net-generate urea, which

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.790
ends up in our urine.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:58.770
OK?

01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:01.680
And so remember, it would
be nitrogen transported

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.120
to the kidneys or the liver via
glutamate or glutamine and then

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.950
and end up ultimately,
entering this urea cycle

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.170
to generate urea.

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:15.630
Now, this involves
reactions that

01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:19.030
will occur in multiple
compartments in the cell.

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:21.330
And so most of it
happens on the cytosol,

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.630
but there's one reaction that
occurs in the mitochondria.

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:28.620
And so a general overview
is as follows, OK?

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:33.600
So I just showed you how you
can start from the amino acid

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:40.140
arginine and generate the
non-proteinogenic amino acid

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.730
ornithine, all right?

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:53.230
And this will involve
production of urea, all right?

01:13:53.230 --> 01:13:56.530
That reaction occurs
in the cytosol.

01:13:56.530 --> 01:14:04.930
But the next reaction, which
is ornithine picking up a CO2,

01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:10.300
as well as or anything picking
up an ammonia to generate

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:16.510
another non-proteinogenic
amino acid called citrulline--

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:19.720
this reaction occurs
in the mitochondria.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:31.730
And then that citrulline will
pick up another nitrogen--

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:33.950
show you how it does
this in a minute--

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:38.360
to make a molecule
called argininosuccinate.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.790
And then that
argininosuccinate will

01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:47.600
be turned back into arginine.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.360
And so a four-step cycle--

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.640
this reaction--
ornithine to citrulline

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.120
happening in the mitochondria
and then regenerating

01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.080
the arginine from citrulline
in two steps happening

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.960
in the cytosol and then the
arginine-backed ornithine

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.830
in the cytosol to generate urea.

01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:08.390
All right.

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:13.100
Now let's go through the
details of how this works.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:16.640
And we're going to start
here and the mitochondria

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.240
at this ornithine to
citrulline reaction.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.810
So it turns out the
first part of this

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:27.290
is generating a
molecule referred

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:30.170
to as carbamoyl phosphate.

01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:32.520
I'll write that out in a second.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:37.190
And so this comes
from CO2, which,

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:43.190
of course, is in equilibrium
and cells with bicarbonate, OK?

01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:49.720
So there's bicarbonate.

01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:58.600
Just like we saw when we did
carboxylation reactions, if I

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:07.060
phosphrylate the
bicarbonate with ATP,

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.720
this molecule here then
would react with biotin,

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.370
and that was a way I did
carboxylation reactions.

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:20.760
Well, it turns out
that rather than react

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.335
with the nitrogen on biotin,
I can also react with ammonia.

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:36.230
That generates this
carbamic-acid intermediate,

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:43.810
which can then be
phosphorylated with ATP, again,

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:59.920
to generate this molecule, which
is called carbamoyl phosphate.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.050
OK, so carbamoyl phosphate.

01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:05.620
It turns out this whole step--

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:09.220
two ATPs taking CO2 and
ammonia and generating

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:14.140
carbamoyl phosphate is carried
out by a single enzyme.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:17.620
This carbamoyl
phosphate will then

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.320
react with an
ornithine molecule.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.910
So here's ornithine.

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:54.240
OK.

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:37.020
And that will generate
this molecule,

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:46.570
which is the amino acid
citrulline, ornithine and

01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:50.680
citrulline being the two
major amino acids not found

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.010
in protein.

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:59.160
All right, now this citrulline,
then, in the cytosol

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.600
can undergo a reaction with ATP.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.300
And it's easier to
see if I rearrange

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:10.740
this part here of the
side chain of citrulline.

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.620
So I'm just here going
to draw the side chain.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:33.190
So it turns out this
will react with ATP.

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:41.510
So I'm just going to draw ATP
here in this stylized way.

01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:59.270
That's going to release
pyrophosphate, which can be,

01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:02.510
of course, pulled
forward by cleaving

01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:10.220
the pyrophosphate into two
inorganic-phosphate molecules.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:21:01.500
And so now you have
citrulline with an AMP on it.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:08.960
And that can react
with an aspartate,

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.850
the amino acid aspartate--

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.440
so this is the amino
acid aspartate--

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:38.467
losing the AMP to generate
this intermediate--

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:29.650
this intermediate, which is
called argininosuccinate.

01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:38.420
So argininosuccinate--
why is it called that?

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:42.350
Because this is a
succinate molecule here.

01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:46.880
And this part here is
an arginine molecule.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.030
And now what can happen next?

01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:54.920
Oh, by the way, this
reaction here from basically,

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.850
adding citrulline to
argininosuccinate-- it's

01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:02.070
carried out by one of my
favorite enzyme names.

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:06.800
It's called Argininosuccinate
Synthase, abbreviated ASS.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.160
So the enzyme is
the ASS enzyme--

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:15.220
A-S-S-- Argininosuccinate
Synthase--

01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:18.350
to turn citrulline
into argininosuccinate.

01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:21.400
Once you have
argininosuccinate, you

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:36.190
can now carry out that reaction,
which will generate two things.

01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:39.640
From the purple half
here, you will now

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:59.230
end up with this molecule, which
is fumarate from the TCA cycle,

01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:07.720
as well as I've regenerated one
of the most tedious amino acids

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.570
to draw, which is arginine.

01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:42.550
So here, we have our
amino acid arginine.

01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:43.570
OK?

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:48.020
And so that fumarate
now needs to be,

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:51.970
of course, turned
back into aspartate.

01:24:51.970 --> 01:24:53.200
You know how to do that.

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.660
I can take fumarate,
turn it into malate.

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:57.890
That's adding water.

01:24:57.890 --> 01:25:01.760
That's the TCA cycle Then
malate to oxalacetate--

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.190
that's NAD to NADH.

01:25:04.190 --> 01:25:08.660
And then aspartate can be
transaminated into aspartate.

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.400
And you can basically see how
I can run that you urea cycle

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.370
as a way to excrete
nitrogen one,

01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:23.240
from carbamoyl phosphate,
one from aspartate

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:26.480
to generate urea.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:32.300
And so this complete
cycle is actually

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:36.650
a few cycles put together,
sometimes referred to as Krebs

01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:39.920
bicycle, or Krebs tricycle.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:42.930
And I'll just draw it out here.

01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:50.630
So if you start with
argininosuccinate here

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:55.740
in the middle, that
argininosuccinate

01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:06.900
will generate fumarate
and arginine, OK?

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:22.280
Arginine into ornithine will
allow generation of urea.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:30.910
Ornithine can be
turned into citrulline,

01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:42.790
picking up a carbamoyl
phosphate, which, of course, is

01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:47.130
from CO2 plus ammonia.

01:26:47.130 --> 01:27:02.570
That citrulline and
aspartate come together

01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:04.710
to give you argininosuccinate.

01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:12.380
And then that fumarate
can run via the TCA cycle

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:17.240
to generate malate.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.210
So that's water.

01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:27.050
Malate can be used to
generate oxalacetate.

01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:28.555
So that is, of course--

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.670
OK.

01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:40.230
That oxalacetate can be
used to generate aspartate.

01:27:40.230 --> 01:27:43.860
That's a transamination
reaction.

01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:46.920
So that transamination
reaction [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:51.540
glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate
and then glutamate

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.310
to alpha-ketoglutarate.

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:28.190
Glutamate-dehydrogenase reaction
can bring the nitrogen in.

01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:32.030
And so this here
complete cycle--

01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:34.700
what you'll see is actually
balanced with respect

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:38.480
to both electrons because of
the glutamate-dehydrogenase

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.360
reaction and the
malate-oxalacetate direction,

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.730
as well as all the
nitrogen, really

01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:47.960
allows you to take
nitrogen as ammonia, put it

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.290
in the system as aspartate, use
that to combine with citrulline

01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:53.520
to make argininosuccinate.

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.240
Go to arginine, make urea
with the other nitrogens

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:03.000
coming from carbamoyl phosphate
to generate the citrulline.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.910
And so the ammonia
that's brought

01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:10.830
to the liver and the kidneys
via glutamate or glutamine

01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:14.340
can then be incorporated
into aspartame and carbamoyl

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:18.840
phosphate and ultimately,
excreted as ammonia.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.450
You can see that there's lots
of ATP that's required here.

01:29:22.450 --> 01:29:27.630
You need two ATP here to
generate carbamoyl phosphate.

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:33.150
And you need
another two ATP here

01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:37.110
at the argininosuccinate
synthase step

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:40.140
to generate argininosuccinate.

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:43.230
And you also need CO2,
but the net effect

01:29:43.230 --> 01:29:47.060
is that you generate urea.

01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:50.640
OK, I know that the urea
cycle is complicated.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.880
I will start out
next time running

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.100
through another
review of it just

01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:56.730
to make sure you have it clear.

01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:58.450
Thank you.

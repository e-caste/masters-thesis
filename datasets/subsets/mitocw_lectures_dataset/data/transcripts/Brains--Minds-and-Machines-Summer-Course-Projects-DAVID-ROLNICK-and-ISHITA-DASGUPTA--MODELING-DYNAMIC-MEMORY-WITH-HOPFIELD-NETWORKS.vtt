ISHITA DASGUPTA:
I'm Ishita Dasgupta,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.090
I'm going into my
third year of my PhD

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.615
at Harvard in Computational
Cognitive Science.

00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:18.990
DAVID ROLNICK:
I'm David Rolnick.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.600
I'm just getting into my
fourth year with my PhD at MIT.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.940
I am in the applied
math department.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.315
ISHITA DASGUPTA: So we're
working with Hopfield networks,

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:27.640
which is a kind of--

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.179
it's a concept in which tiny
neurons are kind of connected--

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:33.970
they're all connected
together, and the way

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.000
they update each
other, basically

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.212
determines the state
they're going to be in.

00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:40.170
It has been used in the
past to model memories.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.435
It's basically that there
are certain kinds of states

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:45.060
that the neurons prefer to be in
given the way that they're all

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.131
connected together.

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.880
And you can make them
go into these states

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.400
by initializing at
a different point.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.870
And so it's been used to
store memories before,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.120
but these are static memories.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.167
Like, once you're in
one of those memories,

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:57.000
you just stay there.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.250
So we were working
with this kind of model

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.770
to make some changes
to it and have

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.660
it be such that
you can go from one

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.266
such memory to
another such memory

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.140
and decide what probability
it is that you're

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.098
going to go to one memory
or to another memory,

00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:11.970
and so basically add
some stochastic dynamics

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.379
to a Hopfield network.

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.170
DAVID ROLNICK: Well,
the idea is that there

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.490
are many situations where
the living brain is going

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.390
to be faced with the task of
reconstructing or simulating

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.580
a stochastic
sequence of actions.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.210
So for instance, if
one were simulating

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.220
an event in which
one didn't know quite

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.550
what the probabilities were that
something was going to happen,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.130
then you can imagine
playing it out in your mind

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.055
and imagining one
way of realizing it

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:45.210
and each state in
your mental sequence

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.960
would be determined
by the previous state.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.860
So if something's falling, then
its state when it's falling

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.990
is determined by the
state when it was upright.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.160
And if we can understand
how we could use memory

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.780
to generate these sequences of
patterns that are determined

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.290
by stochastic
rules, then we would

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:11.820
be able to get a better sense of
what kind of imagination memory

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.150
connections there are
possible even in a very

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.650
simple model of the brain.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.470
And we're working with sort of
the simplest model of memory,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.560
but it still turns out to be
extremely powerful in being

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.830
able to create these patterns
of stochastic sequences Markov

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.522
chains.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:28.980
ISHITA DASGUPTA:
So far, we've just

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.200
been modeling it on using--

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.695
computationally modeling
what we think should happen.

00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:36.195
For us, there's a
bit of theory work

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:37.778
to figure out what
kind of connections

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:40.120
we should put in there
so that it should work,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.390
and then we actually
set up those connections

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.950
and see if it does work.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.180
And we're hoping at some point
to be able to tie it back

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.120
to actual real world
situations in which

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.280
this kind of stochastic
sequence of events

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.680
actually happens in the brain,
but that is currently on the--

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.825
like, in the future.

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:01.200
Right now, we're
just making sure

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.614
that we can model this kind
of behavior in a computer.

00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:06.030
DAVID ROLNICK: In
some sense, it's

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.910
an engineering task or a
theoretical task followed

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.370
by an engineering task.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.600
Understanding what can be
done in a system like this

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.520
and then simply building it.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.055
We built it and now we have to--

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:19.930
ISHITA DASGUPTA: Yes.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.930
DAVID ROLNICK: --see how
it works in practice.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.620
ISHITA DASGUPTA:
It becomes kind of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.030
like an experimental
science, we're just

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.071
changing parameters and
seeing how things change,

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:28.495
because these are not
entirely clear and predicable.

00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.370
You can't just say that
because you built it,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.967
you should know how it works.

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:33.550
There are too many
degrees of freedom,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.700
so there are a lot of
things to be tested

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.882
to see how well it
performs in different--

00:03:37.882 --> 00:03:39.090
under different environments.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.440

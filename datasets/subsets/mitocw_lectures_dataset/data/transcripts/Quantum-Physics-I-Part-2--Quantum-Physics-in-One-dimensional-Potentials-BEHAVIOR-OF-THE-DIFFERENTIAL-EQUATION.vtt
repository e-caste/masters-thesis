00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
PROFESSOR: Now,
what should happen?

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.660
Somehow, this
equation probably has

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.660
solutions for all
values of the energy,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.120
but those solutions diverge
and are not normalizeable.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.640
It's the kind of thing you will
find with a shooting method

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.920
that you're doing
with your computer.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.010
Count the solution and
it suddenly diverges up

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.620
or diverges down and
cannot be normalized.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.680
But for some specific
values, it can be normalized.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.480
So what we need is an intuition
why this differential equation

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.530
has normalizeable solutions,
only if the energies, curly E,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.820
take specific values.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.030
That's intuition that we need.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.110
For that, we'll look at the
equation a little closer,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.490
and try to understand what
happens at the place where

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.110
it can get in trouble, which
is large X. That's where you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.130
expect it to get in trouble.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.010
So what does this
equation become as u

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.120
goes to plus minus infinity?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.400
Well this equation, at that
stage, becomes like this.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.180
The second phi, the u squared is
roughly equal to u squared phi.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.390
Because e is a constant,
it doesn't blow up,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.910
so the differential
equation, the terms

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.080
that are supposed to be largest
in this right hand side,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.560
is the u squared.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.030
So how does this
look as a solution?

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.690
And you can see that
that's definitely not

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.250
like a power solution.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:06.330
If you have a power of u,
say phi equals u to the n,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.470
after u differentiates,
the power goes down.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.390
But here it goes up.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.190
You have a u to the end.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.080
The relative is supposed to
give you u to the n plus 2,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.550
but that doesn't work.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.410
So that's not a power solution.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.520
So it has to be different.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.840
So what it is,
you can try a phi.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.470
And what it should be is of
the form e to the u squared.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.190
It's kind of like that,
because this is the function

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.540
that when you're
differentiate, you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.770
bring down the derivative of
this quantity, which is a u.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.890
When you differentiate
again, you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.590
can bring another u
to get the u squared,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.090
or you can
differentiate this one.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.030
But if you differentiate the
thing that is in the bottom,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.310
you get something
that diverges less.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.390
So morally speaking, this
function is about right.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.300
So I'll put here, for example,
e to the alpha over 2.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.105
And I'll even put here a uk.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.115
Can this work?

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:28.640
A u to the k times
alpha u squared.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.500
Well if we take two derivatives,
if we take one derivative,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.390
if I differentiate the u to the
k, I get u to the k minus 1.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.980
I lose powers of u.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.490
If I differentiate
the exponential,

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:56.680
I can get alpha times u
times the same function.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.210
See, that's, roughly
speaking, what's happening.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.200
You differentiate the thing
that diverges the most.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.760
So if you differentiate
twice, each time

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.240
you differentiate you get
a factor of alpha times u

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.370
squared phi, roughly.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.750
This is plus subleading.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.450
When you differentiate
a function

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.670
and you're wanting to show
the most divergent thing, then

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.470
you--

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.840
because we're looking at
the most divergent part,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.810
you will always differentiate
this, and this u to the k

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.780
is really a spectator,
it doesn't do anything,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.720
because when you differentiate
that, you get something much

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.400
smaller, that doesn't matter.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.210
So yes, with these exponentials,
we get something like this.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.220
Beside double pronged
should have been here.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.000
And therefore, you see
that alpha is plus minus 1.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.420
Alpha is plus minus
1, and those are

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.190
likely to be
approximate solutions

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.170
as x goes to infinity.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.220
So we could expect solutions
for alpha equals 1,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.770
and I will write that it,
and all this, I should say

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.700
is always as u goes to infinity.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.110
So always as u go to infinity,
all of this in this blackboard.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.950
So also as u go to infinity,
we would expect maybe solutions

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.580
of the form A u to
the k, e to the minus

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:55.180
u squared over 2 plus B u to
the k e to the u squared over 2.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.070
The two values of alpha
equal plus minus 1

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.010
are the possibilities for
these two equations to match.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.280
So you would expect things
like this to be solutions.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.270
And here you are seeing the
beginning of the danger.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.510
Well a minus u
squared over 2 times

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:23.220
a power sounds pretty good,
but a u squared over 2 times

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.870
a power sounds pretty bad.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.910
So maybe this is what
we want to happen.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.940
This is not an exact
solution of anything yet.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.220
We're just looking at u going
to plus and minus infinity,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.200
and maybe we'll have such a
behavior or such behavior.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.840
But we want this one,
otherwise we will never

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.330
be able to normalize it.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.610
So here it is.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.960
Without any loss of generality
and inspired by this,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.400
this analysis is absolutely
crucial, you see,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.470
we're following a very
logical procedure.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.650
Cleaning the
equation then looking

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.630
where the divergence
would happen

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.200
and learning something about
the form of the solution.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.230
Now without any loss of
generality, I can write,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:26.380
I will write 5x
is going to be a--

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.470
not of x anymore.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:35.984
U, h of u times e to the
minus u squared over 2.

00:07:35.984 --> 00:07:40.140
So it's an an sat, but it's
without any loss of generality,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.320
because you can always write
any function as another function

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.690
times e to the minus u over 2,
because you take the function,

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.720
you multiply by e
to the plus u over 2

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.680
and e to the minus u over 2
and it's written like that.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.850
But this should be nice,
because it has sort

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.270
of the right behavior already.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.550
And here is the hope.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.290
The hope is that this function
now is a proxy for phi.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.810
If you know h, you know
phi, which is what you want.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.490
And this function,
hopefully, won't diverge.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.070
This will be into [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.110
So if this function
doesn't diverge,

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.270
it will be a great thing.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:33.672
In particular, we could hope
that h of u is a polynomial.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.460
You see, if somebody
with have come and said,

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.750
look at that equation.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.880
Could that be a polynomial?

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.380
A polynomial is something
that ends up to some power

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.660
x to the 20 or x to the 30,
but it doesn't go up forever.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.780
An exponential has all powers.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.660
This equation doesn't have
a polynomial solution.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.210
No polynomial will
ever solve this.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.840
But now that you've
isolated the divergence,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.660
there is a hope that a
polynomial will work.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.660
So for doing that,
exploring that hope,

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.480
I now have to substitute--

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.340
this is no assumption--

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.460
the differential
equation for phi

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.730
implies a differential
equation for h,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.920
you just substitute
this and look at it.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.340
That's a one line computation
or two line computation.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.200
I'll give the answer.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.900
So what is the differential
equation for h?

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:45.080
So back in star, you'll
get the second h,

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:56.000
the u squared minus 2u dh du
plus e minus 1h equals zero.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.740
So you substitute that
into this equation

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.140
and you get this
differential equation.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.620
And now this is a
differential equation for h.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.640
We hope it has a
polynomial solution.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.570
You will see that it wants to
have a polynomial solution,

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.620
but it doesn't quite make it.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.700
And then you will discover
quantization helps,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.030
and suddenly you get the other
normal solution and everything

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.580
works out.

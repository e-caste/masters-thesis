00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.570
PROFESSOR: So what I want to
do today is I want to talk

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.930
about what the heck
this course is.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.560
What is microeconomics?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.080
What are you going to be
learning in this course?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.150
And just, sort of, set us
up for the semester.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.720
OK.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.400
So basically, microeconomics
is all about scarcity.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.470
It's all about how individuals
and firms make decisions given

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.410
that we live in a world
of scarcity.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.540
Scarcity is key because
basically what we're going to

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.860
learn about this semester in
various shapes and forms is a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.480
lot of different types of
constrained optimization.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
We're going to learn a lot
about different ways that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.890
individuals make choices
in a world of scarcity.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.060
OK?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.550
That is, this course is going
to be about trade-offs.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.240
Given scarce resources, how
the individuals and firms

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.760
trade off different alternatives
to make

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.150
themselves as well-off
as possible.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.790
That's why economics is called
the dismal science.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.250
OK?

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.740
It's called the dismal science
because we are not about

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.910
everyone have everything.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.710
We're always the people who
say, no, you can't have

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.090
everything.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.750
You have to make a trade-off.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.190
OK?

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.040
You have to give
up x to get y.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.810
And that's why people
don't like us.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.380
OK?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.050
Because that's why we're called
the dismal science,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.250
because we're always
pointing out the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.870
trade-offs that people face.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.640
Now, some may call it dismal,
but I call it fun.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.640
And that may be because of my
MIT training, as I said I was

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.360
an undergraduate here.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.190
In fact, MIT is the perfect
place to teach microeconomics

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.500
because this whole institute is
about engineering solutions

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.850
which are really ultimately
about constrained

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.060
optimization.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.790
Indeed, what's the best
example in the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.600
world we have of this?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.360
It's the 270 contest. Right?

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.090
You're given a pile of junk,
you've got to build something

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.480
that does something else.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.780
That's an exercise in
constrained optimization.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.070
All engineering is really
constrained optimization.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.800
How do you take the resources
you're given and do the best

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.280
job building something.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.650
And that's really what
microeconomics is.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.900
Just like 270 is not a dismal
contest, microeconomics is not

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.720
to me a dismal science.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.490
You could think of this
course like 270.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.775
But instead of the building
robots, we're

00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:29.180
running people's lives.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.720
OK?

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.650
That's, kind of, the
way I like to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.230
think about this course.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.840
Instead of trying to decide how
we can build something to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.140
move a ping pong ball across a
table, we're trying to decide

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.510
how people make their decisions
to consume, and

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.270
firms make their decisions
to produce.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.660
That's basically what's going
to go on in this class.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.140
OK?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.960
And that's why basically modern
microeconomics was

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.360
founded at MIT in the 1950s
by Paul Samuelson.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.890
The father of modern economics
was a professor here, and he

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.080
basically founded the field.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.240
He basically introduced
mathematics to economics.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.690
And through teaching this
course, 14.01, 50, 60 years

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.210
ago, actually developed the
field that we now study.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.990
Now, what we're going to do in
this class, is focused on two

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.450
types of actors in the economy:

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.330
consumers and producers.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.730
OK?

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.300
And we are going to build models
of how consumers and

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.500
producers behave. Now,
technically, a model is going

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.230
to be a description of any
relationship between two or

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.180
more economic variables.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.950
OK?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.460
That's a model.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.090
A description of any
relationship between two or

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.120
more economic variables.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.430
The trick with economics, and
the reason many of you will be

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.870
frustrated during the semester,
is that unlike the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.970
modern relationship between
say energy and mass these

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.600
models are never precise.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.490
They are never accurate
to the 10th decimal.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.630
OK?

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.950
This is not a precise,
scientific

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.190
relationship with modeling.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.390
We'll be making a number of
simplifying assumptions that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.650
allow us to capture the main
tendencies in the data.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.850
That allow us to capture the
main insights into how

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.000
individuals make consumption
decisions and how firms make

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.240
production decisions.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.390
But it's not going to be as
clean and precise as the kind

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.890
of proofs you're going to be
doing in some of your other

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.450
classes in freshman and
sophomore year.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.130
OK?

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.180
So basically, we have a trade
off with the simplifying

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.480
assumptions.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.720
On the one hand, obviously we
want a model that can explain

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.600
reality as much as possible.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.280
If a model can't explain
reality, it's not useful.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.250
On the other hand, we need a
model that's tractable, a

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.810
model that I can teach you
in a lecture or less.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.100
OK?

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.200
And basically, what we do is we
make a lot of simplifying

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.730
assumptions in this class to
make those models work.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.580
And yet, what we'll find is
despite these assumptions,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.270
we'll come up with incredibly
powerful predictions of how

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.940
consumers and producers
behave.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.260
So with consumers what we're
going to do is, we're going to

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.010
say that consumers are
constrained by their limited

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.030
wealth or what we'll call
their budget constraint.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.930
And subject to that constraint
they choose the set of goods

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.250
that makes them as well
off as possible.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.760
OK?

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.970
That's what we're going to call
utility maximization.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.000
We'll say the consumers maximize
their utility,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.600
consumers are going to maximize
utility subject to a

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.800
budget constraint.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.680
That's going to be what
we're going to develop

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.460
the consumer decision.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.583
They have some utility function
which is going to be

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:33.600
a model of their preferences.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600
OK?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.790
So I'm going to propose to take
everything you love in

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.220
life and write it down
as a u function.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.920
OK?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.716
Then I'm going to propose you
take all the resources at your

00:05:42.716 --> 00:05:44.900
disposal, write them down as a
budget constraint and then I

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.760
just do constrained maximization
to solve for how

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.580
you make decisions.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.310
Firms, on the other hand, are
going to maximize profits.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.100
Pi is profits.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.200
Firms are going to
maximize profits.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.360
Their goal is to make as much
profit as possible, to earn as

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.030
much money as possible.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.880
OK?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.960
However, that's going to be
subject to both the demands of

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.620
consumers, we get to firms it's
a lot harder, subject to

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:22.850
both consumer demand
and input costs.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.740
So firms have to consider,
consumers have to consider

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.310
look what does stuff cost
and what do I like,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.290
I'll make my decision.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.900
Firms is a little more
complicated.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.200
They've go to consider, what do
consumers want and how do I

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.640
make what they want?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.895
So they've got to consider both
the output side, what a

00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:39.050
consumer is going to want me to
make and what's it going to

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.880
cost me to produce that good?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.880
And how do I combine those
to make the most profits?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.700
OK?

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.650
So from these assumptions, we
will be able to answer the

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.790
three fundamental questions
of microeconomics.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.380
OK?

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.650
The three fundamental questions
of microeconomics

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:04.485
will be, what goods and services
should be produced?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.440
What goods and services
should be produced?

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.760
How to produce those
goods and services?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.250
And who gets the goods
and services?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.400
What goods and services
get produced?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.090
How to produce those
goods and services?

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.290
And who gets them?

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.150
And what's amazing, we'll learn
in this course, is that

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.980
all three of these questions,
the three fundamental

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.990
questions that drive our entire
economy, are all solved

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.460
through the role of
one key state

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.825
variable, which is prices.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.820
Prices in the economy resolve
all of these problems. OK?

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.810
Consumers and firms will
interact in a market, they'll

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.800
interact in a marketplace.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.330
And out of that marketplace will
emerge a set of prices,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.020
in a way we'll describe.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.460
And those prices will allow
firms and consumers to make

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.063
the relevant decisions.

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:16.870
OK?

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.080
So let me just give you one, and
we're going to do all this

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.900
rigorously throughout the
semester, let me just start

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.050
with one casual example.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.650
OK?

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.600
Let's think about the
development of the iPod.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.070
OK?

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.830
Let's cast our minds way back,
lo way back to the development

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.760
of the iPod.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.380
OK?

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.350
Now, when Apple was thinking
about making the iPod, they

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.750
had to ask, would consumers
want this?

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.430
So consumers had to decide given
their limited resources,

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.040
given the fact that they were
buying a certain set of things

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.560
would they be willing to forsake
some things they were

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.600
already doing to spend the
money on the iPod?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:52.890
OK?

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.110
It was a non-trivial
amount of money.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.413
Would they be willing to
forsake things they are

00:08:55.413 --> 00:08:56.530
already doing?

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.340
OK?

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.760
To spend money on the iPod.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.500
And clearly they were.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.960
Clearly, consumers were willing
to spend money, to

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.470
spend a lot of money,
to get an iPod.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.590
They were originally
what? $300 Back

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.040
when $300 meant something.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.650
OK.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:16.760
So basically, what the firm will
do is they'll say, OK, we

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.800
get a signal from the consumer
that they're willing to pay

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.620
money to get the iPod.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.910
They're willing to pay a high
price to get the iPod.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.850
Now, the firm will say, well,
should we make iPods?

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.000
Well, that will depend on what
it cost to make them.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.100
So we have to then assess what
are the inputs that we'll need

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.310
to make an iPod?

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.070
Well, to do that we have to
look at the prices of the

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.550
various inputs that we'll need,
of the chip in them and

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.130
the metal and all the other
stuff that goes into the iPod.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.020
OK?

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.610
So they can shop across
different countries, to

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.170
different kinds of chips, they
can look at different kinds of

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.560
monitors, et cetera.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.820
But, once again, what they'll
do is they'll use the prices

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.290
of those different inputs
to decide how

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.430
to produce the iPod.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.630
So whether to produce the iPod
will depend on the price

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.030
people are willing
to pay for it.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.850
How to make the iPod will depend
on the prices that

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.870
firms have to pay for the chip
and the casing and all the

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.420
other things that go
into the iPod.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.280
OK?

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.400
And then finally, who's
going to get the iPod?

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.500
Well, they're going to make
a certain amount.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.510
What decided who gets them?

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.170
Well, the person who gets them
are the people who are willing

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.610
to pay the price that Apple
decides to charge.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.140
Some people are willing to pay
that price, they're going to

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.940
get an iPod.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.400
Some people are not willing to
pay that price, they will not

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.910
get an iPod.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.460
So the price in the market will
ultimately decide who

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.030
gets the iPod, as well.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.710
OK?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.710
So basically, prices will
determine what gets produced,

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.880
how it's produced,
and who gets the

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.000
goods that are produced.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.280
OK?

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.850
Of course, this is a very, very
simplified example, as

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.900
you can already tell.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.610
There are lots of cases
where prices don't

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.070
decide these things.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.590
So my favorite example is the
fact that there are lines for

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.190
hours to get tickets to see
a Lady Gaga concert.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.030
OK?

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.040
Now if it's really true that
prices determine everything,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.740
we shouldn't see any lines.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.650
It should just be that those
who are willing to pay the

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.730
most to see Lady Gaga should.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.220
Those who want the most
to get Lady Gaga

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.120
should get the tickets.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.990
Those who aren't willing to pay
shouldn't get the tickets.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.420
Why should there be a line?

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.000
Not to mention the fact that
people shouldn't be willing to

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.660
pay anything, but that's
a different issue.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.510
That's a taste issue.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.770
We'll come to taste later.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:35.610
OK?

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.010
So basically, clearly this
is not working perfectly.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.060
If the world worked in the way
I just described, then what

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.870
should happen is there should be
essentially an auction and

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.140
whoever is willing to pay the
most for Lady Gaga tickets

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.270
would get them.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.500
And whoever is not willing
to pay wouldn't.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.560
It wouldn't involve
any waiting in

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.850
line or other things.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.440
Now, what's very interesting
is we've actually seen an

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.910
evolution from my youth to
your youth towards the

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.840
economic model.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.660
When I was a kid, if you wanted,
so then it was Cars

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.710
tickets, OK, to date myself, OK,
you had to go and camp out

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:13.050
at 3:00 in the morning outside
the store where they're

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.700
selling them to get
the tickets.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.440
Now, of course, you don't
do that anymore.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.800
Now you go on Stub Hub or
Ticketmaster or these other

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.870
secondary sellers and there
there are prices that

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.380
determine it.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.060
So how many people have
waited on line to

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.750
get a concert ticket?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.390
That's amazing.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.620
So if I asked this question 30
years ago, 90% of the hands

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.500
would have gone up.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.100
OK?

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.750
So what that means is the
price mechanism has

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.000
started to be used.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.240
It has replaced the line
mechanism as a way to allocate

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.700
those tickets.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.070
And we see prices working.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.760
That wasn't true.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.120
There wasn't StubHub.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.470
There weren't these secondary
ticket sellers 30 years ago.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.640
You had to wait on line
to get the tickets.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.590
Now, so that's basically, sort
of, an overview about, sort of

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.300
an example, of how we think
about the role of prices.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.420
Now, let me draw a couple of
important distinctions, terms

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.970
I'm going to use this semester
that I want you to be

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.270
comfortable with.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.000
OK?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.580
The first distinction I want to
draw is between theoretical

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.345
versus empirical economics.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.680
Theoretical versus empirical
economics.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.460
OK.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:34.940
Theoretical economics is the
process of building models to

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.190
explain the world.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:40.860
OK?

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.260
Empirical economics is the
process of testing those

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:49.480
models to see how good
a job they do in

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.380
explaining the world.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.200
OK?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.630
We could all make up a model.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:54.950
OK?

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.890
Anybody with math skills
could make up a model.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.040
But it doesn't do any good
unless it's actually doing

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.600
something to explain
the world.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.490
And so basically, the goal of
theoretical economics is

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:12.560
essentially to build a model
that has some testable

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.090
predictions.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.490
To build a model that says,
look here's my simplified

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:22.050
model of how consumers decide
whether or not to buy an iPod.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:22.570
OK?

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.830
I have a model of that, that
I've built theoretically.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.410
Well, that has some testable
predictions.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.320
And the role of empirical
economics is to gather the

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.490
data and go and test them using
statistical methods.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.700
Specifically, typically
regression analysis like the

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.820
kind you learn about in
advanced statistics.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.980
OK?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.775
So basically, what we're going
to do is we're going to is 95%

00:14:44.775 --> 00:14:46.440
of this course will be
about theoretical

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.940
economics this semester.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.210
It will be about understanding
how economists develop the

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.680
models to model how consumers
and firms behave. But I will

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.610
try to talk somewhat about
empirical economics and what

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.730
data we can bring to bear to
understand whether or not

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.080
these models explain
the world.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.230
OK?

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:10.540
The other distinction that's
very important is positive

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:17.570
versus normative economics.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.020
Positive versus normative
economics.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.950
And this is the distinction
between the way things are,

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.370
which is positive economics, and
the way things should be

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.920
which is normative economics.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.600
Distinction between the way
things are and the way

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.160
things should be.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.060
OK?

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.660
So let's consider a great
example of microeconomics at

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.880
work which is auctions
on eBay.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.210
OK?

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.000
Auctions on eBay, economists
love studying auctions on eBay

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.390
because it's a textbook example
of what we call a

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.100
perfectly competitive market
which is what we'll focus on

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.670
the semester.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.060
A perfectly competitive
market.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:15:59.930
OK?

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:07.040
And by that we mean that
basically that producers in

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.620
this market offer up
their good to a

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.390
wide range of consumers.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.500
OK?

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.610
A number of producers offer
up their goods to a

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.840
wide range of consumers.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.530
OK?

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.150
And the consumers bid up the
price until the person who has

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.680
the highest value for
the good gets it.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.350
So price serves exactly
the signal it should

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.240
in allocating goods.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:29.670
OK?

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.150
So really eBay's really sort of
about this third thing of

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.660
who gets the good.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.360
OK?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:41.840
I offer my alarm clock or
whatever on eBay, OK, and then

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.760
people bid on that.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.880
And whoever values that the
most, that rare Jon Gruber

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.460
alarm clock the most,
they get it.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.150
OK?

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.780
So it's a perfect textbook
example.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.590
OK?

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.980
And basically, because on eBay
the price is used, or now with

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.670
also StubHub and concert
tickets, the price is used to

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.740
allocate the good to the
person who wants

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.620
it the most. OK?

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.380
Now, a recent example of an
auction on eBay that a lot of

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.940
attention, not so recent anymore
a couple years ago,

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.020
someone tried to auction
their kidney on eBay.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.510
OK?

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.010
Someone offered their kidney for
auction on eBay and said,

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.349
I have two kidneys
I only need one.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.200
So I'm going to auction my
kidney, you pay for me to fly

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.300
to wherever you need my kidney
and the operation, they take

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.680
it out and they give
it to you.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.060
And that's the way it goes.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.500
So what happened was person
offered their kidney and they

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.390
said the starting price
will be $25,000.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.620
They didn't do a buy it now.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.150
They said the starting price
will be $25,000 and the

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.860
bidding went on.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.720
The price got to $5 million
before eBay shot it down.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.120
eBay shut the auction down.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.390
And eBay said no, in fact,
you can't do this.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.380
Now there's two questions
here.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.470
The first is, why did
the price of the

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.690
kidney go so high?

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.950
That's the positive question.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.440
The positive question is, why
did the price the kidney on

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.940
eBay get so high?

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.720
And here, we'll talk, and you'll
learn more starting

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:12.360
Friday, about the twin forces
of supply and demand.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.640
The twin forces that drive the
economy of supply and demand.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.920
And you'll talk more rigorously

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.320
about these on Friday.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.290
Basically, they're what
they sound like.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.670
Demand is how much someone
wants something.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.900
Supply is how much of
it there is to have.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.300
And the intuition here
is surprising.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:32.990
OK?

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:40.730
The more that there's demand for
a good, the higher will be

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.500
the upward pressure on prices.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.530
The more people want a good,
the higher prices will go.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.430
And the less supply there is
of a good, also the higher

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.400
prices will go.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.310
So if everybody wants something
but it's common, the

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.650
price will be low.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.220
And if no one wants something
but it's uncommon, the price

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.240
will still be low,
and vice versa.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.000
In fact, the development of the
model of supply and demand

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.900
framework was from Adam Smith,
the, sort of, so-called first

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.360
economist who wrote The Wealth
of Nations in 1776 which is,

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.610
sort of, viewed as the,
kind of, first

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.440
serious book about economics.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.400
And he posed what he called
the water diamond paradox.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.500
What Smith said in that book is,
look, it's clear water is

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.700
the most important
thing in life.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.060
We can't live without water.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.670
And diamonds are completely
irrelevant to life.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.810
You can live totally fine
without a diamond.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.190
And yet, the price
of diamonds is

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.860
astronomical and water's free.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.340
How can this be?

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.620
How can it be that water which
is so much more of a

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.230
fundamental building block of
our life is so much cheaper

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.220
than diamonds which are not.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.110
And the answer, of course, is
that so far you've only

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.260
considered demand
and not supply.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.910
Yes, it's true.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.300
The demand for water
is much higher than

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.200
the demand for diamonds.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.170
But the supply is even larger.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.690
So that basically, yes it's true
that while water should

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.530
be worth more, in fact, in the
end the price of water is much

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.570
lower, because of the twin
forces of demand and supply.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.150
The demand is higher, but the
supply is much higher.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.490
So the price ends up lower.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.320
And that was his diamond
water paradox.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.760
OK?

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.890
Well, in this case, it's
a similar thing.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.530
What determines the demand
for a kidney?

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.905
What determines the demand for
a kidney is going to be the

00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:16.770
fact that you die without it.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:17.340
OK?

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.830
If you have no kidneys, you're
having kidney failure.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.110
OK?

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.810
You'll die without it.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.110
So basically, what will
determine it is people are

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.236
willing to spend all their
wealth, as much money as they

00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:26.360
can have, to get a kidney OK?

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.320
So the demand will
be quite high.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.220
The supply will be quite low.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.940
Sadly, not many people are
willing to be organ donors.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.490
More relevantly, a lot of
people aren't in good

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.480
situations to be organ donors.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.110
OK?

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.980
As a result, the supply is much
lower than the demand.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.775
So we have a situation with a
high demand, a low supply and

00:20:44.775 --> 00:20:47.130
the price went through
the roof.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.240
That's a positive analysis.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.310
OK?

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.250
So we can understand
pretty intuitively.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.750
We don't need this course
to understand why

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.120
the price went up.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.410
OK?

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.460
It's just the twin powers
of demand and supply.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:05.790
But what about the normative
question which is, should eBay

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.220
have allowed this
sale to happen?

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.980
EBay at $5 million cut it off
and then passed the rule

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.420
saying you can't auction your
body parts on eBay.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:12.870
OK?

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.180
Should they have done that?

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.160
That's the normative question.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.200
That's economics gets really
interesting, which is you all

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.660
are smart enough to figure out
why the price went up.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.070
But this is where it gets
interesting is should people

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:31.510
have been able to auction
their kidney on eBay?

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.200
On the one hand, many, many
people in this country die for

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.030
want of a body part.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:37.920
OK?

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.090
Thousands to hundreds of
thousands of people die every

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.300
year waiting for a transplant.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:42.890
OK?

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.470
If someone is incredibly rich
and they want a body part,

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.800
which to me a surplus because
I have two kidneys, why

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.180
shouldn't they be allowed
to buy it from me?

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.560
I'm better off because they
can pay me a ton of money.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.440
They are better off
because they live.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.490
So I've just described a
transaction that makes both

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.660
parties better off.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.540
Why shouldn't that be
allowed to happen?

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.790
So you tell me.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.670
Does everyone think
eBay was wrong?

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.399
Yeah, go ahead.

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:15.158
AUDIENCE: Say there is another
person who doesn't have as

00:22:15.158 --> 00:22:16.408
much money, and that
person also dies.

00:22:25.065 --> 00:22:27.273
PROFESSOR: You mean the person
who, what do you mean the

00:22:27.273 --> 00:22:27.910
person doesn't have as much-

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.165
AUDIENCE: --so obviously
somebody

00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:32.257
doesn't get the kidney.

00:22:35.205 --> 00:22:37.460
PROFESSOR: So in other words,
what you're assuming is, let's

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.550
say that if I hadn't done the
auction on eBay, I would have

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.300
just given my kidney away to
the transplant center.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.780
Then that's one less kidney
that can go to

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.940
the transplant center.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.180
And that means the rich guy gets
the kidney, and someone

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.610
else implicitly doesn't.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:49.890
That's a trade-off.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.570
You've just described
a trade-off.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.180
The trade-off is that basically
now we've allocated

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.470
the kidney away from the poor
person to the rich person.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.600
Now, but why do we
care about that?

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.550
I mean one person dies,
another person

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:04.550
lives, why do we care?

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:04.945
Yeah?

00:23:04.945 --> 00:23:07.085
AUDIENCE: There would
be some sort of case

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:08.664
of severity in condition.

00:23:08.664 --> 00:23:11.395
Like there might be someone
who's poor who would get the

00:23:11.395 --> 00:23:14.930
kidney if it went to a
transplant association because

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:18.790
they would die in a couple
of days without it.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.470
Whereas the rich person might
just be able to afford it, and

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.826
it might make their life
more convenient.

00:23:22.826 --> 00:23:24.940
But they might not be
in any more peril.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.480
PROFESSOR: They might
be a collector.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.980
So basically, that's right.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:35.770
So one reason we might care is
because we think that kidneys

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.170
should be allocated on the
basis of who needs

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.700
it the most. OK?

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.490
So a great example of this, of
course, was Mickey Mantle with

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.570
a liver transplant.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.410
Mickey Mantle, famous
ballplayer, raging alcoholic,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.950
who had liver failure because
he was basically drinking

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.570
himself to death, and jumped
the queue and got a liver

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.530
above a bunch, a lot of people
and then he kept drinking and

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.610
killed himself and wasted
the liver he'd gotten.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.050
OK?

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.270
So basically, you can think
that doesn't make sense.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.850
We should give it to people who
need it the most. For who

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.660
it would do the most
good in terms of

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.800
increasing their life.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.050
OK.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.610
So we've got the substitution
point.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.080
OK.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.420
Let's come back to the
substitution point though.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.300
Tell me a situation in
which that's wrong.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.270
Can someone tell me a situation
in which, in fact,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.020
that not a valid point.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.360
Yeah.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.779
AUDIENCE: Well, if the guy
is only going to sell it.

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:22.725
He's not going to
give it away.

00:24:22.725 --> 00:24:24.617
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:24:24.617 --> 00:24:26.509
You're assuming that the
guy who did sell

00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:27.460
would give it away.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.720
But, in fact, if it's
sell it or keep it

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.670
then there's no trade-off.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:39.430
And similar here, if it's sell
it or keep it then you might

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.130
as well let the rich
guy get it.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.440
Or is there another argument?

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.720
Is there another reason
why you might not

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.883
want this to happen?

00:24:46.883 --> 00:24:47.374
Yeah.

00:24:47.374 --> 00:24:49.171
AUDIENCE: It would encourage
people to use illegal ways of

00:24:49.171 --> 00:24:50.421
getting kidneys.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.390
PROFESSOR: So the other reason
could be that we don't trust

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.950
people to make good decisions
when money's involved.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.610
That we think that, gee, if it's
really true I can get a

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.450
couple million bucks for a
kidney, I might give mine up

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.920
even if I haven't really
thought through the

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.730
ramifications of doing so.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.970
Even if there's a risk to the
surgery, if there's a risk

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.300
that my other kidney will then
fail then I'll be screwed.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:16.800
OK?

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.840
So basically, we might have a
paternalistic attitude that

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.320
will lead us to not want to
allow people to engage in this

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.440
kind of risky behavior.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:28.873
Yeah?

00:25:28.873 --> 00:25:30.870
AUDIENCE: There may also be
some legal ramifications

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.574
associated with that if someone
sells their kidney and

00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:37.096
then their other kidney fails,
they might then blame eBay.

00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:37.554
PROFESSOR: Want it back.

00:25:37.554 --> 00:25:39.850
Like that Repo movie.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.200
That's right.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.630
There could, but let's leave the
lawyers out of this, OK?

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.440
I don't like lawyers.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.260
I'm going to rag on lawyers
this semester.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.530
We're going leave the
lawyers out of this.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.010
But, in any case,
you're right.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.550
That's, sort of, a

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.180
ramification of the same thing.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.330
So we've talked about the fact
that there's substitution.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.340
We've talked about the fact
that it's not allocated to

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.580
those who need it the most.
We've talked about the fact

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.370
that people might be making bad
decisions in doing this.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.180
But there's another factor, as
well, which is we may just as

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.240
a society feel it's unfair
that rich people can get

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.560
things poor people can't.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.660
There may be a pure equity
component here.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.180
OK?

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.100
Which is simply that we as a
society value equality, value

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.500
income inequality.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.250
And we think people should not
have an extra shot at getting

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.970
a resource just because
they're rich.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.380
Now that is a very deep and hard
concept, and we'll spend

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.970
a couple lectures talking about
equity towards the end

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:34.810
of the semester.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.720
By and large, we won't
consider it.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.270
OK?

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:42.300
But it turns out to be behind
much of what we'll discuss,

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.660
OK, in much of what we'll
discuss this semester and much

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.340
of what goes on in economics.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.070
OK?

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.660
Just take a look at the debate
that's going on right now in

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.720
terms of President Obama trying
to decide whether or

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:02.610
not to extend tax cuts to
wealthy individuals in the US.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:06.400
Some people argue that allowing
those tax cuts would

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.800
promote the economy.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.400
OK?

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.730
But others argue it's
unfair for rich

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.630
people to get tax breaks.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.450
And that fairness argument
matters a lot in terms of

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.010
driving the kind of
economic policy

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.010
decisions we need to make.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.530
So this semester, we're going
to focus a lot on efficiency

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.950
and optimization and how
to get resources

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.150
to the right place.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.220
But you have to remember behind
a lot of this is deep

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.200
normative issues about what
should be happening, how

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.440
should an economy function, and,
in particular, how should

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.540
we think about these
kind of equity

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.920
issues that are so important.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.440
OK.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.920
The last thing I want to talk
about is I want to talk about

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.490
why micro is not just an
abstract concept for things

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.300
like you might say, oh this is
all pretty funny and it's like

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.860
selling kidneys on eBay and
tax cuts for the rich

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.070
and why do I care?

00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.640
OK?

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.470
Well, you care because literally
every decision you

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.790
make is made through the kind
of framework we're going to

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.960
think about this semester.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.490
OK?

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:13.060
Now, different decisions may
follow our models more closely

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.840
and less closely.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.740
But there is not an
economic decision.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.910
OK?

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:19.970
Sorry, let me back up.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.990
There's not a decision that
people have made that

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.090
economists haven't
tried to model.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.850
From whether to produce iPods,
to how many times to

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.170
have sex each week.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:28.640
OK?

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.630
These are all things economists
have tried to model

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.790
with varying degrees
of success.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:34.980
OK?

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.420
Because economists think that
these all come from the same

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.080
decision theoretic framework
that we can discuss.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.430
Let's talk about a simple
example from this course.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.880
Your decision of whether or
not to buy the textbook.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.780
There's a textbook and
what's it cost? $140?

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.540
What's it cost?

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.500
Does anyone know?

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.950
AUDIENCE: This line says $180.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.400
And this one says $180, but
it's available for $130.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.450
PROFESSOR: $130, fine.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.340
So $130 for Professor Perloff
out at Berkeley.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.050
He doesn't get it all.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:04.630
I wrote a textbook too.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.000
He gets a small share of it.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.740
OK.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.250
So you have to decide, now has
anyone bought a used version

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.067
of the fourth, well it's the
fifth edition now, does

00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:16.040
anybody use a version of
the fourth edition?

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.440
Does anyone know what
the used price is?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.660
You can be honest.
I don't care.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.970
AUDIENCE: I know some people
found it for like $85 or so.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.440
PROFESSOR: So $85.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.200
So you've got to decide.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.380
So let's say you can buy the
previous edition, the fourth

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.390
edition, for $85 or the current
edition for $130.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.090
OK?

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.160
You've got to make
that decision.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.650
OK?

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.550
How do you make that decision.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.440
Well you may think, gee I
just make the decision.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.860
It's not really about
microeconomics.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.920
But it is.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.540
We're going to model how
you think about a

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.500
decision like that.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.670
Well how do you think about
a decision like that?

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.900
Well, the first thing you
consider is your preferences.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.280
How much are you willing to take
a chance that there's new

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.454
stuff in the fifth edition
that you need to know?

00:29:59.454 --> 00:30:00.740
OK?

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.250
If the fifth issue was identical
to the fourth

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.340
edition then you'd be an idiot
to not just buy the used

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:04.970
fourth edition.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.030
But it's not.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.180
Textbook writers are smart.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.460
They update their book.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.210
OK?

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.670
So basically, the fifth
edition is updated.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.950
There's new things in it.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.880
So you have to ask yourself,
what are the odds that I need

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.670
some of the new information in
the fifth edition and not in

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.910
the fourth edition?

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.400
And in thinking about that,
you're going to think about

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.070
your preferences.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:26.090
In particular, are you very risk
averse, are you afraid to

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.410
take a chance?

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.590
Or are you risk loving?

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.410
Are you willing to
take a chance?

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.050
OK?

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:32.370
That's one side of
the equation.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.810
If you're someone that says,
you know I will not take a

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.450
chance in life.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.420
I just have to make sure I learn
the most possible from

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.820
this course.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.040
Then you're going to want
that new edition.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.410
If you're someone that says, you
know what screw it, I'll

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.610
just figure it out later.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:44.350
I'm going to the lectures.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.490
I don't care.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:46.100
OK?

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.830
Then you might not want
it that much.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.950
So that's the first factor, is
going to be your preferences

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.230
and break down how much you
are willing to take a risk

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.230
that you need this
fifth edition.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.820
The second factor is going to
be your constraint: how much

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.590
money you have. OK.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.430
The more money you have, the
more you're willing, or more

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.210
relevant perhaps your parents
have, the more willing you are

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.980
to go ahead and buy
that new edition.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.060
The less money you have, the
less willing you are.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:08.950
OK?

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.390
So basically, it's going to
depend on whether you're

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:13.070
paying or your parents are
paying, in which case what the

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.680
hell you might as well buy
the fifth edition.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.640
OK?

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.570
And then finally, you're going
to take these preferences and

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.370
this constraint, your
preferences and your

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.510
resources, and go to the market
and look at what does

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.485
the market tell me the
difference is.

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:30.230
So you're going to say, here's
how much I kind of care about

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:34.180
fifth versus fourth edition,
here's the resources I have,

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.570
now I'll go to the market and
say, aha there is a $45

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.530
difference between these
two editions.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.550
So now I will solve
that constrained

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.470
optimization problem.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:52.430
And I'll decide whether I
want to get that book.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:53.730
You are going to be thinking to
yourself, this is stupid.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.530
I never think about
it that way.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.440
But the key point is you don't
have to think about it

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.740
exactly that way.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.400
There's a famous example in
economics of what's called the

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.440
as if principle.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.380
I don't know if kids still
say this one, as if.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.130
So it's the as if principle.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:06.720
OK?

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.545
And basically it's from Milton
Friedman, the famous economist

00:32:08.545 --> 00:32:13.150
from Chicago, who said, look,
when you're playing pool,

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:17.110
technically you could compute
the optimal angles of which to

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.310
shoot the ball every single time
to get the appropriate

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.210
bounce and get the balls in.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.610
You could do the mathematics
and compute it.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.870
But professional pool players
are not in this class with

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:26.710
you, I'll only say that.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.260
OK?

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.710
They're not guys who are able
to do that computation.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.830
They just know how to hit the
ball to get the same outcome

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.980
they would get if they
mathematically solved for the

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.900
optimal trajectory
to hit the ball.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.190
OK?

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:42.160
They behave as if they've
solved the constrained

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.330
optimization problem.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.650
And your decision when you buy
this book, you may not think

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.432
it through the very framework
that I just laid out very

00:32:49.432 --> 00:32:52.380
heuristically and will lay out
more rigorously this semester.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.940
But you're going to behave
as if you do.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.460
Because those facts are going to
be in your mind, and you'll

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.700
be thinking about it when
you make that decision.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.050
So while you may feel the models
we learn in this course

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.430
are rather abstract and don't
really explain how you behave

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.200
in an everyday basis, you're
going to behave as if those

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.290
models are really
applying to you.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.340
And if you think about, over the
next few days, think about

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.530
the decisions you make.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:15.820
From should I bring
an umbrella today,

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.000
it looks like rain?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.080
Well, on the one hand,
I might lose it.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.860
It's a pain to carry.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.770
On the other hand, how much do
I care about getting wet?

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.300
That's a constrained
optimization decision.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.010
To should I have an extra drink
at a party Friday night?

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:30.290
On the one hand, that could
have some pros and cons.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:30.850
OK?

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:34.050
These are all decisions,
constrained optimization

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.680
decisions, you're
going to make.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.440
They're going to affect
your life.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.180
And what we'll learn this
semester is about how you make

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.390
them and how we model, how
economists can use what we

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:43.520
learn about that to understand
the function of the economy.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.220
OK?

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.280
So I'm going to stop there.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.130
One other announcement, there
will, in general, be handouts

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:50.660
every lecture.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.210
I'm not going to
do PowerPoint.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:51.900
I'm going to do handouts.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.000
So when you come in every
lecture, please look at the

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.880
back banister.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.200
Though typically, not today.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.160
But typically, they'll be
handouts that you'll need to

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.900
follow along with in class.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.130
So remember, go to section on
Friday, first problems that

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.480
will be posted on Friday and it
will be due in section the

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.480
Friday after.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.220
And I'll see you all back here
on Monday, next Monday.

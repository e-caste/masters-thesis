00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.750
NANCY KANWISHER: So we won't
get through the whole attention

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.110
lecture.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.860
I saw this coming.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.027
I just felt like that last
bit was important enough.

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:17.430
We'll cut as needed.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.380
But I do want to
talk about attention.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.710
And let me start by
sharing with you some

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.430
of the key ideas about
what attention is.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.580
OK, so to get into the mode
of thinking about this,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.220
let's consider the
following question.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.530
How do you feel about
people driving while talking

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.700
on their cell phones?

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.540
Smart, not smart?

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.990
And while you're thinking about
that, also consider the case--

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.480
like let's suppose
that you have had

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.760
a hands-free setup,
so you don't have

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.190
to be looking down
on your cell phone

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.740
or typing away or
holding your cell phone.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.360
Maybe that's OK.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.710
What do you think?

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.740
Is there no problem with driving
while talking on your cell

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.570
phone, provided you're
not looking down

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.920
and pecking away at it?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.040
Yes?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.790
What do you think?

00:01:13.078 --> 00:01:14.620
I want to know what
you really think.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.190
I know what all the PR says.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.840
Is it fine?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.980
Yes?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.950
AUDIENCE: I would say it depends
on whether you're driving--

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.500
Like if the road is clear and
it's like your usual path,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.600
like driving is pretty
automatic at that point.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.820
But it it's like high
traffic or a new area,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.050
then I think it would have
a significant affects,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.510
so you shouldn't.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.650
NANCY KANWISHER: Totally.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.620
My rule is, if I am
talking on my cell phone,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.380
certainly, if I'm turning
left, I put the damn cell phone

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.160
on my lap.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.430
And I tell whoever it
is, I can't talk to you

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.050
and turn left at the same time.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.240
All right, turning left is
the hardest thing we do.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.113
Self-driving cars
can't turn left.

00:01:51.113 --> 00:01:52.030
Have I mentioned this?

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.800
How does a self-driving
car turn left?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.780
It turns right three times.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.350
Why is that?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.840
Because turning left
is social cognition.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.060
It's like, do they see me?

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.145
Do they know I'm here?

00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:03.520
Are they looking
at my indicator?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.145
Do they realize I'm
going to turn left?

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:05.710
This is hard.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.790
This is social cognition.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.380
Nobody's mastered that yet.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.110
Anyway, it's hard for us too.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.140
Anyway, the real
question here is not

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.410
for me to lecture you about
driving but to think about,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.650
why is that a problem?

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.700
Why can't you talk to a person
and pay attention to driving?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.970
What is the big deal, right?

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.260
And so the intuition is we have
some kind of limited processing

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.190
ability.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.430
OK, we're not like super
supercomputers who can just

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.230
do millions of things at once.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.150
We have some kind of limit in
how much stuff we can handle,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.650
OK?

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.210
And I think everybody
will have this intuition.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.730
You can't think about lots
of different things at once.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.780
I like to think of this as the
toaster model of cognition.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.570
That is, you plug in the
toaster, and the lights dim,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.260
right?

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.030
So if everything's
on the same circuit,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.810
there's some kind of unitary
thing, resource that's limited.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.020
And if some more of it goes
here, less if it goes here.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.272
OK, so obviously we don't
have simple circuits

00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:08.230
like that in our brain.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.530
And the relevant
scarce commodity

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.150
isn't just electricity.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.080
It's not electrons.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.010
It's some other kind of thing
we don't totally understand.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.960
But there's still some sense in
which of our mental processes

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.580
are on the same circuit.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.810
OK?

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.120
I'm assuming everybody is
sharing this intuition here.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.278
So think about this.

00:03:30.278 --> 00:03:32.320
How many people feel like
you can listen to music

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.458
and read difficult
stuff at the same time?

00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:35.500
Raise your-- I'm curious.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.230
How many people feel
like they can do that?

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.090
Only a few.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.980
That's so interesting.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.730
Sort of.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.310
Yeah, I can't do it
at all, like at all,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.740
like even background
music that I don't even

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.900
care that much about.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.730
Someday-- I mean, I
think these are really

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.090
stunning individual differences.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.830
I don't know if there's
any good work on it.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.580
I haven't seen it.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.190
But I think it's
really interesting.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.900
Some people can.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.650
Some people can't.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.740
I don't know what's
up with that.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.343
How about recognizing faces
and scenes at the same time?

00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:08.010
Can you do that?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.460
Yeah?

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.543
How many people feel like
you can recognize a face

00:04:10.543 --> 00:04:12.095
and a scene at the same time?

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:15.210
All right.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.850
In fact, Michael Cohen,
who gave that lecture

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.990
on brain-computer interfaces
a month ago or so,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.230
showed some beautiful
work that, actually, you

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.700
are better at recognizing a
face and a scene presented

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.550
simultaneously than two
faces or two scenes.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.430
Can you think why that might be?

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.720
Yeah, Isabelle?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.977
AUDIENCE: Context.

00:04:40.977 --> 00:04:42.060
NANCY KANWISHER: Say more.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.960
AUDIENCE: If you see somebody,
even a familiar face,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.780
you can either--

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.970
it helps identify them as,
oh, I know that person.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.412
Then, obviously, they're there.

00:04:57.412 --> 00:04:58.370
NANCY KANWISHER: Right.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.710
So they can go together
into a thing, maybe chunk

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.985
it as a thing or something.

00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:02.860
That's a good answer.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.210
It wasn't the one
I was fishing for.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.250
Yeah, Jimmy?

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.950
AUDIENCE: If people and
places are separate things

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.980
that your brain calculates,
if it's two faces,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.250
you have to calculate this
thing with a face number one

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.230
before going to face number two.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.140
Whereas if it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.640
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.360
Exactly.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.470
And you do, right?

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.820
You have an FFA and a PPA.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.620
And they're friends, right?

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.470
So what Michael showed
is not just that you

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.260
can recognize a face and
hold it in working memory,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.710
a face and a scene better
than two faces or two scenes,

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.320
but the degree to which
you have that cost

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.000
of doing two things
in one category

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.220
rather than spreading
over two categories

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.210
is linearly proportional to
how different the activation

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.710
patterns are for
those categories

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.390
in the ventral visual pathway.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.040
So faces and scenes are totally
different from each other.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.860
And so you get a big benefit
for separating your two items

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.530
across faces and scenes.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.660
Other things that are more
similar in their pattern

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.960
of response in the ventral
pathway, like faces and bodies,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.620
you get a smaller benefit.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.120
OK?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.495
So it's consistent
with this idea

00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:15.230
that, to the degree that we
have separate processors,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.020
you can do, to some extent,
processing in parallel, OK?

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.127
It doesn't explain why not
everybody can read and listen

00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:26.210
to music at the same time.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.752
Because, as I argued
a few weeks ago,

00:06:27.752 --> 00:06:29.543
these things don't
overlap at all.

00:06:29.543 --> 00:06:30.710
So there are many mysteries.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.660
But there's some
intuition there.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.910
OK, to get a little
more intuition

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.533
about limited processing
capacity, can you guys see?

00:06:38.533 --> 00:06:40.200
When I was sitting
over there last time,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.100
I couldn't see
the screen at all.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.360
Can you guys see it?

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.860
It's OK?

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.400
All right.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.185
Yeah?

00:06:45.185 --> 00:06:51.063
AUDIENCE: Do you think
the problem is [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:52.230
NANCY KANWISHER: Not for me.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.120
Instrumental music, no
lyrics still a problem.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.833
So I don't know.

00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:57.750
I mean, I'm sure there's
a literature on this.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.740
I just don't happen to know it.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.610
I'm just trying to
share the intuition.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.240
So I don't-- it's not
the only thing for me.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.220
OK, so what I'm going to do--
this is a super low-tech demo.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.613
I'm going to show you an
array of colored letters.

00:07:11.613 --> 00:07:13.030
Grab a piece of
paper or something

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.800
where you can write
down a few letters.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.350
And I'm just going to flash
up one array very quickly.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.740
And I want you to write down
as many of the blue letters

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.820
as you can.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.510
OK, ready?

00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:31.400
There's only a few of them.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.380
So you can.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.980
OK, ready?

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.550
Here we go.

00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:37.110
OK, write them down.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.320
Last year, everyone
got all of them.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.560
So I tried to go a
little faster this time.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.938
OK.

00:07:45.938 --> 00:07:47.230
OK, we're going to do it again.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.000
Ready?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.110
There's going to
be another display,

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.730
and you're going to write
down all the blue letters.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.720
Everyone ready?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.230
Here we go.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.830
OK, just wanted to
share the intuition.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.050
The probability-- did
anyone miss the N here?

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.755
OK, how many people got the N?

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:07.880
Nobody's going to admit it.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.150
I wanted a few people
to miss the N, right?

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.210
I really did zip through.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.317
I probably cheated and
made this one go faster.

00:08:16.317 --> 00:08:16.900
You missed it?

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.647
OK, thank you.

00:08:17.647 --> 00:08:18.730
I'm sure a few others did.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:24.760
OK, anyway, the point
is that, if you do this

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.500
properly in a lab,
the probability

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.340
of detecting it here is
much less than there, right?

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.315
So what does this show?

00:08:33.315 --> 00:08:34.940
It shows that we have
limited capacity.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.429
We can't process all
of those blue letters

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.770
in parallel, right?

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.909
When there's a single
one, you get it just fine.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.120
But when there's a bunch,
you don't necessarily

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.620
get it, right?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.090
OK.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.700
It also shows that we
have ability to select

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.530
the information, right?

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.695
So you weren't bothered
by the red letters.

00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:55.820
If I'd asked you right
after about the red letters,

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.970
you probably couldn't report
any of them at all, right?

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.800
It's a whole field
that studies that.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.450
We won't get into that.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.310
OK.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.740
So in fact, the
probability of reporting

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.220
the N in these two displays
is independent of the number

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.420
of red letters.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.930
They just don't matter.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.040
They are not entering into that
limitation, whatever it is.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.630
The limitation is
only for the ones

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:23.400
you're paying attention
to, the blue ones, OK?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:29.370
OK, so why is our
mental capacity limited?

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.630
OK?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.100
Nobody really knows an answer.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.890
And I actually think this is
a really unsatisfying part

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.780
of attention research because
it sort of seems obvious.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.120
But I think it's not.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.120
So sometime in the
next 10 or 20 years,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.780
some smart computational person
will analyze this well and get

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.960
a more satisfying answer.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.418
But right now,
here's where we are.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.290
The standard story is, well,
we have only so many neurons

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.370
and so much capacity.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.730
And you can't do
everything at once, right?

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.280
So we can't process everything
in the whole visual field

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.790
at once.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.920
That's the standard story.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.070
But the reason I find
this unsatisfying is like,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.070
why the hell not, right?

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.310
We have all this parallel stuff
or the whole visual field,

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.590
at least in the first
few stages of processing.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.440
And we have quite a degree
of parallelism after that.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.270
So I think that's
the standard story.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.480
But I'm just marking that I
don't find it very satisfying.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.090
Yeah?

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.490
A second answer, which
I think is also not

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.970
totally satisfying but also
a little bit right at least,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.310
is that, typically, you're
only going to do one action.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.810
Right?

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.185
You're going around
in the world.

00:10:37.185 --> 00:10:40.080
Let's forget colored letters
on a display in a lab.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.190
Let's think about a person
walking around in a busy city

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.150
street doing something, right?

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.200
There's typically only
one or a very small number

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.450
of things you're going to
do next, like walk down

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.220
the sidewalk and
not bump into people

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.740
or pick up this object, right?

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.430
You don't need to act towards
all the things in your world.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.160
And in fact, if you
had to, so given

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.230
that you're only going
to do one thing, why

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.720
distract the whole rest of
your motor-planning system

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.970
by feeding it all this
information that's is just

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.470
going to clutter
it with garbage?

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.185
Why not give it just the
information it needs?

00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:13.560
OK, so that's the
standard story.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.410
It's very squishy and vague
but hopefully intuitive.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.340
And there's some nice,
compelling examples

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.430
that illustrate this.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.730
So there's a fish
called the pike fish

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.460
that preys on smaller
fish called sticklebacks.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.510
OK?

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:34.640
And if you stick a pike fish
in a tank with sticklebacks,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.500
it will catch the
first stickleback

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.620
faster if there's only
one in the tank with it

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.690
than if there are 10
in the tank with it.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.190
OK?

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.710
You might think, you've
got 10 to choose from.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.810
You'll get a fish faster.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.420
But 10 is more
distracting, right?

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.700
And so maybe our
action-planning systems also

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.430
prefer the single stickleback.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.440
Again, there's no
computational precision.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.110
I'm just sharing
intuitions with you.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.890
OK, so let me give you some
more evidence that there really

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:09.377
are significant capacity
limits in perception

00:12:09.377 --> 00:12:11.960
and that, in fact, there's a lot
of stuff right in front of us

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.800
that comes right onto our
retina that we don't see.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.000
OK?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.350
So I'm going to
show you an example.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.740
I'm going to show you a
picture for just a few seconds.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.970
And I want you to
just look at it.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.770
And then I'm going to ask
you some questions about it.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.070
OK?

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:25.640
Here we go.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.300
OK, so how rich a
percept did you get?

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.335
Did you see lots of stuff
and get lots of detail?

00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:38.710
Or do you just
feel like you just

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.400
have the vaguest sense of a few
buildings, a street, that's it?

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.450
How many feel like they got
a lot of pretty good detail?

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.222
No one does.

00:12:48.222 --> 00:12:49.055
Or everyone's bored.

00:12:49.055 --> 00:12:51.578
I don't know which.

00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:54.200
AUDIENCE: What do
you mean good detail?

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.450
NANCY KANWISHER: The colors
of buildings, the presence

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.840
of objects, details on
the architectural styles,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.878
where an awning was,
that kind of thing.

00:13:02.878 --> 00:13:08.228
AUDIENCE: I feel like
I got [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:08.228 --> 00:13:10.520
NANCY KANWISHER: Well, most
people looking at this feel

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:10.760
like--

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.900
I mean, who knows what it means?

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.692
I mean, we're just
sharing intuitions here.

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:15.495
But most feel like,
that was pretty rich.

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:16.370
I have a sense of it.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.162
I have a sense of maybe
what country that's

00:13:18.162 --> 00:13:19.610
in and what kind
of stuff is there

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.482
and what kind the style is.

00:13:21.482 --> 00:13:23.690
You get a feel for the place,
all that kind of thing.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.930
Maybe not every damn
detail, but lots, right?

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.880
So the general intuition
most people have

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.400
is a fair amount of detail.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.050
OK?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.550
Well, let's look
at that some more.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.870
This is actually a very,
very heated topic right now.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.600
Me and Michael Cohen published
a paper a couple of years

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.030
ago called The Bandwidth of
Perception, which is an effort

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.940
to grapple with this question
of how much information is there

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.710
in your current
percept right now.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.360
And there are many different
perspectives on this.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.810
Let's find out a little
more with a further demo.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.380
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.040
to show you that picture again.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.690
And it's going to flash
on a number of times.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.150
And each time it
flashes on, there

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.050
might be something
that's different.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.640
So take notes on any
differences you might detect.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.685
OK?

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.185
OK.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.280
OK, what things changed?

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:42.780
Yeah?

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.030
AUDIENCE: There was a woman
walking down the sidewalk.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.290
NANCY KANWISHER: And?

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.598
AUDIENCE: That's all I got.

00:14:47.598 --> 00:14:49.140
NANCY KANWISHER:
OK, but she changed.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.840
What changed about her?

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.793
AUDIENCE: Other
than her clothes?

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:55.710
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.450
Over the successive
presentations,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.190
was she there sometimes
and not others?

00:14:59.190 --> 00:14:59.820
Did she change?

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.500
Yeah, she appeared
or disappeared.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.010
OK, good.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.394
What else, Isabel?

00:15:03.394 --> 00:15:04.846
AUDIENCE: The awnings changed.

00:15:04.846 --> 00:15:06.835
The buildings changed colors.

00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:07.960
NANCY KANWISHER: Very good.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.710
Very good.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.790
How many people saw
an awning change?

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.560
Maybe half of you.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.370
OK.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.878
What else changed?

00:15:17.878 --> 00:15:19.238
AUDIENCE: The car.

00:15:19.238 --> 00:15:20.530
AUDIENCE: The model of the car.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.640
NANCY KANWISHER: The
model of the car.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.390
Very good.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:22.900
Yeah?

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.300
AUDIENCE: I feel like
the shops changed.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.930
But I don't know when or how.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.590
NANCY KANWISHER: OK.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.090
OK.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.770
You want to see
how they changed?

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.600
OK, here's how it ended.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.460
Here's how it started.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.140
Are you surprised how much?

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.600
Raise your hand if you're
surprised how much changed.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.410
Yeah, a lot, right?

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.910
OK, so what does that tell us?

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.680
It tells us that
either the sense

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.950
we have that we really saw a
lot of what's going on there

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:53.460
was wrong.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.960
We didn't see as
much as we thought.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.910
Because if we saw as
much as we thought,

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.343
we should notice massive
changes like that.

00:15:59.343 --> 00:16:01.260
If you didn't see the
awning, look over there.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.560
I mean, how could-- look
at the color changes.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.630
Pretty major, right?

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.360
Or we perceive all that
stuff in the instant,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.255
and it just goes poof by the
time the next one comes along.

00:16:12.255 --> 00:16:14.130
That's one of the things
the field is finding

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.088
about those things are
very hard to tell apart,

00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:17.640
not impossible, but hard.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.710
Yeah.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:23.190
OK, so most people feel
like, wow, much more changed

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.450
than I thought.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.230
I can't resist one
more hilarious demo.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.990
So have you already
seen this like in 9.00?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.080
How many people have
seen this before?

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.503
Oh, I don't want to bore you.

00:16:34.503 --> 00:16:35.670
Do you mind seeing it again?

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.690
We could skip it.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.110
It's kind of fun.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.610
Sorry?

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:38.880
Do it?

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.420
OK.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.440
OK.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.940
OK.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.310
So you're just going to
watch this video and just

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.905
track things
because there may be

00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:47.280
changes happening
here and there,

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.090
and you want to notice them, OK?

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.590
Here we go.

who, at precisely
3:34 this afternoon,

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.770
was brutally bludgeoned to

- I was planting my petunias
in the potting shed.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.340
- Constable, arrest Lady Smythe.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.140
- How did you know?

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.250
- Madam, as any
horticulturist will tell you,

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.060
one does not plant
petunias until May is out.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.010
Take her away.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.080
It's just a matter
of observation.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.440
The real question is,
how observant were you?

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.920
Clearly, somebody in this
room murdered Lord Smythe,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.490

00:18:29.674 --> 00:18:31.216
NANCY KANWISHER:
It's actually an ad.

00:18:31.216 --> 00:18:33.110
But it doesn't hurt
to get its message.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:42.270
All right, it's a British ad
with an important message.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.815
But it's a pretty impressive
demo too, isn't it?

00:18:44.815 --> 00:18:46.440
How many people feel
like lots of stuff

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.720
changed that they didn't notice?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.940
Yeah, that's intuition.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.630
So the idea here is that all
that stuff hits your retina.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.300
All of it kind of gets
processed to some degree.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.810
But it's amazing how much
of it goes unnoticed.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.060
OK?

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.020
All right, oops.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.490
Sorry.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.050
OK, you might think, OK, is
this something that only happens

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.300
when it doesn't really matter?

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.790
OK, you were
looking for changes.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.740
But your life
didn't depend on it.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.900
What about commercial pilots?

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.610
So here's a classic
study where they

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.940
brought in actual
real commercial pilots

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.210
with thousands of hours
of flying experience.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.910
And they had them fly
in a flight simulator.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.860
They had them land a plane on a
runway in the flight simulator

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.080
under foggy conditions.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.850
And I forget what percent.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.045
I have to cheat and
look at my notes.

00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:38.270
It doesn't say.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.810
It does.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:39.768
I'm just not seeing it.

00:19:39.768 --> 00:19:43.220
Some large percent
of the pilots never

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.880
saw this plane sitting
right there on the runway.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.880
They landed the planes
in the simulator right

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.142
through that plane.

00:19:51.142 --> 00:19:52.850
And when they were
shown it subsequently,

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.433
they were shocked
and couldn't believe

00:19:54.433 --> 00:19:55.820
they didn't see it, right?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.430
They were using a
heads-up display

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.805
that tells them
their orientation

00:19:58.805 --> 00:19:59.900
to where the runway is.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.700
And they're paying
attention to this stuff,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.720
landing on the runway.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.830
And they just do not even see
that very relevant thing, OK?

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.160
So it's not just something that
happens in like weird psych

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.440
demos and funny movies.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.480
Even for very important things,
people miss absolutely major,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.600
important information.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.500
OK, so what all this
tells us is attention

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.060
is a filter that lets some
information into our awareness

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.760
but completely filters
out of awareness

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.890
a lot of other
information that lands

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.410
on your retina or your cochlea.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.660
OK?

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.880
And there's two key
properties of attention

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.110
that go hand-in-hand.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.360
One, those capacity limits
we've been talking about.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.290
You can't do everything at once.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.160
And two, selectivity,
that is there's

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.470
some way some subset
of that information

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.000
comes in some way
to select it, OK?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.030
All right, so let's say a
little bit more about attention.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.760
There's lots of different
ways and forms of attention.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.420
So let me give you a few key
distinctions about attention.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.420
So far, it's just kind
of a vague word that gets

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.860
used lots of different ways.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.620
So long ago, the great Helmholtz
thought about attention

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.650
and realized that there were two
different kinds of attention.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.880
So he noted way back
in 1860, our attention

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.760
is quite independent of the
position and accommodation

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.840
of the eyes and of any known
alteration in these organs

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.860
and free to direct itself by a
conscious and voluntary effort

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.400
upon any selected portion of a
dark and undifferentiated field

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.460
of view.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.460
This is one of the most
important observations

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.890
for a future theory
of attention.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.050
Indeed, it is, right?

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.780
So his point-- I think we did
this at some earlier lecture.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.350
His point is you can fixate
on my nose right now.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.540
OK, everybody fixate on my nose.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.070
Not that it's that
fabulous a nose.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.020
It'll just serve for
the demo right now.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.860
And if I hold up different
numbers of fingers out here--

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.120
keep fixating on my nose.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.530
No cheating.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:02.700
OK?

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.570
How many fingers are off
to the left side of my nose

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.280
from your perspective?

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.060
OK.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.250
How many fingers are
off to the right side?

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.060
OK.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.020
You can do that.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.750
You can pull up this information
or pull up that information

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.640
without moving your eyes.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.180
OK?

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.380
That's called covert attention
because the input is identical.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.240
And you are just
somehow adjusting

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.800
the dials on your
perceptual system

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.570
to pull up this or pull up that.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.080
OK?

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.840
So that's called
covert attention.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.150
To be unconfounded
from overt attention,

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.430
which is actually the most
powerful kind of attention.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.890
Overt attention, you
move your eyes from point

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.830
to point to select
different information.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.420
OK, so overt attention is a
much more powerful filter.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.570
And we make about two to
four eye movements a second.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.000
And it's very powerful
because the center of gaze

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.890
has very high
resolution information.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.840
Remember high density
of photoreceptors

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.030
at the fovea in
the center of gaze,

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.070
and the density tails
off in the periphery.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.060
So we have much better
information in the fovea

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.040
than in the periphery.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.990
OK, so it's both
photoreceptor density,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.540
and it's also cortical area.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.910
So in retinotopic
cortex, back here,

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.300
primary visual cortex,
V1, V2, those regions,

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.260
you have about 20 square
centimeters of cortex,

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.000
like that area of cortex--

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.750
pretty big-- something like
that processing the central two

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.350
degrees of vision.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.850
OK?

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.820
Huge cortical area devoted
to a tiny little part

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.120
of the visual world.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.340
And much less per degree
for the periphery.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.230
OK, so both at the
photoreceptor stage

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.060
and at higher-level
processing stages,

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.180
we vastly over represent
the center of gaze.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:43.930
OK?

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.690
That's why if you have loss
of foveal vision and macular

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.190
degeneration, it's really awful.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.990
You can't read or
recognize faces.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.000
That's where you need
this fine-grained foveal

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.260
information.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.860
OK, so that means
that moving your fovea

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.930
and parking it on different
parts of the array

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.360
is an extremely
powerful way to select

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.350
different kinds of information.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.340
So to give you a feel for
how much people do this

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:11.020
and how they select
information, here's a video.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.820
This is taken from a
head-mounted camera

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.310
of a person who is
watching these two people.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.130
And the yellow dot is
where their fovea is.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.470
So they're talking to
my former postdoc Matt.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.380
And they're fixating on
his face as he talks.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.530
And sometimes they take a
peek at the other person.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.380
And you can see there's very
fine-grained adjustments

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.198
of where they look
as this goes on.

00:24:31.198 --> 00:24:33.490
And now they're walking down
the hall in this building,

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.915
and they're following her.

00:24:34.915 --> 00:24:36.790
Watch what happens when
they turn the corner.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.110
Check out the signs.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.150
Read the little notices.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.240
Look down the hall.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.698
And then watch what happens
when they go around the corner.

00:24:43.698 --> 00:24:44.500
Oh, new person.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.010
Look at the new person.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.510
Right?

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.410
Sorry, it's too dark to
see what's going on here.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.940
Oh, this is a little
fixation patch

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.420
where they're recalibrating
the eye tracker to figure out

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.700
to make sure it's working.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.700
Here comes a new person.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.110
They look at his face.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:03.890
Saccade back and forth
between the two faces, right?

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.690
Whoever's talking,
you look at them.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.850
And you collect
high-resolution information

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:08.958
from that person's face.

00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:11.000
With both head turns, you
can see their both head

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.520
turns and eye movements.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.140
OK, you get the idea.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.250
I didn't totally explain.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:22.922
So this is a head-mounted
camera and eye tracker, OK,

00:25:22.922 --> 00:25:24.880
of a person who was
walking around the building

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.770
encountering people.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.228
And it was showing you both
what was in their field of view

00:25:28.228 --> 00:25:30.890
and where they were fixating
their eyes in that view.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.700
So you can see there's really
fine-grained, moment-to-moment

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.620
sampling of visual
information all

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.800
the time with overt attention
with eye movements, OK?

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.120
Make sense?

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.082
OK.

00:25:41.082 --> 00:25:43.540
OK, first, so that's the first
distinction about attention,

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.490
covert versus overt.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:46.780
OK?

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.700
Now, you might say,
why would we bother

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.120
with this subtle, sophisticated
covert attention when

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.100
we can just move our eyes
and do overt attention?

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.100
And I think there's a
bunch of reasons for that.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.720
One is other people can
see where you're looking.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.690
And there's sometimes you want
to attend to stuff over there

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.390
and not let people know, right?

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:11.620
So there are many examples of
this from elevator eyes, people

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.202
who look you up and down.

00:26:13.202 --> 00:26:14.410
It's not politically correct.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.250
It's not nice.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.480
It's not considerate.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.830
People notice if you do that.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.600
So don't do it.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.080
You can covertly attend
below the face, if you like.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.450
But don't overtly move
your eyes down there

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.830
because they will know.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.400
OK?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.380
We primates are
very, very attuned

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.600
to where each other are looking.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.350
We are the only primate who
has whites around the eyes.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.660
I just heard a talk last
week by Michael Tomasello,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.000
who's one of the
major primatologists.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.250
And he says that
the fact that humans

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.770
have whites of their eyes that
make it so easy to tell where

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.470
they're looking must
mean that we mostly

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.157
want to share information
with each other about where

00:26:50.157 --> 00:26:50.740
we're looking.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.400
We're a very cooperative,
communicative species.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.363
But not always.

00:26:55.363 --> 00:26:57.280
Sometimes we want to
sneak a peek at something

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.510
where people don't know.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.160
The case that I
notice all the time is

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.290
I'm at a conference and
some very familiar face

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.940
comes along and
says, hey, Nancy.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.450
How are you?

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.520
And I'm thinking,
who the hell is this?

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.460
And the whole time, I'm thinking
I can see the name right there.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.600
I can't quite resolve it.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.480
I know that if saccade
down for a half a second,

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.200
they will see it.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.790
And I will be busted.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.310
And so I'm sitting there with
a name right there racking

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.290
my brain trying to think
who the hell it is.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.623
Anyway, so there are many
cases like this where we don't

00:27:22.623 --> 00:27:24.767
want to be caught looking.

00:27:24.767 --> 00:27:26.350
So those are all
cases where you might

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.870
want to use covert attention.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.670
Also, sometimes
you want to track

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:34.240
lots of things in parallel, and
you can't foveate all of them.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.500
You can only foveate one thing.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.230
So I don't know
anything about sports.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.480
But think of your favorite
complicated sports example

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.438
where there are multiple
players moving at once

00:27:42.438 --> 00:27:44.270
and you need to keep
track of all of them.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.270
That would be a classic
case of covert attention

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.400
because you could covertly
attend to several of them

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:48.900
at once.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.720
And you have only one fovea.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.860
Well, you have two, but
they go to the same place.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.720
OK, so that's the
second distinction overt

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.150
versus covert--

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:58.930
or the first one.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:27:59.430
Right?

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.100
So the next basic distinction
of different kinds of attention

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.350
are the kind where
we decide where

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.400
we want to look versus the
kind where the stimulus draws

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.230
our attention, OK?

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.510
So there are lots of examples.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.880
Like web pop ups
are all designed

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.550
to pull your attention,
overt and covert.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.710
Even you don't want to
look at that damn thing.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.870
But the weird, little
dancing figure,

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.710
they're all optimized to pull
your attention over and make

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.652
you read the ad, right?

00:28:28.652 --> 00:28:29.860
And they're pretty effective.

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.860
OK, so that's called
stimulus-driven attention

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.027
or exogenous attention.

00:28:34.027 --> 00:28:35.110
It comes from the outside.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.670
And it pulls you in.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.950
OK?

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.080
Another classic
example is pop-out.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.880
If you look at this
display, it's very hard

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.710
not to notice and have
your attention drawn

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.450
to that red thing.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.340
Certain properties
of stimuli that just

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.830
automatically capture
your attention.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.200
OK, that is to be
contrasted with

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.713
voluntary controlled attention.

00:28:54.713 --> 00:28:56.380
That's like the case
we did before where

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.030
you were fixating on my nose.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.083
It was totally up to
you whether attend--

00:29:00.083 --> 00:29:01.000
I mean, I told you to.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.350
But you could have
made up your own mind

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.460
and attended to neither.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.350
And I wouldn't
have known, right?

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.910
So you can decide what you
want to pay attention to.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.520
And as I think I
mentioned in I don't

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.040
know what context
a few weeks ago,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.188
thank God we can decide
what to pay attention to.

00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:16.480
Because there's lots of stuff
that goes on in the world

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.970
that we don't want to have
dominate our mental life.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.390
And controlled or
voluntary attention

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.930
is one way that we can have
our mental life dominated

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.420
more by things we want it
to be dominated by and less

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.170
by things we don't, right?

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.790
So that's that notion here.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.190
Like for example,
you're sitting here.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.180
And it's like noon.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.860
And you're just thinking,
OK, I'm really hungry.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.730
I'm really hungry.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.130
If you were my dog Charlie,
your entire mental life

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.080
for the whole next half an
hour would be, I'm so hungry.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.663
I'm so hungry.

00:29:44.663 --> 00:29:45.760
I'm so hungry.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.000
But you're a person.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.235
And so that thought may
impinge now and then,

00:29:49.235 --> 00:29:51.610
but you can drive it away and
think about something else.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.620
Because it's not going
to get you anywhere

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.913
to focus on how hungry you are.

00:29:54.913 --> 00:29:56.080
I know I just made it worse.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.170
I'm sorry about that.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.840
OK.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.750
OK, the way that
scientists have typically

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.830
studied voluntary attention is
they ask subjects to do this.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.300
And much like the
case we just did,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.580
here's kind of very
basic paradigm.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.380
You have subjects
fixating on a cross.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.410
And typically, in covert
attention experiments,

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.960
you want to make sure there
aren't overt eye movements.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.460
And so you'll have an
eye tracker to make sure

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.470
the subject is keeping
their eye on that cross.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:24.472
OK?

00:30:24.472 --> 00:30:25.930
And then you give
them a little cue

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.030
that says pay attention
off to the right,

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.700
but don't move your eyes, OK?

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.730
And then shortly thereafter,
a little cue comes up.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.230
And you have to hit
a button quickly

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.580
that you detected the target.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:36.850
OK?

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.183
It comes out at variable delays.

00:30:38.183 --> 00:30:40.450
So you can't just
hit the button.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.060
OK, if you do that, you
find that the reaction

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.760
time to detect that target, if
it's where you're attending,

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.860
is really fast, not much
more than 200 milliseconds,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.520
which is damned fast, right?

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.765
Now consider a case where you're
instructed to attend over here.

00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:56.640
And the way you get
these experiments to work

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.167
is that these cues are
valid 80% of the time.

00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:01.000
So there's a reason for
subject to-- there's

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.120
a motivation for them to
follow your instruction.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.380
So they're trying
to answer quickly.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.340
And there's like,
OK, they're ready.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.690
It's almost certainly
going to be over here.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:07.260
But oops.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.160
It's not.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.180
OK?

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.600
Then reaction time is almost
100 milliseconds slower,

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.350
which is a huge effect in
psychology, 100 milliseconds.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.310
OK?

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.880
OK, so you're much slower
to detect something

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.320
if it's at an
unattended location.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:23.820
OK?

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.910
And if you have a neutral trial,
you're somewhere in the middle.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:33.120
OK, so that is exogenous
or voluntary attention.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.340
OK, and again, this
is covert attention.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.410
No eye movements.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.460
All right, so third
distinction, the example

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.230
I just gave you was
spatial attention.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.140
You're attending to this
location or that location

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.410
in space.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:47.910
OK?

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.340
That's probably the most
powerful and common kind

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.432
of attention is
usually the things

00:31:52.432 --> 00:31:54.390
you're interested in are
in a particular place.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.598
And you attend to that place.

00:31:55.598 --> 00:31:57.360
And there you go.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.130
But it's not the only kind.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.360
You can have
feature-based attention.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.680
So if your utensil drawer is
a hell of a mess like mine

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.540
is, like this, if your task
is to find the black vegetable

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.030
peeler, best of luck to you.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.710
It'll take quite a while.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:14.380
It's in there.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.088
It's right there.

00:32:15.088 --> 00:32:16.800
But it takes a while, right?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.660
In contrast, if the task is find
the purple rubber spatula, duh,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.440
right?

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.180
OK, so that's
feature-based attention.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.950
You don't know the
location in advance.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.283
You know something about the
feature you're looking for,

00:32:28.283 --> 00:32:31.140
that it's black or that it's
purple or round or square

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.610
or whatever the feature is.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.070
OK, so different
kinds of filters

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.040
you can set on your
attention system.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.810
OK, so that's just
to give you some

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.640
of the phenomenology of the
different kinds of attention.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.245
How does all this
work in the brain?

00:32:44.245 --> 00:32:45.870
I'm not going to tell
you how it works.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.920
We'll just focus mostly on
what the brain regions are.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.750
OK, so let's go back to this
case here, voluntary attention.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:59.160
So now the question is, what
happens when you get this cue?

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.690
You're not going
to move your eyes.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.900
But you're kind of cranking
up that part of space.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.020
OK, what's going on in
the brain right there

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.150
before the stimulus comes on?

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.860
Everybody get the question?

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.900
OK, you can sort of
feel it happening.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.830
But what does that mean?

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.090
Well, this is very amenable
to a simple functional MRI

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.110
experiment.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.360
And in the early days
of functional MRI,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.210
a whole bunch of people at
once realize, oh, right, we

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.190
can answer this
longstanding question

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:29.640
of whether early retinotopic
parts of the visual system

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.610
are affected just
by a cue like that,

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:36.150
even before the stimulus
comes on, right?

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.430
And I think it was 1998.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.980
A whole bunch of people
started doing this in 1997.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.420
I was one of them.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.340
But a whole bunch
did it once in 1998.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.647
I think like six
papers were published

00:33:46.647 --> 00:33:48.480
all doing versions of
this next thing, which

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.150
is one of those obvious ideas.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:51.900
We got scooped.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.730
But anyway, everybody
got the same result.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.070
So basically, if you just
do a simple comparison--

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.320
this is the version they have.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.520
Subjects are fixating here.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.410
There's two stimuli.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.420
They're looking in V1 and V2.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.180
And if you just do a contrast
of the case where you're

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.639
looking here and you're
attending, waiting for a target

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.510
here versus waiting for a target
there without moving your eyes,

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:17.429
you get a big contralateral
modulation in V1 and V2.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.750
This is a slice near the
back of the head here.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.260
So this is a piece
of calcarine sulcus

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.929
or primary visual cortex, right?

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:28.620
And so you can see, even before
the target stimulus comes on,

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.639
just attending over there gives
you a big baseline increase

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:33.570
in neural activity.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.580
Everybody clear
what's going on here?

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.480
And of course, you can
do the opposite one

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.409
and see that it shifts to
the opposite side of space.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:41.750
OK?

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.600
OK, so that's all before
the stimulus comes on.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.360
You can think of it as priming
the brain, kind of juicing up

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.020
those neurons getting
them ready to go,

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.020
so that, when that stimulus
comes through, boom.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.199
Your reaction time is faster.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.570
OK?

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.920
OK, so that's modulating
parts of visual cortex

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.100
before a stimulus comes
on to get it ready.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.020
But we can also look
at, what is the effect

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.000
on a stimulus once
it comes through,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.665
an attended stimulus or
an unattended stimulus?

00:35:09.665 --> 00:35:11.290
To show you that,
I'm going to show you

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:16.360
a kind of feature-based
attention and an ancient-- this

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.540
is a paper we published
in 1998, I think.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.460
This is a nonspatial version.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.950
So we gave subjects--
guess what-- faces

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.260
and houses and a
little crosshair.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.750
And we had subjects
in different blocks

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.120
say whether the two
arms of the cross

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.330
were the same or
different length, OK?

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.855
So vertical one is
different length.

00:35:35.855 --> 00:35:37.180
So that's a different case.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.420
Whether the two houses
are same or different

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.770
or whether the two faces
are same or different.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.680
OK, so actually, it's
spatial and feature,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.245
when you think of it, because
they're in different places.

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:48.100
OK?

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.350
So we then looked in
a bunch of regions.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:53.140
I'll show you the data from
the fusiform face area.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.740
And the key thing about
this is, in all three tasks,

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.300
we had the identical stimuli.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.570
So there's always
faces and houses

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.330
and crosses in the same
place in your visual field,

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.830
in all of those blocks.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.690
It's just a matter of
which of those things

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:09.700
you're paying attention to.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.605
OK?

00:36:10.605 --> 00:36:12.730
So what do you think we'll
see in the fusiform face

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.240
area in this experiment?

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.170
Is it going to care whether
you're attending to faces

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.590
or attending to houses or
attending to the crosshair?

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.195
Same stimulus all the time.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.200
Yeah, Jimmy?

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
when you're not attending.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.040
But when you're
attending, [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.863
NANCY KANWISHER:
Exactly what happens.

00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:39.280
OK, everybody hear
the prediction?

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.780
You'll still get something.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.840
But you'll get more when
you're paying attention to it.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.690
OK, so here's the FFA
response over time.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.120
Here's the time course.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.400
And these gray blocks
are the blocks.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.560
These are the different
attending to houses, faces,

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.370
color, houses, faces, crosshair,
houses, faces, crosshair.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.320
The gray bars are
when the subjects

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.170
are attending to faces.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:09.020
Now, here, I actually
can't quite tell.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.480
Yeah, I can sort of tell.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.830
You can't see it on the screen.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.218
But there are little rest
periods between those blocks.

00:37:14.218 --> 00:37:15.760
So I'm trying to
figure out if you're

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.630
right that there's some
response greater than baseline.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.970
I think there's actually very
little selective response

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:23.290
greater than baseline.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:26.500
By design, we made this
a whopping attentional

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.943
manipulation, so that all of
the tasks are really difficult.

00:37:29.943 --> 00:37:31.360
And when you're
doing one of them,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.680
you just barely feel
aware of anything else.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.100
In fact, I vividly
remember the first time

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.710
we ran this experiment, I
was a subject in the scanner.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.720
And I did the first block.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.900
And I was doing just crosshairs.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.437
And I went through the
whole crosshair thing.

00:37:46.437 --> 00:37:48.770
And it wasn't till the end
of the experiment I realized,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.187
oh, right, there
were faces there.

00:37:50.187 --> 00:37:51.860
I was just completely
unaware of them.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.770
So we designed it to really
so tie up your mental capacity

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.230
that you just didn't have
processing resources left

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.200
for anything else.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.980
And so if there is a response
to everything else here,

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.890
it's really low.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.670
But you can see, certainly, the
attended thing is much more.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.360
It's much stronger
in the attended case

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.880
than the unattended case.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.720
OK?

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.400
So this is a general property.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.440
Like basically, all of
the perceptual regions

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.490
we've talked about are strongly
modulable by attention,

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.320
OK, from retinotopic
regions on up.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:29.300
OK, including V1 and, in fact,
even including the lateral

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.680
geniculate nucleus.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.520
So one synapse up
from the retina,

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.390
you're already modulating
activity there by attention.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.880
OK?

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.670
I know I said this, but
it maybe went by briefly.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.950
You have 10 times as
many connections down

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:50.190
from cortex down to the LGN
as you have going forward.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.690
OK?

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:52.790
One of the things they're
doing is setting up

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.660
selective filters, so that only
the stuff you want to process

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.250
makes it to higher stages.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.312
OK, Yes?

00:39:01.312 --> 00:39:03.020
AUDIENCE: So does this
sort of phenomenon

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.230
generalize across
the brain areas?

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.170
I mean, it's like--

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.295
NANCY KANWISHER: It's
generally true of pretty much

00:39:08.295 --> 00:39:09.485
everywhere, yeah.

00:39:09.485 --> 00:39:11.280
AUDIENCE: It might be
the intuitive physics

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.580
thing is justified.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.608
So it's better to see
the same stimulus.

00:39:15.608 --> 00:39:16.650
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:18.810
It's an instance of
this, exactly right.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:19.560
Exactly right.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.110
It gives us one
of our paradigms.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.660
In functional MRI studies,
have the same stimulus,

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.050
vary the task.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:27.128
OK?

00:39:27.128 --> 00:39:28.920
Some things don't work
as well, things that

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.030
are just very dominant stimuli.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.900
In this experiment, if we hadn't
put the faces in the periphery

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.900
and given subjects a
damn difficult task,

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.400
the modulation
wouldn't have worked.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.900
Because faces are
just so dominant,

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.990
they're going to punch through
even if you don't want to, OK?

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.597
Like web pop ups. You also--

00:39:44.597 --> 00:39:46.680
I'm going to skip this
because we won't have time.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.180
You could get very
similar things

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.000
in primary auditory cortex
listening to high frequencies

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.140
or low frequencies.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.800
These are all the same stimuli.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.860
This is voxel selected
for low frequencies, voxel

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.110
selected for high frequencies.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.940
You have a high frequency
input in one ear,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.080
low frequency in the other.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.210
As you switch between,
those responses toggle.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.390
OK, so all of that tells you
the effects of attention,

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:11.010
how it modulates activity
all over the brain.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:14.510
But what is the source of
attention signals in the brain?

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.370
And that source is
a set of regions

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:19.130
we have encountered
before, sometimes called

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.050
the frontal-parietal
attention network,

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.180
these blue and green
bits up in here,

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.840
back here in the parietal lobe,
up here in the frontal lobe.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.360
And they are active
when you shift attention

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.420
from one location to another,
from one feature to another,

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:36.260
or when you do any difficult
attention-demanding task.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.660
We've also talked about
them in the other context

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.070
of the multiple demand system.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.410
It's pretty much the same
set of cortical regions.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.840
That pretty much any time
you do a difficult task,

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.240
almost no matter what the task
is, these regions turn on.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.360
So they're not just
about visual attention.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.890
They're kind of about basically
controlling your mind, right,

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:59.810
selecting information, making
yourself do difficult things.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.910
Who knows what that
is computationally.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.330
But these regions are very
systematically engaged.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.550
And they're particularly
systematically engaged

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:10.970
when you're shifting attention
over different locations.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.280
OK, so just to remind you
in contrast, everything else

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.610
we've talked about, face areas,
music areas, language areas,

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:18.980
they're very specific
for one mental process,

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.940
domain specific.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.000
These are the opposite.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.690
They're ludicrously
domain general.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.280
OK?

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.580
All right, I'm going
to skip the video.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.500
When the system is
damaged bilaterally,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.360
all kinds of weird
stuff happens.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:33.860
OK?

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.580
I'll post this.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.500
If you guys send me
an email to remind me,

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.610
I'll post this clip in.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.550
Balint's syndrome, where
you have bilateral damage

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.440
back there in these
parietal regions,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.390
people can only see
one object at a time.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.890
OK?

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.230
They're looking at a
complicated thing like this.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.450
And they would see, I see Shosh.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.320
See anything else?

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.520
No just Shosh.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.390
Nothing else there?

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.890
No.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:54.680
Just Shosh, right?

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.340
Totally weird.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.170
Anyway, so they get
locked on one thing.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.030
They can't shift attention.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.550
OK.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.220
OK, I want to talk at least
briefly about awareness.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:09.780
So let's talk a little bit about
neural correlates of awareness.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:13.220
And so first question
is, if we want

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.990
to study perceptual awareness
and not just perception,

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.570
how are we going to
uncouple those things?

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.720
We've sort of talked about a
few examples with attention.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.940
With attention, the
thing you're attending to

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.220
is at least much more
dominant in your awareness

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.080
than the stuff you're
not attending to,

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.300
even if the other stuff
seeps in a little bit.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:39.470
So that's one way, where you
have the identical stimulus.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.140
But you were varying
the degree of awareness.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.737
But another way-- oh, I need you
guys to pass out the glasses.

00:42:45.737 --> 00:42:47.570
You want to both do
that at different sides?

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.517
OK, so I'm going to
show you a stimulus.

00:42:49.517 --> 00:42:51.350
These guys are going
to pass around glasses.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:52.940
And let me say in
advance, I want them back.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.900
I use these every year.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.822
So drop them off
here when you leave.

00:42:55.822 --> 00:42:58.280
OK, so what you're going to
do, you put them on either way.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.750
Doesn't matter.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.700
OK, so first, we're
going to do optics.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.260
Nothing interesting.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:07.430
So look at this stimulus
and close one eye.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.410
OK, now look at it
through the glasses.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.690
Look at it through the
glasses, and close one eye.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.630
And you should see just
a face or just a house.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:17.400
And if you close the other eye,
you should see the opposite.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.680
Does everybody get that?

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.910
OK, that's not psychology.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:20.750
That's optics.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.730
The glasses are just
filtering one image

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.385
into one eye and another
image into the other eye, OK?

00:43:26.385 --> 00:43:28.760
This is all this is is a way
to get different information

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.110
to your two eyes.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.690
OK, now just look
with both eyes.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:33.890
And don't do anything.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.270
Just kind of look.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:39.360
And if anything cool happens,
you can kind of go, ooh, aah.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.160
Or you can tell me
what's happening.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:45.910
Just watch.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.500
Doesn't always
happen immediately.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.774
Yeah, Kwylie, what's happening?

00:43:49.774 --> 00:43:51.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:51.490
NANCY KANWISHER: Sorry.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:51.990
What's that?

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.370
AUDIENCE: Every time I blink,
it changes from the house

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:54.870
to the face.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:55.920
NANCY KANWISHER: Aha.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.650
OK, it changes from the house
to the face only when you blink.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:43:59.265
Yeah, Kwylie?

00:43:59.265 --> 00:44:01.140
AUDIENCE: So at first
when I first put it on,

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:05.010
I was like I saw the house
and the face superimposed.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.690
And then you told
us put one eye.

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:09.945
And then I opened both eyes,
and it went from the house

00:44:09.945 --> 00:44:11.090
to the face.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.090
NANCY KANWISHER: Uh huh.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:12.660
Uh huh.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.785
And then did it stay there?

00:44:13.785 --> 00:44:16.080
Or does it keep flipping?

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.240
OK, if this is not working
for you, don't panic.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.532
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:44:19.532 --> 00:44:22.570
It's hard to get everybody's
red-green balance the same.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.070
Yeah.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:23.370
Sorry.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.040
Question?

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:24.740
Shardul, yeah?

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:29.550
NANCY KANWISHER: So I
share your intuition.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.870
I think I can choose too.

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:33.040
But there's actually a
whole literature on that.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.760
And the guy I was collaborating
with on this project,

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.220
20 years ago, insists
that, actually, that's

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.070
a wrong intuition.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:39.780
You can't choose.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.890
And I said, oh, the hell.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.290
The hell I can't.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.040
I'm in the scanner
being your best subject

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.810
ever because I'm
switching exactly when you

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:46.440
want me to switch.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.400
Don't tell me I can't switch.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.840
He said, no, the
literature says you don't.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.760
Anyway, I don't know
the latest on that.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.530
Yeah?

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.630
AUDIENCE: Kind of related,
it feels a lot harder

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.993
to see the house than the face.

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:56.910
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.970
AUDIENCE: I can see the face
a lot easier than switching.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:59.845
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.

00:44:59.845 --> 00:45:03.150
It's not optimally set up, so
that it's perfect for each.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.880
Really the reason I do this
is to amuse myself looking

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.030
at all of you with your--

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.680
thank you.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.262
OK, so you can keep
looking or not,

00:45:12.262 --> 00:45:14.220
but I'm going to tell
you what's going on here.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.290
The cool thing
about this is when--

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.230
if it didn't switch
for you, the person--

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.460
is there anybody for
whom it didn't switch?

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:21.960
One.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.150
OK, so maybe your color
vision or who knows what.

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:26.640
But anyway.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.610
OK, if it doesn't switch,
there's nothing wrong with you.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.090
The percept everyone else has is
it just flips every few seconds

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:34.140
from one to the other.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:34.980
OK.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.130
So what's cool about this
is, when it switches,

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.350
nothing changes on your retina.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.630
Only your state of
awareness changes.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:45.240
And that gives us
a wonderful lever

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.750
to study what goes on in the
brain when awareness switches,

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.690
unconfounded from the stimulus.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.680
OK?

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.470
It's like varying attention,
but it's more powerful.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:58.800
So of course, we put
people in the scanner.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.610
We put mostly me
and a few others.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:01.170
But anyway.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.030
We popped ourselves
in the scanner.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.010
We just taped these
things on our forehead,

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.090
nice low-tech experiment.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.980
And we looked at
that exact stimulus.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.030
OK?

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.670
And we scanned the
brain while people

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:15.300
sat there watching the
stimulus flip back and forth.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:15.960
OK?

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.630
So this is a stimulus
for the whole experiment.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:19.740
This is the percept.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.132
It switches back and forth.

00:46:21.132 --> 00:46:23.340
The subject has a little
button box, so they can say,

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.330
now I see the face.

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.930
Now I see the house.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.930
Now, of course, the choice
of a face and a house

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:29.520
was not random.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.470
Why did we choose
a face and a house?

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.150
So that we could
look at the response

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.250
in the FFA and the PPA.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.080
FFA loves faces, hates houses.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.820
PPA loves houses, hates faces.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.020
Perfect.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:40.950
Right?

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.540
So the question
is, are they going

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.450
to switch when your percept
switches, even though nothing's

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.040
changing on your retina?

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.660
What do you guys think?

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.480
Switch?

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:49.980
Switch?

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.140
How many people think
it's going to switch?

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.430
How many people think
it's not going to switch?

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:55.300
A few.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.420
OK, all right, so
that's what we did.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.990
Here is now the raw MRI time
course averaged over the FFA

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:05.800
and averaged over the PPA for
one five-minute experiment

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.630
or three-minute
experiment in one subject.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.170
Probably me.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:09.520
I forget.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.380
Again, stimulus is the
same the whole time.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.340
The letters are the times when
the subject pressed the button.

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.320
And you can sort of get
a sense that there's

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.770
a little bit of maybe like
here's a phase the FFA

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:21.940
response goes up.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.430
Here again the house goes up.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.140
But it's kind of hard to tell.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.420
So really, the way
to analyze these data

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:33.250
is to take all the face
to house flips, right,

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.770
and align them and signal
average to get rid of noise.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:37.270
OK?

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.710
So we can look at, what happens
before and after a switch

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.910
from face to house?

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:45.100
And what happens in the
opposite direction switch?

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.580
Everybody get the idea?

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.090
It's just a way to
clean up the noise here.

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.410
And here's what happens.

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:51.500
This is time zero.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.680
The subject presses
a button saying

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.280
that their percept has flipped
between a house to a face.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.620
The response in
the FFA shoots up.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:03.355
And the response in
the PPA shoots down.

00:48:03.355 --> 00:48:05.430
Isn't that cool?

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:10.860
OK, now why are these peaks and
valleys after the button press?

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:14.780
Yeah.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.320
Evan, right.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.450
There's a delayed signal, right?

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.640
OK?

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.630
This is harder.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:22.880
Why do they come back
together out there?

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.830
Yeah, because it flips back.

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:30.300
It flips back.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.270
And all we've done is signal
average to one button press.

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:35.320
But there are different
durations of percepts.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.900
Sometimes it lasts
three seconds.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.480
Sometimes it lasts 10 seconds,
everything in between.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.250
By the time you're
12 seconds out,

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.750
most people have flipped again.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.550
That's why it goes back.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:45.435
OK, make sense?

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:49.237
Yeah?

00:48:49.237 --> 00:49:05.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.290
NANCY KANWISHER: I don't know.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:09.050
And I'm not sure that
that was generally true.

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.670
I hadn't noticed that before.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.830
But we should
scrutinize the images.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:16.040
I can't actually remember if
this was averaged over subjects

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.150
or if this is one subject.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.530
I suspect that's a fluke.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.640
But we could look at it and see.

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.310
OK, so the point of all of this
is that these regions, the face

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:28.590
area and the place area,
care about what you

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.290
are experiencing,
unconfounded from what's

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:33.120
hitting your retina, right?

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.620
They are reflecting the
contents of your awareness,

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:41.370
not just what's coming into
your eyes, which is cool.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:45.430
OK, so that shows that
these regions kind

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:47.710
of track awareness.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:48.670
OK?

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:52.330
But can we find any
evidence for perception

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:55.630
without awareness
using neuroimaging?

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:56.560
OK?

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.230
So to make this point, I'm
going to accelerate slightly,

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:00.968
but I think there's
just barely time.

00:50:00.968 --> 00:50:03.010
There are lots and lots
of studies of this genre.

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.750
And I'll tell you about one.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:05.800
So I'm going to show you.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.110
I'm going to flash up a
very rapid series of digits.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.600
You have to get ready
to write stuff down.

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:15.610
Your task is to see if there
are any letters in the digit.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:16.480
There might be zero.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.200
There might be one.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:17.920
There might be a few.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.330
Write down any letters you see.

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.960
It's going to go by really fast.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.500
OK, everyone ready?

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.930
OK.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:26.500
Here we go.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.320
OK, write down any
letters you may have seen.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.180
OK?

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.640
All right, let's do another one.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.390
Everyone ready?

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:47.140
OK, write down any
letters you may have seen.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.480
OK?

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:52.560
OK, raise your hand if you
saw both the A and the P

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.030
in the first sequence.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.630
A few of you.

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:57.130
Less than half.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:00.100
Raise your hand if you saw both
the X and the H in the second.

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.600
Almost everyone.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.670
All right, well, I
cheated slightly.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:05.650
But never mind how I cheated.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:07.150
The way you cheat in demos--

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.950
you guys will be
teaching someday.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:11.630
You have the one you want
people to get wrong first.

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.610
It's a total cheat.

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:13.660
So it's slightly cheated.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.718
But if you do it right--

00:51:15.718 --> 00:51:16.760
it didn't work last year.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.635
That's why I cheated.

00:51:17.635 --> 00:51:19.510
Anyway, even if you do
it right in the lab,

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.540
you get a really strong effect.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.910
There was only one
digit between the A

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.950
and the P in the first sequence.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:29.620
And it's like your brain
is still dealing with the A

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.983
when the P comes along.

00:51:30.983 --> 00:51:33.400
You just don't even see the
P. You're looking for letters.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.750
You don't see it.

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.910
Whereas there were three
digits between the X

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:39.370
and the H in the
second sequence.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.930
And just to show
you some real data.

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.030
So this has been done
lots of different ways.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.090
Here's an example
of this experiment.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:50.738
And this is the time that people
get the second letter when they

00:51:50.738 --> 00:51:52.030
don't have to report the first.

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.350
Well, the first
one's colored, right?

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.480
So you either have to
report the colored letter

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.430
and detect the letter
after it or just

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.990
detect the letter after
the colored thing.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.120
So if you don't have to
report the first one,

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.530
there's no dip in accuracy.

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:04.030
Oh, sorry.

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:06.340
This is a function of the
distance between the two

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.000
items in the sequence.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.570
But if you do,
there's a big dip.

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:13.810
That's maximal with
one intervening item.

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:15.470
Yeah?

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:19.970
OK, well, here it
says two or three.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.370
But anyway.

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:24.525
OK, so that's called
the attentional blink.

00:52:24.525 --> 00:52:26.900
And the idea is there isn't
a physical blink of the eyes.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.793
But your attention
system is tied up

00:52:28.793 --> 00:52:29.960
processing the first target.

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.300
And it doesn't get
the second one, OK?

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.332
So there are dozens,
probably hundreds

00:52:34.332 --> 00:52:35.540
of papers on this phenomenon.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.190
It's pretty cool.

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:41.450
But for present purposes,
we're going to use it to say,

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:45.170
does that unseen second
target get into the brain?

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:46.610
Presumably, it
lands on the retina

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:47.808
because you didn't blink.

00:52:47.808 --> 00:52:49.100
So it could probably get there.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.210
Probably got to V1.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.930
How far up the
system did it get?

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:58.130
Can you think of how we might
test this using functional MRI.

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:02.090
How would we see how
far those stimuli

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:03.890
go in an experiment like this?

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:08.500
What would we use?

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.770
What would we measure
the MRI response to?

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:13.427
How could we design
a version of this

00:53:13.427 --> 00:53:15.010
that you could do
with functional MRI?

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:24.040
We need some MRI response,
where, if we get that response,

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.455
we know that it's a response
to a given stimulus.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.990
What would we measure?

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:33.250
And what stimuli would we use?

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:37.953
AUDIENCE: Well, we could
use faces or something.

00:53:37.953 --> 00:53:38.870
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:39.920
It's always the same.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.460
Yeah.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:41.930
Faces and houses.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:43.190
Lots of ways to do this.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:46.987
But it's not even my experiment,
and they used faces and houses.

00:53:46.987 --> 00:53:49.070
OK, so they did a version
of that very same thing.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:51.230
This is a bunch of
garbage flashing on.

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:52.470
Early on, there's a face.

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.345
The subjects have to
say which of those three

00:53:54.345 --> 00:53:55.920
faces they've studied it is.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.520
And then after that,
a scene comes on,

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.290
or it doesn't come on.

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:03.110
OK, they have to just
say, was there a scene?

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:04.790
First of all, which face was it?

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:07.350
And was there a
scene afterwards?

00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.000
OK, so it's a variant of
the thing you just did.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.810
So here's the behavioral data.

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:14.760
If you don't have
to report the face,

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.580
then you are very accurate
reporting the scene.

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.380
If you do have to
report the face,

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.980
then you're very bad at it if
the scene comes right after.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.690
But if there's a big
interval in between,

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:25.740
you do OK with the scene.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.260
Same thing we saw before but
now with faces and scenes.

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.390
OK, that's the behavioral data.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.700
What do you see
in the PPA, right?

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.920
The second target
is always a scene.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.500
So what you see
in the PPA, here's

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:42.090
a response in the PPA to that
second scene if it's a hit.

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:43.680
That is if you detect it, right?

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.500
You correctly say, yes, there
was a scene in that trial.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.490
Here's a response
with a correct reject.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:49.950
There was no scene
in that trial.

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.290
And you correctly
said there was not.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.110
OK, so that difference
shows you the response

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:58.320
in the PPA to a scene
that you've seen,

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.360
that you detected consciously.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.902
But here's a critical case.

00:55:02.902 --> 00:55:04.860
I don't know why there's
a little pop up there.

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.250
Anyway, this is a case
where there was a scene,

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:10.370
but you've said there wasn't.

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.870
OK?

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:11.745
That's called a miss.

00:55:11.745 --> 00:55:12.370
You missed it.

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:14.710
It was there, and
you didn't see it.

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:17.830
And what it shows you
is two cool things.

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:21.490
Well, first of all, it tells
you that the more aware you

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:24.010
are of the stimulus,
the stronger response.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:27.120
But the crucial
thing it shows you

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.880
is this difference right
here, which is significant.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.030
This is a kind of perception
without awareness.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.650
You did not detect the scene.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:36.000
You said there was no scene.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.850
But your PPA detected
the difference.

00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:40.930
Everybody get that?

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:42.900
So we have evidence
for perception

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.160
by the PPA at least of a
scene without awareness.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.730
That make sense?

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:51.650
So there are many, many
studies like this that kind of

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:52.650
take it every which way.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.630
This is just one
little example of how

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:58.200
you can use neuroimaging to
ask, how far up the system

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.110
does an unseen stimulus get?

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:03.430
Make sense?

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:05.800
OK, so we are about out of time.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.870
And I just gave
you a little taste

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.390
of some of the work on neural
correlates of awareness,

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:13.960
showed you, with binocular
rivalry, a neural response

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.410
that's correlated with awareness
unconfounded from the stimulus,

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:20.020
uncoupling, again, perceptual
awareness from what's

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:23.650
hitting your retina, and, in the
case of the attentional blink,

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:27.250
some evidence for
perceptual representation

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.150
without awareness.

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:30.700
OK?

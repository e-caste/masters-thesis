00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.700
ESTHER DUFLO: So actually
a lot of themes are

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.380
criss-crossing in this
documentary.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.330
It's pretty well done for
managing to bring many of

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.360
those teams up.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.550
So before we sort of I summarize
them, I'd like to

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.110
have your impression of what are
the themes that seem to be

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.370
important in like how the
students get educated, the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.030
government's decisions, the
parent's decision, et cetera?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.120
Yeah, Ben?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.038
AUDIENCE: Cultural
preservation.

00:01:06.038 --> 00:01:07.986
I forget the other one.

00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:10.430
It was the Kurds, and who's--

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.920
ESTHER DUFLO: Just the rest of
Turkey, mainstream Turkey.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.648
AUDIENCE: --mainstream Turkey
and how they're willing to

00:01:15.648 --> 00:01:18.872
preserve their culture, and how
that spill-over effects

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:21.360
[INAUDIBLE] how they operate
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.250
ESTHER DUFLO: Right, so one
issue that is kind of there is

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.250
whether the whole education is a
way to mainstream the Kurds,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.980
which they are suspicious
about.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.854
That's a good point.

00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:37.395
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was going
to say infrastructure, so

00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:40.252
actually physically getting the
schools becomes a problem.

00:01:40.252 --> 00:01:44.716
The guy mentioned like when it
snows, it becomes hard for the

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:47.692
children to get to school,
so they fall behind.

00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:50.668
And they have the desire to
become a boarding school, like

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:52.900
religious schools actually
in their village.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.130
But because they don't have
that, it becomes difficult.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.490
ESTHER DUFLO: Right.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190
So there is a supply
constraint.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.230
There are no schools in the
villages and getting to them--

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.350
they go by bus, but even that
is difficult, because

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.578
infrastructure is difficult.

00:02:04.578 --> 00:02:07.483
AUDIENCE: It can also to be hard
to find justification for

00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:10.987
this education, because although
some people argue

00:02:10.987 --> 00:02:13.921
that there is still value to it,
even if girls or boys who

00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:16.122
get educated just come back to
the village and live with

00:02:16.122 --> 00:02:18.567
their family, but a
lot of people say,

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:19.550
well, what is the point?

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.580
ESTHER DUFLO: So there
is a question of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.042
the benefits of education.

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:27.070
Yaprak's parents, what do they
think the benefit of education

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.470
is for her?

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.290
What do they expect from
the education?

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.790
AUDIENCE: For her to come back
and contribute to the family.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.880
ESTHER DUFLO: Is it what they
say, or is it someone

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.470
else who says that?

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.700
What do the parents say,
the mom, and then

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.722
Yaprak say it also.

00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:43.353
AUDIENCE: Her mom said
that she wanted

00:02:43.353 --> 00:02:45.200
her to become a doctor.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.420
ESTHER DUFLO: Her mom says she
wants her to become a doctor.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.875
She also wants to
become a doctor.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.690
And in fact there is this
debate where people are

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.790
saying, well, what's the point
of education if we don't have

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.510
a job that will take into
account this education?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.770
And there's this other guy who
says, well, even if she

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.840
doesn't become a doctor, there
are these other things.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.550
But it seems to have
a little bit of a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.030
minority view in this.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.250
You don't see any anyone asking
her the question, but

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.750
she answers, saying,
yeah, yeah, there

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.500
would be some value.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.740
But there's somewhat
of a debate there.

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:30.208
AUDIENCE: When you're talking
about supply, there's a lack

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.520
of supply of teachers
over there.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.122
So in particular regions, like
the eastern region for

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:38.160
example, teachers have
to go out into those

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.585
cultural sort of things.

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.020
They're coming from
different regions

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.560
where culture's different.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.156
And then at the same
time, they may not

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:46.376
particularly be there.

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:47.352
They're passing through.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:52.722
You mentioned that do we go to
train or to get experience in

00:03:52.722 --> 00:03:54.310
this way and them move on.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.530
So there's not sustainability.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.780
When you think about teaching,
it's important that teachers

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.205
build relationships
with students and

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:01.200
really pour into them.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.550
But when they're in this like
transit sort of mindset, it

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.760
becomes a little hard
to do that.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.290
ESTHER DUFLO: Right, so that's
another supply issue from the

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.020
supply side is whether there
are enough teachers.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.850
And then that kind of interacts
like it was a

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.980
cultural issue.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.339
Who were the teachers?

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.420
I think you're making
two points

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.500
that are both important.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.140
One is the point that the
teachers who are coming to

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.110
them may not be as motivated.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.550
They might not be accountable
to the community.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.900
They might be difficult
to discipline.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.620
They might not care.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.880
In addition, they might be the
ones who are trying to teach

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.820
in Turk and not and not in
Kurd, and all of that.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.830
So that brings the cultural
dimension.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.198
Yup?

00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:42.160
AUDIENCE: Another thing I didn't
realize whether or not

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.318
they mentioned in that movie.

00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:48.256
But there's a problem if all
these girls are actually

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:51.100
living in those boarding schools
for most of the week.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.766
And they're just going
back for the weekend.

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:57.160
You know, they don't have that
sort of family [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.790
that's going to actually
give them more balance.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.860
So even though they'll be
getting an education, there's

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.735
a huge drawback for the fact
that they don't have their

00:05:06.735 --> 00:05:08.452
parents right there and
telling them what

00:05:08.452 --> 00:05:09.120
they have to do.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.117
And nobody really knows
what that could

00:05:13.117 --> 00:05:14.470
cause in the long run.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.020
ESTHER DUFLO: Like you guys,
far from your families--

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.450
yeah, I think this sort of
comes a little bit in

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.030
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.970
when they have this debate about
I think they would like

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.810
to have the schools
in their villages.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.030
That don't like to send the
kids to boarding school.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.980
I think one issue is are the
kids mature enough to manage

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.000
in boarding school?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.840
And the other which
is in [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.810
of that, are they going
to become different?

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.620
Are they going to absolve these
values that these guys

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.090
are not necessarily
looking for?

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.560
There might also be a slight
conflict underlying this,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.220
where actually from the point
of view of the Turkish

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.970
government, who is trying
to make the Kurds

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.530
into regular Turks.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.595
It's actually a good
thing to get them

00:05:57.595 --> 00:05:59.150
away from the families.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.210
But from the point of the view
of the Kurd, that's kind of a

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.790
way of following
the exhibition.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.650
So that's one thing that goes
with education, which you find

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.140
in a lot of places.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.955
For example, there was a big
education drive in Indonesia

00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:18.530
that I'm going to talk
in a bit, which had

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.270
exactly the same idea.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.420
Education is about
imparting skills.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.950
It's also about imparting
a world view.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.560
And therefore that creates
conflict between the different

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.100
people who have different
ideas about what these

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.350
worldviews should be.

00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:41.725
AUDIENCE: Maybe also that those
parents talked about the

00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:43.186
lack of [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:49.040
practical things maybe teach
about agriculture [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.130
ESTHER DUFLO: Yes, so that goes
back to what is the value

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.760
of education?

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.700
What's the benefit
of education?

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.700
So it comes back to well, fine,
if she graduates and

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.290
becomes a doctor,
that's great.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.900
But if not, what has
education brought?

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.040
Maybe nothing.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.660
People might not necessarily see
the value of the education

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.670
that's imparted as being that
great, unless you can make it

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.590
to being a doctor, which would
be great, but is a

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.620
bit more of a leap.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.700
AUDIENCE: I just have
a question.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.814
So I figured how many children
were in the household.

00:07:18.814 --> 00:07:22.300
My understanding is that they
only send one to school, like

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.288
the impact that has on the
children who aren't in school.

00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:29.521
I know the mom at least said
that she wasn't happy as she

00:07:29.521 --> 00:07:32.780
would like to be [INAUDIBLE]
education [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.980
But is that mindset perpetuated
because you have a

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.980
child who's going to school kind
of puts you in further

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.480
[INAUDIBLE] your current
circumstances, which could

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480
pose another problem.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.280
ESTHER DUFLO: That's an
interesting question.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.410
For example, the sister
of this girl, Yaprak.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:49.790
what's her name?

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.210
Was [? Meemet. ?]

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.380
She wasn't in school, because
she was too old to benefit

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.850
from the compulsory education.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:05.940
So on the one hand, she gets
some indirect benefits,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.530
benefits from the fact that
Yaprak is educated.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.230
On the other hand, she also
gets like these education

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.680
envy, and feels that, oh, it
would have been great if I

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.950
could have been educated
myself.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.550
So that's an interesting
point.

00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:28.564
AUDIENCE: We kind of spoke about
this before, but just

00:08:28.564 --> 00:08:30.840
the idea of the value of
education and what are the

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.330
returns to it?

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.395
So when you're most poor, you're
just kind of raising

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:35.659
everything higher.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.669
When you think about education,
the returns are

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.520
going to be much farther off.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.810
This was sort of mentioned, but
you get to a certain point

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.646
and you need some education,
then after a while, it's kind

00:08:47.646 --> 00:08:49.505
of like, well, you'll probably
be more valuable if you just

00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:50.985
stayed home and helped
out around the house.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:59.600
There's a dichotomy, I guess,
between the social pressure

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.000
for education and the
home pressure to

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.435
help your family out.

00:09:04.435 --> 00:09:06.340
We need to eat tomorrow,
so this is a

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.940
little bit more important.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.060
You'll be able to go to school
when you feel like it, or when

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.780
you get a little bit older.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.302
Or maybe you won't need to go
to school because we need a

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:14.720
survivor now.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.610
ESTHER DUFLO: Right, so there's
another cost of that

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.290
in the cost of getting yourself
to school, and that

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.880
now the government is paying for
the bus, and is paying for

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.830
the school, et cetera.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.870
But there is another cost, which
is in economic jargon we

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.950
call the opportunity cost,
which is while you're in

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.280
school, you're not helping
out on the house.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.270
And that is something that is
mentioned in the movie at some

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.510
point, where they're saying,
well, that's kind of one

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.170
reason why people are not
complying to the objectives.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.940
People are feeling that they
are getting on their house.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.620
And you said it exactly right.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.880
There is a trade off.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.540
Even if you don't bear the
direct cost of schooling like

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.110
is the case here, there is
a trade off between the

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.620
opportunity cost, when you're
losing the value of the child

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.410
work now, and the benefits
that are far out in the

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.110
future, potentially very far out
in the future if you think

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.430
that it's worth getting an
education, only if you can

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.518
become a doctor.

00:10:07.518 --> 00:10:09.718
AUDIENCE: I was going to say, if
the child goes back to the

00:10:09.718 --> 00:10:12.505
village, then they just wasted
their time, essentially, if

00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:13.880
they weren't helping out.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.610
ESTHER DUFLO: So that is the
debate that they have at some

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.740
point, which is at least some
people feel that if you go

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.000
back to the village, you
just wasted your time.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.980
So the only value is
to being a doctor.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.400
And at the same time they
realize that it's not super

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.750
likely that it happens.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.410
And then in general, if someone
says that it's easier

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.950
for men than for women to get
jobs outside the village,

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.060
there might be the other point
I made earlier, that they

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.080
might not want the girls
to really leave to

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.570
be outside the village.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.480
They might accept for them to
leave to be a doctor, but they

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.460
might be less likely to let them
leave to man a register

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.950
in a supermarket, which maybe is
a job you could get with a

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.100
good education without
continuing.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.287
And so if you're not going to
leave the village to take that

00:11:04.287 --> 00:11:07.690
job, and they feel that there
is no value in between, then

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.720
you would have no reason to
pay the opportunity cost.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.780
So that's where kind of this
debate or tension comes up.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.646
Is any of it valuable?

00:11:18.646 --> 00:11:22.410
Or is it only valuable if I
achieve a sufficient amount to

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.430
really get like the lottery
ticket of having a chance to

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.680
become a doctor.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:37.490
So what does this bring, this
idea that the benefits of

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:45.310
education may or may not be
obtained from the first years

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.420
of education?

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.230
We might be able to obtain
them only if

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.290
we get enough education.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.430
What does that remind you
of that we have seen?

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.170
It's that idea of the S shape.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.880
So the question, and here,
again, at this level, as usual

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.750
it's a question.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.440
Is there S shape in education?

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.475
So are the first few years of
education valuable, because

00:12:11.475 --> 00:12:14.360
you learn how to socialize.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.250
That's what they said
in the movie.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.190
You learn how to socialize.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.660
You learn family planning.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:22.190
You learn maybe to read the
instruction in the packet of

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.700
fertilizer for when you
come back to the farm.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.310
So there might be reason to
think that even the first

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.920
years of educations
would be valuable.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.310
Or is it the case that the first
year of education are

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.606
not really valuable, that the
only thing that's worth it is

00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:37.410
a college education.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.180
And the first year of education,
all that gives you

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:46.910
is the option value of going to
high school and college if

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.150
you want to.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.820
The latter case is a case where
there is an S shape.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.910
So unless you get enough
education, it's not worth it.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.870
At the former case is a case
where there is no S shape.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.300
And so one empirical question is
whether it's actually an S

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.720
shape or it's actually
not an S shape.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.160
Another empirical question,
of course, is the value of

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.000
education, whatever the
shape the overall

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.670
level of the benefits.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.180
And the third question is what
people are thinking?

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.200
Because even if it's in fact
linear, if people think that

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.080
it's actually S shape,
then it's going to

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.193
influence their behavior.

00:13:24.193 --> 00:13:27.990
And it's going to influence
the choice

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.470
that they are making.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.195
So for example here, they have
all these discussions about is

00:13:32.195 --> 00:13:36.390
it even worth it to send the
kids to school or not.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.170
And they never question the fact
that it would be great if

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.780
she could become a doctor.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.200
But they might question the
fact that there might be a

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.050
value of anything below
being a doctor.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.245
Is there anything else that
comes out of this?

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.842
Yeah?

00:13:55.842 --> 00:13:57.270
AUDIENCE: I think Ben
might have talked.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.130
I heard him say something
about cultural--

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.083
but just the idea of the head
scarves, the preventing of the

00:14:04.083 --> 00:14:08.075
girls from going to school,
and then the idea of Kurds

00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:14.063
being assimilated as opposed to
being integrated in a way

00:14:14.063 --> 00:14:16.059
that helps them maintain
their culture.

00:14:16.059 --> 00:14:18.055
Again, that's something
that would deter me

00:14:18.055 --> 00:14:19.080
from going to school.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.850
ESTHER DUFLO: Right, so that's
kind of the convex combination

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.230
of the two points, Ben's point
and the point about once you

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:31.950
send them to boarding school,
they're not under your thumb.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.210
You can't check what they are
doing anymore, which is

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.315
reinforcing in Turkey that's
it's not allowed to wear a

00:14:39.315 --> 00:14:41.170
head scarf in school.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.390
So from the beginning, there
is a conflict there.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.590
Is school aware of
indoctrinating the kids away

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.890
from what you would like, under
the guise of providing

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.090
them with valuable skills
in the labor market?

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.460
And there is certainly some
amount of that, to be honest,

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.088
that's actually said by them.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.110
The only thing we missed
from the movie--

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.620
well, we might have missed a bit
more-- but the only piece

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.510
we missed that I remember and
is worth pointing out is the

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:21.900
woman with the hair like that
who speaks with this very posh

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.430
English accent, the columnist
from The Economist.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.180
She has the last word.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.970
And she mentions one thing that
might be worth pointing

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.220
out, which is this is compulsory
education.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.210
This drive to compulsory
education was very much of a

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.090
top down intervention, was done
without any consultation,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.400
or anybody, which is done.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.360
And the way the schools are run
is run in this completely

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.680
centralized way, with a
centralized curriculum, with

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.170
the teachers appointed from the
center, the kids driven to

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.920
boarding school, et cetera.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.130
And she says that that's not
going to work, that people are

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:06.270
not going to accept or not going
to really be in the mood

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.870
or thought to be really groovy
about the whole education

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.200
thing, unless they're
given some autonomy

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.210
in running the schools.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.460
So that's an important point,
because that's the point that

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:23.470
many people make, that any
effort at top down education

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.610
will meet some resistance
from the people.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.950
They might still go because
they have to go, but the

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.340
parents won't be very engaged.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.760
The children won't
be very engaged.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.610
The teachers might not
be very engaged.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.900
And nothing will happen.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.020
So we keep that in mind.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.600
I'm channeling her, because I
want to keep that in mind as

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.120
we have the discussion.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.480
Because this tension between
education, board-funded top

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:55.940
down, and education, emerging
from the bottom up, is one of

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.865
the central debates
in education.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.660
So I think you guys said a
lot of the things that I

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.420
wanted to touch on.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.119
Let me kind of make sure that
we have everything together.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:15.609
So the stories of a Kurdish
girl who goes to boarding

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.069
school after education was made

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.800
compulsory until grade eight.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.869
So many important themes
appear in the movie.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.180
I think we mentioned them.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.540
One are all the questions about
the supply of education,

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.470
so that seems to have been a
constraint before this big

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.280
education push from the Turkish
government and still

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.750
is a constraint.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.680
There is no schools in
the remote villages.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.860
The roads are bad.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.920
Transportation is difficult.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.260
There is a shortage of
well-trained teachers.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:56.110
Therefore there is a large class
size, and the teachers

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.030
are moving, what you were saying
about the teachers

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.800
coming from far away not being
necessarily the best teacher,

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.050
most motivated teacher.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.950
For part of the international
community, these types of

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.760
constraint are the only thing
you have to worry about.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.755
I think you guys have all seen
a picture of a little African

00:18:19.755 --> 00:18:22.790
girl in a village saying, that
if only she had a school, she

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.400
would study until she would
become a doctor.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.540
So there is a whole branch of
the international community,

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.390
governments, et cetera, for whom
the only problems with

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:38.280
education are supply problems,
and if only we could get rid

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.270
of the supply problem and make
sure there are enough

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.080
well-trained teachers, then the
kids would go to school.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.250
They would learn something
in school.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.400
And they would all
be very educated.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.490
So the problem is a problem of
fixing the supply constraint.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.460
But what we see in the movie is
that these are not the only

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.610
constraints.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.010
So the reason why it's relevant
is that a lot of the

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.620
international community, a lot
of the policy was in aid.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.700
And the policies implemented
by the government have that

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.610
flavor in mind, which is let's
fix the supply problem.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.870
So for example, a lot of African
countries have gotten

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.900
rid of school fees completely to
make sure school was free.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.160
You go to a country like Kenya,
and there is a school

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.300
every 25 meters, because every
community who wants a school

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.600
can gets one.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.100
So there is plenty of schools.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.090
In some sense, one could say too
many schools in that the

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.410
class size is actually quite
small at the top.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:40.550
And in India, it's
the same thing.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.640
India is debating a right to
education, where if you don't

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.770
have a school right near your
village, you can get one.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.440
But what we see in the movie
is that it's not the supply

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.810
constraint, not having a school
near you, et cetera, is

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.060
not the new problem.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.360
In fact, Turkey is not only
building schools, and building

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.180
these boarding schools, and
having kids travel in

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.840
minibuses to go to the school,
they also made education

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.730
compulsory.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.410
And if the only problem was
supply, then making education

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.900
compulsory would not
be necessary.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.850
You would put the schools there
and people would be

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.170
delighted to go.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:24.610
And you wouldn't need
any compulsion.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.670
In fact, Turkey decided that the
only way that they could

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.117
get a fast increasing education
was to make

00:20:31.117 --> 00:20:32.880
education compulsory.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.730
So implicitly, there is the
argument that, well, maybe

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.240
people would not want to
go to all the schools.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.710
So there must be a demand
constraint as well.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.280
There must be a lower demand
for education.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.250
So what constrained them?

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.300
We mentioned that.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.240
One is no economic resources.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.000
So they don't have money.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.400
So this in principle, the direct
cost of education can

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.640
be compensated by making
education free by paying for

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.720
books, by paying for
transportation.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.580
But there is also the need
for child labor.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.780
It was mentioned in the movie.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.160
The kids who are in school are
not helping on the farm.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.910
Then there is the need to get
married, which was mentioned

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.580
by Yaprak's sister.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.920
She says, now I need
to get married.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.640
And you can be married and
in boarding school.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.190
In principle you could, but it's
not very frequent that

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.430
you would be both married
and in boarding school.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.650
So this is not a cost effect.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:36.330
This is something which
is more about culture.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.120
Maybe the husband wants
a young wife.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.300
Or there is something different
than just a strict

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.480
opportunity cost effect.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.820
Like, why do they think that
it's important to get married

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.960
early instead of continuing
schooling?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.070
So these are only important
because they're mentioned.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.590
And there are the benefits.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.940
Is it useful?

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.540
Or is it useful only if you
get enough education?

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.040
If it's useful, do parents
know that it is useful?

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.225
What do they expect
of education?

00:22:08.225 --> 00:22:11.130
Do they expect that education
is making their child

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.020
generally better at
living their life?

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.190
I'll do they see
education as--

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.710
the woman employs a term that
is interesting-- it's almost

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.090
like a foreign currency.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.010
So people see your education
diploma.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.640
Do you see that as something
that if you get enough of it,

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.710
you can actually sell
to the market?

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.730
What is enough?

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.490
Is it a foreign currency that
you could get a few cents of

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.650
and that would be good enough?

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.080
Or is it a foreign currency that
you need a big packet of

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.540
to be worthwhile?

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.660
And in the movie, what was
interesting was is that we saw

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.780
different people having
different views about whether

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.170
it is a foreign currency, that
is, you have to take it

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.840
elsewhere to benefit from it?

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.560
Whereas you could also benefit
from it just in your general

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.230
my life, with having fewer,
healthier children, being more

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.480
socialized?

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.660
I think it's again Yaprak
sister who sees another

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.510
advantage of education for girls
in that it is going to

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.660
increase her bargaining power
within the family.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.610
Since traditionally girls are
quiet and don't say anything

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.280
and men have all the power, and
if girls get education,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.540
that is going to improve
their bargaining

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.470
power within the family.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.050
And that is something that girls
may find very attractive

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.000
and their future husbands might
find less attractive.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.720
And here the question
is what are the

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.020
fathers going to think?

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:43.020
Yaprak's father, on the one
hand, probably he has in mind

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.170
the value of keeping the
girls in their place.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.230
On the other hand, he
likes his daughter.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:53.250
So there is probably a conflict
within him between

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:57.810
the fact that as a man, he
doesn't want to conflict with

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.140
his wife, so we would rather
the woman being lower down,

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.750
but as a father probably likes
his daughter more than his son

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.360
in law, who doesn't
even exist yet.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.900
So there might be a conflict
here in his preferences which

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.420
might easily lead him to say,
fine, she should get an

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.160
education or no, we want
to move forward.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.690
And what is interesting in the
movie is that he clearly sees

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.150
himself as a bit of a
[INAUDIBLE] leader and a

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.100
modern character.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:32.530
So he seemed to have concluded
this debate from his point of

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.276
view to say that OK,
I'll send her.

00:24:36.276 --> 00:24:37.698
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:24:37.698 --> 00:24:41.077
I'm wondering with that attitude
if it's sort of like

00:24:41.077 --> 00:24:44.973
we'll just indulge the girls for
a while and let them go to

00:24:44.973 --> 00:24:48.869
school, but we know secretly
that we're still going to take

00:24:48.869 --> 00:24:53.252
the power we have and not
actually concede anything and

00:24:53.252 --> 00:24:55.210
respect the fact that
they [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.900
ESTHER DUFLO: Right, so there
might be a little bit of that.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.420
So just to repeat the question,
the question was,

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.490
are they just indulging them
for a little while and then

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.315
going to bring them
back in line?

00:25:06.315 --> 00:25:09.790
And then education is more
like it's not seen as an

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.480
investment anymore, but more
consumption value for the

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.850
girl, since the government is
providing it for free and

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.340
she's kind of a bit too
young to be really

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.790
helpful in the farm.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.580
Let's get her get an education,
but we kind of know

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.970
that at the end of the
day, it's not going

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.300
to change her life.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.670
And we certainly maybe hope that
it's not going to change

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.650
her attitude.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.020
What's interesting is that if
this is what people had in

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.480
mind is that that's clearly
not her view.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.100
So that might be a little bit
of disconnect here, which

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.590
would be in her advantage
in terms of when

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.700
she gets the education.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.580
So here if we're thinking of
these bargaining power issues

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.600
and this potential conflict
withing the father between his

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.990
goal as a husband where he wants
to keep the power, and

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.260
his goal as a father, where he
would like probably her to

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:03.780
have some power, is that that
may change with economic goals

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.430
in the society and what are the
opportunities he sees for

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:10.810
her to do something with
the education.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.900
If the society's completely
paralyzed, then in a way the

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.540
benefits of education are very
high for her, so he has less

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.165
of a reason to want
to go to it.

00:26:20.165 --> 00:26:22.350
AUDIENCE: Just from watching the
video, it seems like it is

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.179
possible for them to combine
both the cultural values and

00:26:25.179 --> 00:26:26.040
the value of education.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.320
Like for instance, clearly it
is a male-dominated society,

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.918
but here we watch the scenes
where there's a bunch of men,

00:26:33.918 --> 00:26:35.060
sitting around, and
they're talking

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:35.970
the value of education.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.735
It's still the women who
are serving them tea

00:26:37.735 --> 00:26:39.130
or whatever it was.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.152
And they still see the women,
the girl who is getting the

00:26:42.152 --> 00:26:44.000
education, she's still
helping with the

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.346
children and all that.

00:26:45.346 --> 00:26:47.300
So it seems like--

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.210
ESTHER DUFLO: Yeah, it is
possible that even with the

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:53.960
education they are still going
to maintain the differences.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.210
What is interesting is that
there is a level question and

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.610
a slope question, which is it
is possible that the girls

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:05.280
have so far to go that getting
an education wouldn't be

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.930
sufficient to make them
become equal.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.940
But that would still go
in that direction.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.680
And at least some of them seem
to have the hope that it would

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.580
bring it in that direction.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.600
But you're right.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.630
So those are the expected
benefits of education.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.500
And then there is what worries
them about the schools.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.370
We've mentioned the culturalized
assimilation, the

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:32.070
fact that it might be like a
covert way to assimilate them

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.900
to a culture that's not theirs,
and the fact that

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.440
maybe there are no benefits, the
fact that just if sending

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.810
the kids away is not
a very good thing.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:47.160
Potentially they are
worried about them.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.780
So these are the
demand issues.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.160
So the demand issues are a
little bit tricky, because

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.640
depending on how this thing
balances out, what are the

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.330
benefits they see versus the
feel they have versus the

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.600
immediate cost of not having
the kids on the farm.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.990
Or the decision of sending the
kids or not sending the kids

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.160
is not obvious, even if
education is free.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.550
And making education compulsory,
of course, pushes

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.800
them in that direction.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.620
So is benefits of education that
are touched upon in the

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.030
movie are of different kinds.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.810
There is this foreign currency
idea-- you get a job.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.390
You get a higher wage.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.240
They hope that the girl is
going to be a doctor.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.850
So the issue is can everybody
become a doctor?

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.770
And probably not.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.910
So even though they don't say
it in the movie, they must

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.350
have in the corner of their mind
that they're not quite

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.790
sure that she's going
to make it.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.550
They sort of say it, but they're
not quite sure it's

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.640
going to make it.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.930
And that uncertainty and the
fact that the objective is so

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.670
hard certainly has some impact
in how serious it is to take

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.930
the whole thing.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:29:01.080
And then there is the
possibility that just getting

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.920
an education would help in
your job, doing your job

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.990
better, even if your job
is to be a farmer,

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.410
coming back to the farm.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.480
And nobody seems to
really say that.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.560
It's only mentioned in a
negative way, which is if only

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.080
they taught something useful
like home economics then maybe

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.870
we would be able to have some
benefits of this education.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.140
But that's not what
they are doing.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.100
And so maybe education is
useless or is seen as being

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.050
useless at the lower level.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.990
Then there are the non-monetary
dimensions of

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.450
getting an education.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.830
Girls will become
more socialized.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.500
The family planning, they'll
have more friends and know how

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.310
to interact with people in
the city, et cetera.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.630
And then there is the idea of
learning things that you can

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:46.910
teach others.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.290
So the one guy who has an
college education in these

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.475
men's discussion, he goes and
say, well, let them get an

00:29:52.475 --> 00:29:55.530
education, come back, and
teach us some stuff.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:30:00.210
And so this is the external
spill-over value of education,

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.100
which is the opposite than the
one that Ben had mentioned,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.430
which was the education envy.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:08.220
But it's the idea that if I get
an education, if there is

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.770
some benefits, for example,
I learn how to read the

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.330
instructions on the fertilizer
package, maybe I learn to use

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.440
new technology in agriculture,
not only it can be useful for

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.450
me, but potentially it can
be useful for others.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.810
So if that is the case, a
village might decide to focus

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:28.180
on the smartest kids on the
block and make sure that they

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.230
at least get an education so
that everybody benefits.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.770
So those are kind of the
benefits of education.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.820
So one empirical question
is what are the

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.870
real benefits of education?

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.290
The other empirical question is
what are people perceive to

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.540
be the benefits of education?

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.705
Another thing that he touched
upon in the movie is this top

00:30:49.705 --> 00:30:51.870
down versus bottom up.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:56.260
So here the government is
trying a big top down

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.750
approach, trying to
do it very fast--

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.890
putting all the money from the
top, making it compulsory,

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:05.370
which is the ultimate top
down, and instead of

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.840
supply-drive policy, has been,
as I was saying, popular in

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.180
many countries.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.260
Many African countries--

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.630
Kenya, Uganda, Ghana--

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:18.070
have recently, relatively
recently, in the last 10 years

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.780
or so, have adopted free primary
education and moving

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.680
to free secondary
education now.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.890
India, as I was saying, has a
right to education, which

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.240
actually allowed people, in
principle, to sue the

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.610
government if they don't
get a school.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:45.400
So the supply drives have been
the main education policy say

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.800
in the last three decades.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:53.720
The Millennium Development
Goal specified that every

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.630
child should get at least a
basic education, basic goes to

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.960
nine years of education.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.430
What is interesting is that
there is no mention anywhere

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.805
that they should actually learn

00:32:03.805 --> 00:32:05.300
anything in those schools.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.450
It's sort of assumed that if
they get nine years of

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.520
education they'll get
something out of it.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.740
But as we'll see, it's a
pretty big assumption.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.360
And there are certainly some
clear signs success of these

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.580
big supply drives.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.650
Between 1999 and 2006, the
enrollment rates have

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:29.350
increased, in Sub-Saharan Africa
from 54% to 70%, in

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.270
East and Southeast Asia
from 75% to 88%.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.380
These are primary
schools only.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.960
Secondary school enrollments
have also increased, even

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.980
though secondary school is much
more expensive, much more

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.240
difficult to do for
governments.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.330
So worldwide, there are still
a bunch of millions of kids

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.420
who are not in school, but much
less in 2006 than they

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.350
were in 1999.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.660
So is it all worthwhile?

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.190
That's the question that
Easterly is asking in the

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:01.830
reading for today.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.080
And what is his answer?

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.690
His answer is not that graph.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.710
AUDIENCE: I thought education
in itself, an increase in

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.000
education, is not going to cause
and increase in growth.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.260
ESTHER DUFLO: Right.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.660
He is saying it's useless.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:26.620
And how does he explain that
despite the fact that it's

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.997
used less people have
still done it?

00:33:28.997 --> 00:33:30.781
Yeah, go ahead.

00:33:30.781 --> 00:33:32.585
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:32.585 --> 00:33:34.312
ESTHER DUFLO: Go ahead,
go ahead.

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:38.240
AUDIENCE: I was going to say
because the increments in the

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:41.920
ESTHER DUFLO: Exactly.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:48.350
So what Easterly is saying is
that you guys have been fooled

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.600
by this graph.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.820
These are countries--

00:33:53.820 --> 00:34:03.980
USA, Romania, Paraguay,
Venezuela.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.870
And these are the average years
of schooling of the

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.880
population.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.770
And this is the log output per
worker, relative to the US.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:16.200
So everybody is negative because
the US is a richer

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.949
country in the world.

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.500
And what you can see here is
that there is a pretty strong

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:27.460
correlation between the log
output per worker and the

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.610
years of schooling.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:29.750
Countries which have
more years of

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.150
schooling are also richer.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:37.420
So one could conclude from there
that year of education

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.310
increases income.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.909
And people have certainly
drawn this conclusion.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:46.193
What is his point about
this graph?

00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:56.073
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure this is
the point but, it's the idea

00:34:56.073 --> 00:34:57.555
of mobility bias.

00:34:57.555 --> 00:35:03.236
We have more education, perhaps
that's because we have

00:35:03.236 --> 00:35:04.471
some sort of mobility.

00:35:04.471 --> 00:35:05.953
I mean, I don't know
if this is--

00:35:05.953 --> 00:35:06.447
ESTHER DUFLO: This
is countries.

00:35:06.447 --> 00:35:08.045
AUDIENCE: --in the
national sense.

00:35:08.045 --> 00:35:11.140
ESTHER DUFLO: Think of it's like
he made this argument,

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.780
not for a person, but
for a country.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.926
What's different about these
countries as well?

00:35:18.926 --> 00:35:21.878
AUDIENCE: They also
have more greed.

00:35:21.878 --> 00:35:25.322
Their GDPs are higher, so
they have some more

00:35:25.322 --> 00:35:26.310
opportunity for school.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.280
ESTHER DUFLO: Yes,
they are more

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.840
flourishing for younger people.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:34.320
We run this graph with
the number of

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.730
football team you have.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.140
You would have a
lot of zeroes.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.250
It wouldn't be such
a good graph.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.900
But you would have the same
relationship that places that

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.200
play American football
are also richer.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.236
And we don't think it's because
of American football.

00:35:50.236 --> 00:35:52.273
Or I mean I don't think so.

00:35:52.273 --> 00:35:55.500
You may have a different view.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.300
So that correlation is
not very informative.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.480
So what he's suggesting
is to say, so

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.400
let's not look in levels.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.982
Let's look in differences.

00:36:05.982 --> 00:36:08.270
And I couldn't find such a
nice looking graph for

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.650
differences, but here is one.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:18.220
Now we have the difference in
human capital from it's 1990

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.990
minus 1965.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:26.210
It's a difference in the log
other ideas of education.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.096
And now we put the log
difference in income.

00:36:32.096 --> 00:36:35.560
You could do it in level log,
except that doesn't matter.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.170
What's relevant in this graph
is you get a big cloud of

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.250
points and a completely
horizontal line.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:45.050
So if I can say this graph in
words, what this is saying is

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:49.220
that the countries which have
increased the most the average

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.270
years of education of their
labor force, are the countries

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:57.380
which have put more and
more kids to school

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.800
have not become richer.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:06.630
So you compare in the Easterly
reading, he had a comparison

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.110
between different African
countries which had made

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.170
different levels of progress--

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.770
so I think, so for example,
Ghana versus Madagascar, and

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.490
saying that Ghana has increased
education more,

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:19.980
Madagascar increased education
more, and Ghana is not going

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.365
faster than Madagascar.

00:37:21.365 --> 00:37:23.010
Actually, I don't think
that's true anymore.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.210
I think subsequent to that,
Ghana has increased quite good

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.350
and quite a bit faster
than Madagascar.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.970
But that's, let's say,
was the point, were

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:32.875
the keys at the time.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.980
So now we interpret him saying,
well, when we take the

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.800
difference out, now we are at
least seeing what has been the

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.090
effort terms of increasing the
years of education, versus the

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.300
gain in terms of increasing
the GDP.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.990
And we see no effect.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:53.370
So the level relationship was
all coming from this bias In

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.990
fact, there's no effect of
the years of education.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:00.420
And the bias in the level of
regression are some form of

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:07.210
the ability by us as USA which
countries have more education,

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:12.790
because it takes money
to have teachers.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.380
They can afford it.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.870
Or maybe they choose to be
educated because when it's

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.880
more worthwhile to get an
education if you can do

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.470
something with that education.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.280
So that comes back to this
argument of what's the point

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.300
of getting an education if
you're going to come back to

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.060
the village anyway?

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:34.080
So if education allows you
to take advantage of the

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.920
opportunities that are afforded
by economic growth,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.870
then you're going to be more
willing to get an education if

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.380
you think that the country
is going to grow a lot.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.450
So for all these reasons, and
you would expect more

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.630
education in rich countries, not
because education causes

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.860
growth, but because growths
cause education.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.930
So his conclusion is that
internationally driven

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:58.425
investment to education were
a waste, that education is

00:38:58.425 --> 00:39:01.020
actually useless.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.320
Now there's a bunch of problems
with his argument,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.190
because in a sense what he is
saying is that I don't see any

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:11.680
evidence across country that
there is a lot of increase in

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.170
GDP coming from increasing
education.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.210
But the issue is we don't
know why these

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.640
countries increase education.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.250
We don't know what would have
happened if they had not

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.930
increased education.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.940
So for example, many of the
African countries that

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.420
increased education the most
also had severe civil war

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.330
subsequently.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.050
It is possible that education
caused the civil war, but it's

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:33.440
not very likely.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.040
It is more likely that the
social tension that preexisted

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.440
in the country caused
the civil war.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.300
One possible answer to the
social tension may have been,

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.410
well, let's try and get
people an education.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:49.310
Yep?

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.930
AUDIENCE: This is interesting
because I guess in our

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:56.220
standard macro classes, you
look at a factor of A as a

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.860
multiplicative factor that
increase in GDP.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.572
And typically, maybe I'm
thinking about it wrong, you

00:40:02.572 --> 00:40:05.790
look at that as if you have
increased education, it could

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.770
be worth more innovation.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.400
If you have the technology, you
still go for the forms or

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.150
operating a computer.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:15.650
And education helps facilitate
that group.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:19.800
So I'm a little confused as to
how you make this conjecture.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.266
ESTHER DUFLO: So that's
an interesting fact.

00:40:22.266 --> 00:40:27.230
I think in a sense, in your
macro class you may have been

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.480
interpreting this graph.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.180
And there is certainly a lot of
theories for why education

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.680
would be good for growth.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.350
So one of them is the
one you point out.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.860
This is the externality argument
that we were making

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.900
about the movie.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:51.160
One person who is educated can
figure out some technology,

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.890
and then everybody can
use the technology.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.800
So they are all these
spill-overs, which is why we

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.385
would get this pretty strong
relationship between education

00:40:57.385 --> 00:40:58.320
and income.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.740
So there a lot of theoretical
reasons to think that there

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.355
could be a macroeconomic
relationship between education

00:41:03.355 --> 00:41:04.560
and income.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.070
And in fact, we see one, which
is why everybody is happy

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.070
thinking education
is a good thing.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:14.110
What Easterly is saying is just
commenting on this graph,

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.670
which is he doesn't see
a relationship.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.665
Because when he does, the
relationship in differences

00:41:18.665 --> 00:41:22.690
now between growth and education
and growth and

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.620
income, he doesn't see the
relationship anymore.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.970
AUDIENCE: How long is that?

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:30.160
ESTHER DUFLO: That's 1990, 1965,
just about 30 years.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.050
Yup?

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.490
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.775
In Easterly's paper,
he mentions the

00:41:34.775 --> 00:41:38.170
productivity factor.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.917
And he says that only a small
percentage of this is

00:41:40.917 --> 00:41:44.257
accounted for by [INAUDIBLE]
capital and by machinery and

00:41:44.257 --> 00:41:45.990
other forms of capital.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.970
What is the rest of it?

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.445
Like, what is productivity
in that case?

00:41:50.445 --> 00:41:53.380
ESTHER DUFLO: So that's
an excellent question.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.025
The answer to this question is
that's what I do what I do and

00:41:57.025 --> 00:41:59.120
not macroeconomics.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.330
If you're looking at growth
across country, and you're

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:08.480
trying to account for the growth
in an pure accounting

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.900
sense, which is to say, so
imagine that you each country

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.660
is a big machine.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.870
Think of a country
as a machine.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.760
So there is a machine.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.010
There are some people to operate
the machine, labor.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.300
And there is some human capital
to think about how to

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.410
operate the machine.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.860
And then there is some spunk.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.790
So think of a macroeconomy
as that.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:38.720
In letters, we write it as an A
multiplied by K, that's the

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.660
capital, to some power, multiply
by L to some power,

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.160
multiply by human capital
to some power.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.870
That's your macroeconomic
model of an income.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.580
We can observe K
to some extent.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.440
What's the capital
in the economy?

00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.480
We can observe L to a pretty
good extent, how many workers

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.830
there are in the economy.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:05.420
We can observe H to some extent,
what is the the human

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.235
capital, usually measured
with education.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.880
And the rest spunk is what
we don't observe.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:20.450
Now we can say, well, let's
look at what share of the

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:24.360
level of income of the country,
differences in income

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.520
across country, are what share
of differences in growth

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.100
across country are explained
by those factors.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.010
And the answer is
not very much.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.360
So the answer is that we use
factors such as capital,

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.070
labor, and human capital,
measured in this way.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.220
We don't explain much
of the gross

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.040
differences across country.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.860
This is one of the reasons why,
which when you look at

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.250
growth and you look at the
differences in human capital,

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.350
there's just no relationship.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.910
There's a bit more with
physical capital.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.500
And the rest is like,
we don't know.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.210
So technological progress is
just a fancy term for we have

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:05.670
no clue what the hell is going
on, which is to me saying that

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.160
well, if we have no clue what
the hell is going on, then it

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.060
means that we need to go beyond
thinking of the economy

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.280
as one big machine.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.950
And we need to start to
understand what is happening.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:16.890
Look at micro level.

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:21.010
That might start giving us a
sense of what might actually

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:22.120
be going on.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:27.230
Because technological progress
is not just how good is the

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.070
chip in your computer.

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:33.250
You think of this as, as I was
saying, the spunk, how people

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:34.548
interact, all of that.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:46.640
So in your macro class, you
either saw this graph and

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.270
commented on it, or you may also
seen a graph where you

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.580
have growth on the left hand
side and level of education.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.260
You do see a strong
relationship

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.040
between growth and level.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.900
These countries which had more
education in 1965 have grown

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.340
faster between '65 and 1990.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:08.690
But what Easterly objects to
that is that yes, of course.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.320
Because if you anticipate
growth, that's how you're

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.850
going to decide to
get education.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:15.540
Because education becomes
more worthwhile.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.180
So that does not tell me that
education is worth anything.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.510
So that's where we are
with the macro data.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.110
And my bottom line is not that
your macro class is wrong or

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.130
that your macro class
is right.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.770
My bottom line is we just don't
know by just looking at

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:34.910
these data.

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:35.880
We don't have enough
data points.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.730
And anything could
have happened.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:40.340
In the countries which were
about to have wars may have

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.520
invested more in education
perhaps as an attempt to not

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.790
have those wars.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.160
Who knows.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.500
So in order to answer the
question of what's the

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:57.140
benefits of education, we need
to look at specific examples.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.860
So ideally, I would have liked
to look, for you, at the

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.140
example of Turkey, because we
just saw it in the movie.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.190
But I don't have it.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:07.280
So we'll be looking at the
example of Indonesia.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.500
So if we are looking at the
effect of supply-driven

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.460
expansion, there are some
arguments where one could see

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.770
that it's not going to work.

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:18.580
And these are arguments that
Easterly is making.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.180
And we kind of all saw
them in the movie.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.850
There was the point about
the teacher quality.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.500
If the teachers don't care
because they've just been spar

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.540
shooted by a central government
to the community

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:34.610
exactly as you were saying, then
the level of education is

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:36.840
not going to be very good.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.940
If the parents don't care and
just do it because they have

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.630
to do it, then they are not
going to put pressure on the

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:44.790
teachers to actually deliver.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.930
And they're not going to put
pressure on the children to

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.660
actually learn.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.050
So the | case is the point that
you were making earlier,

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:56.840
where the children are all alone
in boarding school, and

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.640
nobody's looking after
what they do.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.460
And potentially, they learn
nothing, or they might learn

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.320
to do all sorts of bad stuff.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.110
So if parents do not think that
schools are delivering

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.470
anything useful, then they
won't pay attention.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.340
And finally, children,
if they also don't

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.760
care, won't pay attention.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.490
So these are all theoretical
arguments.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.510
I'm not saying they
are correct.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:18.910
But these are the types
of argument

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:20.820
that Easterly is making.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.340
So how would we know whether
or not there is

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.130
a benefit of education?

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.870
So as I was saying, I don't
you want to interpret the

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:28.880
cross-country evidence.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.040
I think it's very difficult
to interpret.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.180
So I want to focus on one
country, and this one company

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:39.840
that did almost the same
thing that Turkey did.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.040
And fortunately for us, they did
not a few years ago, but

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.370
many years ago.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.600
So now we can look at those
kids as they are

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.630
in the labor market.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:53.640
And we can see whether it was
beneficial for them to be sent

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.120
to these schools.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.290
So that country is Indonesia.

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:59.880
Indonesia is an oil-producing
country.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.560
So when there was a big oil
shock in 1970, starting in

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.230
1973, for Indonesia, it was
actually good news.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:10.470
Because there were producing
oil, so they became richer.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.960
And they decided that they were
going to use this oil

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.900
money to build a
lot of schools.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.210
Basically, all the oil money the
first few years went into

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.300
building tons of schools.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.400
Tons means they build almost
62,000 schools

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.110
all over the country.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:30.580
But particularly in places
which had a low education

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.600
enrollment.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.230
So it's your ultimate
top down.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.330
Furthermore, what is interesting
in relationship

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:39.310
with Turkey is that they had
exactly the same objective,

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:43.300
which is they wanted the kids
to learn Bahasa Indonesia.

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.790
That's the language for the
country, even people in the

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.710
outlying island and
stuff like that.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:51.930
And they wanted everyone to
learn the state ideology,

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:52.860
which was the Pancasila.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:57.160
It's kind of halfway between
an ideology and a religion

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:57.780
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.280
was keen on.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.600
So it was entirely pushed
by public effort.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.770
If it was going to fail, then
this was going to fail.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.724
And what do we see?

00:49:09.724 --> 00:49:14.395
So these graphs are the number
of schools that were built in

00:49:14.395 --> 00:49:16.030
the region.

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.690
And this is the difference
between the education of the

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:22.350
young cohort who benefited from
the school, and education

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.880
of the old guys who
didn't benefit.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.290
So you see that in general, it's
always positive, because

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.450
education went up over
time between the

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.280
younger and the old.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.670
That makes sense.

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:36.810
But it is also increasing in
slope, that is, places which

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:40.040
got more schools got more
years of education.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.415
Maybe that's not surprising,
because that's almost a

00:49:42.415 --> 00:49:44.680
mechanical result of
putting schools.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.270
But this graph is an
interesting one.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:52.060
I'm now looking at the wages of
people in 1995, difference

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.990
between the wages of the
young, minus the

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:56.240
wages of the old.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:02.450
Now it's all negative, because
old people have more

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:05.030
experience and tend to
make more money.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:07.960
But what is interesting is
not the negative thing.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.230
It's the slope again.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.690
The slope is again positive.

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:15.790
So it is saying that compared
to the old guys, the young

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:20.576
people benefit more in places
which build more schools.

00:50:20.576 --> 00:50:23.500
And it's very difficult to think
of a story why would

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.675
this be the case,
except that the

00:50:25.675 --> 00:50:27.920
benefit is from the education.

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.410
So it seems to be the case that
parachuting more schools

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.230
to communities increase
the years of

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:37.320
education, increase wages.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.740
And that seems to imply that
education increases wages.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:45.150
And in fact, if you put two
and two together, you find

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:50.420
that the effect of education
on wages is about 8%.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.460
You can use similar experiments
to look at the

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.180
non-monetary effect
of education.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.490
So Taiwan around the same time,
little bit before, also

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.480
did a top down drive to
increase education.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:09.380
What they did is compulsory
education.

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.000
And what you find in 1968, and
what you'll find is compulsory

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.420
education in Taiwan led to
an increase of education.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.290
That's not surprising but also
a reduction in infant

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:22.860
mortality in places
where education

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.790
increased more as a result.

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:28.550
So again, these are the
non-monetary benefits.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.140
Nigeria did the same thing
as Indonesia for the

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.680
same type of reasons.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.800
They used their oil money
to build schools.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.590
Again, they built more
schools in some

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.200
regions than some others.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.920
And again you can compare the
changes in infant mortality,

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.040
and infertility, and in wages
in places where they built

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.330
more schools and
in places where

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:48.670
they built fewer schools.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.630
And the more schools they
built, the higher the

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.610
education, the higher the
wages, the lower the

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.210
infertilities, the lower
the infant mortalities.

00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:02.200
So the bottom line, when we do
look at specific top down

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.800
policies is that they actually
are useful, that it seems to

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.080
be that there is a returns to
education, corresponding to

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.850
about 8% increase in wages for
every extra year that you

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.140
spend in school.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:20.530
So when we look at this thing in
detail and we answer these

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.225
questions, we see yes, there
is a benefit of education.

00:52:23.225 --> 00:52:26.980
What we are going to do next
is to say, well, is the

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.200
benefit as high as
it could be?

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.010
And that's where we are going
to see the limits of these

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:34.480
kinds of things, having to do
with the quality of education,

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.370
the motivation of the teachers,
the motivation of

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:39.230
the parents, et cetera, which
we'll do next time.

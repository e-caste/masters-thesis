00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.162
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.850
In this video I'd
like us to work

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.660
on the following application
for spherical coordinates.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.060
So what I'd like
us to do is find

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.850
the gravitational attraction
of an upper solid half

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.700
sphere of radius a
and center O, that's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.670
the gravitational attraction
on a mass m naught at O.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.880
So the m naught is sitting at
O, we have a solid half sphere

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.125
of radius a and
center O, and we want

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.620
to find the gravitational
attraction of the half sphere

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.180
on the mass.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.940
And we're going to
assume that the density

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.990
delta is equal to
the square root of x

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.280
squared plus y squared.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.015
So why don't you pause the
video, take a little while

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:45.430
to work on it, and when you
feel good about your solution,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.513
bring the video back up,
I'll show you what I did.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.300
OK.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.089
Welcome back.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.880
Again what we're going
to do is we're going

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.640
to do an application problem.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.480
And what we have is we
have the solid half sphere

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.250
of radius a and
center O, and we want

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.660
to know the gravitational
attraction of it

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.394
on a mass m naught.

00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:09.810
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.240
is draw a picture, just so
I can get myself oriented.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.930
The easiest thing
to do-- obviously,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.680
when I'm going to try
and figure this out,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320
I'm going to use
spherical coordinates.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.050
I have an upper
solid half sphere,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.651
so that should tell me spherical
coordinates will be good.

00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:24.900
And the easiest way to deal
with spherical coordinates

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.470
is obviously to choose
O to be the origin.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.754
So I'm going to have m naught
sitting right at the origin.

00:01:35.754 --> 00:01:37.170
And then I'm going
to have-- oops,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.628
I should write that
somewhere else.

00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:40.538
Maybe, well, I'll
just leave it there--

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:42.246
and then I'm going to
have the solid half

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:46.485
sphere, which I'm going to
just draw sort of like this.

00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:48.360
Maybe that doesn't look
like a sphere to you.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.910
But we have the
solid half sphere

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.880
and it's exerting a
force on m naught.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.030
And if I want to
know the force-- how

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.820
we denote the force in
lecture was the components

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.510
were the x-component
of the force,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.360
the y-component of the
force, and the z-component

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.279
of the force.

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.820
And so I want to point out these
are not partial derivatives.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.655
This is the standard notation
you use for force in this case,

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:12.530
and so these are not
the partial derivatives.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.446
They're just the
x-component, the y-component,

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:15.530
and the z-component.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.830
And if you notice,
this upper solid half

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.440
sphere-- because of
where m naught is,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.610
the x-component and the
y-component of the force

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.530
are 0 based on symmetry.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.310
So all I really need to worry
about is the z-component.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.670
I'm only really interested
in one component of the force

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.950
and it's the z-component.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.130
Because the other two
are going to be 0, just

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.257
by the symmetry of
this solid half sphere.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.840
So I really only
need the z-component.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.850
So what I have to do, in
order to calculate the force,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.895
is I have to figure out the
magnitude and the direction.

00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:47.520
So let's write down
the two components.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.310
These were given
to you in class.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:59.120
So the magnitude is going
to be equal to G m naught

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.120
dm divided by rho squared.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.850
So this was given to
you in class already.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.770
So G is some constant; m
naught is the mass you have;

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.116
dm, we have to determine
a little bit about it;

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:11.740
and then we're dividing
by rho squared.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.410
And the direction--
because I'm only

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.720
interested in the z-component--
the direction is just z,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.340
but then I want to make sure
that the direction component is

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.460
z divided by rho.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.272
The full direction is
[x, y, z] divided by rho,

00:03:27.272 --> 00:03:29.230
but I'm only interested
in that last component.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.961
So the z-component
is just z over rho.

00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:34.336
If that confused
you, I just want

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:38.430
to remind you that
you had [x,  y, z]

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.010
over rho is the full
direction of the force,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.130
we're just pulling
off the z-component.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.340
So what we're going to
be trying to figure out--

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.820
we need to integrate the
product of these two things,

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.706
but I need to figure
out what dm actually is.

00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:54.830
So let me remind you also
what dm is and then we'll

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.180
put it all together.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.140
dm, to remind you, is supposed
to be the density times dV.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.120
And the density in this
case was square root

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.150
of x squared plus y squared,
that's just equal to r.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.360
So it's just r*dV.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.820
So there's a bunch
of little pieces

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.430
and now I have to
put them together.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.790
So if I want to determine
the full attraction

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.590
in the z-direction, because
the other two are 0,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.090
I just need to do
this triple integral.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.780
I'll figure out my
bounds momentarily.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.363
I'm going to leave a lot of room
to write my bounds, because I

00:04:28.363 --> 00:04:29.770
always run out of room.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.870
And then I just
need to integrate

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.810
G m naught divided by rho
squared times z divided

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.145
by rho times r dV.

00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:43.770
Actually I won't even
do the bounds yet

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.170
because I have to
change everything

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.030
into polar coordinates.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.460
So let's figure
out how to do that.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.090
What is z in polar
coordinates? z

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.510
in polar coordinates we
know is rho cosine phi.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.420
So I'm going to
have a G m naught--

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.360
I'm going to keep this
rho cubed right here--

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.190
and then I'm going to
have a rho cosine phi.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.090
r is rho sine phi, so I'll
just put another rho, and then

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.520
a sine phi.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:20.320
And then dV is rho squared
sine phi d rho d phi d theta.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.870
So what I'm going
to do here is--

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.220
I have to add in a rho squared,
so I'm just going to cube this.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.240
And another sine phi, so
I'm going to square that.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.940
And then I'm going to have
a d rho d phi d theta.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.920
Hopefully that wasn't too scary.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.680
But the z is my rho cosine phi.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.540
The r is a single rho sine phi.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.250
And then dV includes a
rho squared sine phi,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.580
so I put a cubed here
and a squared here,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.789
and then d rho d phi d theta.

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.330
So now I just have
to integrate, so I

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.000
have to figure out my bounds.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.170
So we're integrating
first in rho.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.740
And rho, it's a sphere- a
half sphere of radius a.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.830
It's a solid half sphere.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.980
So I'm just integrating
from 0 up to a.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.420
And then phi-- because
it's a solid half sphere,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.410
phi is starting at 0
and it's going down

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.140
until it hits the xy-plane.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.240
And so that's pi over 2.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.580
We know we start at 0, we go to
pi over 2 when we go a quarter

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.300
turn, basically.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.300
When we go 90 degrees, right?

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.530
So we go 0 to pi over
2, and then theta--

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.270
once I've taken my rho and
I've gone up as far as I can,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.770
and I've gone down this way, I
have to rotate it all the way

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.210
around-- and so theta is
actually going from 0 to 2*pi.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.010
All right.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.600
So this is my full
integral I have here.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.130
And now let's do
some simplifying

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.400
before we integrate.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.790
Notice I have a rho cubed
in the denominator here

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.590
and a rho cubed in
the numerator there.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.450
So when I integrate in rho,
I only have this single rho.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.150
When I integrate that rho,
everything else is fixed.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.110
So I integrate that rho, I
get a rho squared over 2,

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.340
and I evaluate it
at 0 and a and so I

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.946
get an a squared over 2,
as integrating this part.

00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:02.570
I'm going to pull
all that to the front

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.652
and then write what I get next.

00:07:05.652 --> 00:07:06.860
Let me write what I get next.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.480
I'm going to have a G
m naught as a constant.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.550
I'm going to be multiplying
by a squared over 2

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.020
from the rho integral.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.640
And then I have
2 more integrals.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.850
Integral from 0 to 2*pi.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:24.330
And the integral from 0 to
pi over 2 of cosine phi sine

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.900
squared phi d phi d theta.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.940
So how do I integrate
this in phi?

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.820
Looks like it's going to
be sine cubed phi over 3.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.890
Let me just double check.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.450
The derivative of that is 3
sine squared phi cosine phi.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.950
Yes.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.660
So, this is going to be
sine cubed phi over 3

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.000
evaluated at 0 and pi over 2.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.972
This inner part is.

00:07:47.972 --> 00:07:49.430
And so let's see
what we get there.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.020
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.850
Sine of pi over 2 is 1.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.169
So I just pick up a
1/3 from this integral.

00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:58.960
So now I'm going to
pull that out in front.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.220
So again, the thing
I've written down here

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.950
is just the integral of this.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.997
So I just get a 1/3 out of that.

00:08:07.997 --> 00:08:08.830
Let me double check.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.521
Yep, sine of pi
over 2 is still 1.

00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.020
Good.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.490
So I get a 1/3 out of that.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.240
That's a constant.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.670
So I'll pull that to the front.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.128
And then notice
what I'm left with.

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:19.070
I'm just integrating
0 to 2*pi of d theta.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.850
Well that's just 2*pi.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.915
So I've got a 1/3
from the inside one,

00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:25.310
times a 2*pi from
the outside one.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.750
So I just end up getting
2*pi times-- or 2*pi over 3,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:36.070
because there's my 1/3 also--
times G m naught a squared over

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.000
2.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.300
And if I simplify
that, I just get

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:46.290
G m naught a squared pi over 3.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.270
And so if I want to know
the force of this solid half

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.160
sphere acting on the mass
m naught, where the mass is

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.550
positioned at the center of the
base of the solid half sphere,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.540
it's going to be exactly
the following thing.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.920
By symmetry, the first
two components are 0

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:11.440
and the last component is this
G m naught a squared pi over 3.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.290
And so that's my final solution.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.790
Let me just take us back and
remind us where we came from.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.590
So we wanted to find the force,
the gravitational attraction

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.600
of this solid half sphere that
had a radius a, was centered

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.070
at O, and had mass m
naught sitting at O.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.070
And so we were interested
in drawing the easiest

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.800
picture possible.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.258
We're going to put
O at the origin,

00:09:33.258 --> 00:09:34.620
so m naught's at the origin.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.190
Then we have a solid
half sphere of radius a.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.231
So this is-- you know, if
I come all the way out,

00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:40.280
my radius length is a.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.770
And I gave you the
density was equal to r.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.220
So we know-- the force
we're interested in,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.620
F sub x, F sub y, F sub
z, from the picture alone,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.860
we see F sub x
and F sub y are 0.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.670
So we really only
need the z-component.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.570
So you know how to
find the magnitude

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.626
and you know how to find the
direction of the vector field.

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.625
The reason that you've
divided by rho here, just

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:02.166
to remind you, is
that the direction,

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:04.790
you want it to be a unit vector.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.680
And so this is what
makes it a unit vector.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.160
And so the direction part
that I'm interested in

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.470
is the z-part.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.380
So it's z over rho.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.420
And so all I need to do
is take the z over rho,

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.230
multiply it by the magnitude,
and replace the dm by what it

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.910
is in terms of the volume form.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.910
And in terms of the volume
form, it's the density times dV

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.240
and so in this case
it's just r*dV.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.490
So I made all those
substitutions.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.701
And then all I had to do
is do a lot of replacement.

00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:33.200
And that was kind
of the messy part,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.050
and then the
integral's fairly easy.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.690
So the messy part is z I
replaced by rho cosine phi.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.810
r I replaced by rho sine phi.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.264
And dV I replaced by rho squared
sine phi d rho d phi d theta.

00:10:45.264 --> 00:10:46.680
And then I just
have to figure out

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.265
what the bounds are for the
half sphere, solid half sphere.

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:50.140
And then I integrate.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.690
And the integration
is all ultimately

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.110
one step at a time,
single variable.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.870
And they were all
fairly simple integrals.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.790
So in the end, we see that
your mass m naught sitting

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.490
at the origin, the force exerted
on it by this solid half sphere

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.960
is 0, 0 comma G times m naught
times a squared pi divided

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.870
by 3.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.150
All right, that's
where I'll stop.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:01.560
PROFESSOR: So what do we do?

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.070
We are going to sum
over final states

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.180
the probability to go
from i to final at time t0

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.165
to first order.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.830
Since the sum of our final
states is really a continuum,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.280
this is represented
by the integral

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:37.930
of the f i t0 1, multiplied
by the number of states

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.010
at every little interval.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.590
So this will go rho of Ef dEf.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.795
So this is what we developed
about the number of states.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.830
So I'm replacing this--

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.760
I have to sum but
I basically decide

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.260
to call this little dN,
the little number of states

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.890
in here, and then I'm going to
integrate this probability, so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.770
the number of states over
there, and therefore the dN

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.450
is replaced by rho times dEf.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.350
So then this whole transition
probability will be 4 integral,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.890
I'm writing now the integral,
VfI squared, sine squared,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:46.421
omega f i t0 over 2 Ef minus
Ei squared, rho of Ef, d of Ef.

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:53.400
And you would say
at this moment,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.800
OK, this is as far
as you go, so that

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.500
must be Fermi's golden
rule, because we

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.700
don't know rho of Ef, it's
different in different cases,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.620
so we have to do that integral
and we'll get our answer.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.800
But the great thing
about this golden rule

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.630
is that you can go far and
you can do the integral.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:23.990
Now I don't even know, this
VfI also depends on the energy,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.270
how am I ever going
to do the integral?

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.580
That seems outrageous.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.130
Well, let's try to do
it, and part of the idea

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.930
will be that we're going
to be led to the concept

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.180
that we already
emphasized here because

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.410
of this suppression, that
only a narrow band of states

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.460
contribute, and in
that narrow band,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.200
if the narrow band is narrow
enough, in that region

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.770
VfI high be
approximately constant

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.530
in a narrow enough
region, and rho

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.020
will be approximately constant.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.150
So we'll take them
out of the integral,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.750
do the rest of the
integral, and see later

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.000
whether the way we're
doing the integral

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.970
shows that this
idea is justified.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.330
So I'll just-- you
know, sometimes you

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.130
have to do these things,
of making the next step,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.110
so I'll do that.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.940
I'll take these things
out, assuming they're

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:40.900
constant enough, and then we'll
get 4 VfI squared, rho of E,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.490
what should I put here?

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.530
E sub i, is that right?

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.520
Because if it's all evaluated
at the initial energy Ei,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.240
if only a narrow
band will contribute,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:02.140
I'll put an h squared here so
that this will become omega fi,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.120
and now I will integrate over
the sum range of energies

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.650
the function sine squared
omega f t0 over 2,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.140
over omega fi squared dEf.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.780
So I just took the thing
out of the integral

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.340
and we're going to hope
for some luck here.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.640
Whenever you have an integral
like that it probably

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.270
is a good idea to plot
what you're integrating

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.650
and think about it and
see if you're going

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.265
to get whatever you wanted.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.930
Look, I don't know how far
I'm going to integrate,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.460
I probably don't
want to integrate

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.310
too far because then these
functions that I took out

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.920
of the integral
are not constants,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.390
so let's see what
this looks like,

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.050
the integrand,
this function here.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.190
Well, sine squared
of x over x squared

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.160
goes to 1, you know when--

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.650
this we're plotting as
a function of omega fi.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.590
Why?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.520
Time is not really what we're
plotting into this thing,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.050
we're plotting-- we're
integrating our energy,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.850
Ef, omega fi is Ef minus Ei,
so omega is the variable you

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.830
should be plotting, and
when omega goes to zero,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.850
this whole interval goes
like t0 squared over 4,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:15.860
and then sine squared of x
over x squared does this thing,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:25.670
and the first step here is
2 pi over t0, 2 pi over t0

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.440
and so on.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.490
And now you smile.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.810
Why?

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.960
Because it's looking
good, this thing.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.180
First what's going
to be this area?

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.820
Well, if I look at
this lobe, roughly, I

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:59.380
would say height t0 squared with
1 over t0, answer proportional

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.820
to t0.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.480
This whole integral is going
to be proportional to t0.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.500
The magic of the combination
of the x squared growth,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.710
t0 squared and
the oscillation is

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.910
making into this
integral being linear

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.160
in t0, which is the probability
the transition [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.010
is going to grow
linearly is going

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.510
to be a rate, as we expected.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.440
So this is looking very good.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:37.140
Then we can attempt to see that
also most of the contribution

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:43.000
here happens within this
range to the integral.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:55.260
If you look at the integral of
sine squared x over x squared,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.320
90% of the integral
comes from here.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.730
By the time you have these
ones you're up to 95%

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.530
of the integral.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.095
Most of the integral
comes within those lobes.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.380
And look what I'm going
to say, I'm going to say,

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:18.330
look, I'm going to try
to wait long enough,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:30.230
t0 is going to be long enough so
that this narrow thing is going

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:35.900
to be narrower and narrower and
therefore most of the integral

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.500
is going to come from
omega fi equal to 0,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.169
which means the f equals to Ei.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:47.990
If I wait long enough with
t0, this is very narrow,

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.380
and even all the other
extra bumps are already

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.030
4 pi over t0 over
here is just going

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.730
to do it without any problem,
it's going to fit in.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.010
So another way of
thinking of this

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:10.690
is to say, look, you could
have argued that this is going

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:16.640
to be linear in t0 if you just
change variables here, absorb

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.210
the t0 into the energy,
change variable,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:27.200
and the t0 will go out of
the integral in some way,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.570
but that is only true if the
limits go from minus infinity

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.320
to plus infinity.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.360
So I cannot really integrate
from minus infinity to plus

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.990
infinity in the final
energies, but I don't need

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:48.860
to because most of the integral
comes from this big lobe here,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:55.190
and if t0 is sufficiently large,
it is really within no energy

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.482
with respect to the energy, Ei.

00:09:59.482 --> 00:10:03.000
So our next step is
to simply declare

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.570
that a good approximation
to this integral

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.110
is to integrate the whole
thing from minus infinity

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.720
to infinity, so let me say this.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:24.540
Suppose here in this range omega
fi is in between 2 pi over t0

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.320
and minus 2 pi over t0.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.270
What does this tell us that
omega fi is in this region?

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:42.170
Well, this is Ef minus Ei over
h bar so this actually tells you

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:51.220
Ef is in between Ei
plus 2 pi h bar over t0,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.300
and Ei minus 2 pi h bar over t0.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:13.990
All right, so this
is the energy range

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:20.180
and as t0 becomes larger and
larger, the window for Ef

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.740
is smaller and smaller, and
we have energy conserving.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:33.210
So let's look at our integral
again, the integral is I,

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:38.810
that's for the integral,
this whole thing,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:44.570
will be equal to
integral dEf sine squared

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:52.370
of omega fi t0 over 2
over omega fi squared.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.660
So what do we do?

00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:02.660
We call this a variable, u,
equal omega fi t0 over 2,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:13.310
so that du is dEf
t0 over 2 h bar,

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.380
because omega fi is
Ef minus Ei, and Ef is

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.610
your variable of integration.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.880
So you must substitute
the dEf here

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.300
and the rest of the integron.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:36.530
So what do we get from the
dEf and the other part?

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:42.320
You get at the end h bar
t0 over 2 integral from--

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:49.080
well, let's leave it, sine
squared u over u squared du.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:58.970
So look at this, the
omega fi squared,

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:05.550
by the time you get here omega
fi goes like 1 over time,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.190
so when it's down here we'll
give you a time squared,

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.940
but the dE gives you 1 over
time so at the end of the day

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:19.610
we get the desired linear
dependence on t0 here,

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:25.220
only if the integral
doesn't have t0 in here,

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.510
and it will not have it if you
extend it from minus infinity

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.040
to infinity.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.430
And there's no error,
really, in extending it

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.240
from minus infinity to
infinity because you basically

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.350
know that n lobes
are going to fit here

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.010
and are going to be accurate,
because there is little energy

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.120
change if t0 is large enough.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.640
If t0 is large enough, even a
20 pi h bar and a 20 by h bar

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.770
here, that still will do it.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.770
So we integrate like
that, we extend it,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:08.800
and we get this whole
integral has value pi,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:16.210
so we get h bar t0 pi over
2, that's our integral, I.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:27.280
So our transition
probability, what is it?

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:35.950
We have it there,
over there, we'll

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:47.740
have the sum over final states,
i to f of t0, first order

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.990
is equal to the integral
times this quantity,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:15:00.580
so that quantity
is h t0 pi over 2,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:06.160
so it's 4, what do
we have, VfI squared,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:17.680
rho of Ei over h squared,
then h bar t0 pi over 2.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.950
So your final answer
for this thing

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:32.290
is 2 pi over h bar VfI
squared, rho of Ei t0.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.290
So let's box, this is
a very nice result,

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:40.720
it's almost Fermi's
golden rule by now.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.470
Let's put a time t
here, t0 is a label,

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.350
not to confuse our time
integrals or things like that,

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.740
so we could put
the time, t, here,

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:58.722
is 2 pi over h bar VfI
squared rho of Ei t.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.470
From here we have
a transition rate,

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.430
so a transition rate is
probability of transition

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.920
per unit time, so
a transition rate

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.000
would be defined as the
probability of transition

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.500
after a time t, divided by
the time t that has elapsed,

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.080
and happily, this has worked
out so that our transition rate,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:51.910
w is 2 pi over h bar
VfI squared rho of Ei,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:56.740
and this is Fermi's
golden rule, a formula

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:01.840
for the transition rate to
the continuum of final states.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.640
You see, when I see
[INAUDIBLE] it almost

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.579
seemed you still
have to integrate,

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.400
there is a rho of E and
let's integrate [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.109
but the interval has been
done and it says transmission

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:24.190
amplitude squared evaluated
at the state initial

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:28.089
and final with the same
energy and final state,

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:33.470
and the rho evaluated at the
energy of the initial state.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:38.250
You don't have to
do more with that.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.870
So we have this formula, let's
look at a couple more things.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.390
Do units work out?

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:51.540
Yes, this is transition per
unit, this is 1 over time,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:57.750
this is energy squared,
this is 1 over energy,

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.460
and this is an h bar, this
will give you 1 over time,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.240
so this thing goes well.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.610
How about our assumptions?

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.170
This was calculated using some
time t, we used to call it t0.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.450
How large does it have to be?

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:22.680
Well, the larger it is the
more accurate the integral is,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.230
but you don't want
to take it too large,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.490
either, because
the larger it is,

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.610
the transition
probability eventually

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.840
goes wrong at first order
of perturbation theory.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:43.200
So this argument is valid
if there is a time, t0,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:51.150
that is large enough so that
within this error bars, rho

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.490
and the transition matrix
elements are constant so

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.650
that your integral is valid.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:02.430
But this t0 being large
enough should be small enough

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:08.550
that the transition probability
doesn't become anywhere near 1.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:15.430
That will happen in general or
if VfI is sufficiently small,

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:21.660
so when VfI is sufficiently
small, this will always hold,

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:28.680
and in physical applications
this happens and it's OK.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.920
So that's our presentation
and derivation

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.250
of Fermi's golden rule,
and we will turn now

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.590
to one application
and we will discuss.

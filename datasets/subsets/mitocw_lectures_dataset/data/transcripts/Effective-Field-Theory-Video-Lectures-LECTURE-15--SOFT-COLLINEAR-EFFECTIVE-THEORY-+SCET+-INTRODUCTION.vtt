00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.350
IAIN STEWART: All right,
that's roughly where we were.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.530
So last time, we started
talking about SCET.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.480
We said it's going
to be a theory that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.100
can describe energetic
hadrons and energetic jets.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.080
Our first example was
discussing about a process

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.560
with an energetic hadron,
which is this pink pion.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.540
So the pion has a large
momentum, large energy.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.990
It's much bigger
than lambda QCD.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.400
It's much bigger than in m pi.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.470
And it moves basically along
a light cone direction.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.560
So that was a motivation for us
to use light cone coordinates.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.010
So we introduce
an n and an n bar.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.550
And with that n and n bar,
which satisfy n squared 0,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.520
n bar squared 0, and n dot n
bar equals 2 as a normalization

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.752
convention, we can
decompose any momentum P

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:16.380
mu in terms of components along
n, components along n bar,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.630
and then the remaining two
components which we call

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.450
the perpendicular components.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.224
So we can also write the metric
out in these coordinates.

00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:34.500
And this kind of makes
explicit that you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.570
have this off-diagonal
nature to the basis,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.830
that you have n
mu with n bar mu.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.020
So unlike Cartesian
coordinates, where

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.880
the component along
a direction is just

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.850
given by dotting that
vector into the vector

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.640
you start with, here
the component along n

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.603
is given by dotting n
bar into the vector.

00:01:59.603 --> 00:02:01.770
And that's reflected in the
metric here in the sense

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.320
that you have these
terms n within n bar.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.060
So you can do this with any
tensor if you have an epsilon.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.290
You can find an epsilon
perp tensor, for example,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.180
by taking epsilon and
putting in an n bar and an n.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.070
And then this would be
a two-component tensor

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.960
that behaves in the
perpendicular direction

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.060
as an antisymmetric tensor.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.570
And this g perp mu nu
would be effectively living

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.470
in the little subspace
of the perp coordinates.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.490
And again, it's a
metric tensor there.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.440
And this would be the
antisymmetric tensor there.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.710
OK, so these are the
coordinates we're going to use.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.990
So n here had a
physical motivation,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.150
as you saw from my picture.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.280
The pion was moving
in the n direction.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.350
And bar was just
a vector that we

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.600
decided that we needed in
order to define things.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.540
So if you have some vector
where n squared is 0

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.360
and you want to make a
decomposition of coordinates,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.770
then you're required
to introduce

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:26.110
a complimentary vector,
which is this n bar

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.570
to make the decomposition
for the reasons I said.

00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:39.790
The simplest choice
that you could make,

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.540
if you made this choice
for n, so if we choose n

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:58.990
to be 1, 0, 0,
minus 1, as I did,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.260
then the simplest thing you
could do for n bar is to pick n

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.616
bar to be 1, 0, 0, plus 1.

00:04:07.616 --> 00:04:10.600
So then that would be
a lightlike vector.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.660
When you dot it into
this vector, you get 2.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.459
And it satisfies all the
criteria that we would need.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.709
If I choose these
two vectors, then I

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.420
have to find what
perp is because perp

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.030
is the space that's
orthogonal to these vectors.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.490
So that's these two
coordinates, OK?

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.440
So perp in general is defined
such that n dot P perp is 0

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.040
and n bar dot P perp is 0.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.540
It's the orthogonal
two directions

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.642
to the ones that are
picked out by an n bar.

00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:46.850
And so you need to know what
n and n bar are in order

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.808
to define what perp is.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.620
So this is one choice.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.140
You could make other choices.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.330
And we'll come back
to this later on.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.910
So just by way of example, if
I have the same choice for n,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.210
but I choose n bar
to be 3, 2, 2, 1,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.790
that would also be a
choice that's equally good.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.360
I need this to be minus 1.

00:05:26.944 --> 00:05:31.420
I'll do this, make
my choice work.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.180
I guess, well, OK, if
we want the same sign,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.200
then I have to do this.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.820
OK, so 9 minus 8, this
thing still squares to 0.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.740
You dot it, you get
3 minus 1 is 2, OK?

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.320
So it still satisfies the
criteria that we had here.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.360
And it points in some
other weird direction.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.480
So the point is that this
is an auxiliary vector,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.585
and there's some freedom
in what you pick for it.

00:06:03.585 --> 00:06:05.710
And once you've picked
this, if you pick these two,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.230
you would have a different
definition of perp.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.740
OK.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.250
But it's an equally
valid possible choice.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.840
And we'll actually exploit
this freedom later on.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.430
But for now, we'll mostly focus
on picking the simplest choice.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.610
OK, what we're actually
interested in describing

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.310
in these processes
is not just the plan,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.870
but what goes on
inside the plan.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.730
What is the quark level process?

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.050
So we're interested
in the constituents.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.430
That's where the dynamics are.

00:06:43.522 --> 00:06:46.548
Is there any questions
before I keep going?

00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:48.840
No.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.710
So in this process, B to D
pi, if you think about it

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.100
in the rest frame
of the B meson,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.168
which is the most natural
frame, then the B meson

00:06:56.168 --> 00:06:57.960
we've already learned
how to describe that.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.900
We can describe that with
HQET, same with the D meson.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.390
And we know that the things
that are inside the B and the D

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.930
meson are one heavy quark and
then a bunch of soft stuff.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.945
So I'll call these guys soft
because the dynamical part is

00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:14.445
soft.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:33.720
And so we can use HQET
for them as we did before.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.590
And that means we're describing
gluons and quarks that

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:54.205
are inside these hadrons
where the forward momentum are

00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:57.370
of order lambda QCD.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.280
The pion, on the other hand,
is what we would collinear.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.590
So as I already described,
the pion's energy

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.060
is much greater than its mass.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.905
Its highly boosted.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.600
If you were to talk about
it in the rest frame,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.880
then like the B and the D
meson, then the constituents

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.215
of the pion would have
momentum of order lambda QCD.

00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:42.590
But if you were to talk about
the pion in the rest frame,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.050
you'd have to talk about the B
and the D in the boosted frame.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.150
So let's stick with
describing the B and the D

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.790
in the rest frame or
close to the rest frame.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.150
The B meson is in
its rest frame.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.610
In the D meson is slow.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.700
And in that case, we're stuck
with the pion being energetic.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:12.640
So in rest frame,
our pion would be--

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:25.698
it would also have
quarks and gluons

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:27.560
our P mu is order lambda QCD.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.360
And we can actually just take
that result, once we know that,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.720
and boost it to another frame.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.520
So let's just boost along
z hat by some kappa that's

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.695
much greater than
1 as the boost.

00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:48.570
And the way that light
cone coordinates boost

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.290
is very simple.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.040
If you're along the axis of
the light cone coordinates,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.410
it's multiplicative.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.500
So P minus gets
enhanced by some amount.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.390
P plus gets suppressed
by the same amount.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.268
That's one nice thing
about these coordinates.

00:10:05.268 --> 00:10:07.310
And of course, P perp
doesn't change because it's

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.510
perpendicular to the boost.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.925
So now, we can get our
pion, which is moving,

00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:15.800
which should be pink.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.020
And if we ask about
its constituents,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.060
we just boost the components
of this for vector.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.330
So we ask about how they scale.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.810
And we look at the
different components.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.870
The plus, minus, and perp
scale differently now,

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.320
so we have to break
it up by that.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.240
And if we boost it by
this amount Q or lambda

00:10:53.240 --> 00:11:02.970
over Q, Q over
lambda, then that's

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.440
the scaling for
this boosted pion.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:06.940
OK.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.110
So now, it's got a component
in the minus direction.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.650
n bar dot P is
order Q. That's what

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.360
we saw before when
we decomposed the P,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.570
that it was basically Q
times a lightlike vector.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.430
But that was the pion.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.130
Now, we're talking about the
constituents inside the pion.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.638
Constituents inside
the pion fill it out.

00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:27.180
They fill it out in
the perpendicular

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.210
by an amount lambda QCD that's
perpendicular to the direction

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.350
of its motion.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.440
And then the plus momentum
got correspondingly smaller

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.310
as the minus momentum
have got bigger,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.310
so we have that scaling.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.510
And so the relative
scaling here is

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.110
what actually defines
something being collinear.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.610
So the relative
scaling of this vector

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:58.230
here is that the P minus is
much bigger than the P perp is

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.480
much bigger than the P plus.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.472
And that's what we
mean by collinear.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.490
It's collimated
in some direction,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.990
and that direction
is the direction

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.907
of the large momentum.

00:12:13.353 --> 00:12:14.770
You always have
to be careful when

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.810
you say things like that
because the component

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.610
along the direction is the
opposite lightlike vector,

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.600
but I think you'll
always know what I mean.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.730
OK, so in the n mu direction, we
have a large component P minus.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.837
And that defines this
thing is collimated

00:12:29.837 --> 00:12:30.920
in a particular direction.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.065
It's perpendicular fluctuations
to that direction are small.

00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:35.440
And so all the
degrees of freedom

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.330
that are in this boosted pion
have that type of scaling.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.070
So what we're
describing, or what

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.370
we want to describe if we
have a field theory for this,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.110
is we want to
describe, if you like,

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:57.340
fluctuations about the
pion momentum, which,

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:06.580
ignoring the pion mass, we could
just take it to be like this.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.700
And the size of the
fluctuations we need to treat

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.250
are things that can fluctuate
by amounts of this size.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.610
So the field theory
is going to have

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:23.153
to describe fluctuations about
some kind of canonical scaling.

00:13:23.153 --> 00:13:24.570
And the field
theory for this pion

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.520
is going to have
to be describing

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.100
collinear fluctuations
that are of this type.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.560
Just like the HQET had to
describe soft fluctuations,

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.690
P mu's of order lambda QCD
ignorant of the heavy quark

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.730
mass, here it's a little
bit more complicated.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.230
But that's the kind of thing
we want the field theory to do.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.520
Any questions about that?

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.340
So the way that we write this
is we say that P plus, P minus,

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:08.460
P perp has a particular
scaling that we

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.200
call lambda squared
1 lambda where

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.640
lambda is some small parameter.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.750
And if we have a momentum
that scales that way,

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.066
we call it collinear.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.630
So this is generic any
case with any lambda.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.116
And our allowed here was
just lambda QCD over Q.

00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:46.680
But if we encounter
another physical problem

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.620
where the lambda
was different, we

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.224
would also call that collinear.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.970
All right, so what's a
nice way of picturing this,

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.980
what we're doing here?

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.990
Because it's a little
bit different than you're

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.223
used to with an
effective field theory.

00:15:07.223 --> 00:15:09.640
Usually, with an effective
field theory, what you're doing

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.593
is you're separating modes
by their invariant mass.

00:15:12.593 --> 00:15:15.010
You have things with large
invariant mass, small invariant

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.618
mass.

00:15:16.618 --> 00:15:18.160
If you think about
massive particles,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.950
well, that's just the
invariant mass squared.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.900
So if you're separating
massive particles

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.780
from massless particles
or less massive particles,

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.370
you're really separating things
along an invariant mass curve.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.940
Just an invariant mass variable
is used for the separation.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.740
And that doesn't
quite suffice here.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.830
Because as you saw, the pion
in the B and the D meson,

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.620
they both had P squared
of order lambda QCD.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.710
What separates the pion
from the B or the D meson

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.350
is this morphyne structure.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.720
So SCET is actually an
example of an effective field

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.340
theory that requires at
least more than one variable

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.830
to describe where the
degrees of freedom live.

00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:21.580
So we can draw a picture
for what we've been talking

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.880
about here in two variables.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.470
Let's just pick P
minus and P plus.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.980
And essentially, what's
going on in this space is

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.260
you can think that there's
degrees of freedom that

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.840
live in this space at
different locations.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.570
So out here, if I draw
a hyperbola like this,

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:58.938
then remember that P squared
was P plus times P minus minus P

00:16:58.938 --> 00:16:59.480
perp squared.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.460
But let's ignore P perp
squared for this picture.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.839
So if I draw a curve of constant
P squared in this plane, then

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.010
it's I hyperbola.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.930
So these are curves
of constant P squared.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.670
And this one here has
P squared of order Q

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.800
squared, which might be Mb
squared or some hard scale.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.420
So this any degrees of freedom
that live on this curve,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.640
or in particularly
these ones, would

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.752
be what we would call
hard degrees of freedom.

00:17:29.752 --> 00:17:31.960
And those are something that
we want to integrate out

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.210
of the effective theory.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.180
And the other degrees of freedom
that we've been talking about

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.680
have smaller invariant mass.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.460
So this hyperbola down here
has P squared of order lambda

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.410
QCD squared.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.570
But there's two different
degrees of freedom

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.340
that live on this curve.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.020
One of them has a large P minus.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.110
That's the collinear one,
so it should be pink.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:08.090
And then the soft
one lives down there.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:12.680
So P minus here is scaling,
if you like, lambda to the 0.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.135
And here, for this soft mode,
which also exists in this case,

00:18:17.135 --> 00:18:18.635
this is actually
going to be lambda.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.210
So you can contrast
that type of picture

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.260
with a more usual picture where
you would just have one line.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.940
And you'd say there's
some modes up here

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.900
and some modes down there.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.400
And you'd integrate
out these modes.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.790
And you keep those modes.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.582
This is a little
different because you want

00:18:38.582 --> 00:18:39.798
to integrate out these modes.

00:18:39.798 --> 00:18:41.340
You want to keep
both of those modes,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.465
but they live in a little
bit of a different place.

00:18:43.465 --> 00:18:45.960
And that's actually going to
be important to formulating

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.760
the effective theory.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.910
So the way that you should think
about this, physically the way

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.490
you should think about it, is
that these modes are kind of

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.840
localized in that region.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:05.320
This is the right
physical picture,

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.440
which requires another variable
besides just invariant mass

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:15.940
in order to specify that, right?

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.790
The reason we don't have to draw
a third direction for P perp

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:25.410
is because it was just
redundant information.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.455
P perp squared is
always of P plus P

00:19:28.455 --> 00:19:30.330
minus if you're talking
about fluctuations

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.538
that are near the mass shell.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.400
For a massless mode, that mass
shell is P squared equals 0.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.730
And so P perp would just be
providing redundant information

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.605
to our picture, and we
just can leave it out.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.080
Now, the boundaries
of the regions

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.700
between soft and collinear here
seems like an interesting thing

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.550
to worry about.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.400
And that is, indeed, true.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.470
You have to think about
how you want to set up

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.060
this effective theory.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.425
And of course, as I have
been emphasizing earlier

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:15.050
in the course, the
easiest way to think

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.630
about momentum
degrees of freedom

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.430
is with a Wilsonian picture.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.348
That makes physically
what's going on very clear.

00:20:22.348 --> 00:20:24.140
So the simplest thing
would be to introduce

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:35.270
a Wilsonian cut-off
and set this up

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.750
as a Wilsonian
effective field theory.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.910
And then we would just
take these regions.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.180
And I would literally carve
them out in the way that I drew.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.160
I would carve out some
cut-off between them.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.890
And I would decide who's
in the soft region, who's

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:53.720
in the collinear region
based on those hard cut-offs.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.700
But we don't want to
do that, actually,

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.240
because it would mess up
all sorts of symmetries.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.515
In particular, it would
mess up gauge cemetery

00:21:01.515 --> 00:21:03.140
which is an important
thing when you're

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.400
talking about gauge theory.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.000
So we're going to use
dimensional regularization,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.515
as we have for other problems.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.280
And that actually
will still leave us

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.860
with this picture, which
I drew as a cartoon.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.000
You'll still be correct.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.400
Think about the modes
live in those places

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.200
in dimensional regularization.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.020
What's a little bit harder is
how to think about the cut-off.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.121
And we'll treat that in
some detail later on.

00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:59.260
So it's still the
correct picture,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.740
but treating the region overlaps
with dimensional regularization

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.740
is a little more tricky.

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.910
But at least we can
do it in a way that

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.692
preserves the gauge invariance.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:22.529
So that's going to be
our mode of operation.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.790
This theory has a name.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.020
It goes by the name SCET2.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.260
That's why I called it SCET2.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.780
We'll come back in a
moment to what SCET1 is.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.120
So I can say that the
degrees of freedom

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.758
in this theory, the one that
we've been talking about,

00:23:05.758 --> 00:23:07.550
are some collinear
degree of freedom that's

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.920
associated to some
direction, some collinear

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.450
degrees of freedom as well as
some soft degrees of freedom.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.568
And when you have
effective theories that

00:23:16.568 --> 00:23:18.860
are like this one, where the
soft and collinear degrees

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.230
of freedom live on the
same mass hyperbola,

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.670
they're called SCET2 theories.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.090
And these are really
the kind of theories

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.360
that you get when you're
talking about energetic hadron

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.425
production.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.730
So any questions so far?

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.420
OK, so if that's
energetic hadrons,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.520
then SCET1 will
be energetic jets.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.740
And that's what we'll
talk about next.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.950
So let's do another example
which has jets in it.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.530
And we'll see what
the similarities are

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:39.690
to this SCET2 set up in terms
of just identifying still what

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.630
the right degrees
of freedom are.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.810
So let's look at e plus
e minus to two jets.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.750
So e plus e minus collide.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.170
They produce a
virtual photon, say.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:05.250
The virtual photon produces
a quark-antiquark pair.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.430
The quark-antiquark
pair starts to radiate.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.690
And we get jets, two of them.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.243
So again, there's a
kind of natural frame

00:25:23.243 --> 00:25:24.410
to describe this scattering.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.460
And that's the center of mass
frame of the e plus e minus.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.860
Most e plus e minus colliders
are built in that frame.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.270
And if you're in the
center of mass frame

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.530
and you call the for
momentum of this photon Q,

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.650
then it just has an
energy component.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.320
So Q here is not the same as
the Q in our previous example,

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.690
but we're always going to
identify the hard scale as Q.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.550
So here, the hard
scale is the scale

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.823
of the energy of the collision
in the center of mass frame.

00:25:58.823 --> 00:26:00.490
And if you ask, what
does the event look

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.080
like in the center
of mass frame,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.000
then these two jets
which are going out

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.480
have to balance each other.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.270
And so you have two
back to back jets.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:19.160
So we draw it like this, one jet
going this way, one jet going

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.010
that way.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.890
Our original e plus e
minus might have come

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.100
in from some other direction.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:29.030
So maybe e plus e minus were
coming in from here and here.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.440
And then we have these two
jets going out this way.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.690
Since they're jets,
that means they're

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.460
collimated sprays of radiation.

00:26:46.745 --> 00:26:47.870
So they're not featureless.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:53.550
They have some size
to them like this.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.920
And in this process,
we can quickly

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.560
identify that there's
two relevant directions.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.950
It's back to back,
but let's define

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.460
this direction of
this jet to be n1,

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.960
some lightlike vector that
points in that direction,

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.870
and this one to be n2.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:16.940
So generically, we could
say you n is some 1, n hat.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.900
And if we choose this
to be the z-axis,

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.120
then this must be 1, 0, 0
1, just like we had before.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.780
But we can always pick a
lightlike vector that points

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.082
along some direction n hat.

00:27:28.082 --> 00:27:29.540
So when I draw a
picture like this,

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.480
really what I mean when I say
n1 points in this direction

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.360
is that the hat part of it
points in that direction

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.520
in through space.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.160
OK, so just like
before, what happens

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.040
with the jet is, as I
said last time actually,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.310
we have a large energy flow in
this direction and a smaller

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.540
perpendicular flow.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.380
So if we measure
perpendicular momentum, which

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.040
we can think of as perpendicular
to that axis, free axis,

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.110
then that's the perpendicular
flow inside the jet.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:06.090
And so if we want to talk about
constituents inside the jet,

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.670
then we'll be interested
in smaller perpendicular

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.650
flow than flow in the
forward direction.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.960
And that's what makes it
into a collimated jet.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.710
You have question?

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:15.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:15.840
IAIN STEWART: Sure.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.423
AUDIENCE: So you're
not using anything

00:28:17.423 --> 00:28:19.440
about the QCD
[INAUDIBLE] to tell you

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.828
the things is [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:20.828 --> 00:28:23.370
You're just saying we know that
we have to [INAUDIBLE] topic.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.740
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, that's
the attitude, right.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.022
So I mean, we'll see why.

00:28:27.022 --> 00:28:28.480
You know, you can
ask the question,

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.063
why do we get jets
in the first place?

00:28:30.063 --> 00:28:31.470
We haven't talked about that.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.130
And we could talk about that.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.910
I'm taking the attitude here,
this is what we observe.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.220
How do we design an effective
field theory for it?

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.320
And we'll see then, from
that effective theory,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.850
we can go back
and understand why

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.475
it is that we get
these objects and why

00:28:43.475 --> 00:28:45.225
actually, when you
look at cross-sections,

00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:47.835
that this is the leading order
description of what happens.

00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:50.790
We'll come to that later.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.710
Good question.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.107
Any other questions?

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.330
All right.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:06.480
Yeah, in the hadron case, you
just say this process exists.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.530
And I didn't explain to you
why the process could exist.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.280
But in the jet case,
there's more dynamics

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.800
going into the fact
that the process exists,

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.850
the fact that QCD likes
to radiate collinear

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.400
to a direction, which has to
do with the infrared structure

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.200
of the theory.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.640
And we'll come back to that.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.690
I mean, the short
answer, of course,

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.200
is that things like to
radiate in that direction

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.160
because there's
large logarithms that

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.670
enhance splittings that are
collinear to the direction

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.210
of motion.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.880
And you also get smaller
coupling consonants

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.963
when you do that rather
than a wide angle emission.

00:29:51.963 --> 00:29:53.630
So we're saying here,
what we're saying,

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.600
is we measure e plus
e minus to two jets.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.758
If I had an extra
wide angle emission,

00:29:58.758 --> 00:30:00.550
that would be e plus
e minus to three jets.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.041
So I ruled that out just
right at the beginning.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.790
OK, so what you can
do with this picture

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.400
in order to define what's
going on is you can say,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.490
well they're to
back-to-back jets.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:14.750
Let's draw a hemisphere.

00:30:17.978 --> 00:30:19.520
So this is supposed
to be kind of out

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.380
of the board point at you.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.130
Let's draw a hemisphere
between these two.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.370
And then we can call one
side a and the other side b.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:29.840
And we can talk
about momenta that

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.048
are flowing in the a hemisphere
and the b hemisphere.

00:30:32.048 --> 00:30:34.318
And you see that we have
one jet in each hemisphere.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.590
So we have a jet of
hadrons in hemisphere a.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:56.540
And we have another
one in hemisphere b.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.431
So in some ways, we can talk
about a and b independently.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.270
So let's start off
by talking about a,

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.350
which is what I called
the n1 collinear jet.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:26.550
And if we ask about
constituents in the jet,

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.110
then the perpendicular
momentum will

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:31.980
be of some size, which
let me just call it delta.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:37.290
And that'll be much smaller than
P minus, which is of size Q.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.500
So the energy that we
pump in through the photon

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.310
has to leave.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.760
And the only place that it
can leave is that half of it

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.260
has to kind of leave
this direction.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.570
Half of it has to
leave that direction

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.850
by energy conservation.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:55.090
And so we have a large energy
flow in the P minus component.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.510
And then we have a much
smaller amount in the P perp.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.820
And that's what I already said.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.740
And given those
two facts, you can

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.260
ask, what about the
constituents of the jet?

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.575
And again, they're collinear
because you have a hierarchy.

00:32:16.485 --> 00:32:19.050
So the plus minus and
perpendicular momentum

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.540
of constituents would
scale in that way.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.668
And that is Q lambda
squared 1 lambda, just as

00:32:26.668 --> 00:32:27.960
before with a different lambda.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.650
So here, lambda is how
much spread and perp

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:43.230
do we have over Q. This delta
doesn't have to be lambda QCD.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.350
It could be something
much bigger.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.855
Another way of thinking about
physically what this delta is

00:32:48.855 --> 00:32:52.570
is to calculate something
called the jet mass.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:33:01.260
So you could define the mass of
the jet as the sum of the four

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:10.510
vectors in hemisphere a of
all the particles squared.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.010
And if you ask about how big
that is, in these coordinates

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.650
that we're using, it's P
plus times P minus minus P

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.460
perp squared.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.980
If we align things so
that this thing is really

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.260
aligned with the jet, there
won't be any P perp squared.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.910
But that wouldn't change us
scaling our given anyway.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.820
So basically, if you ask
about what this jet mass is,

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.970
it's scaling like a P
plus times a P minus.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.630
And it's scaling
like delta squared.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:43.230
So the jet mass is something
of order delta squared.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.490
And that's much
less than Q squared.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:48.030
So another way of characterizing
that you have a jet

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.670
is to measure the invariant
mass of all the particles

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.020
in this hemisphere.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.390
And if that invariant
mass is small relative

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:58.320
to the hard scale, then
it's collimated, OK?

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:05.040
So MJ squared Q squared
much less than 1 also

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.060
means collimated.

00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:13.050
So we could talk about
it either in terms

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.060
of perpendicular spread,
or we could talk about it

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.960
as an invariant mass.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.183
OK.

00:34:22.183 --> 00:34:25.620
So this is much less than 1.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:29.639
Now, with this delta, we
didn't specify what it is.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:31.980
So what are possible
values of delta?

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.400
Well, let's first talk
about what it's not.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.739
If delta was of order
Q, then obviously

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.530
we'd break the kind of scaling
that we have here that this

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.525
should be much less than 1.

00:34:42.525 --> 00:34:44.775
And what happens in that
case is we don't have dijets.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:52.600
So if either the mass MJ
squared of the particles

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.130
becomes of order Q squared
or the perpendicular spread

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.751
becomes of order Q, then we
don't have dijets anymore.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.230
And basically, in
this case, you would

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:14.490
be talking about inclusive
sum over our jets

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.740
And that would be something
that you would actually

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.115
describe in a different way
in the effective field theory

00:35:19.115 --> 00:35:22.500
because you wouldn't then have
collinear degrees of freedom

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.550
for this jet.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.570
It's really picking
out the dijet process

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:27.653
that means that these
collinear degrees of freedom

00:35:27.653 --> 00:35:28.500
are relevant.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.410
If you did just e plus e minus
to hadrons, that's something

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:33.720
you could do with an
operator product expansion

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.940
without ever talking about SCET.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.520
And that would be valid
if you were really

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.860
doing an inclusive sum
over jets in all directions

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.950
without any restrictions
that tell you it's a dijet.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.560
And then the effect of
power counting in your OPE

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.290
would be such that
delta is of order Q.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.970
So this is actually
the OPE region.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:01.170
Let me call it the OPE region
of Peskin or any other field

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:01.680
theory book.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.710
Another thing we could
do is we could take delta

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.460
to be very small.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.830
We could take delta all
the way down to lambda QCD.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.870
And that's also not a jet.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.610
If delta is of order
lambda QCD, what

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.770
happens with the
spray of radiation

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.960
is that it gets
bound into a hadron.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.130
It just can't separate.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:44.490
Confinement grabs it, and you
get an energetic hadron, not

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:44.990
a jet.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:04.498
So if the jets get too narrow,
in particular this narrow,

00:37:04.498 --> 00:37:06.415
then the constituents
are bound into a hadron.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.920
And that might be something
you want to talk about,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.420
but it wouldn't be talking about
e plus e minus, the dijets.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.545
You'd be talking about e
plus e minus to pi plus pi

00:37:18.545 --> 00:37:19.789
minus or something.

00:37:33.858 --> 00:37:35.650
And then you'd actually
use this other SCET

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:37.450
that we were talking
about a moment ago,

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:39.790
not the one for jets.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.130
OK, so anything kind of in
between these two regions

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.010
much greater than lambda
QCD, much less than Q,

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.050
then we can talk about
it as being jets.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.020
OK.

00:38:06.223 --> 00:38:07.640
So we figure out
what region we're

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.500
interested in by figuring
out what region we're not

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.083
interested in.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.770
So that was one jet.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.680
And kind of by symmetry we
can talk about the other one.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.700
So there's this one
that I called n2.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.850
The simplest way of
invoking symmetry

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:30.300
is to take n1 to point
along n, which is our,

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.790
say 0, 0, minus 1.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:38.820
And then just take n2 to be n
bar, which is 1, 0, 0, plus 1.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.920
And then the description
of the n2 jet

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.810
is the same as the
description of the n1 jet.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.477
It's just you switch
pluses and minuses.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.140
Remember that what
defines plus and minus

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.440
depends on the
choice of this n bar.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.120
A priori, that choice of n
bar has nothing to do with n2.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.160
And this is just a
different physical vector.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.770
Both n1 and n2 are physical.

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.210
And bar is an auxiliary vector.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.010
But if I just happened
to choose that n2

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.050
is equal to that
auxiliary vector,

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.480
then it makes things simple.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.660
Because we just have a
relation between the two

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.495
sets of degrees of freedom, this
swapping pluses and minuses.

00:39:30.555 --> 00:39:31.055
OK.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.890
So that's actually not
the end of the story

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:41.400
of the degrees of freedom here.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.100
And that is because, even
if we make restrictions

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.040
to getting these dijets, we can
still have soft radiation that

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.427
is between the jets.

00:39:49.427 --> 00:39:51.510
And so this one's a little
less intuitive perhaps.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.780
So I'll call these
guys ultra soft modes.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.330
And I'll label them
by US for Ultra Soft.

00:40:13.412 --> 00:40:15.870
And one way of thinking about
physically what they're doing

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.412
is that they're allowing you to
communicate between the jets.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.770
There can be radiation that's
radiated from one jet that

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.450
interferes with the other jet.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.427
This is a homogeneous
type of radiation,

00:40:42.427 --> 00:40:44.760
so it has the same scaling
in the plus, minus, and perp.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.860
So this is for these
ultra soft modes.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.970
If I compare this to the
scaling that we have for, say,

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:58.430
the n collinear modes--

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.450
so let me call that Pn--

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:05.310
that was delta squared
over Q Q delta.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:09.930
And if I make the mirror
for the other jet,

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:15.910
then I would switch these two
delta squared over Q delta.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.790
So when I say
communicate, what I mean

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:20.760
is that these guys can
talk to both of these guys

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.503
without interfering
with their scaling.

00:41:24.503 --> 00:41:26.670
So if they're not going to
interfere with this guy's

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:29.523
scaling, they better have plus
momentum that's the same size.

00:41:29.523 --> 00:41:31.440
If it was any bigger,
then we'd have a problem

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.190
because they'd interfere
with this scaling

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.800
when they tried to communicate.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.500
And then likewise for
the minus, they better

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.972
have scaling of the same size.

00:41:38.972 --> 00:41:39.930
And then perp is fixed.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:53.930
So the word communicate here
in the way I'm defining it

00:41:53.930 --> 00:42:01.740
means sharing momenta
of a common size--

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:20.760
well, means sharing momenta and
not taking the other particle

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.782
off-shell.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.250
OK.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.290
So we can draw a picture
for this one, too.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:36.890
Like we have our SCET2 picture,
we could draw an SCET1 picture.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.600
And that helps.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:45.320
Pictures always help to make
words more palatable, more

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.446
absorbable.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:43:04.220
So same type of picture where
you have P minus and P plus,

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.540
we also can think about
things in terms of hyperbola

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.235
of constant invariant mass.

00:43:09.235 --> 00:43:15.530
We now have some collinear
modes for the n1 direction.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:22.990
There's going to be
some purple collinear

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.618
modes for the n2 directions.

00:43:25.618 --> 00:43:27.160
There's going to be
these soft modes.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.380
And then we could also
have some hard modes

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.290
that we want to integrate out.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.700
So these are the
ultra soft modes.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.700
So the reason that I call them
ultra soft rather than soft

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.100
is because, by soft,
we meant something

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.530
that sat on the same hyperbola.

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.330
And here it sits on
a lower hyperbola,

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.320
so it should be softer.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.550
So we call it ultra soft.

00:43:59.288 --> 00:44:00.830
This is the hyperbola
where P squared

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:01.913
is of order delta squared.

00:44:01.913 --> 00:44:05.060
This is the hyperbola where
P squared is of order delta

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.620
4 over Q squared.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.230
If you square any
one of these guys,

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.780
you get delta 4 over Q squared.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.550
And up here, is P
squared over Q squared.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.710
And this kind of
thing is called SCET1.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.850
So what does it
mean to communicate?

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.680
Well, it means that there's two
momenta that are the same size.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:35.440
So the fact that I tried to
line this up as best I could,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.880
partially succeeding, is
what I mean by communicate.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.737
These things are the
same size in the plus.

00:44:41.737 --> 00:44:43.570
These things are the
same size in the minus.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:59.062
And if we want to put in kind
of how big these things are,

00:44:59.062 --> 00:45:00.000
we would say that.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.070
So the scaling of
the ultra soft,

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.750
unlike the scaling
the soft, the ultra

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.120
soft in all component
scales like lambda squared.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.290
So in terms of
scaling parameters,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.850
we would say that
it goes like this.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.670
And here, we're not
talking about soft.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.808
It would have lambda
in all components.

00:45:51.193 --> 00:45:53.110
So this is the effective
theory that turns out

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.318
to be the right one for jets.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.070
And whenever you have
this kind of situation

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.680
where you've got collinear modes
that are living on a higher

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.230
hyperbola than the
soft modes, which

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.920
you call ultra soft modes,
that's an SCET1 type theory.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.480
And these two actually
cover a wide range

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.330
of phenomenology, these
two particular cases, SCET1

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:21.830
and SCET2.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:30.070
OK, questions?

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.843
We'll talk a little bit
more about this picture.

00:46:32.843 --> 00:46:34.510
AUDIENCE: Do you think
of the soft modes

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:40.288
as being smaller than or
equal to lambda squared?

00:46:40.288 --> 00:46:41.080
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.200
So you can ask,
now, how should I

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.920
think about drawing the blobs
around these things, right?

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.400
And you still should
think about these things

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.750
with blobs like that.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:02.420
But then it becomes a
question which we didn't have,

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.900
which was kind of more obvious
actually in the SCET1 case.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.570
And that is kind of how these
things overlap with the axes.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.730
And we'll come back and
talk about that later.

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.730
But I think, for now,
just think of them

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:17.270
as being localized in that way.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:20.390
In the case of the softs in
the collinear we had before,

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:22.640
you can think of them as
uniformly kind of coming down

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.970
into the infrared.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.820
Here, it's not like
that because this guy

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.380
is more infrared to begin with.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.520
And that will have
some impact later on.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.510
OK.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.820
So what are the
important features here?

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.515
Well, we see this
idea that I mentioned

00:47:45.515 --> 00:47:49.310
would occur that we
have multiple modes

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:52.100
for the infrared.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.440
And you can try to get
away with not doing

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.540
that, but then you would
have a lot of trouble

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.400
with your power counting.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.310
And since power counting, as
I've convinced you hopefully

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:03.890
by now, is just as
important as other things

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:06.260
when you're designing
an effective theory,

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.470
you really don't want
to mess with that.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.290
And so you're forced
into a situation where

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.240
you start talking about
having multiple fields

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.850
for the same degrees of
freedom because the scaling

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.160
of the momentum in different
regions of the space

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.333
you're interested in
is just different.

00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:23.750
So the derivatives that are
corresponding to those momenta

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.340
are going to scale differently.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.320
And if that's the
case, you're going

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.360
to need to have multiple
fields to describe

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.360
those different regions.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.250
We'll also see the power
counting is different.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.530
So you can ask, what
are you integrating out?

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.430
And we're still
taking the attitude

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:54.300
that we integrate out modes
that are off-shell and so

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.830
above a given hyperbola.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.320
So that part of our story
of effective field theory

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.230
is really the same.

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:04.720
It's just that, when we
describe the low energy modes,

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.970
we need more than one of them.

00:49:14.863 --> 00:49:16.530
So what we mean by
off-shell is the same

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:17.910
as it always has meant.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:24.420
Off-shell modes
get integrated out.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:29.654
Those are modes with large P
squared, like the hard modes.

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.037
So one natural
question when you're

00:50:00.037 --> 00:50:01.870
talking about these
effective field theories

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:05.440
is, how do I know I
have all the modes?

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:09.320
And that's a good question.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.317
And there's been examples
in the literature

00:50:11.317 --> 00:50:13.900
where people wrote papers where
they didn't know all the modes

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.480
and modes were missing.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.130
So it's not even an
academic question.

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.710
It's really a pitfall in some
sense that you can fall into.

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:24.790
So I take the following
attitude towards that question.

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.110
You should attack
it from all sides.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.260
So one is that you
should really physically

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.760
think about what
the modes are doing

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.650
and have a physical
description of why

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:34.900
those modes are something
relevant for your effective

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:35.300
field theory.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.883
After all, your
effective field theory

00:50:36.883 --> 00:50:40.160
is supposed to be a description
of nature and infrared physics.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.160
So there should be something
physical associated

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.020
to what those models are doing.

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.730
That's the physics side.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.530
Calculationally,
there's various ways

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:48.975
that you could approach this.

00:50:48.975 --> 00:50:50.350
So one thing you
can do, which is

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:52.420
sort of an order
by order thing, is

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.450
you can just calculate
results at one loop

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.300
and make sure you match
up infrared divergences.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.910
Because if you don't match
up the infrared divergences,

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:03.670
then you're missing some
infrared degree of freedom

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:05.810
in the effective field theory.

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:06.310
OK.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:18.800
So that's one way you
can check for the modes.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.790
So if you can either do
physics, or you can calculate.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:26.990
And when you
calculate, there's also

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:28.710
something called the
method of regions,

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:32.720
which is a nice way of thinking
about trying to discover modes,

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.240
which basically says that, any
full theory calculation I can

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.540
do, I can do that
calculation by dividing up

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.520
the integrand into regions.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.610
And if I'm using
dimensional regularization,

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:48.390
then the full theory answer
is just the sum over regions.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:53.030
So you can just
calculate using some EFT,

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:56.000
as I described to
you, and check it.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:00.620
Or could do a different way.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:07.940
You could say, calculate
the full theory result

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.090
with something called
the method of regions.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:12.590
And that's just a
way of calculating

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:15.110
the full theory of
result, but it's

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:21.080
a way of telling you what
regions are important.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.030
There's all-other
theorems in QCD

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:26.843
about what regions can
give infrared divergences.

00:52:26.843 --> 00:52:28.385
And that's another
thing you can use.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.650
And I won't talk about this last
one or actually about this one.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.440
So these are different
ways that you

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.890
could look for what are the
relevant degrees of freedom.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:56.200
And actually, when
we started SCET,

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.140
we didn't separate between
ultra soft and soft.

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.070
We had both of them
at the same time.

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:04.070
And the reason was we
knew that in some examples

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.670
we needed soft and some
examples we needed ultra soft.

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:09.130
And we were thinking of it
as one theory, not SCET1

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:10.415
and SCET2.

00:53:10.415 --> 00:53:12.790
And then at some point, we
realized that all the examples

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:14.860
we were doing, as we did
more and more examples,

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.630
they broke into these
two categories, one

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:18.760
for jets, one for hadrons.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.380
And so we were finding
that, for example,

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.232
if you add a soft
mode to this picture,

00:53:23.232 --> 00:53:24.940
it just ends up being
totally irrelevant.

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.607
And you can just
absorb it or remove it.

00:53:26.607 --> 00:53:28.210
You don't need it.

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.640
And likewise, if you tried
to put an ultra soft mode

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.430
into the example of
energetic hadrons,

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:35.110
you'd find you don't need it.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:38.210
So you could put too many
degrees of freedom in as well.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.995
It's not just that you
could have too few.

00:53:40.995 --> 00:53:42.370
You could put more
than you need,

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:44.412
and then you would see
from your calculations

00:53:44.412 --> 00:53:46.120
that you actually had
more than you need.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.160
The reason I'm
spending time on this

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.390
is because this is, in some
sense, the tricky part.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:54.973
Once we know what
the modes are, we'll

00:53:54.973 --> 00:53:57.190
just get the effective
field theory and go.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:02.415
AUDIENCE: Is your second
point here the method

00:54:02.415 --> 00:54:05.400
or regions [INAUDIBLE],, is that
any different than the check it

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.828
of the first point?

00:54:06.828 --> 00:54:07.620
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.750
Because, here, what I'm
saying is hypothesize

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:11.160
some effective field theory.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.510
AUDIENCE: But check
it means full theory.

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.300
IAIN STEWART: And then check
it against the full theory.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:14.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:16.320
IAIN STEWART: And so
the direction here

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.480
is that you write
down something,

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.630
and you do calculations
in two theories.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.240
And you make sure they agree.

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.950
Here, it's a little
bit different

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:29.310
because there may not be a
one-to-one correspondence

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.140
of the modes of the
method of regions.

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.730
Method of regions
is not technically

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:35.100
exactly what the
effective theory is.

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.005
So this can give you hints about
what the effective theory is.

00:54:38.005 --> 00:54:39.630
Then you basically
go back and do this,

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:42.360
but it sort of helps you
because you have most

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.470
of the calculations to do this.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.970
Yeah.

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:46.380
So technically, they're
a little bit different,

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:47.505
but they're pretty related.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.330
OK.

00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:01.060
So in the example
we had here, it

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.400
was a little more complicated
than our B to D pi example

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.550
because we had three
things in the infrared.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:08.710
And you could ask the
question, is there something

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:09.670
with just one jet?

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:12.550
The reason we had three things
is because we had two jets.

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:15.760
We had the purple
jet and the pink jet.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.450
And we can come up with a
process with only one jet.

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:20.980
So let me give you
a third example.

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:31.150
If we have something recoiling
against the jet that's

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:32.980
electromagnetic, like
a photon, then we

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.600
could just have one jet.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.670
So one way of doing that
is to look at a process

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:41.080
like b to s gamma, where you
say that really what you want

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:47.920
is B to one jet plus a photon.

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.600
And that's a region
of phase space

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:54.460
in b to s gamma, where
the picture over there

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.190
just has one jet.

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:01.360
And so it's the same
picture, but now we just

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.140
have our pink jet.

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:15.410
So the right modes
for this picture

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:19.175
for this process in the region
where you just have one jet

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:21.920
would be like this where this is
hard and you integrate it out.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.590
And you just have two things in
the infrared, a Cn and an ultra

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:26.090
soft.

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:33.140
In this case, you also have
to ask the question, what

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.160
is the hydronic process?

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.870
Well, it has to B meson.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:37.910
What are the things
inside the B meson

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:39.380
that are binding it together?

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.320
And you would make those
the ultra soft modes.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.630
So in this process
here, it's very natural

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:50.960
to take P squared of this lowest
line to be lambda QCD squared.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.440
And then these guys are
binding the B meson there,

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:55.695
the soft modes of the B meson.

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:12.620
This collinear hyperbola for
the jet lives somewhere between.

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.790
And this here, in this case,
would be something of order

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:19.512
the B quark mass squared, OK?

00:57:19.512 --> 00:57:21.470
So that's a little bit
different than over here

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:24.470
where there was kind
of a no natural--

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.300
this thing was set
by kind of what

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.210
we chose to do with the
jets was setting this.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:31.195
Here, there's kind
of a natural scale

00:57:31.195 --> 00:57:32.570
where you know
that there's going

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:34.095
to be some degrees of freedom.

00:57:34.095 --> 00:57:35.720
And so it's very
natural, in this case,

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.060
to take that as an input.

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.370
And then you could
actually figure out,

00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:45.890
given that what the jets should
be and the jets would have,

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:49.640
lambda QCD times Mb,
which is in the middle.

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:56.880
So that's kind of a natural
scaling for the b to s

00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.000
gamma process, OK?

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.840
So just to give you an
idea how, if I have a jet,

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.480
it's going to look
something like this,

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.980
it might not look
exactly like that.

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:10.117
It depends on how
many jets you have.

00:58:10.117 --> 00:58:11.700
And of course, these
pictures actually

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.908
get more complicated if you
try to start drawing them

00:58:13.908 --> 00:58:16.500
when you have three jets
because then the plane

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.590
is no longer enough.

00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:24.490
All right, so any
more questions?

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:25.150
OK.

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:29.020
So when we did HQET, the
first thing that we did

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.940
is we started to expand.

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:33.220
Before we designed the
effective Lagrangian,

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.580
we just said, well, what happens
if I expand the full theory?

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.493
And I'm going to take
the same attitude here.

00:58:39.493 --> 00:58:41.410
Let's just write down
some full theory objects

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:47.920
and expand them in the limits
that we've been talking about.

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.920
And then we'll see what
kind of effective theory

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:52.950
we want based on the results
from those expansions.

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:02.840
So let's start with spinners
in a collinear limit.

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.800
So let me start with some
massless QCD spinners

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.270
in the Dirac representation.

00:59:21.685 --> 00:59:23.310
We could use some
other representation,

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:25.170
but let's just use Dirac.

00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:45.430
So we have spinners
for the quarks.

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:56.890
We have spinners for
the antiquarks, V,

00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:58.750
where this curly
V and this curly U

00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:59.935
are two-component objects.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.370
I'll make sure it
looks curly enough.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.540
So what we can do
here is we can expand.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.970
And you see that what
happens when you expand

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.880
is that you can think about
the P3 vector being larger

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.740
than P1 and P2.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:33.430
So let's just let our n be
1, 0, 0, 1 and our n bar

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.693
be 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

01:00:35.693 --> 01:00:37.360
So they're back to
back with each other.

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:43.790
Whether I put the plus
or minus 1 there or there

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:46.070
doesn't really matter.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:52.660
Let's expand in n bar
dot P, which in this case

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:58.240
is P0 plus P3 being much greater
than P perp, just P1 and P2.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.760
And then that's
much greater than n

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.220
dot P, which is P0 minus P3.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:11.930
And what that means is that
you can approximate sigma dot P

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:14.870
over P0 from these
massless particles.

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:18.498
It's just sigma 3 because
you pick out the P3.

01:01:18.498 --> 01:01:19.540
That's the big component.

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.920
The P1 and P2, you can drop.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.330
Then it kicks out the sigma 3.

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:24.548
And then P3 is also
the same size as P0,

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:25.840
so you're just getting sigma 3.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:36.530
So what you get
from this then would

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:39.830
be guys that look like this.

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.350
Just so, I put it in
the two possibilities

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:49.670
for the curly U are
four-component spinners that

01:01:49.670 --> 01:02:22.830
look like this for U and
then likewise for V of P.

01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:24.550
We can work out what we get.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.878
We get that.

01:02:31.878 --> 01:02:33.920
So this is actually a
little different than HQET.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.450
In HQET, what you
would have found

01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:39.330
is that the antiquarks would
have been just left out.

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:42.110
And the quarks would've
been there in the theory.

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.892
Here, both of them survive.

01:02:43.892 --> 01:02:45.350
And actually two
degrees of freedom

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:49.190
survive for both the particles
and the antiparticles.

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:50.810
So it's not like
we're integrating out

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:57.260
of something like the
antiparticle, like in HQET.

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:59.090
By this expansion, we
still have all four

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:02.330
of these degrees of freedom if
you count degrees of freedom

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.420
by whether you have particles,
antiparticles, and spin states.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.870
Nevertheless, there is a
simplification that occurs.

01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:18.870
And that is the fact that
the spinners that you have

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:19.995
have a projection relation.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:29.510
So if you look in
this basis that we're

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.810
talking about here, what n
slash is if you write down

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:38.048
what the gamma matrices are
in the Dirac representation,

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:40.760
then n slash is this.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.250
And another useful
thing is n slash n bar

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:50.530
slash over 4, which you
can work out as just this.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:04:00.420
And these spinners here,
which I need a name for--

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.920
so let's call this
Un and call this Vn.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:15.540
They satisfy n slash
Un is n slash Vn is 0.

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:21.252
And they also satisfy
n slash n bar slash

01:04:21.252 --> 01:04:25.460
Un is Un for both of them.

01:04:42.015 --> 01:04:43.890
So what we can do with
that is the following.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:51.000
We can take the identity
in this 4 by 4 space.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.550
And we can actually
write it as n

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:59.190
slash n bar slash over 4 plus
n bar slash n slash over 4.

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:02.770
And that's because,
remember, that gamma mu

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:09.300
gamma nu plus 2 g mu nu
and n dot n bar is 2.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.510
So this is just one
way of using those.

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:15.480
This is the anticommutator
dotted into n and n bar.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.370
So I can write it out that way.

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:20.340
And this kind of formula
here is the formula

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:24.090
that is for projection
operators, right?

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:27.640
So as you act with the operator,
you get that guy back again.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.540
So you could act twice
with that operator.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.080
And so what you can
do with this one

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.255
is you could let one
act on psi of QCD.

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:44.720
And if you did that, you'd get
n slash n bar slash over 4 psi

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.780
plus n bar slash n
slash over 4 psi.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.390
And you could define
these two pieces

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:53.670
as being two different
components of the full theory

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:59.230
field that I'll
call Cn and psi n.

01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:00.760
And what happens
at high energies,

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.070
because of the type of thing
we were doing over there,

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.960
is that we only like
to produce Cn's.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.730
We don't like to
produce psi n bars.

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:18.530
So if you look at some
high energy process,

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:20.540
this sort of thing I was
doing at the spinners

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:24.320
basically boils down
to one sentence.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.770
And that is that we
produce or annihilate

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:29.690
the components,
the guys that live

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:44.890
in this Cn, not the so-called
small components, which

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:47.380
live in this other guy.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.532
This language of calling
them the small components

01:06:49.532 --> 01:06:52.115
is something that goes back to
the early days of QCD actually.

01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:58.450
We may say that
word a few times,

01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:03.630
but the history won't
be so important to us.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:05.457
OK, so, so much
for the spinners.

01:07:05.457 --> 01:07:07.290
There is some simplification
in the spinners

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:11.340
because we do like to
produce certain combinations.

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:18.360
But it didn't really teach
us too much beyond that.

01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:29.140
And we didn't see that we
lost a degree of freedom

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.020
like we did in HQET.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.900
But nevertheless, there
was some simplification.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:43.715
Let's do the same thing for
the propagator of the quarks.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.640
Take the propagator of the full
theory, expand in this limit.

01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:59.200
So first of all,
propagators always

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.690
involve P squared plus i0.

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.120
In our decomposition,
that's in n bar

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:11.197
dot P n dot P plus Minkowski
P perp squared plus i0.

01:08:11.197 --> 01:08:13.030
And if you look at the
size of these things,

01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:14.450
they're all the same size.

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:18.939
This guy is lambda 0, and
this guy is lambda squared.

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:21.260
And this guy is just
lambda squared by itself.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.689
So the two guys
are the same size,

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:25.858
although they become the same
size for different regions.

01:08:25.858 --> 01:08:28.779
This is lambda 1
squared if you like.

01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:32.050
So I don't drop anything
in that propagator.

01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:40.040
And you see that actually
that's not entirely true.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.430
And it does depend on
what type of things

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:43.430
you're interacting with.

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:48.319
But if I just have P's that are
collinear, as I've drawn here,

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.729
then there's nothing to drop.

01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:04.525
So if you look at fermions
that are collinear

01:09:04.525 --> 01:09:10.540
and you look at i P slash
over P squared plus i0,

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.547
you can decompose P slash
out in terms of n slash

01:09:13.547 --> 01:09:15.130
and n bar slash,
write it out in terms

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:17.649
of the coordinates we're using.

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:23.722
And then in the numerator,
you keep the full denominator.

01:09:23.722 --> 01:09:25.930
But in the numerator, there
is one momentum component

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:27.939
that's larger than the others.

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:31.090
And that is the n bar dot P
piece, which is order one.

01:09:41.026 --> 01:09:42.859
So there is a simplification
of the P slash.

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:45.073
And it's related in some
ways to the simplification

01:09:45.073 --> 01:09:45.740
of the spinners.

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:50.149
If you take two of these guys
and you do the sum over spin,

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:57.202
you'll actually get n
slash over 2 n bar dot P.

01:09:57.202 --> 01:10:00.660
AUDIENCE: Is it n slash
on the side of the 0?

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.470
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:02.345
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:02.345 --> 01:10:04.928
IAIN STEWART: So the right way
of thinking about the numerator

01:10:04.928 --> 01:10:07.470
here is that, if you do the
sum over spins of sort of two

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:12.210
of these spinners,
like this, that's

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:14.200
giving you the numerator.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.330
And if you look at sort
of the overlap of this,

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:19.980
if you look at any
amplitude, you also

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.770
have to take into account,
but I haven't written yet--

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.250
which is this.

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:28.910
And that's going to
go like n bar slash.

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:31.960
So what happens is you
have n slash, n bar slash.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.920
And that gives
you the projector,

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.480
which then overlaps
order 1 with the spinner.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.145
Yeah.

01:10:38.145 --> 01:10:39.270
But that's a good question.

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:48.880
Later-- but that's a good point.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:13.840
OK.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:19.540
So we can ask about, if we have
some propagator for a fermion,

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.770
then what does it look like?

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:25.240
And you can take that
first order term,

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.440
and we can write it in a way
that kind of is reminiscent

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.280
of something more like
NRQCD or this nucleon theory

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.515
or even HQET.

01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:40.870
It's just another way of
writing the same formula that

01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:43.810
is sometimes useful.

01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:46.300
We just divide through
by the n bar dot P.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:49.585
And then it's n dot P plus
P perp squared over n bar

01:11:49.585 --> 01:11:53.050
dot P. And then there's the
i0, but the sign of the i0

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:56.740
will depend on the sign
of the n bar dot P.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.890
The fact that this could
be both plus i0 or minus i0

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:02.740
is the same thing as saying
that there's antiparticles

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.540
and particles in the theory.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.880
If it was just plus
i0, as it was in HQET,

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.930
we only had the particles.

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:10.180
Here, it could be either sign.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:11.420
We have both.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.510
And so this thing,
again, has both particles

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:17.650
and antiparticles, which
we saw when we were

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:18.820
doing the spinners as well.

01:12:31.965 --> 01:12:34.340
And if we want to think about
particles and antiparticles

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.840
separately, then we could have
a definite sign for the i0's.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.340
But if we want to think about
them in a combined propagator,

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.690
then we have to
write it this way.

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:46.430
All right, so once we know
what the propagator is,

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:50.480
then we can also figure
out what the power counting

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.390
of the fields are because
the propagator tells us

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:57.890
what the kinetic term should
look like of the Lagrangian.

01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:05.280
So let me show you
how that works.

01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:14.190
So where does the
propagator come from?

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:17.220
The propagator comes
from the time order

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.560
product of two fields.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.160
And in this case, it comes
from the time order product

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.990
of a field for this Cn component
that we were talking about.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:37.960
And if we just take the
free kinetic term, which

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.200
is the Lagrangian that
we'd give that propagator,

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:48.130
that's enough to determine
the power counting for fields,

01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:50.390
as is always the case in
any effective field theory.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:58.600
So we haven't figured out
what the Lagrangian is,

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.870
but we know something about
what it's going to look like.

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:05.200
So let me write
down enough of that

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.840
to determine for you what the
power counting would look like.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.270
So when I read it this
way, as I wrote it,

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:17.150
where it's linear in
this n dot P derivative,

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:19.150
you know that what that's
going to correspond to

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:22.780
in the Lagrangian is
some n dot partial.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:25.960
And I have to have
an n bar slash here

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.110
because that always comes
along with an n decomposing

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:30.610
the metric.

01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:32.680
If you ask about the
power counting here,

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.730
well, d4x has all
4 components of k.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.040
And x is the inverse of k.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.410
So the way that you
assign a power counting

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:45.370
for x is that you say the
phase should be of order 1.

01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:49.210
So the scaling for x
is the opposite of k.

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:54.550
So that fixes that d4x should
be lambda to the minus 4.

01:14:54.550 --> 01:15:02.590
So x plus times k minus
is of order 1, et cetera.

01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:05.260
And that tells you
how many powers

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.110
to associate with the d4x.

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:10.360
We know how many powers to
associate with this partial

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.480
because that was our momentum.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.363
That's lambda squared.

01:15:15.363 --> 01:15:16.780
And actually, the
other terms here

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.367
will also be lambda squared.

01:15:19.367 --> 01:15:20.950
And then we just
say, well, that's let

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:25.240
the power counting in this field
be arbitrary lambda to the a.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.150
And so if we do that, then
we get an overall scaling

01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:33.850
for this Lagrangian that's
lambda to the 2a minus 2.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.940
2 to the power of the lambda
minus 4 cancel by the partial n

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:42.640
dot partial and we get that.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.070
Now, the way that we do
effective field theory is we

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.620
look at the lowest order
term, and we count everything

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.460
relative to that.

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:55.600
So what we do is we say, we
want the lowest order Lagrangian

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.330
to scale like lambda to the 0.

01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:00.960
And you can think of
that roughly in a power

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.240
counting sense as normalizing
the free kinetic term

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.190
or normalizing the
kinetic term in general.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.660
And then, once you
do that, then you

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.430
fix what the
scaling of the field

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:22.750
is, Cn to the order lambda.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:31.020
And that's different
than the mass dimension.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.550
So I said that we
were going to be

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:34.175
doing a power counting
that's different

01:16:34.175 --> 01:16:36.240
than the mass dimension.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.900
If we looked at the mass
dimension of this field,

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:46.380
Cn would have mass dimension
that's 3/2, whereas it has,

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.740
if you like, a lambda power
counting dimension which is 1.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:57.048
So if I look for the
powers of lambda, that's 1.

01:16:57.048 --> 01:16:59.590
And that was one of the things
I told you was going to happen

01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:01.087
is that, in this
effective theory,

01:17:01.087 --> 01:17:02.920
we wouldn't just be
counting mass dimension.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.300
We'd be counting something else.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:14.540
OK.

01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.550
So that's collinear quarks.

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:20.738
We can do a similar thing
for collinear gluons.

01:17:20.738 --> 01:17:23.030
And we may not get to the
end of that discussion today,

01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.822
but let's start it.

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.040
The momenta for
a collinear gluon

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:37.023
scales the same as the
momenta for a collinear quark.

01:17:37.023 --> 01:17:38.690
That means collinear
doesn't distinguish

01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.970
between quarks and gluons.

01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:42.590
So P squared, the
full P squared,

01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:47.510
is still something that we're
going to leave together.

01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:51.740
And let's just consider
looking at the propagator

01:17:51.740 --> 01:18:00.320
in a general covariant
gauge and asking

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.860
kind of the same type of
thing that we did over here

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.330
about the scaling of the field.

01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:17.760
So the propagator for
two collinear gluons

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.950
and the general
covariant gauge--

01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:23.160
time order product vacuum
matrix element of two fields.

01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:28.440
Ignore the subscript
ends right now.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:35.983
I'm just writing down
a full theory result.

01:18:35.983 --> 01:18:37.650
We called C something
else, so we better

01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:39.060
not make that gauge parameter.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.740
So let me call the
gauge parameter tau.

01:18:53.723 --> 01:18:56.140
That's the gauge parameter of
the general covariant gauge.

01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.790
And this is a full three result.

01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:00.880
The thing that
makes it collinear

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.980
is if we say that k has
a collinear scaling.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:14.340
So as above, k squared is k plus
k minus plus k perp squared.

01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.970
That's of order lambda
squared, and there's

01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:20.347
no expansion in there.

01:19:20.347 --> 01:19:21.680
And there's two k squareds here.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.230
There's one there,
and there's one there.

01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:28.220
And if you start looking
at g mu nu minus k mu k nu

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:31.550
over k squared, you also
find that the terms there

01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:34.670
are the same size.

01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:38.500
So there's actually--
let's see how that works.

01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:54.830
So let's do an example of that.

01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:58.210
So g perp you knew was just 1.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.310
So that's obviously something
that has no scaling.

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:05.400
And if you compare that to
k perp mu k perp nu over k

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.620
squared, k perp
scale like lambda. k

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.200
squared scales like
lambda squared.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.117
So this is lambda squared
over lambda squared.

01:20:12.117 --> 01:20:14.140
So that's also lambda to the 0.

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.610
So both the g perp mu nu
and the k perp nu term

01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:18.600
are the same size.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.100
Yeah.

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.950
AUDIENCE: If it happened
that it didn't work out,

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:23.375
could you choose the gauge
parameter have a [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:23.375 --> 01:20:23.875
with lambda?

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:25.500
IAIN STEWART: You
could, but then you'd

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.040
be restricted to
the classic gauges

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.290
that you would be able to
use in the effective theory.

01:20:29.290 --> 01:20:31.707
And then you have to ask what
gauge invariance would mean.

01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:38.350
If I don't make any
restrictions on tau,

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:40.010
I don't assign a
power counting to it,

01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:43.960
that means my effective theory
should allow all these gauges.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.652
And I actually want that.

01:20:46.652 --> 01:20:47.610
That's a good question.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.920
You can do the same
thing looking at,

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.280
for example, g plus g minus.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:00.720
That's also 1, so lambda 0.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.802
Then you get k plus k
minus over k squared.

01:21:03.802 --> 01:21:05.760
That's also lambda squared
over lambda squared.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.510
So this is what I was
saying, that the two

01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:09.330
terms are the same size.

01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:14.730
If you dot in n mu n nu,
that kills the g mu nu.

01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:18.090
g plus plus is 0.

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:21.180
And then you just
get k plus squared

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:26.670
over k squared, which
is lambda to the 1/4

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:30.010
over lambda squared,
which is lambda squared.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:33.450
So when the g mu nu is not
1, then the k mu k nu term

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:35.220
can still determine
how big something is.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:39.735
And that's what would happen
for these off-diagonal terms.

01:21:39.735 --> 01:21:41.610
So if we go through the
same type of exercise

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:45.947
that we did for the fermion,
d4x scales like 1 over k

01:21:45.947 --> 01:21:46.530
to the fourth.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.950
So that's lambda to the
minus 4, just as before.

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:58.170
And actually, if we were
to do the following,

01:21:58.170 --> 01:22:01.220
if we were to write this as--

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:02.810
I should have done
that up there.

01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:04.910
If we were to write
it as minus i over k

01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:12.410
to the fourth k squared g
mu nu minus tau k mu k nu,

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:15.290
the k to the fourth just
matches up with the d4x.

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:17.180
So those take care
of each other.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:20.930
And then the fields here have
to match up with the rest.

01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:26.420
So the scaling of this should
be the scaling of the A mu A nu.

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.335
And that basically means
that A mu in A nu scale

01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:29.960
like a momenta.

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:43.300
So A mu n for this collinear
gluon scales like k mu, scales

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.605
like lambda squared 1 lambda.

01:22:54.907 --> 01:22:56.240
Let me write that one more time.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.220
And that's also a nice
thing because it also

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.770
means you could form a
covariate derivative that's

01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:19.610
homogeneous by
combining together,

01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:23.410
if I write it this
way, k mu and g A mu.

01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:27.640
I can get a covariant derivative
where, for each component of k,

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.390
I also have a component
of the gauge field

01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:30.440
that's the same size.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.530
So you could have
argued it, originally

01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:36.010
just from gauge invariance, that
you want to sort of have fields

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.450
that are of the same
size as your momenta,

01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:40.360
but we did it a little
bit differently here.

01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:58.090
So it's nice that
that comes out.

01:23:58.090 --> 01:23:59.945
This all hangs together.

01:23:59.945 --> 01:24:01.570
So next time, we'll
talk about the fact

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:03.730
that what does it mean that the
gauge field has components that

01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:04.940
are scaling in a different way.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.273
And particularly, there's a
component of the gauge field

01:24:07.273 --> 01:24:08.200
that's order 1.

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.510
There's no power suppression
for that component.

01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:14.126
And we'll talk about what
implications that has.

01:24:14.126 --> 01:24:16.210
Yeah.

01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:20.194
AUDIENCE: So what about in the
non-variant case, like n bar

01:24:20.194 --> 01:24:21.190
of A equals 0?

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:21.982
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:24:21.982 --> 01:24:25.270
So you could go through this
argument in that gauge as well,

01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:27.210
and it will work.

01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:29.677
AUDIENCE: But you have n
bar to the A equals 0, so--

01:24:29.677 --> 01:24:31.010
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, that's fine.

01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:32.620
That's just a
restriction on the-- you

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.150
can still assign
a scaling to it.

01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.550
And a special choice if it is 0.

01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:40.600
Scaling and values of things
are not the same thing, right?

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.900
Like, you could have a field
that scales like 1 in the power

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:46.610
company, but happens to be 0.

01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:47.480
And that's OK.

01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:52.096
Yeah.

01:24:52.096 --> 01:24:54.198
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about SCET1 and SCET2.

01:24:54.198 --> 01:24:54.990
IAIN STEWART: Sure.

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:59.874
AUDIENCE: So in the example
adding one jab, and one hadron,

01:24:59.874 --> 01:25:01.827
like the [INAUDIBLE],,
why do I need

01:25:01.827 --> 01:25:03.982
to have different degrees
of freedom to describe

01:25:03.982 --> 01:25:04.798
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:25:04.798 --> 01:25:05.590
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:07.690
It's really because
of the way the modes

01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:11.690
sat on those hyperbolas that,
in the case of the hadrons,

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.190
you had the soft
modes and collinear

01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:14.320
modes on the same hyperbola.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.510
And that's going to change how
the effective theory looks.

01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:17.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:25:17.135 --> 01:25:19.430
But from a physically point
of view, why the hadrons--

01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:21.469
[INAUDIBLE] the hadrons
behaving in a different way

01:25:21.469 --> 01:25:22.180
than [INAUDIBLE]?

01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:22.972
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:25:22.972 --> 01:25:24.942
So one way of
thinking about it is,

01:25:24.942 --> 01:25:26.650
if you just had the
collinear modes alone

01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:28.040
and you didn't have
the soft modes,

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.290
then it would be very similar.

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:32.020
It would just be that
the hyperbola moved down.

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:34.720
And you think maybe those
two theories are the same.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.280
There's examples
of that actually.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.220
There's one example
that we'll cover where

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.630
you don't need soft modes.

01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:42.505
And then you can't really
tell whether you're

01:25:42.505 --> 01:25:44.410
using SCET1 or SCET2.

01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:47.350
But if you have a process that
has both soft and collinear

01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:50.410
modes, then it's the kind
of way that those modes

01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:52.180
talk to each other
that distinguishes

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.310
the cases of hadrons
and jets in the cases--

01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:56.270
AUDIENCE: For example,
for the case of the jet,

01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:58.742
[INAUDIBLE] soft modes
like as a need for the--

01:25:58.742 --> 01:25:59.575
IAIN STEWART: Right.

01:25:59.575 --> 01:26:01.960
You could try, yes.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.870
And it turns out that those
modes aren't relevant.

01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:06.580
So you have to be a
little bit faithful

01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:08.107
from what I've told you so far.

01:26:08.107 --> 01:26:10.190
AUDIENCE: But there is no
physical picture for why

01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:11.520
it can understand [INAUDIBLE].

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.430
IAIN STEWART: You
can understand it

01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:14.513
because what would happen
with those soft modes is

01:26:14.513 --> 01:26:18.400
that they would take the
collinear modes far off-shell.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.695
If you just had one of
those soft modes interacting

01:26:20.695 --> 01:26:23.320
with the collinear mode, you end
up not with the collinear mode

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.930
back again, but something that's
further off-shell that you

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:27.430
actually want to integrate out.

01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:31.330
So that thing that has the
scaling that allows you to just

01:26:31.330 --> 01:26:34.960
have collinear mode in something
which we call ultra soft in

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.370
and still have collinear,
that's the ultra soft mode.

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:40.120
So if you want to
communicate with the jet

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.760
without disturbing it
and blowing it apart,

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:45.430
then you really need
the ultra soft mode.

01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:46.000
Yeah.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.100
But these are all
good questions,

01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:50.700
and we'll talk
much more about it.

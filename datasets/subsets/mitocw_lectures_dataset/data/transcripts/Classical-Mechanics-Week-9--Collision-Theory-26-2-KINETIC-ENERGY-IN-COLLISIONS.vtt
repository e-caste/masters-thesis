WEBVTT

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.530
So we analyzed our
one-dimensional collision

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.670
where we had an object 1 moving
with some initial velocity,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.740
object 2 also moving with
some initial velocity.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.570
And after the collision,
we just arbitrarily

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.840
said object 1 is moving
this way and object 2

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.250
was moving that way.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.620
And we called that
our i hat direction.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.280
In this collision,
we assume that it

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.460
was a frictionless surface.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.080
And there were no
external forces.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.730
So momentum is constant.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.100
Now what about energy?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.310
Well, we know that if there
is no external forces, then

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.790
in principle there could
be no external work.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.300
However, during the
collision, we've

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.640
established different
types of collisions.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.980
We said elastic
collision is when

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.670
we are assuming that the kinetic
energy of the system-- that's

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.360
K system final minus
K system initial--

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.620
is 0, the statement that the
kinetic energy is constant.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.560
We have an inelastic
collision in which

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.460
delta K system has decreased.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.896
And that can come from some
deformation of the objects

00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:29.770
during the collision.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.660
Heat is generated.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.560
Some sound, some
other source of energy

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.170
in which energy is
always constant,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.170
but the kinetic energy of
the system could diminish.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.289
And we also talked about
a super elastic collision.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.080
And in this type of
collision, the kinetic energy

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.390
of the system has increased.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.720
Now that's a little bit
tricky in terms of what

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.160
we're calling our system.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.280
But imagine that when
these two objects collided,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.250
there was some type of
chemicals on it that exploded.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.380
And so that was
some chemical energy

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.710
that was converted into
extra kinetic energy.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.360
So in order to make a
model of our problem,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.780
we have to beforehand make some
assumptions about the nature

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.020
of the collision.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.960
Now for our
particular collision,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.540
let's assume that the
collision is elastic.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.630
So we have two
conservation principles.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.780
We have that the kinetic energy
of the system is constant.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.700
And we've already said
that because there's

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.270
no external forces, the momentum
of the system is constant.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.650
So now we can write down our
kinetic energy condition.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.462
We have m1 V1-- now here, this
can be a little bit tricky

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:45.420
how we're going to write
this, because remember

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.220
kinetic energy is
a magnitude squared

00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:00.360
plus 1/2 m2 V2 initial squared
equals 1/2 m1 V1 final squared

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.040
plus 1/2 m2 V2 final squared.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.810
Now because a
component, although it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.900
can be positive or
negative, in one dimension,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.170
if you square the component,
you get the magnitude.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.300
So I can also write
this equation--

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.390
and I'm going to divide
through by the halves,

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.750
cancel all those-- as 1x initial
squared equal to the magnitude

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:36.400
squared plus m2 V2x
initial squared equals M1

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.235
V1x final squared plus
1/2 m2 V2x final squared.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.500
And we've already
canceled all the halves,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.230
so we have no half there.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.210
Now given this equation--
we'll call this equation

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.780
1-- we can also had
our momentum equation,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.640
which I'm going to
write down as 2, m1 Vx

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:25.790
initial plus m2 V2x initial
equals m1 V1x final plus m2 V2x

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.460
final, reminding
us of our condition

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.350
of the constancy of momentum.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.570
So now, if you look at this,
if we're given the masses, all

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.880
the mi's and we're also
given the initial state

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.950
of the system, V2x
initial, then we

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.940
have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:57.740
And we can solve algebraically
for V1x final and V2x final.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.320
And by determining the
signs of these components,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.850
we can figure out the actual
final state of the system.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.070
So this is going to end up
involving a quadratic equation.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.760
And what we'd like to do now
is show an alternative way

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.800
that gives us another kind of
conservation, another principle

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.410
to analyze these one
dimensional collisions.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.160
So we'll begin that.

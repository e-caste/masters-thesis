DAVID THORBURN: This lecture
tonight is our last chance

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.940
to pay attention to this process
I've been calling the Fred Ott

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.810
principal.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.710
And forgive me for appearing
slightly repetitious

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.390
about this.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.510
But to me, it's an
essential aspect

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.790
of our appreciation
of these early weeks,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.100
to recognize that films like
The General, or Modern Times,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.060
or the film we're going to
see next week, The Last Laugh,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.700
Murnau's remarkable
silent film from Germany,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.700
to recognize that these
astonishing, complex narratives

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.361
grew out of something
so primitive

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.360
and grew out of something
so primitive in such a

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.650
relatively short
time, is part of what

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.910
makes these early
films so interesting.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.970
And the viewing you're
going to see tonight

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.030
is your last opportunity
to, in a concrete way,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.510
experience something
of that process,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.640
something of that
evolution for yourself.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300
Because the two Chaplain
shorts that you're

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.770
going to see, while they are, as
I indicated this afternoon, not

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.230
from the earliest stages
of Chaplin's work,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.870
they're three or four
years advanced beyond that.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.180
He's already mastered his
medium in certain ways.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.230
And these shorts
are, in themselves,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.890
very coherent and
interesting works.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.100
And I hope you'll look at them
for their own intrinsic value.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.300
But I also want
you to recognize,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.720
as you think about those short
films, remarkable as they are,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.860
how much richer, how
much more complex,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.500
how much more demanding
and rewarding in many ways

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.550
Modern Times is.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.740
And I think the same thing
could be said about all

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.790
of Chaplin's features.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.170
There's an astonishing
distance between even the best

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.560
shorts or between most of the
best shorts and the features.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.090
Some of the very
best shorts have

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.400
a kind of elegance
and purity, as well as

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.900
a level of comic
inventiveness that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.920
makes them in their
own way almost

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.240
the equal of the features.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.730
But, of course, even
the best of them

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.750
don't have quite the
reach or the resonance

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.850
of a film like Modern
Times or The Gold Rush.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.170
One way we can perhaps clarify
some of what I've been saying,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.210
and maybe also do
a bit more justice

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.220
to poor Buster Keaton, who
I think in many ways is

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.730
an equally remarkable artist
and in a technical sense

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.140
an even more interesting
director than Chaplain himself,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.310
is to begin with a
comparison of the two.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.940
Not so much because the
comparison will really

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.810
illuminate weaknesses
in one or the other,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.120
but the contrast
between them I think

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.430
will help to clarify
what are some

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.170
of the essential qualities
in each of these director's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.712
work in films.

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:06.420
And I hope that you'll
sort of think back

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.550
to the Keaton material
you saw last week as I'm

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.920
making these comparisons.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.804
One way to think about the
differences between Chaplin

00:03:13.804 --> 00:03:15.470
and Keaton, and also
to think about what

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.410
is essential about
both of them, is

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.690
to talk about the way they
deal with objects and the role

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.290
that objects have
in their films.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.500
In Keaton's case, we might
say that the basic objects

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.870
of interest are usually
massive and gigantic things,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.060
whole houses, locomotives,
as in The General,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.950
an ocean liner as
in The Navigator.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.880
And Keaton was interested
in intricate systems

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.590
and in the intricacy with
which these systems operated.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.850
And he liked to pose
his Buster character

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.750
against these massive systems,
to see whether Buster could

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.310
survive them and to
show us certain aspects,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.400
both of Buster's
resourcefulness and power

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.520
to muddle through, but
also his comic inadequacy

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.080
and comic failings as well.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.840
And a number of the most
dramatic and famous bits

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.000
from The General could be said
to crystallize this principle.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.670
Think of that magnificent joke.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.220
It's more than a joke.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.630
That cosmic joke, that
vision of experience,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:31.330
that existential
mockery, but also

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.760
affectionate mockery
of human nature, that's

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.820
embedded in the cannon
sequence at the very beginning

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.540
of Keaton's most important film.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.710
You remember how that works.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.540
It's very funny at every level.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.690
But as Keaton first
fails to fire the cannon,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.910
then the second time
reloads the cannon

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.350
with 10 times as
much powder, then

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.740
gets stuck in
front of the cannon

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.448
and it looks as if
he's going to be shot.

00:04:56.448 --> 00:05:00.540
But every move in
that sequence is

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.790
full of amusing comic business.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.270
But think of how
as the joke builds,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.600
as it keeps topping
itself, something else

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.320
begins to happen.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.630
What begins to emerge,
as I suggested last time,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.230
is almost a kind of vision
of life, a vision of life

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.310
in which human agency matters.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.780
You do have to
struggle and do what

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.400
you can to try to save yourself
or accomplish your ends.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.430
But then when your
ends are accomplished,

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.700
even when things work out almost
exactly as you had planned,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.730
remember what happen.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.940
The cannon does fire.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.130
It doesn't shot at poor Buster,
who runs away from it and hides

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.030
in the cowcatcher of
the engine to avoid it.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.347
But why doesn't it go?

00:05:36.347 --> 00:05:37.930
Because at a certain
moment, the train

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.400
just happens to go around the
bend and geography and physics

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.950
collaborate with
the Keaton character

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.470
in order to create a shot
that actually does almost

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.210
hit the engine he's pursuing.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.790
And it certainly
persuades the people

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.500
he's pursuing that
they are being

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.510
chased by more than one man.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.360
And, in fact, remember
when the cannon fires

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.370
and we see that the outcome
that results is pretty

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.030
much the outcome that the
Buster character intended,

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.100
there's a double comedy
there, isn't there?

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.810
And it's a metaphysical
or an existential comedy.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.230
Because what that joke is
saying is, of course, what

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.560
the whole film
also says and what

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.930
many other individual crescendo
jokes, we might call them,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.430
also say in the film.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.040
Which is that we get through
in life by muddling through,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.860
by working hard, by engaging in
all kinds of sometimes almost

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.780
obsessive labor in order
to accomplish our ends.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.280
But in the end, when we
do accomplish our ends,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.430
it's not entirely because of us.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.337
It's because of accident.

00:06:40.337 --> 00:06:41.920
And when we don't
accomplish our ends,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.810
it's also because of
accident often, as well as

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.380
because of our human frailty.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.650
So there really is a kind
of complex understanding

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.620
of the world implicit
in the kinds of jokes

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.332
that Keaton manages to
tell us, as if there's

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.040
a sort of understanding
or interpretation

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.720
of life embedded in the
best moments of The General.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.700
And this kind of
vision of experience

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.040
wouldn't really be
possible if Keaton

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.150
was as interested in individual
encounters with small objects

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.440
as Chaplain is.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.830
Because the distinction
between Keaton and Chaplain

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.480
in terms of the way
they use objects

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.110
is that Chaplain is in love
not with large, gigantic

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.500
structures, but with tiny ones.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.050
He wants to see how Charlie
manipulates his cane.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:34.130
He wants to watch Charlie
interact with a hamburger

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.290
or with a shoe that he is
pretending is a turkey dinner,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.840
in a fragment from
a late film of his

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.580
that I'm going to show you
I hope in a few moments.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.990
So if objects in Keaton
are massive and systemic

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.340
in a certain way,
the objects that

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.730
are most characteristic
of Chaplin's world

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.500
are small and manageable.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.100
And the interactions between
the Chaplain character

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.550
and these objects are often an
occasion for the exploration

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.630
of character.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.540
When the Tramp character
encounters a particular object,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.980
one of the things he is
characteristically tempted

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.120
to do is to transform its
use, is to make it useful

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.980
some other purpose.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.280
As if in the contest between
Charlie and the world,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.370
Charlie has some
transcendent power

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.300
to allow his
optimism to transform

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.680
a recalcitrant reality, to
make the reality kind of bend

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.180
to him.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.664
And it becomes
especially poignant,

00:08:31.664 --> 00:08:34.039
as you'll see in the passage
from The Gold Rush I'm going

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.460
to show you in a little while.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.130
It becomes especially
poignant when

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.760
we understand how minimal are
the constellations that Charlie

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.330
finds.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.770
When he transforms this
shoe into a turkey dinner,

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.139
he's actually starving.

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:47.180
And although it may
psychologically help him out,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.930
we can see his resilience
facing hunger and making

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.044
the shoe do for a meal.

00:08:53.044 --> 00:08:55.460
So what is expressed there is
something of the character's

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.730
imaginativeness,
but also something

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.640
of his resilience and optimism.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.560
Because when he encounters
the world, his relation to it

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.830
is one of a magician
or a transformer.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.200
He's always trying to impose
his imagination on the world.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.957
And if you watch
Chaplin's films--

00:09:11.957 --> 00:09:14.290
this is true of his shorts
as well as his longer films--

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.620
if you watch Chaplin's
interactions with objects

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.500
closely, you will
see a continual drama

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.900
in which the imaginative
world of the Tramp

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.490
is in some sense in
a kind of conflict,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.810
or a kind of
collision, or at least

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.810
a kind of angry conversation
with the world in which

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.884
the objects of the world are,
although they may resist,

00:09:33.884 --> 00:09:36.240
are constantly
under the pressure

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.330
of the transformative power
of Charlie's optimism,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.250
resilience, and imagination.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.950
So it's small objects
in Chaplain that matter.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.950
And they declare for
character, rather than

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.010
for some cosmic
understanding of the world.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.830
We can get at another
fundamental difference

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.990
and some of the strengths
and the alternate kinds

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.790
of strengths of both
Keaton and Chaplin

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.100
by talking about the different
protagonists or heroes that are

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.820
characteristic of their works.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.160
In Chaplin's case, let's
start with Chaplain,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.940
we often have heroes who have
grand visions, or schemes,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.350
or hopes.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.170
They tend to be
chivalric characters.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.680
So sometimes the project they
take on is rescue the damsel,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.990
protect the woman.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.780
In the first feature-length film
or nearly feature-length film

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.470
that Chaplin made-- it
was a film called The Kid.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.370
And it actually
involves a child.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.020
The kid of the title is a
young boy, an urchin, very much

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.400
like the real Chaplain in
his childhood in London.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.010
And the Tramp character,
who is himself starving,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.340
encounters the kid and
has to protect him.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.360
So it's actually a
story of maternal--

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.450
there's a maternal quality
to Charlie in this.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.920
He's much more like a mother
than he's like a father.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.850
But anyway, it's in a certain
sense a kind of sentimental

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.490
parenting fable, in which
we see starving, miserable,

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.250
down-at-the-heels Charley
defending a person who's even

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.010
more vulnerable and even weaker,
even less able to take care

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.250
of himself than Charlie is.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.240
And although it is a deeply
sentimental film in many ways,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.470
it also was a film that provides
another occasion in which we

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.540
can see the Tramp character's
imaginativenes operating.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.360
Because as I suggested
this afternoon,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.310
one way you can also see it
operating in chase sequences

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.140
because he makes such amazing
split second decisions

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.200
about how to elude his pursuers.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.890
And often those decisions
reveal his intelligence

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.480
and his improvisatory quickness.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.650
So almost everything that
happens in a Chaplain film

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.760
returns in some sense to our
sense of the Tramp's character.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.025
And we feel that especially
strongly I think in The Kid

00:11:49.025 --> 00:11:50.650
because one of the
things that happen--

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.520
I think The Kid is 1921.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.600
And one of the things
that happens in The Kid

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.710
is that we see Charlie
exceeding himself

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.720
in imaginative
resourcefulness because he now

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.560
has to protect a child.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.940
And what you feel is
that his compassion

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.720
and his protective instincts
mobilize a resourcefulness

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.980
and an intelligence that
you can't help but recognize

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.901
and you can't help but see.

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:16.400
And so that in a certain sense,
there's a grand scheme here,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.920
protect a child, save a child's
life, or protect an orphan,

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.980
or protect a young
damsel in distress

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.910
from bandits and outlaws,
that sort of thing.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.440
And then Chaplain himself,
the character himself,

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.600
often has grandiose visions
of wealth or of success.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.360
Some of his films,
as in Modern Times,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.010
include dream sequences or
fantasy sequences, very, very

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.270
clever, intelligent sequences.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.990
Because you can tell
that they are taking

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.910
place in a subjective
realm, itself

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.250
a kind of thematic
and technical advance

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.540
in the making of movies.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.220
That Chaplin found ways
to introduce images

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.130
that the audience would
recognize instantly

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.190
as taking place, not
in the real world,

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.470
but in the subjective life
of the characters as part

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:12.950
of his achievement as
much as a mature director.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.860
So the Chaplain hero is
often an ambitious character,

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.330
although he often fails.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.840
He has large ambitions.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.600
He has chivalric tendencies.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.850
He's hopeful, resilient, in many
ways grandiose and sentimental.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.630
And the Keaton
character couldn't

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.110
be more opposite in some ways.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.570
He has sometimes been called
wrongly the great stone face.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.660
But he's a character who
sort of muddles through

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.290
without any grand schemes.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.720
The Keaton character
usually isn't

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.900
trying to do anything more.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.730
The largest thing
he ever tries to do

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.224
is impress a woman,
as he does in Cops.

00:13:48.224 --> 00:13:49.640
Mostly what he's
just trying to do

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.290
is survive, get through the
day, get around the corner,

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.500
keep this ship from sinking,
keep this locomotive

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.170
on the track.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.060
One might even say that
in The General, which

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.720
is his most grandiose plan
in all of Keaton's films,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.620
what the Buster character does
in The General is the most

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.810
ambitious and remarkable.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.450
He's going to
recapture his train.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.464
He's chasing the
Union army as if he's

00:14:13.464 --> 00:14:14.630
fighting the war on his own.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.470
But it's important
to realize how

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.260
we're supposed to understand
that in a deeply comic way

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.480
because the Keaton character is
so wedded to his engine that's

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.152
really not thinking about
any more marshal victory

00:14:27.152 --> 00:14:28.780
or winning the war.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.410
What he wants to do
is recover his engine.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.310
So even there, there's
a kind of smallness,

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.960
a kind of lack of ambition,
a lack of grandiosity

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.290
to what the Keaton
character is doing.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.000
So he wants to
just survive and do

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.190
a task, again a
very sharp contrast.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.120
The treatment of women,
a third category,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.470
might be a way of seeing
them in sharp distinction

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.080
to each other.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.800
Chaplin's treatment
of women is deeply

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.220
sentimental and chivalric.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.940
They're almost always, with
the partial exception of Modern

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.760
Times-- and I'll talk
about that briefly

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.140
in a moment-- they're almost
always treated sentimentally

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.110
and as characters
who need protection,

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.370
who are weak and vulnerable,
as well as beautiful

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.480
and stand for some
kind of purity.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.210
They are an inheritance or a
vestige of the Victorian ideal

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.455
of women.

00:15:17.455 --> 00:15:19.080
They were put on
pedestals because they

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.690
were too pure for the world.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.650
And they were also too weak
to open doors for themselves.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.160
They had to have men
do that for them.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.960
So Chaplain's female characters,
with the partial exception,

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.690
dramatically partial exception
of the gamin in the film you're

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.500
going to see tonight,
tend to be of this sort,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.750
Victorian stereotypes.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.010
And his treatment of them
is deeply sentimental.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.520
If you think about the treatment
of the heroine in The General,

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.420
you'll see how dramatically
Keaton diverges from this view.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.870
Remember, Keaton is not
making fun of women in that.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.140
He's making fun of the
Victorian stereotype of women

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.220
that appears in so many movies.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.372
So when the Keaton
character picks up

00:15:58.372 --> 00:16:00.330
that woman when she's
hiding in the potato sack

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.790
and throws over his
shoulders, and throws her

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.330
onto the pile as if she's
another sack of potatoes,

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.370
or later in the film
when the Keaton heroin

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.540
begins to do such stupid
things that you begin

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.760
to realize that she is
one of the great airheads

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.365
in the history of movies.

00:16:15.365 --> 00:16:17.720
Do you remember some of
the tricks she pulls?

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.370
Like she ties a willow
tree across the tracks.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.030
She tries a rope
across the tracks

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.140
to stop the next train
from catching up with them.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.990
Or she sweeps out-- do you
remember this business-- where

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:33.280
she sweeps out in the
cabin of the engine

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.910
while poor Buster is struggling
to keep the engine going?

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.415
She doesn't like a little
bit of soot on the floor.

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:41.120
Keaton makes fun of this figure.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.590
But he's not making
fun of women.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.520
He's not making fun of
actual living females.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.940
He's making fun of the
stereotype of women

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.960
that appears not
only in the movies,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.130
but also appears in sort of
the popular conception of what

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:55.730
women are.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.340
In any case, we
can see how deeply

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.390
mocking and unsentimental
Keaton's treatment of women is.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:08.000
One final contrast that I think
is helpful and interesting

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.730
might be the contrast
that we might

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.540
generate if we tried to
describe the visual style

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.839
of each director.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:19.300
Chaplin favors close shots
and emphasizes character.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.230
He aims for a totally
realistic style

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.680
in which you're oblivious
to the camera's presence.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.640
You're not supposed to
think about the camera.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.580
He wants to create a camera that
is as transparent as possible.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.950
You're supposed to just
focus on the action.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.850
Chaplain's idea is that his
camera is a window on reality.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.840
And he doesn't want the
window or the window pane

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.720
to be part of your understanding
of what you're watching.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.920
There's something social
and character-oriented

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.250
in Chaplin's visual
style and especially

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.650
in his preference for
closeups which reveal

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.880
the psychology of character.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.680
The contrast with
Keaton is very dramatic.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.470
Keaton is a more interesting
director in a technical sense.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.240
He'll mix his shots
much more often.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.350
He'll use closeups.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.520
But he also loves long
shots and middle shots,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.180
depending on the effect
he's looking for.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.100
If you think about what a
master he is of the long shot,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.100
think of the moment, for
example, in The General

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.940
where the camera
backs up far enough

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.480
so that we can see
Buster working furiously

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.393
on the car that carries
the wood, the wood

00:18:26.393 --> 00:18:29.640
carrier on his train, working
furiously with his head down,

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.774
while we see the train move
across the battle line.

00:18:32.774 --> 00:18:34.315
So that he ends up
in enemy territory

00:18:34.315 --> 00:18:36.000
and he doesn't even know it.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.590
So there's a kind
of cosmic joke.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.170
And again, it's a joke that's
only possible in the movies.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.660
I mean it's a joke that partly
depends upon the camera's

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.320
position, its power
to photograph motion,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.240
and the fact that
it can encompass

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.550
a much larger
mise-en-scene that is ever

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.250
possible in a live theater.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.460
So it's a technically
interesting achievement.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.430
But it's also a morally
interesting achievement

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.990
because what does it dramatize?

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.310
The usual trick, the
usual thing we know

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.610
about the Buster character.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.310
He's mostly oblivious to
the dangers around him.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.580
And often the comedy in
Keaton comes from the fact

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.340
that he's oblivious
to his narrow escapes,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.620
as we've said before.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.380
So Keaton uses mixed shots.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.510
He's much more interested
in creating an aura

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.450
of authenticity in his filming.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.560
The General especially alludes
to documentary photography

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.280
made during the Civil War.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.740
And some of the
images are actually

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.050
recreations of Matthew
Brady photographs,

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.230
very famous Matthew
Brady photographs.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.440
It was very important
for Keaton to create

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.350
these realistic effects,
this sense of realism,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.140
because so many of his
most magnificent jokes

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.780
depend on your recognition
that it's actually happening.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.620
That he's not using
process shots.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.150
Think of, for example, of
the unbelievable engineering

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.030
feat that was involved in the
final crash of the train, when

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.490
the bridge burns at
the end of The General.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.260
Remember, there's no
digital animation then.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.910
When Keaton did that, if
he didn't get on the camera

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.882
the first time, that was it.

00:20:08.882 --> 00:20:10.840
And, in fact, it's
incredibly beautifully done,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.760
It happens perfectly.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.700
There's something
almost graceful

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.850
about that
catastrophic sequence.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:20.060
It's so well done, in fact, it
even holds up today in an era

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.800
when we are so used to
special effects of a much more

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.660
dramatic and astonishing kind.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.790
There are no special
effects in that sequence.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.630
It depended on a
mastery of knowing

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.780
where to put the camera; a
kind of engineer's mastery

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.250
of various individuals
and machines

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.210
that were in motion at the
same time; perfect timing, so

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.280
that the bridge had
to actually burn down

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.610
at just the right moment for
the train to come over it.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.335
There was no margin
for error there.

00:20:46.835 --> 00:20:50.130
Again and again,
Keaton's comedy shows

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.340
us this level of
technical, as well as

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.760
intellectual or
thematic mastery.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.540
Because, of course,
that moment when

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.840
the train crashes
into the canyon

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.530
isn't just a magnificent
visual moment

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.840
and a magnificently
comic thwarting

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.010
of the expectations
of the generals

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.550
who are running the thing.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.560
But that moment
is also completely

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.140
consistent with the
mock heroic interests,

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.230
the mock heroic themes
of the movie as a whole.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.030
And what I'd like to
do now is concretize

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:25.720
and embody the arguments
I've been making very briefly

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.610
and inadequately by having
you look at three scenes, one

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:35.450
from Keaton, two from Chaplain,
that can help ground what I've

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.990
been saying in particular
images, in particular moments.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.100
The first scene is a scene that
I wanted to show you last week

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.600
and didn't have time.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.790
I think of it in a certain
sense as a particularly clear

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.180
embodiment of what we might
call the Keaton vision.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.360
And it's a sequence
that violates

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.640
one of Keaton's deepest
principles at the very end.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.980
And I'm a little sorry it does.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.920
And the sequence
is harmed by that.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.360
There is a special effect in it.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.970
And it's too bad that there is.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.580
But it's one of the very
rare such moments in Keaton.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.160
Keaton tried never to do that.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.180
And as I mentioned to you,
sometimes very dangerous things

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.160
happen to Keaton.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.000
And they happen in reality.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.350
And he was often begged, when he
became a director of features,

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.519
to not do his own stunts.

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:19.435
But he always refused.

00:22:19.435 --> 00:22:20.810
And he always did
his own stunts.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.530
He broke his neck when he
was making The General.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.230
And any continued filming
with a broken neck

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.780
for part of the time.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.610
He didn't quite realize
how seriously he

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.306
was injured when that happened.

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.680
If you think back
to The General,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.140
you might actually be
able to figure out--

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.210
it happens relatively early in
the film when he hurt himself.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.710
When he's on the
hand car, when he's

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.959
chasing on the hand car and
he falls off the hand car.

00:22:43.959 --> 00:22:48.690
And he actually did real harm
to himself in that sequence.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.390
So this first sequence,
it comes from Cops.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.310
And in many ways,
I think it embodies

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.970
that kind of aversion of the
trajectory or crescendo joke

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.310
I was talking about earlier.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.640
It's a small version
of the cannon joke

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.287
that you see in--
or jokes plural,

00:23:02.287 --> 00:23:04.120
because there's another
joke with the cannon

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.520
in the second half of the film--
that I've talked about earlier.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.500
Let's show it, Greg.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.250
And, of course, this is
the moment where Keaton

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.914
is in flight from the police.

00:23:12.914 --> 00:23:13.955
The cops are chasing him.

00:23:13.955 --> 00:23:16.290
He runs up this teeter-totter.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.170
He runs up a ladder.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:22.300
It turns out to
be like a seesaw.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.230
And there we see
the Buster character

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.550
trying to elude cops who
come up on either side

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.510
of the teeter-totter.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.280
You see his acrobatic qualities.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.060
But part of what makes
it good is that we

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.660
know he's improvising here.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.710
He's in trouble.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.340
People on both ends
now are after him.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.740
How can you escape this?

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:51.230
Teeter-totter up and down, it
seems as if there's no escape.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.990
It's almost as if
every cop in the city

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.660
is now after poor
Buster, massive forces

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:03.660
arrayed against the lone
hero, a key to his comedy.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.790
And, of course, that's
the process shot.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.115
But it is a very
witty way to end.

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:09.586
I mean what does it depend on?

00:24:09.586 --> 00:24:10.960
Among other things,
an engineer's

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.480
understanding of
the laws of motion.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.450
Many of Keaton's
jokes depend on a kind

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:23.230
of collaboration with gravity
and call attention to that.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.620
So it seems as if
there's no escape.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.360
And he does not escape
because of anything that he

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.810
himself has really done.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:30.910
It's contingent.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.110
It's accidental.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.430
But he does escape, right.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.650
It's as if the universe
sometimes , not always,

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.520
conspires to help us.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.010
If we try hard,
sometimes it'll help us.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.110
Sometimes it won't.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.530
We're mostly foolish
characters muddling through.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.110
The jokes say that
again and again.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.460
It's a vision of life.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.470
Now, I want to contrast
this kind of joking

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.010
and this kind of style.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.790
Again, for that effect
to work, the camera

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.170
had to be pretty far back.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.210
It depended on your seeing
the seesaw going up and down.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.410
It depended on your
seeing the cops

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.660
on either side of the ladder.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:14.660
So in that sense, it's a
characteristic Keaton moment,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.280
a characteristic Keaton passage.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.745
I want to show you two passages
from feature films of Chaplin's

00:25:20.745 --> 00:25:22.620
that I think are those
characteristic moments

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.119
of Chaplin.

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:25.840
And you'll see how they fit
into what I've already said.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.630
First, a scene
from The Gold Rush.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.290
And let me set it up for you.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.110
One of the delightful
and important things

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.590
about the Tramp's character,
as I mentioned this afternoon,

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.590
is after a while-- Chaplain
made a total of 81 films.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.635
The vast majority of
them were silent films.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.690
After the first couple
of films that he made,

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.560
the Tramp character began to
elaborate itself and proceed

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.350
by a principle of accretion.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.190
That's very important
for us to be aware of.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.890
Because think of
what this means.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.620
If the audience for
Modern Times had

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.690
seen 50 Chaplin shorts or most
of Chaplin's movies-- and this

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.820
would have been true.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.580
In 1936, the vast majority
of the movie audience

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.610
would have lived
through the silent era

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.910
and certainly would have known
a great many Chaplin films.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.950
So when they came
to see Modern Times,

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.340
they had in their memory
banks all these other stories

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.159
about the Tramp.

00:26:21.159 --> 00:26:23.200
And, in fact, they didn't
have to wait for Modern

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.810
Times for this effect to occur.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.330
As the Tramp begin to
generate a kind of reputation

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.350
and more and more people
came to watch him,

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.650
what began to happen was that
each subsequent adventure

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.000
of the Tramp got richer,
not because of anything

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.770
inherent in the
new adventure, but

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.210
because the previous adventures
lay behind it and were

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.620
part of the Tramp's
ongoing identity.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.260
So as the audience became
more familiar with the Tramp

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.180
and as Chaplin's gifts
for dramatizing character

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.560
and for making
movies enlarged, so

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.750
did the resonance of
the Tramp as a figure.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.590
And I should have
said this afternoon

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.660
because it's the deepest
explanation for why

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.330
the Tramp became a mythic
figure, why the Tramp became

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.690
such a memorable
and powerful icon.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.440
And in this sequence,
you're going

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.480
to see one of the classic
instances of the Tramp's

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.980
resilient imaginativeness in the
face of difficulty and danger.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.430
In The Gold Rush, the
identity that Charlie

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.340
takes on-- by the time he comes
to make his feature films,

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:32.210
there are dozens and dozens,
30, 40 short films in the past.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.420
And all of those identities,
all of those adventures,

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.190
feed into and inform
the more recent ones.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:43.040
When the audience then comes to
watch Modern Times and The Gold

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.090
Rush, it has that
history behind it.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.370
In this particular
film, Charlie takes

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:55.520
on the identity of a '49er, not
a football player but a miner,

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.700
who's gone to Alaska for
the Alaska gold rush.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.910
We've seen him as a waiter.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.510
We've seen him as
a ship builder.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.470
We've seen him as a
pawn broker's assistant.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.300
We've seen him in a whole
range of other jobs.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.540
And until Modern
Times, each film,

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.190
even the feature-length
films, only

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.390
show Charlie in one occupation.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.240
It's only in Modern
Times where we see him

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.285
in multiple occupations.

00:28:18.285 --> 00:28:21.080
It's one of the things that
marks Modern Time's greater

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.900
complexity from
the earlier film.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.100
So what's happened,
he goes to Alaska.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.100
He finds himself
stuck in a cabin

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.310
after a terrible
avalanche and snowstorm.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.380
He's stuck in the
cabin without food,

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.530
with a massive,
gigantic fellow, one

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.790
of his favorite antagonists.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.450
Mack Swain, there's a name.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.640
And Chaplain certainly chose him
because he was so humongously

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.815
large that when he was
juxtaposed against Charlie,

00:28:45.815 --> 00:28:48.980
he looked even more menacing.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.890
Well, in the sequence
you're about to see

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.570
Charlie is confined in a
cabin, in a horrible snowstorm,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.400
starving, with this
gigantic fellow, who's

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.800
beginning to look at Charlie as
if he might be a tasty morsel.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.050
And it's Thanksgiving.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:05.191
It's Thanksgiving.

00:29:05.191 --> 00:29:06.940
They're about to have
Thanksgiving dinner.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.200
What are they going to do?

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.300
Watch Charlie's
imaginative response.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.126
OK, Greg.

00:29:15.528 --> 00:29:18.444
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.260
Even before this, we've seen
the Mack Swain character

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.400
look at Charlie with
a kind of hungry eye.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.900
And you'll see him
do it again here.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.190
Watch how Charlie interacts
with particular objects,

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.065
with small objects.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.905
What he's done is he's cooked
a boot, one of their shoes.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.110
The shoelaces become spaghetti.

00:30:25.595 --> 00:30:27.220
Did you see the
subtlety of that moment

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.475
where Charlie look frightened?

00:30:29.475 --> 00:30:31.290
Watch the range of
emotions that he's

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.490
able to express in his face.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.900
Now, you see how
he uses closeups,

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.150
how it's a drama of character.

00:30:51.154 --> 00:30:53.540
You see now, he lacks
Charlie's imaginativeness.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.880
So he doesn't survive as well.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.943
It's almost like
mind over matter.

00:30:57.943 --> 00:31:00.860
It's that quality in
the Chaplain character,

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.430
I think, more than
any other, that

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.000
explains why people loved him.

00:31:16.379 --> 00:31:18.420
You see, if you act like
you're eating good food,

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.640
you almost are.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.380
All right.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.500
That's enough Greg.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.500
You get the idea.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.610
It's a remarkable film.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:31.443
And you get an idea.

00:31:31.443 --> 00:31:34.450
Now, the next sequence I want
to show you is in some sense

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.990
even more powerful.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.740
It's less comic, although
there are comic elements in it.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.680
It's Chaplain at
his most dramatic.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.840
And it's the final sequence of
the film City Lights, the film

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.860
that precedes Modern Times.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.950
Five years separate them.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.150
But it's the last film he
made before Modern Times.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.940
And it's essentially
an urban drama,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.840
in which the Tramp
character finds himself

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.350
protecting a vulnerable woman.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:09.480
And the woman he's protecting
is a blind flower girl.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.070
She's blind.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:15.280
And so she's even more
vulnerable and deserving

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:20.797
of protection than a sighted
flower girl would be.

00:32:20.797 --> 00:32:22.630
So Charlie sort of takes
her under his wing.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.550
And because she's
blind, she doesn't

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.100
realize-- there's
a kind of trick

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.720
in the beginning, a
visual trick, that

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.300
makes the blind
flower girl believe

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.470
that Charlie is a wealthy man.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.240
And Charlie allows
her to believe this.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.552
He's the Tramp.

00:32:35.552 --> 00:32:37.510
But he allows her to
believe that he's wealthy.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.060
And he visits with her.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.300
And she has an aged
mother, something

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.400
like the character you
see in The Immigrant,

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.420
who dies in the
course of the film.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.610
And the second
subplot in the film

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.430
has Charlie befriending
a very wealthy man, who

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:58.500
is incredibly nice to him when
he's drunk and kicks him out

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.100
of his life when he's sober.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.690
And his irrationality is
part of Chaplin's critique

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.210
of capitalism, I think,
because he's a rich man.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.990
But when he's drunk,
he loves Charlie.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:10.800
And he gives Charlie
money and so forth.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.300
But Charley uses this
to get a fortune.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.010
And he sees an article in a
newspaper about a Swiss doctor

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.780
who can fix blindness.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:23.380
And he sends the flower girl
to Switzerland or someplace.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.170
And she has the operation.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.670
She has her sight regained.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.700
And the Tramp character has
had his usual misadventures.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.550
And he's just
getting out of prison

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.000
at the very end of the film.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.530
So the encounter
he's going to have

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.960
with the now sighted
flower girl, which

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.050
is the very climax of City
Lights-- this encounter

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:44.610
that he's going to have
with her is an encounter

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.912
in which he and the audience
know perfectly well who

00:33:47.912 --> 00:33:48.870
all the characters are.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.520
But she has never set
eyes on Charlie before.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:57.270
And she has the idea that
her benefactor, the man who

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.900
sent her for the operation
and restored her sight,

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.890
is a wealthy and
handsome fellow.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:04.945
Here is the ending
of City Lights.

00:34:08.722 --> 00:34:11.202
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.870
So for the audience, this
moment has tremendous poignance

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.650
because the audience
is aware of things

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.090
that the female character
is not aware of it.

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.320
That there's her benefactor,
this shabby little tramp.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.210
So her condescension
to him in this sequence

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.980
has tremendous poignance
for the audience.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.970
And look at the closeup
on Charley here,

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.270
Charley sees who it is.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.550
Charlie knows who it is.

00:35:47.204 --> 00:35:49.620
The only thing that's wrong
with this ending is the titles

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.480
are unnecessary.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.670
The faces are so eloquent,
they're unnecessary.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.400
The words aren't needed.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.825
In fact, the words
even simplify.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.410
Can you see how
Charley's expression

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.410
involves pride, as well as
affection and a kind of love.

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:14.647
He's incredibly excited
and happy to see her

00:36:14.647 --> 00:36:15.605
and to see her sighted.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:50.120
See the power of a closeup.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.280
She suddenly realizes
who it is from touch.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.830
The least necessary intertitle
in the history of movies

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:05.766
is about to appear.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.747
But look at the closeups here.

00:37:14.747 --> 00:37:16.163
Look at the art
of these closeups.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.290
Another unnecessarily line.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.300
There are people who have
said that that last closeup is

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.020
the most eloquent closeup
in the history of movies.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.360
It might be true.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.050
Because the
complexity of emotion

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.980
that's playing across
Charlie's face there--

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.521
it's hard for people
who haven't seen

00:37:54.521 --> 00:37:55.990
the whole film to
fully grasp it,

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.470
although I tried to set it up.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.220
It's partly that he
knows there can never

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.490
be anything between them.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:02.680
It's partly that he's
full of joy over the fact

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.230
that he's been able to help her.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.990
But there's also a sense of
their inevitable separation,

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.480
of the differences between them.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.480
And that's part of
what's reflected

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.760
in that closeup at the end.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.170
And another thing I would
call your attention to,

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.720
part of Chaplin's
subtly, is look how

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.670
he doesn't hold it too long.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.830
A truly sentimental
director would

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:26.100
have held his final
shot, Charley's face,

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.810
twice as long,
three times as long.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:30.140
But do you notice how
wasn't there for very long?

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.575
His hand was over here and
then the screen goes blank.

00:38:34.575 --> 00:38:36.950
He doesn't milk the moment,
even though it's an immensely

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:37.741
complicated moment.

00:38:37.741 --> 00:38:39.987
But the most important thing
to say about this scene

00:38:39.987 --> 00:38:41.570
is that it's a scene
that's played out

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.300
by the drama of the face.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.990
It shows how Chaplin had reached
a point by the time he reached

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.580
his maturity in the
1920s, had reached

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.850
a point where he
could create films

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.890
in which closeups on
expressive actors' faces,

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.980
and especially closeups
on the Tramp's face,

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.530
could reveal worlds of meaning.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.820
The range of contradictory
feelings and meanings

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.790
that run across the
theater of Charley's face

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.180
in these final
sequences of City Lights

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.990
are proof of the eloquence
of the silent film

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.740
and are a particularly
distinctive signature instance

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.790
of Chaplin's art.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.800
Well, in the time
I have remaining,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.320
what I'd like to do is talk
very quickly about Modern Times

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.700
itself, the great
masterpiece that you're

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.750
going to be seeing
in a few minutes,

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.510
as a way of sort of setting
up some of the things for you

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.260
to watch for.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.480
But I feel badly
that I couldn't do

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.310
this fully enough with
The General, which

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.832
is an equally complex film.

00:39:38.832 --> 00:39:40.290
And I only have a
few minutes here.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.960
So I can hardly do full justice
to the astonishing richness

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.786
and complexity of Modern Times.

00:39:45.786 --> 00:39:47.160
But I want to call
your attention

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.960
to certain features
in it and count

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.840
on your being as attentive
and generous in your viewing

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.130
as you possibly can.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.550
I'm sure you'll pick up
other things as well.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.890
First, the context of the film.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.070
I've already mentioned this.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.500
So I don't have to spend
a lot of time on it.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.960
But it's very interesting and
significant that the film was

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.690
made in 1936, released in 1936,
something like seven or eight

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.210
years into the sound era.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.320
There hadn't been any
silent films made.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.710
Now, I'm not saying that
Modern Times is actually

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.730
a truly silent film.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:15.290
It's not.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.560
It has a soundtrack.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.440
And the soundtrack
is complex and rich.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.130
And I'll say at
least a word about it

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:23.540
before I'm finished here.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.050
But in every
fundamental respect,

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:29.350
Modern Times wants its
viewers to think of it

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:30.860
as a silent film.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.000
It invokes the
tradition of silent film

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.300
and especially the
tradition of Chaplin films,

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.230
to which it
systematically alludes

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:39.440
in virtually every frame.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.980
So the context for
the film is first is

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.430
that it is in a certain
way a kind of silent film.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.740
There is no synchronous
dialog in it.

00:40:51.525 --> 00:40:54.050
There are sound
effects-- and, of course,

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:58.660
there's music-- a soundtrack
the Chaplain arranged

00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.510
very complexly.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.760
And it's a very rich soundtrack.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.540
But there's no synchronous
dialogue until the very end.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.570
At the very end, there
is synchronous dialogue.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.530
And it's Charley who speaks it.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.185
In fact, the film was advertised
as follows in many newspapers.

00:41:13.185 --> 00:41:16.070
It was, "The Tramp speaks."

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.630
Well, watch for what happens
when the Tramp speaks.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.950
It's one of the film's
great and serious jokes.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.169
He does speak at the end.

00:41:24.169 --> 00:41:25.210
And it's the only moment.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:27.474
You do hear dialogue
elsewhere in the film.

00:41:27.474 --> 00:41:28.640
I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.348
This is what I wanted
to say about sound.

00:41:30.348 --> 00:41:33.151
But you don't see
synchronous dialogue.

00:41:33.151 --> 00:41:35.150
You don't see people
moving their lips and words

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.983
coming out of there.

00:41:35.983 --> 00:41:37.740
You see people on
a screen talking

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.600
or you hear people
on a radio talking.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.030
But you don't see someone on
screen actually moving his lips

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.570
and words, sound coming
out, until the very end,

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.220
when Charlie does his song.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.189
He sings a song.

00:41:48.189 --> 00:41:49.980
He plays a waiter near
the end of the film.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.900
And he sings a song.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.502
And he tells a
story with the song.

00:41:53.502 --> 00:41:54.460
Watch for what happens.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.450
So the Tramp does talk.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:59.630
But it's a wonderful comic joke.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.880
Another aspect of the
context of Modern Times

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.090
is it takes place
during the Depression.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.400
But the subject
matter of Modern Times

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.900
was Chaplin's typical
subject matter.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.340
It was about the Depression.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.000
It was about hunger,
about misery,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.620
about someone who can't find a
job, about two homeless people,

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.720
about the conflict
between capital and labor,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.840
about the irrationality
of both sides.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.360
It was literally about
the turmoil and trouble

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.850
that was going on during
the Great Depression.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.030
Many people predicted,
not only that the film

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.480
would fail because it was
really essentially a silent film

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.000
in an era when no one was
interested in silent film

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.940
anymore, but also that it would
fail because it was rubbing

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.110
the audience's noses
in the very experiences

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:41.870
they were trying
to escape when they

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.490
came to the movies, the
escapist theory of why

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.020
people attend films.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.770
Of course, both
predictions were mistaken.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.420
Modern Times was a significant
commercial success,

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.590
partly because Chaplin was
very clever in the way he

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.270
did his exhibition of the film.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.540
He released it first,
not in mass release,

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.590
but to elite feeders,
which charged

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.426
quite a great deal of money,
and then slowly allowed

00:43:02.426 --> 00:43:04.300
the film to reach larger
and larger theaters.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.000
He anticipated certain
modern marketing methods

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.560
with the release
of Modern Times.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.190
And, of course, by
1936, Charlie Chaplin

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:15.100
was an internationally famous
figure, of such stature.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.560
He was about the only figure,
maybe apart from D.W. Griffith,

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.080
about whom people had begun
to write essays calling him

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.010
an artist.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:25.360
So Chaplain occupied
a unique place.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.280
And that was also part
of why Modern Times was

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.990
waited for so fully.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.740
So the context of Modern
Times is important.

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.650
There's something brave and
surprising about the fact

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:38.230
that it was about the
miseries of the Depression

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.200
during the Depression, that it
was essentially a silent film

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.620
in the middle of the sound era.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.810
Both very bold decisions
on Chaplin's part,

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:51.620
both characteristic of his
ambitiousness as an artist.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.590
Like Keaton's The General, we
could certainly call this film

00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:01.350
also a culminating text,
a summarizing text,

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:02.710
in several senses.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.890
It's a culminating text in
terms of Chaplin's work.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:07.380
And I've already
talked about that.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.130
Every single person coming
to see Modern Times, who

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.270
had any experience
with the movies before,

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.360
would recognize in
Modern Times situations

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.090
and even physical spaces that
had occurred in earlier Chaplin

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:19.870
films.

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.530
So there was almost
a sense in which

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:25.870
Modern Times was a reprise of
the whole career of the Tramp.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.400
And I mentioned
that Modern Times

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.960
shows us the Tramp for the first
time in multiple jobs Having

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.240
multiple sources of-- and, in
fact, multiple misadventures.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.200
He goes to jail more
than once in the film.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.350
We find him in a factory
more than once in the film

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:42.020
and so forth.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:45.830
So there's a sense in which
the various separate episodes

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:51.620
of Modern Times, taken together,
dramatize, in small, the whole

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.570
of the Tramp's career.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:57.150
And there are many specific
bits of business and scenes

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.560
in Modern Times that are
little repetitions, or echoes,

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:06.020
or reprises of earlier Chaplin
films, which have caused

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.170
a shock of recognition in
the audience, a happy kind

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:11.177
of recognition.

00:45:11.177 --> 00:45:12.510
There are many examples of that.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.010
There are many earlier films
which deal with restaurants.

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:16.635
You'll see some of
them from the shorts

00:45:16.635 --> 00:45:18.480
that you've looked
at, certain echoes.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.360
I won't talk about any of them
beyond mentioning that there's

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.987
a remarkable sequence in
the film-- if we have time,

00:45:25.987 --> 00:45:26.820
I'll show it to you.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.140
But we probably won't
have time-- in which

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.240
we see Charlie on skates.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.941
And that scene alludes
to a whole short

00:45:34.941 --> 00:45:37.190
that Chaplain had made, in
which he plays a waiter who

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:38.900
has to serve people on skates.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.720
And you'll see that he
has to do that again

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.820
at the end of the film.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.204
He sort of reprises that role.

00:45:43.204 --> 00:45:44.620
And then there's
an earlier moment

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.740
in the film where we see
Chaplin states as well.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:50.560
But the main point is that
virtually every moment

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.740
in Modern Times has some
counterpart in an earlier

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:54.770
Chaplain short.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:57.270
So there would have been a sense
of the audience coming back

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.650
to Charlie, returning
to the world

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:02.290
that Charlie stood
for, when they

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:05.010
came to watch Modern Times.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.130
So it's a culmination
of Chaplin's career.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.740
But it's also in a deep
sense, like The General,

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.490
a culmination of silent film.

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:13.886
And it would have had
that nostalgic affect.

00:46:13.886 --> 00:46:15.510
It would have had
that nostalgic effect

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.780
on the original audience.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.120
Most of the original audience
would have recognized the film

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.730
as an embodiment of a phase of
movie going that had passed.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:32.910
And we should watch it
in that way as well.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.511
I want to say a word
about the Gamin.

00:46:34.511 --> 00:46:36.760
That's the character, the
female character in the film

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.230
because she
represents an advance

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.510
over any previous Chaplin movie.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:46.280
As I suggested earlier,
in most Chaplin films,

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.900
women are relatively
stereotyped and don't

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.770
play very active roles.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.490
This is the first
film in which there's

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:56.090
a woman who seems to be in
some sense the Tramp's equal,

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:57.510
in many ways more
than his equal.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:58.420
She has more energy.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.030
She's a bit younger.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.406
You might watch
for the ambiguity

00:47:01.406 --> 00:47:02.321
in their relationship.

00:47:02.321 --> 00:47:04.420
Is it a sexual relationship,
a romantic relation?

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.350
Probably not.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.730
Charlie's a lot
older than the Gamin.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:10.210
In real life, he was
having an affair with her,

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:13.130
I might mention to you.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:16.110
In fact, he was famous
for having relations

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:19.690
with young women, especially
his young actresses.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.810
And there were scandals
connected to Chaplin's name

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:24.740
partly because of this.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.180
And Paulette
Goddard, the actress

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.980
who plays the
Gamin in this film,

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.590
entered on a career
of great fame

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:35.330
in the movies, partly
because of this role.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:38.730
And you could see how expressive
and remarkable her face is.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.420
This is the first
female character

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:44.950
who has energy, will, who has
a kind of aggressive capacity

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:47.560
to be resilient and
care for herself.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.290
And that represents a tremendous
advance in Chaplin's work.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:53.850
She's the first sort of
semi-independent female

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:54.860
in Chaplin's work.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.234
And you can see
in a certain way,

00:47:56.234 --> 00:47:57.840
she's a kind of
partner for Chaplin.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.590
When this film ends with
Charlie and the Gamin

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:03.670
walking down the road
toward an unknown future,

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.270
the only difference between
that ending and the ending

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.740
we normally see in
a Chaplain short

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.500
is that Chaplain
is usually alone

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.500
when he walks down the
road toward the mountains

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:13.360
in the distance.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.350
And in this film,
he is has partner.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:17.640
So there's a slight
suggestion of,

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.280
if not exactly hopefulness,
at least the resilience,

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.010
of the capacity to survive.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:24.150
You have someone to help you.

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.717
And you might watch the way the
Paulette Goddard character is

00:48:27.717 --> 00:48:28.550
treated in the film.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:31.120
Because she actually
represents something new

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.510
in Chaplin's work,
a real advance

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.610
in his understanding of how to
deal with female characters.

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:43.810
A new kind of respect for
women show up in this film.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.570
I've mentioned the
soundtrack before.

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:47.510
But I want to quickly
call your attention

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.800
to two features of it.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.075
One is that Chaplin arranged
the sound track very carefully.

00:48:53.075 --> 00:48:54.450
And what you'll
notice if you pay

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:58.470
attention is that the
soundtrack has what

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:05.900
we might call a quality in
which particular themes recur

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.150
when certain characters
appear on screen.

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:12.300
And you begin to
associate certain melodies

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.670
with certain characters.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:15.540
And you should watch
the way this unfolds.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.990
I mean the melody that's played
behind the Chaplain character

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.830
was actually a popular
song of the day, entitled,

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.980
although the words are never
sung in the film, "Hallelujah,

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.380
I'm a Tramp."

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.130
And it was a song
about being free,

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.860
and not having to worry
about working, and riding

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:32.910
the rails, and so forth.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:34.130
Hurray, I don't have a job.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:37.437
Hurray I'm a free,
in those ways.

00:49:37.437 --> 00:49:39.770
But each of the characters,
each of the major characters

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.730
in the film, has a musical theme
associated with him or her.

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.200
And you should watch the
way they sort of meld in

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.360
and blend together.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.010
Chaplain took the sound in
the film very seriously.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.470
I've mentioned
the talking theme.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:54.450
Watch the mocking
way in which talk

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:58.730
itself, speech, is dealt
with in the soundtrack.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.350
You might want to talk about
this in your recitations.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.170
But ask yourself
what's going on there?

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:07.440
Why would Chaplain, in
the end, denigrate talk?

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.580
I think the answer is obvious.

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.160
The Tramp is a silent character.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.020
It's as if this is the revenge
of silent film on talkies.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.920
It's as if the film is saying
talk is crap, talk is silly,

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.880
talk is ridiculous.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.130
Who needs talk?

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.070
Watch how the film repeatedly
makes fun of talking

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:31.590
or shows talking as
inadequate or unnecessary.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.280
And also the way
the film associates

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.113
talkies with something
else that the film is

00:50:35.113 --> 00:50:39.440
very hostile to, which is
mechanized industrialization.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.920
The film is a critique
of the excesses

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.190
of capitalism and the
excesses especially,

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:47.260
the tedium of factory work.

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:53.060
And talk and talking
films are associated

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.950
with what the film identifies
as evil or dangerous,

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:57.969
as you'll see.

00:50:57.969 --> 00:50:59.510
But there's also a
moment in the film

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.339
that-- I won't show it to you.

00:51:01.339 --> 00:51:03.630
But I'll mention it and ask
you to watch for it-- where

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:04.589
we can see another way.

00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:06.338
It's only one of the
ways in which Chaplin

00:51:06.338 --> 00:51:07.170
manipulates sound.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:09.880
And it's an interesting moment
because it's easy to miss,

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.760
easy not to register
what's happening there.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.800
There's a moment in the
center of the film where

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.960
Charlie and the Gamin escape
their difficulties briefly.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.760
Charlie gets a job as a night
watchman in a department store.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.170
And the department store
is like capitalist heaven.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:26.749
They've been living hand
to mouth, nearly starving.

00:51:26.749 --> 00:51:28.790
And they find themselves
in the department store.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:29.490
There's food.

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:30.510
There are beds.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.270
There are beautiful
warm clothes.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:33.390
There are toys.

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.820
There are even roller skates.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.778
And there's a moment when
Charlie and the Gamin

00:51:36.778 --> 00:51:39.580
exploring the store, having
this exciting experience

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.460
with all these goods,
which they are deprived of.

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.469
It's not an accident
that that scene is

00:51:44.469 --> 00:51:45.760
at the very center of the film.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.330
Almost all the scenes on either
side of the department store

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.280
scene rhyme with
each in certain ways,

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.210
as an aspect of the
structure of the film.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.543
And I'll come to that in second.

00:51:54.543 --> 00:51:56.160
I'll conclude with that point.

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.400
But the department store
scene is the only one that

00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.720
doesn't have any counterpart.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.470
It's right at the very
center of the film.

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:03.580
And what one can feel
is the way in which

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:07.580
that dramatizes the
injustice, the sense of haves

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.850
and have nots that is at the
center of the film's meaning.

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:13.930
The film is always in some
sense interested in that topic.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.960
So there's a moment when
the Gamin and Charlie

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.620
find themselves in this store.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.560
Charlie, in his exuberance
and high spirits,

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.180
straps on roller skates
and begins skating around.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.030
And if you listen
to the soundtrack,

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.480
you'll see the soundtrack is
very beautiful and gentle.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.310
And you know, dah.

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:32.220
It's very calming and exciting.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.810
And as Charlie is
skating, the camera

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.220
shows that, in
fact, he's skating

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.770
in a very dangerous area.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:38.740
The store is partly
under construction.

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.660
And on one point,
while he's skating,

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.330
he puts a blindfold on.

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.930
And he's still
skating very calmly,

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.290
and beautifully, and gracefully.

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:49.425
And the soundtrack under it is
very graceful and appropriate

00:52:49.425 --> 00:52:50.680
to his feelings.

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.590
But what the camera
shows, what you see,

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:55.680
is him coming near
the edge of an abyss.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.100
Actually, it's a platform.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.810
He might fall three stories
down into the lower story.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:02.860
And he's not aware of it
because he's blindfolded.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:04.446
And the sound-- and
then, of course,

00:53:04.446 --> 00:53:06.820
there's a certain moment where
he takes the blindfold off

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.517
and he sees that
he's about to fall.

00:53:08.517 --> 00:53:09.350
And he gets nervous.

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.330
And he suddenly is no
longer so graceful.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.690
It's kind of a minor joke.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:17.500
But what's really
interesting about the moment

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.560
is to think about what Chaplain
is doing with the soundtrack.

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.720
Because when you reflect
on it, what you realize

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.360
is that what Chaplain has
done with that soundtrack

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.060
is have it reflect not
the external reality

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.170
that we're all watching, but
the inner feelings that Charlie

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:31.730
is feeling.

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:33.340
What he's done is
he's discovered

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:36.400
a way-- it's a simple point,
but it's a brilliant discovery.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.220
He's discovered a way
to use the soundtrack

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.740
to express a subjective state.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:44.090
And what he's also
discovered, of course,

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:45.260
is that-- although
other people had

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:46.510
discovered this principle too.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:48.930
But Chaplin's using it
with great intelligence.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:52.130
He's discovered that the
soundtrack and the visual track

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:54.300
don't have to
absolutely coincide.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.470
That they can report
different emotions

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:58.990
or cause different
kinds of reaction.

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:02.360
And that what you get when
you have this disjunction

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.420
is something much more complex.

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.660
We see Charlie is
skating in danger.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.370
But his obliviousness
to the danger

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.030
is partly registered by
the music, which tells us

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:12.850
not about what's
happening outwardly,

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:14.867
but what's happening
inside Charlie.

00:54:14.867 --> 00:54:16.950
And there are other moments
like this in the film,

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:18.450
not necessarily
with the soundtrack,

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:20.970
but in other ways, in
which the subjective states

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:22.707
of the characters are explored.

00:54:22.707 --> 00:54:24.290
Pay attention to
those because they're

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.970
very remarkable and interesting
moments, in which Chaplain

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:31.820
is expanding the
repertoire of film.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.110
The structure of the film
is especially interesting.

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.690
And I won't say more
about it, than to say

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.820
if you watch closely
what you will see

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:42.550
is the structure is a profound
structure of repetition.

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:45.720
As in The General,
the film's first half

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.360
is revisited in the
film's second half.

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.627
It's as if the film is based
on a series of rhyming scenes.

00:54:51.627 --> 00:54:53.210
In the first half
of the film, there's

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.510
a fantasy sequence in
which we see Charlie

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:59.530
and the Gamin inside a kind
of cabined environment,

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.040
inside a kind of domestic scene.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.750
It's actually a
fantasy scene, in which

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:06.505
Charlie imagines a suburban
heaven for him and the Gamin.

00:55:06.505 --> 00:55:08.130
In the second half
of the film, there's

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.830
an actual cabin in the mud
flats that they live in.

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:13.370
And those two scenes are
sort of in conversation

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:14.500
with each other.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.210
There are two extended
sequences in factories

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:21.120
and involving the
malfunctioning of machinery.

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.980
And what you'll notice,
if you pay close attention

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.590
to the film, is that this
principle of rhyming scenes

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:30.150
creates a situation in which
in the second half of the film

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:32.580
you partly feel that
you're revisiting

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:35.640
scenes and experiences
that you've had before.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.800
And one of the reasons
that this is a useful

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.110
and an important idea is that if
you think about Charlie's life

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:44.400
and you think about the previous
history of Chaplin's career

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.990
as a director and as an
actor, what you realize

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:49.560
is that in a deep sense
what Modern Times is doing

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.180
is replicating the history
of Charlie's career.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:56.040
Because Charlie has
held a series of jobs.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.790
Charlie has been in
15, or 20, or 40,

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.390
or a hundred different
environments.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:05.320
And in virtually every
case or in every case,

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.640
the ending has been the same.

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.900
He has been released into an
ambiguous kind of homelessness

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.780
and freedom at the
end of the film.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.800
There's something footloose,
homeless, and unfinished

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.940
about Charlie's life.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.070
And after a while, you
come to realize you

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:21.850
this would have
been true by 1920,

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:23.460
if you had paid
attention to the 30

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.870
or so other Chaplin shorts
that already existed.

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:29.130
The fact is that it's
an endless process.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:31.610
So another thing that the
structure of Modern Times

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:35.250
manages to dramatize, maybe
more deeply and powerfully

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:38.790
than any prior Chaplin film has
been able to do exactly because

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:41.830
of this mirror structure,
is that this principle

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.780
of repetition never
ends, that Charlie

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:45.250
is on a kind of treadmill.

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:50.260
And, of course, Charlie revisits
scenes and repeats actions

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.720
that we'd seen
earlier in the film

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.020
because his life is a
series of repetitions.

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.550
Because the film's
vision of social life

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:59.780
for a character like Charlie
is one that's so mordant.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.550
What he's suggesting is things
are hard, things are tough.

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:05.469
This man's homelessness, this
man's hunger, will never abate.

00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:07.510
He's going to have a
struggle for his whole life.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:10.790
But we don't despair because
the Chaplain character

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.810
himself doesn't despair.

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:17.087
So pay attention to the way the
structure embodies the meaning.

00:57:17.087 --> 00:57:18.920
The point I'm making
now, and I'll come back

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.280
to this later in the course,
the point I'm making now

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.210
is a way of talking
about what could

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.910
be called the film's
commitment to the principle

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:28.080
of organic form.

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:33.080
When the structure of a text is
organic, what is meant by that

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:37.880
is that the structure
itself embodies meaning.

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.950
That the way the
text is organized

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:43.332
carries the themes of the text.

00:57:43.332 --> 00:57:45.540
And if you think about the
structure of Modern Times,

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.790
you'll see that it's a
marvelously distilled instance,

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:53.500
a marvelously clear instance, of
the principle of organic form.

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.910
What happens to
Charlie serially is

00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:57.760
more meaningful in a
way than what happens

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.350
to him in a single episode.

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:01.584
And the fact that
we have this sense

00:58:01.584 --> 00:58:04.000
that things are repeating,
that Charlie is on a treadmill,

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.100
that he lives a cyclical life,
that he'll always have moments

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:12.270
of hope and hopelessness, that
he'll have momentary times when

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:14.840
he finds a place to live
or find sufficient food.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.240
But that it will
always be temporary.

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.150
That his life is
always on the road.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.370
That his life is
always in process.

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:23.970
And that, at the
same time, he never

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.230
lets himself completely despair.

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:30.270
There's always a moment where
his resilience reasserts

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.870
itself.

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.650
Where those elements
are embedded

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:34.750
in some sense in
the very structure,

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.390
the very organization
of the film.

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.790
And I urge you to watch it.

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:40.840
What's been embedded or implied
in a good deal of what I've

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.670
been saying tonight
also has to do

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:48.030
broadly with what might
be called as the director

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:50.510
Chaplin's complexity.

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:52.970
Almost every moment in
Chaplin, and certainly

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:55.120
almost every moment
in Modern Times,

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.270
has the kind of
multiplicity, or density,

00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:59.700
or texture that I've
been describing to you

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.630
as the mark of a serious film.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:04.700
The mark of what I want
to call a work of art.

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.660
And if you pay attention,
one of the things you'll find

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:10.710
is that even the moments that
seem on the surface to be

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.240
the simplest ones, are not.

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.909
Or even the
implications in the film

00:59:13.909 --> 00:59:15.200
that seem the simplest are not.

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.150
Just one example, the film's
critique of capitalism,

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:21.560
of a certain kind of excessive
form of industrial capitalism,

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.305
is obvious and very deep.

00:59:24.305 --> 00:59:30.020
I mean the film is deeply
hostile to the dehumanization

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.620
that work on the assembly
line generates for people.

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:37.130
And Chaplain works wonderfully
comic variations on this idea.

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:40.385
And yet if you think of
the film in a simple way,

00:59:40.385 --> 00:59:43.050
if you think in the
film in a simple way

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:46.262
as a kind of Marxist
or left-wing screed,

00:59:46.262 --> 00:59:47.220
you're really mistaken.

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:48.520
And some people did, in fact.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:52.650
And Chaplain was hounded
out of the United States

00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:54.700
later in his career,
in part because he

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:58.180
was associated with what we
thought to be left-wing causes.

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.835
But Chaplin's socialism was
of a particularly sentimental

01:00:00.835 --> 01:00:01.335
variety.

01:00:01.335 --> 01:00:04.170
And he was certainly no
systematic communist.

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:06.400
But the most important
thing about Chaplain

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.251
is his complexity.

01:00:07.251 --> 01:00:09.500
Because if you look closely
at the film, one of things

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.990
you'll find that it isn't just
capital that's criticized.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.480
It's also labor.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.200
There's a wonderful moment in
the film when Charlie finally,

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.420
after times of difficulty,
reads in the newspaper

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.299
that the factory
is hiring again.

01:00:22.299 --> 01:00:23.215
And he's very excited.

01:00:23.215 --> 01:00:24.330
And he leaves the Gamin.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.730
They'd been living in their
little sort of idyllic cabin

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:30.634
in the mud flats in the
second half of the film.

01:00:30.634 --> 01:00:31.925
And he runs out to the factory.

01:00:31.925 --> 01:00:33.210
And he gets hired.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:35.680
And just as he's about
to start his work,

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.870
the workers go on strike and
his life is destroyed again.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:43.620
And, in fact, the
truth of the matter

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.620
is that Chaplain is an
equal opportunity insulter.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.200
He thinks that labor
is just as stupid.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.270
Organized labor is just as
foolish, just as misguided

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:53.180
as capital.

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:56.500
Something of the complexity
of his social vision

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.630
is reflected there.

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:00.650
And something of the complexity
of his moral and psychological

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:04.940
vision is reflected in the
way the Tramp interacts

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:05.830
with the Gamin.

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:08.650
And in the way in which both the
Tramp and the Gamin together,

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:10.170
at different
moments in the film,

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.517
try to buck each other up.

01:01:11.517 --> 01:01:14.100
So we see that there are moments
in which each character falls

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.410
into a kind of despair in
the face of the difficulties

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.820
that they encounter
and in which they

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.630
are helped by their partner.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:27.360
So there's a kind of
complexity or maturity

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.540
in Chaplin's way
of understanding

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.900
even the social difficulty,
the social evils,

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.140
the social problems
that he recurrently

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.970
dramatizes in his film.

01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:40.350
For those of you who have never
seen a Chaplin film before,

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:42.950
and especially those of you who
have never see Modern Times,

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.700
let me conclude by
saying I'm a little bit

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.800
jealous of the opportunity
you have to see

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.270
this film for the first time.

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:51.020
It's one of the very
few silent films

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.540
I think-- I think The General is
also one-- that actually stands

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.090
on its own.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:57.840
That's worth watching,
even without any arguments

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.020
about its artifactual value.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.340
I wish you the joy of
this remarkable film.

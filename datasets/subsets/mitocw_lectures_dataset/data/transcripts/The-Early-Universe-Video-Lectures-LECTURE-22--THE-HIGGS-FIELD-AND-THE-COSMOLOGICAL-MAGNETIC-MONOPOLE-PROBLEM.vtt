00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:23.070
PROFESSOR: As you know,
Professor Guth is away.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.250
I'm substituting for
today, he didn't leave me

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.230
with a particularly
coherent game plan,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.340
so I'm going to begin with
where he thinks we should start.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.350
Please jump in if I am
just repeating something

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.259
that he has already
described to you guys,

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:41.550
or if there's anything you
like me go over a little bit

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.310
more detail, I will
do my best here.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.470
So, I'm working off of
a fairly rough plan.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.450
But let me just
quickly describe what--

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.100
based on what Alan has explained
to me --what we're planning

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.686
to talk about today,
and if there's

00:00:57.686 --> 00:00:59.102
any adjustments
you think I should

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:00.351
be making that would be great.

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.800
So, the game plan for today.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.616
What I want to do
very quickly is

00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:09.240
hit on a couple of
the key points which

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330
I believe you talked
about last week,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.040
which is a quick review
of the essential features

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.669
of symmetries of
the gauge fields

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:22.960
the make up the standard model.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.490
Now, I believe you
guys did in fact talk

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.400
about this last week,
at least briefly.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.483
And you talked about how
you can take these things

00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:43.141
and embed them in a larger
gauge group, the group SU(5).

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.890
I'm not going to talk
about that too much,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.560
but I want to just quickly
hit on a few elements related

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.240
to this before we get into that.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.034
From this we'll then talk about
the Higgs mechanism-- really

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:55.700
I'm going to talk
about the Higgs field,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.658
I'm not going to talk
about the Higgs mechanism

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:02.870
quite so much as motivate
why it is necessary--

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.550
and then talk about how
the Higgs field behaves

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.870
and why it's important for
the next problem, which

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.230
is what is called the
cosmological monopole problem.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.685
To be more specific
magnetic monopole problem.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.560
I confess I feel a little
bit awkward talking

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.650
about this problem
on behalf of Alan.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.370
This would be kind of
like if you were planning

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.840
on studying Hamlet and there
was this guy W. Shakespeare who

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.200
was listed as the
instructor and you walk in

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.890
and discover there's this
guy Warren Shackspeare, who's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.098
actually going to be teaching
or something like that.

00:02:54.098 --> 00:02:56.850
I kind of feel like Warren here.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.290
This stuff really is Allen's
thing, so it's sort of,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.057
I'm probably going to leave this
at the denouement of all this

00:03:05.057 --> 00:03:06.890
when you actually get
into inflation to him.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.500
I may have a little bit of time
at the end to just motivate

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.030
it a little bit, but the grand
summary will come from him.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:26.230
OK, so, as discussed by
Alan the standard model

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.480
describes all the
fundamental interactions

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.510
between particles
via gauge theories.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.400
OK, and these gauge theories
all have a combined symmetry

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.620
group that is traditionally
written in a somewhat

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:17.990
awkward form, SU(3)
cross SU(2) cross U(1).

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.529
U(1) could be an
SU(1) for reasons

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.070
which I'll elucidate
a little bit more

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.450
clearly in just a moment.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.210
There's really no point in
putting the S on that one.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.130
So each of these
things essentially

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.170
labels the particular
symmetry group.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:45.910
So, the "S" an
element of SU(n) is

00:04:45.910 --> 00:05:04.436
a matrix that is n x n, that
is unitary-- that's the U.

00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:07.380
Unitary just means that the
inverse and the transpose

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.610
of the matrix at the same,
actually the Hermitian

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.169
conjugate because they
can be complex, in fact,

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:13.960
they generally are.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.955
And it has determinant of 1.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.460
That's what the special refers
to, special, the S in SU(n)

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.880
stands for special unitary n.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.990
So, the S means
that the determinant

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.640
is one-- that's what's
special about it-- unitary

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.730
is this idea that the inverse
Hermitian conjugate are

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.430
the same, and then n
refers to all these things.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.656
So, that tells us that the
gauge degrees of freedom

00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:47.530
are related by a symmetry
that looks like a 3

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.620
by 3 matrix with
these properties,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.480
as listed there for the
SU(3) piece of the symmetry.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.120
SU(2) means it's
a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.290
And U(1) means it's a one by one
matrix, what's a 1 by 1 matrix?

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.392
It's a number, its
a complex number.

00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:04.850
And that's why we
don't really need

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.230
to put an "s" in front of it.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.740
If it's a complex
number its determinant

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.480
is 1 if it's just a complex
number whose modules is one.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.860
That's why we don't bother
with the S on the U(1).

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.229
So, I think you've already
hit on some of this

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.270
but this is sort of useful
to review because it's

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.910
going to set up why we
need to introduce a Higgs

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.050
mechanism in a little bit.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.820
Let me just quickly
hit on what the details

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.110
structure of this looks
like for you want to think

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:46.150
is the easiest one understand,
So, as I just said,

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.540
a one by one matrix is
just a complex number.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.820
So that means that any
element of this group

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:11.390
is a complex number, which
we can write in the form z

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.990
equals ei theta, where
theta is a real number.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.460
Now, the thing which
is I want to hit on

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.960
in this, the reason I want to
describe this a little bit is,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.140
this may not smell
like the gauge symmetry

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.620
that you're used to if you
study classical E&M. Some of you

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.190
here are in 807
with me right now,

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.300
and we've gone over this
quite a bit recently.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.160
How is this akin to the gauge
group that we are normally

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.799
used to when we
talk about the gauge

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:40.340
freedom of electricity
and magnetism?

00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:57.550
Well, it turns out
there's actually

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.520
a very simple relationship
between one and the other,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.880
rather between this view
of it and the way we learn

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.095
about it when we study
classical E&M. It's simply

00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:13.720
that we use a somewhat different
language, because when we talk

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.340
about it in this group
theoretic picture we're doing it

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.310
in the way that is sort of
tuned to a quantum field theory.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.800
So, the way we have learned
about electromagnetic gauge

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:43.739
symmetry in terms of the
fields sort of goes as follows.

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:46.030
We actually work with the
potentials, and so what we do

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:54.860
is we note that the potentials
Amu, which you can write

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.760
as a four vector, whose
time-like component is

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.710
the negative of the
scalar potential,

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.320
and whose spatial
components are just

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.160
the three components of
the vector potential.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:34.030
So, this potential and
this potential-- --okay

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:40.179
this is possibly module of
factor of c somewhere in here

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.970
but I'm going to imagine
the speed of light

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.490
has been set equal to 1.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.760
Both of those potentials
generate the same E&B fields.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.589
OK, again you still
should be looking at this

00:10:12.589 --> 00:10:14.380
and thinking to yourself
what the hell does

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.200
this have to do with the
U(1) as we presented it here.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.960
I've given you a
bunch of operations

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.060
that involve some kind of
a scale or function of time

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.680
and space.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.490
And I've added particular
components of this four vector

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.790
in this way, what does that
to do with this multiplication

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.887
by a complex number?

00:10:32.887 --> 00:10:34.470
Well, where it comes
from is that when

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.930
we study E&M, not as a
classical field theory

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.250
but as a quantum
field theory, we

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.800
have a field that
describes the electron.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.540
So, where it comes
from is that when

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.360
you examine the Dirac field,
which is the quantum field

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.270
theory that governs the
electron, when you change gauge

00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:00.300
the electron field acquires
a local phase change.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.520
So in particular,
what we find is

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:46.292
that if we have a field
5x, which those of you who

00:11:46.292 --> 00:11:48.250
have taken a little bit
of quantum field theory

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.240
should know this is
actually a spinner field,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.140
but for now, just think of it
as some kind of a field that

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.970
under the field
equations of quantum

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.544
electrodynamics-- the Dirac
equation or high order

00:12:01.544 --> 00:12:03.710
ones that have been developed
by Feynman, Schwinger,

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.860
and others-- under
a change of gauge

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:14.290
this goes over to
si prime of x, which

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.800
equals e to the--
terrible notation

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.030
I realized-- 1e is obviously
the root of natural logs,

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.240
e sub 0 is the fundamental
electric charge.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.200
OK, can everyone read that?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.870
I didn't block it too badly here
I'm not used to this classroom.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:48.240
So, here's the thing to note,
is that this field lambda, which

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.425
we learned about
in classical E&M

00:12:52.425 --> 00:12:58.165
directly connects to the phase
function of the Dirac field

00:12:58.165 --> 00:12:59.290
in quantum electrodynamics.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.730
So, our gauge symmetry
is simply expressed

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.700
in the quantum version
of electrodynamics

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:18.660
by a function of the form e
to the i real number, where

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.840
that real number is the
fundamental electric charge

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.630
times the classical
gauge generator.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.780
So, this is what is meant when
people say that electrodynamics

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.325
is a U(1) gauge theory.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.190
Now, I'm not going to go
into this level of detail

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.760
for the other two
gauge symmetry that

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.680
are built into the
standard model.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.380
But, what I want
you to understand

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.690
is that the root idea
is very, very similar.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:47.770
It's just now, instead of my
gauge functions looking like e

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:53.430
to the i, some kind of a local
gauge phase of x multiplying

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.820
my functions, my
quantities which

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.020
generate the gauge
transformation are going

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.340
to become complex
value matrices.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.390
So that makes them a
lot more complicated,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.830
and it's responsible
for the fact

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.860
that the weak and the
strong interactions

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.420
are non-abelian paid which
order you perform the gauge

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.620
transformation in matters.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.690
Question.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.440
AUDIENCE: What's the
physical significance

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.625
of them being non-abelian?

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:17.250
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.470
So, what is a
physical significance

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.553
of them being non-abelian?

00:15:23.877 --> 00:15:29.790
I'm trying think of a really
simple way to put this,

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:36.510
it's-- Alan would have an
answer to this right off the top

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.120
of his head, so I
apologize for this--

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.920
this isn't the kind of thing
that I work on every day so I

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.790
don't have an answer right
at the very top of my head,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.920
unfortunately.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.604
Let me get back to
you on that one, OK,

00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:48.770
that's something I can't
give you a quick answer to.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:55.180
It's an excellent question and
it's an important question.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.500
Any other questions?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.210
OK, so, here's a basic
picture that we have.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:21.230
So, we find is that the
strong interactions have

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:29.680
a similar structure where
my need to e to the i factor

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:47.380
goes over to a 3 by 3 matrix,
and the weak interactions

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:57.070
in a similar structure with my
e to the i factor going over

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.760
to a 2 by 2 complex matrix.

00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:09.740
OK, what does this have
to do with cosmology?

00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:16.400
In fact, as an enormous
amount to do with cosmology,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.079
as we'll see over the course
of the rest of course.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:24.240
Part of the thing which is
interesting about all this

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.600
is that we have strong
experimental reasons,

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.110
and theoretical
reasons to believe,

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.230
that the different symmetries
that these interactions

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.380
participate in, the
different symmetries that we

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.880
see them having, that isn't the
way things have always been.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.580
So, in particular when the
universe was a lot hotter

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.550
and denser these different
symmetries actually

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.880
all began to look the same.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.395
In particular the one which
is particularly important,

00:17:53.395 --> 00:18:04.410
and you guys have surely heard
of this, is that the SU(2)--

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:15.360
if we just focus on electric
and the weak piece of this--

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.530
SU(2) cross U(1).

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:23.100
So, this is associated
with the gauge boson that

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.620
carry the weak force, OK, the
z boson, the w plus, and the w

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.460
minus.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.181
And your U(1) ends up being
associated with the photon.

00:18:31.181 --> 00:18:32.680
In many ways, when
you actually look

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.730
at the equations that
govern these things,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.830
they seem very,
very similar to one

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:42.025
another except that
the-- here's partly

00:18:42.025 --> 00:18:43.400
an answer to your
question I just

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:49.280
realized-- the gauge
generators of these things

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.185
have a mass
associated with them.

00:18:51.185 --> 00:18:52.560
That mass ends up
being connected

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.380
to the non-abelian
nature of these things.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.400
That's not the whole answer,
but it has a connection to that.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.940
That's one thing
which I do remember,

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.450
like I said I feel
this is really

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.140
Alan's perfect framework
here and I'm just

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.640
a posture in bad shoes.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.050
So if we look at this
thing, what we see

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.690
is that these symmetry groups,
what's particularly interesting

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:23.740
is that U(1) can be regarded
as a piece of SU(2).

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:29.530
And we would expect
that in a perfect world

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.900
they would actually
be SU(2) governing

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.430
both the electric and
the weak interactions.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.350
Whereby perfect
I mean everything

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.090
is a nice balmy 10 to the 16th
GeV throughout all of space

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.470
time, and all the different
vector bosons happily

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:47.569
exchange with one another,
not caring with who is who.

00:19:47.569 --> 00:19:49.110
It's actually not
very perfect if you

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.568
want to teach a physics class
and have a nice conversation,

00:19:51.568 --> 00:19:54.050
but if you are interested in
perfect symmetry among gauge

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:58.520
interactions it's
very, very nice.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:12.130
So, the fact that
these are separate

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.870
is now-- I was about to use the
word believed but it's stronger

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.780
and that, we now know
this for sure thanks

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.590
to all the exciting work
that happened at the LHC

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:26.440
over the past year or two-- the
fact that these symmetries are

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.650
separate is due to what is
called spontaneous symmetry

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.150
breaking.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:51.100
So, let's talk very
briefly about what

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.590
goes into this spontaneous
symmetry breaking.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.560
So SU(2) turns
out to actually be

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.204
isomorphic to the group
of rotations on a sphere.

00:21:15.204 --> 00:21:16.620
So, when you think
about something

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.120
that has perfect
SU(2) symmetry it's

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.010
as though you have perfect
symmetry when you move around

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.624
through a whole host
of different angles.

00:21:24.624 --> 00:21:26.790
OK, so you move through all
of your different angles

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:31.050
and everyone looks exactly
identical to all the others.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.820
If you break that
symmetry it may

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.530
mean you're picking out
one angle as being special,

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.090
and then you only retain
a symmetry with respect

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.250
to the other angle.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.920
And essentially, that is what
happens when SU(2) breaks off

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.600
in a U(1) piece of it.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.280
Something has occurred
that picked out

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.220
one of these directions.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.142
And by the way, you have to
think very abstractly here.

00:21:55.142 --> 00:21:57.350
This is not necessarily a
direction in physical space

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.725
we're talking
about here but it's

00:21:58.725 --> 00:22:01.450
a direction in the
space of gauge fields.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.714
So, if we imagine that all of
these, my gauge fields in some

00:22:04.714 --> 00:22:06.630
sense the different
components of them defined

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.840
in some abstract
space direction,

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.120
initially these
things are completely

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.970
symmetric with
respect to rotations

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.400
in some kind of an abstract
notion of a sphere.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.570
And then something
happens to freeze

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.825
one of the directions
and only symmetries

00:22:19.825 --> 00:22:21.950
with respect to one of the
angles remains the same.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.390
Let's just write that
out, when SU(2)'s symmetry

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:52.830
is broken so one of the
directions in the space

00:22:52.830 --> 00:23:02.090
of gauge fields is
picked out as special.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.980
That direction
then ends up being

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.740
associated with
your U(1) symmetry.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.570
So, what is the mechanism that
actually breaks the symmetry

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.720
and causes this to happen.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.490
Well, this is what the
Higgs field is all about.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:57.120
The idea is there is some field
that fills all of space time.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.490
It has the property that
at very high energies

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.310
it is extremely symmetric,
with to respect all these gauge

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.330
fields, all directions and
sort of gauge field space

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.980
look exactly the same.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.370
And then as things cool, as
the energy density goes down

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.580
by the temperature of the
expanding universe, cooling

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:26.190
everything off, the Higgs field
moves to a particular place

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.460
that picks out some direction
in the space of gauge fields

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.470
as being special.

00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:36.430
So let's make this a
little bit more concrete.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.570
OK.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.903
You guys have probably heard
quite a lot about the Higgs

00:25:15.903 --> 00:25:17.710
field over the
past couple years,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.510
months-- what actually is it?

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:38.410
Well, the field itself is
described by a complex doublet.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.000
So, if you actually see someone
write down a Higgs field what

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.080
they will actually
write down is h,

00:25:53.080 --> 00:26:00.900
being a two components
spinner, whose components are

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:06.450
h1 of x, h2 of
x-- where x really

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.840
stands for space time
coordinates, so that's time

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.690
and all of your
spatial coordinates--

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:15.940
and both h1 and h2
are complex fields.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.760
The thing which is particularly
key to understanding

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.040
the importance of this
thing is that h transforms,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:59.300
under gauge transformations,
with elements of SU(2).

00:27:06.495 --> 00:27:08.120
So, if you want to
change gauge the way

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:13.060
you're going to do it is you're
going to have some new Higgs

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:13.560
field.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:30.930
So remember, if U(2)
is an element of SU(2)

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.250
we call it the
two by two matrix.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:43.150
This is what they look like
in a new gauge OK-- pardon me

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.380
a second I don't see
a clock in this room,

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.920
I just want to make sure I
know the time, thank you.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.266
OK, so, what are we
going to do with this?

00:27:54.266 --> 00:27:56.390
Well, there's a couple
features which it must have,

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.330
so the Higgs field
fills all of space time

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.780
and it has an energy
density associated

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.680
with it, which we will call
just the potential energy.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.612
It's really an energy
density, but, whatever.

00:28:13.612 --> 00:28:15.820
The energy density that is
associated with this thing

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:16.915
must be gauge invariant.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.870
OK, even when you're
working with strong fields

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:46.390
and weak fields, the lesson
of gauge invariance from E&M

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.190
still holds.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.450
OK, one of the key points was
that the gauge fields affect

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:54.760
potentials, they allow us
to manipulate our equations

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.800
to put things into a form where
the calculation may be easier.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.425
But at the end of the day, there
are certain things it actually

00:29:00.425 --> 00:29:03.080
exert forces that
cause things to happen,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.770
those must be invariant to
the gauge transformation.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.410
Energy density is
of those things.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.016
If you were to get
into your spaceship

00:29:10.016 --> 00:29:11.390
and go back to
the early universe

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.640
and actually take a little
scoop of early universe out

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.590
and measure the energy density,
A, that would be cool, but B

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.350
it would be something
that couldn't actually

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.417
depend on what
gauge you were using

00:29:22.417 --> 00:29:23.500
to make your measurements.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.024
That is something that is
a complete artifice of how

00:29:26.024 --> 00:29:27.440
you want to set
up the convenience

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.770
of your calculation.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:36.300
So, in order for the energy
density to be gauge invariant

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.570
we have to find a gauge
invariant quantity that

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:42.160
is constructed from this, which
is the only thing the energy

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.060
density can depend on.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.360
This means, let's call
our energy density V,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.150
it's the potential
energy density.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:11.380
So, it can only depend on
the following combination

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:23.050
of the fundamental fields Pretty
much just what you'd expect.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:27.330
This is sort of the
equivalent to saying

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.220
that if you're working
in spherical symmetry

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.220
the electrostatic
potential can only

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.200
depend on the distance
from a point charge.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.130
This is a very similar
kind of construct

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.160
here, where I'm taking
the only quantity that

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.150
follows in a fully
symmetric way, of calling

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.447
the fact that this is a
special unitary matrix that I

00:30:47.447 --> 00:30:48.780
can construct from these things.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.670
So then, where all
the magic comes

00:30:55.670 --> 00:31:01.890
in is in how the Higgs field
potential energy density

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.980
varies as a function of
this h, this magnitude of h.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.857
So, as I plot v as
a function of h,

00:31:42.857 --> 00:31:44.940
in order to get your
spontaneous symmetry breaking

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.070
to happen what you want
is for the minimum of V,

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:53.540
the minimum potential
energy, to occur somewhere

00:31:53.540 --> 00:32:21.310
out at a non-zero value
of the Higgs field H.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.135
Now, why is that so special?

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.030
The thing that is so
special about that

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:46.320
is that when I constructed
this magnitude of h,

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.350
I actually lost a
lot of information

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.000
about the Higgs field.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.860
OK, let's just say for
the sake of argument

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:56.120
that this minimum
occurs at a place where

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.580
the Higgs field in some system
of units has a value of 1.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.990
So, all I need to do
is as my universe cools

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.100
what I'm going to
want is energetically,

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.160
my potential is going to want
to go down to its minimum.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.620
So, that just means that as
the universe is cooling, maybe

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.080
at very, very early times
when everything is extremely

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.020
hot and dense, I'm up here
where the potential energy is

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.020
very high.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.960
As the universe expands,
as everything cools,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.459
it moves over to
here, it just moves

00:33:26.459 --> 00:33:29.780
to someplace where the Higgs
field takes on a value of 1.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.200
And that's exactly correct,
that is what ends up happening.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:48.340
But remember, the minimum
occurs at some value

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.360
in which the magnitude
of this field

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.140
does not equal zero, but given
that value-- where again let's

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.110
just say for this for
sake of specificity

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.340
that we set it equal to
the magnitude of this thing

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.370
equal to 1 in some
units-- there's actually

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:07.090
an infinite number of
configurations that correspond

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.380
to that because this
is a complex number,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.159
this is a complex number.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.539
I could put it all
into little h1,

00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:18.080
and I could set into the value
where that thing is completely

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.540
real, or I could put it all
into little h2 being completely

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:27.310
imaginary or all on to h1 being
all imaginary, halfway into h1,

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.800
halfway into h2.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.460
There are literally an
infinite number of combinations

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.429
that I can choose
which are consistent

00:34:34.429 --> 00:35:20.958
with this value of the
magnitude of H. So, yeah--

00:35:20.958 --> 00:35:22.704
AUDIENCE: So, I
don't know if I'm

00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:24.870
putting too much physical
significance on the gauge,

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.480
but with the other cases
of spontaneous symmetry,

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.640
briefly, that we discussed
you can always measure.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.140
OK, I've broken my symmetry,
and now it's lined up this way,

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.280
or there's something measurable.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.896
Now, the field
has to be physical

00:35:35.896 --> 00:35:38.736
because the fact that
you have gauge symmetry

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:41.350
gives you some concerned
quantity, right?

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.710
But, how can I measure what
direction in gauge space

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.300
that I picked out?

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.960
PROFESSOR: So, that
is, let me talk

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.090
about this just a
little bit more.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.390
I think answering your
question completely

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.450
is not really
possible, but there

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.406
is a residue of that is
in fact very interesting,

00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:01.030
and let me just lay out a couple
more facts about what actually

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.550
happens with this
gauge symmetry,

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.500
and it's not going to
answer your question

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.666
but it's going to give you
something to think about.

00:36:06.666 --> 00:36:10.130
OK, so that's an excellent
and very deep question,

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.120
and there are really
interesting consequences.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.645
And this is a case
where my failure

00:36:15.645 --> 00:36:17.520
to answer the previous
one is because there's

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.160
details I can't
remember, in this case,

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.160
I think it's because
there's details we actually

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.260
don't understand fully.

00:36:24.709 --> 00:36:27.250
Research into the mechanism of
electroweak symmetry breaking,

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.194
which is what this
is all about, is

00:36:29.194 --> 00:36:31.360
one of the hot topics in
particle physics right now.

00:36:39.492 --> 00:36:41.200
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering if gravity

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.660
has any gauge symmetry
associated with it.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.390
PROFESSOR: It does, but it fits
in a very, very different way,

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:54.210
and with the exception of the
fairly speculative framework

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.810
of string theory-- which I
think is very, very promising,

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:58.280
but it's just
sufficiently removed

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.290
from experimental
verification that I'm

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.050
going to have to label it
speculative-- it doesn't quite

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:04.700
tie in in the same way.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.870
And that's the best
I can say right now.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.030
The gauge symmetries
of general relativity

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.110
are, at the classical
level, they correspond

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.790
to coordinate transformations,
at a quantum level,

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:22.450
there's not such a
simple way to put it.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.530
All right, where
was I, OK, sorry

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:25.780
I didn't get to your question.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.540
So, the point we made here is
that we have spontaneously,

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.400
when we actually choose which
one of these infinite number

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.040
of values we're going
to have, we just

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.500
randomly break the symmetry.

00:38:08.514 --> 00:38:10.180
OK, and you guys
apparently have already

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.900
talked a little bit about
spontaneous symmetry breaking.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.730
The analogy that
people often make

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.430
is to the freezing
of water, OK, prior

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:21.620
to the water entering its
solid phase its completely

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.480
rotationally symmetric,
then at a certain point

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.310
crystalline planes
start to form,

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:30.850
the water forms,
all the molecules

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.990
get set into a
particular orientation,

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.940
you lose that
rotational symmetry.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:41.130
In this case, we started
out with a theory,

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:44.740
with a set of interactions
that were completely symmetric

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.590
in sort of gauge field space.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.290
And now by settling
down and picking

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.730
a particular special
value of h1 and h2

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.435
we have at least nailed
down one direction.

00:38:55.435 --> 00:38:58.110
It's like we've defined
a crystalline plane,

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:02.330
and so now things, suddenly,
aren't as symmetric.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.770
And we start to pick
out preferred directions

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:12.150
in our gauge fields.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.610
What we can do
with this is really

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.200
a topic for a
whole other course,

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.550
and that course is called
quantum field theory,

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.539
but I will sketch a
couple of the consequences

00:39:27.539 --> 00:39:29.705
and this gets directly to
the answer your questions.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.740
So, one of the
consequences of this

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:48.950
is that once we have picked
out a particular direction,

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:55.210
electrons and neutrinos
are different.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.780
When the Higgs field
is equal to zero

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.350
there is no difference between
an electron and a neutrino.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.810
They obey exactly
the same equation,

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:11.450
there's literally no
difference between them.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:14.940
Once we have actually
settled on an h1 and an h2

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.680
some combination of the
fundamental underlying fields

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.100
comes together, acquires a mass,
acquires an electric charge,

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.780
and we say A-HA thou
beist an electron.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:31.093
It wasn't like that in the
original unbroken symmetry.

00:40:31.093 --> 00:40:32.420
AUDIENCE: Also, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.919
PROFESSOR: Presumably,
but I'm going

00:40:33.919 --> 00:40:35.680
to stick with just
these for now,

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.490
but I've I'm pretty sure
that's the case, yeah.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:42.800
That gets into even more
complications of course

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.770
because the additional
generations are actually

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:47.680
consequence presumably of some
broken higher level symmetry,

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.540
which is even poorly,
more poorly understood.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.280
But you raise a good point.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.870
So, that's one partial
answer your question.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.360
How one can actually
walk that backwards

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.730
to understand this thing
about the initial state?

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.410
That's hard to say.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.260
I actually think
this particular one

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.745
is one of the profound
and interesting aspects

00:41:20.745 --> 00:41:27.440
of this, in part because we now
know the neutrino has a mass.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.270
We have no idea what that is,
and in fact we only really

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:35.460
have bounds on the mass, such
that we know it is non-zero,

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.150
and we have upper
limits that are

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.450
set by very indirect
measurements.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:41.190
But the actual
values of the mass

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.810
are very, very
poorly constrained.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.590
Within the standard
model you just

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.610
take the electroweak
interaction,

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.780
introduce a Higgs coupling
and allow the symmetry

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.880
to be spontaneously broken,
the neutrino mass is zero.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.494
Full stop zero.

00:41:57.494 --> 00:41:59.160
So something's not
right, we're actually

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.950
missing something here.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.120
People have kind of jury
rigged the standard model

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.920
to put in the masses by
hand, and it works OK,

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.770
but it's not
completely satisfying.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.000
And a lot of experiments
going on right now

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.060
to explore the neutrino
sector are hopefully

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.000
going to open us up to a
deeper understanding of this

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.330
and may say a lot about all this
physics, which is at present,

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.140
pretty poorly understood.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.540
The consequence, which has
received the most popular

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.920
press, and what you
guys have certainly

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.860
seen about in newspapers,
given the results that came out

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:40.330
from the LHC over the past year
is that quarks and leptons have

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:45.000
mass, or put more
specifically, rest mass.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.810
To understand what
this actually means

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.440
I think you really need to
ask yourself what is mass

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.000
meant to be.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:06.470
Well, the idea is you calculate
the spectrum of oscillations

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:36.560
associated with the
fields of your theory,

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.660
and then if your theory
predicts a discrete spectrum

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.180
of oscillations, it doesn't
even have to be discrete

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.560
but predict some
spectrum of oscillations,

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.790
then for every oscillation
frequency omega

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:53.340
there's an associated
mass that is just

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:58.190
H bar omega over c squared.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:03.630
If your omega has
some lower bound that

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:10.030
is greater than zero,
then your theory

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:14.310
has particles with
nonzero rest mass.

00:44:56.082 --> 00:44:58.040
Without going into the
details-- and this again

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.970
is something which
those of you who

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.930
are going to go on to study
this in more detail in a higher

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:05.730
level course, which is
fairly standard stuff is done

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.897
in probably the first or maybe
late in the first or early

00:45:09.897 --> 00:45:12.230
in the second semester of a
typical quantum field theory

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:16.250
course-- what you'll find is
that when the Higgs field is

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.470
zero then quarks
and leptons have,

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.890
the field that describes quarks
and leptons-- and yes including

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.210
mu and tau, so including
all the leptons, this one

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.530
I'm very confident
on-- the spectrum

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.550
goes all the way to zero
if the Higgs field is zero.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:01.260
But when the Higgs field becomes
non-zero, roughly speaking,

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.500
it shifts the spectrum
over for these particles.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.740
There's an interaction between
the things like the electron

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.880
field in the Higgs field or the
up quark field and the Higgs

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.400
field, which shifts the
spectrum over just enough

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.470
so that the frequency
is never allowed

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:20.598
to go below some minimum.

00:46:20.598 --> 00:46:22.590
AUDIENCE: Going back
a bit, I'm confused

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:25.950
about how picking a specific
value to the Higgs field

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.562
is breaking SU(2)
symmetry and not U(1),

00:46:29.562 --> 00:46:32.060
because it seems like we're
fixed on a circle, right?

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.559
PROFESSOR: That's right what
U(1) is a symmetry on a circle,

00:46:34.559 --> 00:46:37.354
SU(2) is kind of like symmetry
on a sphere, essentially.

00:46:37.354 --> 00:46:40.763
AUDIENCE: Right, so how are we
not picking a specific value

00:46:40.763 --> 00:46:42.932
[INAUDIBLE] circle [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:42.932 --> 00:46:45.390
PROFESSOR: Well, what we're
doing is, think of it this way,

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.590
imagine SU(2) is a
symmetry on a sphere,

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.670
and then when we break
the SU(2) symmetry

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.460
it's like we're picking
some circle on that sphere.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.370
So, we've broken one circle,
we've picked one circle,

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:58.870
but now we're allowed
to go anywhere

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:02.770
on that remaining circle,
which is a U(1) symmetry.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.160
Does that help?

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.145
Yeah, OK good.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.890
And it comes down to the
fact if you sort of count up

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:15.110
your degrees of freedom,
it has to do with the fact

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:20.930
you you've got four, you
have two complex numbers,

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:23.650
so there's four real parameters
associated with this thing,

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:28.060
and they are isomorphic to sort
of rotations in a three space

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.435
and you're adding
one constraint.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.960
OK, so let me just finish
making this point here again.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:41.240
So, when h does not
equal zero, spectrum

00:47:41.240 --> 00:48:00.340
get shifted for the
quarks and leptons,

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:03.280
so everything picks up
a little bit of a mass.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.025
And the final one,
final consequence

00:48:06.025 --> 00:48:11.400
which we're going
to talk about today,

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.765
is that the universe is filled
with magnetic monopoles.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.040
We all remember studying
Maxwell's equations

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:31.140
learning that del dot
b is equal to 4 pi

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.750
times the density
of magnetic charge--

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:35.520
this all makes
perfect sense, right?

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:42.000
Well, this is actually something
that when it first sort of came

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.570
out and people begin to
appreciate this thing with sort

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:50.510
of a "Um, well everything
else works so well,

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:55.340
maybe we're just not
looking hard enough. " So,

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.085
it was a bit of a surprise.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.460
So, where do these magnetic
monopoles come from?

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.120
And essentially, the
magnetic monopoles

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.010
are going to turn out to be
a consequence of the fact

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.770
that when spontaneous
symmetry breaking happens

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.715
it doesn't happen
everywhere simultaneously.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.319
So, think again about-- yeah?

00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:30.110
AUDIENCE: Doesn't that
bring up possibility

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.068
that the symmetry could
break in different ways

00:50:32.068 --> 00:50:32.940
in different places?

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.780
PROFESSOR: That is in
fact exactly what this

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:35.750
is going to be.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.430
Magnetic monopoles are in
fact exactly a consequence

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:42.052
of this, yes.

00:50:42.052 --> 00:50:43.510
Give me a few
moments to step ahead

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.517
to fill in a couple of the
gaps, but you're basically

00:50:46.517 --> 00:50:47.100
already there.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:56.480
So, think about crystalline
crystal formation again.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:03.030
Imagine you have,
we could do ice

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.604
if you like or choose something
that's got a little bit more

00:51:05.604 --> 00:51:07.270
of an interesting
crystalline structure.

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:12.420
Imagine you have a big bucket
full of molten quarts, OK.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.550
So, if you have a
big thing of quartz

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:18.740
that you want to sort of freeze
into a single gigantic crystal,

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.380
what you typically do if
you'd like to do this is

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.710
you actually seed
it with a little bit

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:26.340
of a starter crystal.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.060
So, you put a little bit
of crystal into this thing,

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:33.390
and what that does is it sort of
defines a preferred orientation

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:37.570
of the crystal axes,
so that as things

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:39.920
start to cool in the
vicinity of that they have

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.420
a preferred orientation
to grab on to.

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.330
And that seed then
gradually gets

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:47.560
bigger and bigger and bigger,
and all the little crystals

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:50.120
as they form near
it tend to latch

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.350
onto the preexisting
crystalline structure,

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.010
and that allows you
to grow actually

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.819
extremely large crystals.

00:51:55.819 --> 00:51:58.360
I don't know if anyone here is
doing a year off with the LIGO

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:02.800
project but these guys have to
make these sort of 100 kilogram

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.990
mirrors of very pure either
Sapphire or silicon dioxide,

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:10.574
and when you make 100
kilograms of crystal

00:52:10.574 --> 00:52:12.490
you need to build it
really, really carefully.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:14.531
It's extremely important
for the optical purposes

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:17.150
that all the axes
associated with the crystal

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.970
will be pointing in
the right direction.

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:20.780
Otherwise you spend
$100,000 on this thing

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:25.070
and it ends up being the
world's prettiest paperweight.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:28.880
So, similar things happen
when the Higgs field cools.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:34.150
Let's imagine that
we've got our universe,

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:39.730
time going forward like this,
and at some point over here

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:45.390
the universe cools enough
that's the Higgs field condenses

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.900
into some particular direction.

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:52.370
And symmetry is spontaneously
broken right at this one point

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:54.199
over here.

00:52:54.199 --> 00:52:55.990
So, I'm going to draw
my diagram over there

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.198
and put some words over here.

00:53:18.622 --> 00:53:20.330
I shouldn't say Higgs
field cools enough,

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.590
the universe cools
enough so that the Higgs

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:23.905
field breaks the symmetry.

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:49.370
So, just to be concrete, let's
imagine that at 0.1 over here

00:53:49.370 --> 00:54:00.476
it takes on a field of the
value one for h1 and I for h2.

00:54:00.476 --> 00:54:02.600
So just for concreteness
imagine it looks something

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.297
like this at this point.

00:54:05.297 --> 00:54:07.380
And so what happens is as
the university continues

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:11.020
to expand other areas
are going to cool off.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.620
The bits that are
closest to it are

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.010
going to see that
there is already

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:18.650
a preferred orientation
defined by the Higgs field.

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:21.280
And so it's energetically
favorable for those regions

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.750
of the universe to fall
into the same alignment

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:26.390
and so there'll be a
region in space times

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:31.080
that grows here as the universe
cools, in which the Higgs

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.640
field all falls into
this configuration, which

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:35.660
I will call h1.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:49.000
But suppose somewhere
over here at 0.2,

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.920
and the key thing is
that initially 0.2

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:55.580
is going to be so far away
from 0.1 that these points are

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.210
out of causal contact
with one another.

00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:01.410
I can not send a message
from event one to event two.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.450
The Higgs field
also reaches a point

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:07.220
that the universe cools enough
that at 0.2, just you know,

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.717
it's a system that's not
in thermal equilibrium.

00:55:10.717 --> 00:55:12.550
So, some places are
going to be a little bit

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:13.604
hotter than others,
some are going

00:55:13.604 --> 00:55:14.687
to be a little bit cooler.

00:55:14.687 --> 00:55:18.040
And so, at these two
points it just so happened

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.850
that the Higgs field
got to the point

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:22.250
where it could spontaneously
break the symmetry.

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:31.215
So at 0.2 the Higgs field
also got to the point

00:55:31.215 --> 00:55:33.215
where it could spontaneously
break its symmetry.

00:56:00.295 --> 00:56:01.920
And the only thing
that's got to happen

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.140
is, remember the only
constraint we have is

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.762
that the magnitude
of the Higgs field

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:08.220
be equals to some value-- I
should normalize that to root 2

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.720
in units I want to
use but whatever.

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:15.510
Let's say on this one
my h1 is equal to y,

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:17.890
and h2 is equal to minus 1.

00:56:21.265 --> 00:56:22.640
So, it's basically
the same thing

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.727
but all the fields
are multiplied by i.

00:56:25.727 --> 00:56:27.310
It's the same
magnitude, so it's going

00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:29.370
to have the same
potential energy.

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:31.150
So that's cool.

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:36.370
Clearly this is allowed,
and now all the regions

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:38.311
in the universe that
are close to the this

00:56:38.311 --> 00:56:40.560
are going to sort of smell
this particular arrangement

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.101
of the Higgs field
and say OK, that's

00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:45.410
preferred arrangement
I want to go into.

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:48.740
So, we have two separate
values of the Higgs field

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:53.320
that are happily swooping
out space time here.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.180
This gets to the
excellent question

00:56:55.180 --> 00:57:00.670
I was just asked a moment ago--
what happens when they collide?

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:04.190
As the universe expands
and gets cooler, all of it

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:07.060
is going to end
up getting swooped

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:09.810
into either the field that
was seeded at event one,

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:11.754
or the field that was
seeded in to event two,

00:57:11.754 --> 00:57:13.170
but at a certain
point we're going

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.890
to get the bits where they're
smashing into one another.

00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:58.630
So what happens when these
different domains come

00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:00.530
into contact with one another?

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.210
The absolutely full
and probably correct

00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:11.390
answer is we don't know.

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:14.470
The reason is that we don't
really, to be perfectly blunt,

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:20.150
fully understand every little
detail about the symmetry

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:24.580
breaking, or about the
structure of whatever

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:26.880
grand unified theory brings
all these things together

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.310
at the temperatures at
which this is happening.

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:30.268
Because this is happening
when the universe has

00:58:30.268 --> 00:58:32.960
a temperature of like
10 to the 16th GeV.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.730
And so it's way
beyond the domain

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:36.830
of where we can push things.

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:41.000
But we can, as physicists
are fond of doing,

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.570
we can paramaterize
our ignorance,

00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:45.960
and we can ask
ourselves, well what

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.480
happens if these various
parameters that characterize

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.770
my grand unified theory take on
the following plausible kinds

00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:54.000
of parameters.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.216
And what we find is
that generically,

00:58:56.216 --> 00:58:58.340
when you have two different
domains where the Higgs

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:01.480
field takes on different
values like this, when

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.560
these domains come
into contact you

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.345
get what are called
topological defects.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.299
The topological defects come
in three different flavors.

00:59:39.299 --> 00:59:41.090
To understand something
about those flavors

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:42.756
you have to know a
little bit about what

00:59:42.756 --> 00:59:47.430
happens in general when
you have phase transitions,

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:51.410
and different regions
of your medium

00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:53.690
go through a phase transition
with different values

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.070
of the parameters.

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.100
So, it's a general
case that whenever

00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:02.250
you have some kind
of a phase transition

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.560
and you have domains
of different phase

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.930
that come into contact
with one another,

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:29.300
your field will attempt
to smoothly match itself

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.235
across the boundary.

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:37.110
But that can be very difficult.

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:38.980
So if you imagine these
particular two cases

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.150
that I have here,
that's essentially

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:42.690
saying that when
these two domains

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:44.530
coming to contact
with one another

01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:46.830
there's going to be sort
of a transition zone

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:49.590
where the field is
attempting to rotate

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:52.130
from one value of the
Higgs to the other.

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:54.630
And it's going to pick some
value that is in some sense

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:56.240
intermediate to
those two things.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.390
So that, let's say we
continue these up here,

01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:03.890
so that the collision is
occurring right in this place

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:06.920
here, in this little locus
of events in space time.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.830
I have Higgs field 2 over
here, Higgs field 1 over here,

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:13.232
and I've got some crazy
intermediate field that

01:01:13.232 --> 01:01:14.690
goes between the
two of them, which

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:19.760
is trying to sort of force
itself to smoothly transition

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.570
from one to the other.

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:25.010
In so doing, I might end
up pushing my field away

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.120
from the minimum, in
which case there will then

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.320
be some energy
trapped in that layer.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.920
And there's a reason we
do this level the class

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.540
in a bit of a hand
wavy way, I mean

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.490
it's very, very complicated
to get the details right.

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:43.770
But the key thing we see is
that in doing this match,

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.782
the field has to do some
pretty silly shenanigans order

01:01:46.782 --> 01:01:48.240
to make everything
kind of match up

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.430
and we can be left with
odd observable consequences

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:55.110
from the energy associated
with the Higgs field getting

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:57.210
pinned down at
that boundary here.

01:01:57.210 --> 01:02:02.480
Now, the details of the
forms of this boundary

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.730
vary a lot depending upon
to the specific assumptions

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:08.330
you make about your underlying
grand unified theory.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:38.720
OK, so I should
back up for a bit.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.270
I'm sort of assuming here when
I discuss all this that there

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:45.750
is some underlying SU(5)
theory which describes

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.590
the strong weak and
electromagnetic interactions

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:51.114
are very, very high temperatures
as one gigantic thing.

01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:52.530
And we're getting
to the point now

01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:54.060
where all the different
interactions are beginning

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.643
to just sort of
crystallize out of it.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.920
There's a lot of different ways
you can pack your underlying,

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.470
fundamental, what we now think
of as our standard model,

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:10.010
into SU(5) grand
unified theories.

01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:11.560
And so the ways in
which we can get

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.640
different topological
defects depend

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.580
upon how we choose to do that.

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:26.580
So defect flavor one is you get
something called a domain wall.

01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:37.600
When we do this
the fields attempts

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:42.170
to make itself smoothly match
from one region of Higgs field,

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:44.850
say from Higgs 1 to Higgs 2.

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.510
It succeeds, but
you end up with kind

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:52.070
of a two dimensional structure--
a wall-- in which there's

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:55.570
some kind of anomalous field
that is just pinned down there.

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:01.145
And so we end up
with a big sheet.

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:38.240
So in a theory
like this, it would

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.600
predict that somewhere out
in the universe if there were

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.350
regions in which the
Higgs field had taken

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:43.725
on a different
value than the one

01:04:43.725 --> 01:04:45.969
that we encounter
around us right now,

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:48.260
it could be somewhere out
gigaparsecs away, essentially

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.477
a giant sheet of some kind.

01:04:50.477 --> 01:04:52.310
And there would be
weird, anomalous behavior

01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:53.620
associated with it.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.940
People have really
looked long and hard

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.500
to try to find things
like this and in fact it

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.380
would be expected to leave
interesting residuals

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.630
in the cause of
microwave background.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:05.230
My understanding
of the literature

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:07.290
is that there are
actually now very

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:10.187
strong bounds on the
possibility of having

01:05:10.187 --> 01:05:12.270
a grand unified theory
that leads to domain walls.

01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:15.110
And so this kind of
a topological defect

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.055
is observationally disfavored.

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:23.820
So this, I should
mention, only occurs

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:27.210
in some grand unified theories.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:48.920
Basically, As we move on to
the other flavors of defects

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.950
we end up just going down a step
in dimensionality associated

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.845
with the little kinks
that are left over when

01:05:55.845 --> 01:05:58.220
the different domains come
into contact with one another.

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:08.070
Flavor two, we would get
what's called a cosmic string.

01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:12.850
Some of you may
have heard of this.

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:18.920
This is essentially, at its
core, just a one dimensional,

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.684
it could be gigparsecs long,
but one dimensional, truly

01:06:22.684 --> 01:06:24.100
one dimensional--
essentially just

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.590
a point in the other two
dimensions-- string of mismatch

01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:31.150
Higgs field with some kind of
an energy density associated

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:32.995
with it when the different
domains get in contact.

01:06:32.995 --> 01:06:34.390
AUDIENCE: Do we
have any estimate

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:38.110
of how close in actual space
these different regions would

01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:39.050
have started?

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:42.430
PROFESSOR: We do and I'm
actually going to get to that.

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:45.390
So, let me give you
two answers to that.

01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:48.870
One of them is you are going
to estimate that apparently

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:52.760
on PSET 10, according to the
notes that Alan left for me.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.440
But I'm going to spell out
for you the arguments that

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.320
go into it in the last
10 minutes of a class.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:01.350
But yeah, so let me just quickly
finish up this one because this

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:04.100
again-- so a cosmic string is
sort of like a one dimensional

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.570
analog of a domain wall.

01:07:14.596 --> 01:07:16.470
And because it would be
this sort of long one

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:20.140
dimensional structure, that
has actually up a lot of energy

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.560
sort of pinned down to it
by the fact it has a Higgs

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.974
anomaly associated with it, it
would be strongly gravitating

01:07:25.974 --> 01:07:28.140
and so it would leave really
interesting signatures.

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.910
It was thought for a while
that cosmic strings might

01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:33.490
have been the sort of original
gravitational anomalies

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:35.510
that seeded some of
the structures we see

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:36.700
in the universe today.

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.960
Again, it's now pretty
highly disfavored.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.910
If cosmic strings
exist, they don't

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:49.944
appear to contribute very
much to the budget of mass

01:07:49.944 --> 01:07:50.610
in our universe.

01:07:53.266 --> 01:07:54.890
I should also mention
that this is only

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:57.120
predicted by some grand
unifying theories.

01:08:03.244 --> 01:08:04.660
If you guys are
curious about this

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.590
I suggest when Alice
back you ask him

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:08.650
what the difference
between these sums,

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:10.150
why some predict a
domain wall, some

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.275
predict the cosmic strings.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:18.680
Flavor three is where
you end up with the Higgs

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.609
field essentially being
able to smoothly transition

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:25.000
without leaving any defect
anywhere except at a zero

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.840
dimensional point.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:42.029
So you end up with just a
little knot in the Higgs field.

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:51.500
And for reasons that I
will outline very soon,

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:55.604
it turns out that this little
not must carry magnetic charge,

01:08:55.604 --> 01:08:57.479
and so it must be a
magnetic monopole.

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:06.290
The domain walls and
the cosmic strings

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:11.460
are, as I've emphasized,
only predicted

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.609
by certain specific
grand unified theories.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.290
Magnetic monopoles are actually
predicted by all of them.

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:18.020
Question.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.490
AUDIENCE: What does it mean to
have a one dimensional domain

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.440
wall, because there's no
different region separated

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.451
by one [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:25.451 --> 01:09:26.450
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:27.779
So what ends up
happening, and this

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.320
is where I think
you're going to have

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.850
to ask Alan to sort of follow
up on this a little bit.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:35.330
So, as the domains come into
contact with one another.

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:38.970
The fields do their best to
smoothly transition from one

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:39.880
to the other.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.810
And grand unified theories
that predict a cosmic string,

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.852
they succeed pretty
much everywhere.

01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:47.060
They're able to actually
smoothly make it all go away

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.018
so you don't end up with
feel being pinned down

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:53.290
anywhere, except in a little
one dimensional singularity that

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:57.020
is somewhere along where the two
dimensional services originally

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.050
met.

01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.224
And that is--
there's details there

01:10:00.224 --> 01:10:01.890
that I'm not even
pretending to explain.

01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:07.120
And as I say, those
are only predicted

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.100
by certain kinds of
grand unified theories.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.475
All of them will then predict
that even if you don't have

01:10:11.475 --> 01:10:14.730
that, that cosmic string
will then shrink itself down

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:17.270
and it'll just be left with
a little knot of Higgs field,

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:20.380
where there's a little
bit of residual mismatch

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.041
between the two regions.

01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:24.915
AUDIENCE: Do all three
types of defects carry

01:10:24.915 --> 01:10:26.560
a magnetic charge,
or only the knots?

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.230
PROFESSOR: I think
only the knots.

01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:29.950
They do carry other
kinds of fields,

01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:32.830
though, in particular the
other ones gravitate, in fact

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:34.240
all them gravitate,
and so that's

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.400
one of the ways in
which people have

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.546
tried to set observational
limits on these things.

01:10:37.546 --> 01:10:38.920
In particular
there have recently

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.740
been a fair amount of
work of people trying

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.920
to set limits on cosmic strings
from gravitational lensing,

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.274
and there was really
a lot of excitement

01:10:46.274 --> 01:10:48.440
because people thought they
discovered want a couple

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.436
years ago.

01:10:50.436 --> 01:10:54.342
And they saw
basically two quasars

01:10:54.342 --> 01:10:56.550
that looked absolutely
identical, that were separated

01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:00.904
or scale that was just
right to be a cosmic string.

01:11:00.904 --> 01:11:03.320
And then people actually looked
at with better telescopes,

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.778
and saw they had absolutely
nothing to do with one another.

01:11:05.778 --> 01:11:09.580
They were not cosmic, they were
not lenses, it's just every now

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.260
and then God is
screwing with you.

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:18.590
OK, so without going into some
of the details what you have,

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:24.500
these little point like
defects-- and I'm short on time

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.490
so I'm going to kind of go
through this a little bit

01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:31.090
in a sketchy way enough so
that I can pay for you how

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:33.250
to do some calculations
you're going to need to do.

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:46.250
So the point like defects
end up being regions,

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:55.850
where at that point the
Higgs field actually takes

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:57.480
the value zero.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.150
So remember I was describing how
when you have two regions where

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:07.890
the Higgs fields are both
taking on values such as there

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:10.597
at the minimum of the
Higgs potential energy,

01:12:10.597 --> 01:12:12.180
and they come in to
match one another,

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:13.721
and what we have a
boundary condition

01:12:13.721 --> 01:12:16.770
that very far away the
Higgs field has values

01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:19.190
such as the energy is minimized.

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:25.140
And there is a theorem, which
in his notes Alan-- the way

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.930
he describes it is
he gives you a figure

01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:30.090
and outlines the
various things that

01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:32.310
are necessary for the
theorem to be true,

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:34.410
and invites you to think
deeply for a moment

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:40.330
and until insight
comes to you, I guess.

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:43.340
And when you put this ingredient
that the Higgs field has

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:46.020
this asymptotic, very far
away value that drives you

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:49.580
to the minimum of the field,
and yet it must change value

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.810
somewhere in the
middle, the theorem

01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:56.089
requires that there be one
point at which H equals 0.

01:12:56.089 --> 01:12:57.630
And apparently, this
is a consequence

01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:00.520
in all grand unified theories.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.640
So, recall, H equals 0.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:14.990
This is a point at which
the potential energy

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.580
density can be huge.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.470
So, when you have a little
point like defect like this,

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:36.440
it looks like a massive nugget,
little massive particle.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.170
You can in fact calculate
the total amount

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:53.620
of energy associated
with this particle.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:14:16.897
If you do so just including the
influence of the Higgs field,

01:14:16.897 --> 01:14:19.440
the calculation
basically goes like this.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.110
It's very similar to the way we
calculate the energy associated

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:25.850
with electric and magnetic
fields in electrodynamics.

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:33.010
Ask yourself, how much
energy is contained

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:39.800
in a sphere of
radius, capital R,

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:44.520
centered on this little
knot of Higgs field.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.380
Well, it's going to
look like 4pi times

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:53.460
an integral of the
gradient of the Higgs field

01:14:53.460 --> 01:15:06.080
squared r squared
dr It turns out,

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.260
when you calculate the
[INAUDIBLE] of the Higgs field

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.770
around one of these
little defects,

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:15.060
it's actually very complicated
close to the defect,

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.910
but as you get far away
it has a very simple form.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.742
The gradient goes
as 1 over r, it

01:15:33.742 --> 01:15:35.200
tells you the field
itself actually

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.380
goes something like log.

01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:51.950
That means your energy looks
something like, R squared,

01:15:51.950 --> 01:16:00.070
1 over R squared dr which goes
as R, which diverges as you

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:02.050
make the sphere bigger
and bigger and bigger.

01:16:10.209 --> 01:16:11.500
So, what's the mistake we made?

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.719
Well, the Higgs
field doesn't always

01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:18.260
just sit there and
operate on itself.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:21.030
The Higgs field actually
couples pretty strongly

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:23.340
to all of our vector bosons.

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:25.160
Particularly, it
couples pretty strongly

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.390
to electric and magnetic fields.

01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:34.360
So, we have to repeat
this calculation including

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:46.050
the interaction of the Higgs
field with the E&D field.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.500
And in Alan's notes he
gives you some references

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.791
on this because this is not
the kind of calculation you

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.330
can really sketch
out very easily

01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:12.590
in an undergraduate class.

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:17.140
To make this
integral convergent,

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:21.170
the only way it can be done
is if that little nugget

01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:24.410
of Higgs field is endowed
with magnetic charge.

01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:29.780
You need to have a monopolar
magnetic field that ends up

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.920
putting in interaction
terms, that

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.270
make the divergence of
this integral go away.

01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:09.470
So, I at last get to the
punchline of all this,

01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:17.000
we are left inevitably, if we
accept the whole foundation

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.130
story of particle physics that
the different interactions were

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:23.360
unified in some high energy
scale and then froze out.

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:34.500
We are driven
inevitably to the story

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:46.995
that defects in the Higgs field
create magnetic monopoles.

01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.660
Now, I realize I'm out of time,
so let me just quickly sketch

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.317
a few interesting
facts about this

01:19:00.317 --> 01:19:02.650
and there's a few exercises
that you guys are apparently

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:06.640
going to look at in your
homework assignment.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.410
When we do this
calculation, one which

01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:13.200
is I believe just
referenced in the notes

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.150
that Alan has for the
class, we learn a couple

01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:17.910
of things about this
magnetic charge.

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:27.020
One of them is that if you
work in the fundamental unit,

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:31.470
say CGS units, the value
of the magnetic charge,

01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:42.350
we'll call that g,
is exactly 1 over

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.270
2 alpha where alpha
is a fine structure

01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:46.540
constant, times the
electric charge.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.070
So if you have two
magnetic monopoles

01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:53.570
they attract each
other with a force

01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:58.720
that is-- so 1 over 2 alpha is
approximately 68.5 I think--

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.420
and so it would be 68.5
squared times the force of two

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.570
electric charges at
that same distance.

01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:06.100
We also end up
learning the mass.

01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:19.381
It turns out to be 1 over alpha
times the scale of GUT symmetry

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:19.880
breaking.

01:20:30.945 --> 01:20:33.320
Anyone recall what the scale
of GUT symmetry breaking is?

01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:40.080
10 to the 16 GeV.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.400
So, this is a particle, 1
over alpha is approximately 10

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.670
to the two, so this
is a particle that

01:20:45.670 --> 01:20:52.348
has a mass of about
10 to the 18th GeV,

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:54.730
in other words it's a single
particle with a mass of 10

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:57.700
to the 18th protons.

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.260
This is approximately
one microgram.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:10.490
If you put one of these things
on a scale it could measure it,

01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:12.420
that's bloody big.

01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:16.250
So getting to the last bit
of the class, which I am just

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:19.776
going to very basically
quote the answer.

01:21:19.776 --> 01:21:23.270
The question becomes how often
do these things get created

01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:25.290
and here I'm going to
refer to Alan's notes.

01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:28.470
What you'll find
is that, remember

01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:30.640
when we sketched our original
picture of this thing

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.310
we looked at regions
of the universe

01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.860
where the Higgs
field was initially

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:37.780
seeded with different values.

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.200
In order for the Higgs field
to take on different values,

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.620
initially, these regions had
to be out of causal contact

01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.530
with one another.

01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:54.030
So we are going to require
that the initial seed areas be

01:21:54.030 --> 01:22:01.540
separated by a distance,
which is the correlation

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:04.600
length, which has to
be less than or of

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.260
order the horizon distance.

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:12.910
You can get a lower bound on
this thing by imagining that

01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:16.110
it's-- sorry let me
say one other thing.

01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:18.910
If you do that, then you
can estimate that the number

01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:27.140
density associated
with these things,

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.530
the number density
of these monopoles

01:22:29.530 --> 01:22:34.435
will be 1 over the
correlation length cubed.

01:22:34.435 --> 01:22:36.690
To get a lower
bound on the number

01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:39.960
density of these things, set
the correlation length exactly

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:46.927
to the horizon distance, and
then do the following exercise.

01:22:46.927 --> 01:22:48.510
So first, let's set
up the correlation

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:52.000
length equal to the
horizon distance.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:01.140
Set the density in monopoles
equal to the mass of a monopole

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:06.670
over rH cubed, normalized
to the critical density.

01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:21.270
If you do this,
you will find that

01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:27.630
just due to magnetic
monopoles alone,

01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:30.866
the density of the universe.

01:23:30.866 --> 01:23:32.240
PROFESSOR 2: Excuse
me, professor

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.750
PROFESSOR: Yes, I'm wrapping
up right this second.

01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:36.083
PROFESSOR 2: It's seven minutes.

01:23:36.083 --> 01:23:37.980
You were supposed
to end at 10:55.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.896
PROFESSOR: I'm substitute
teaching, I'm sorry.

01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:48.430
OK, so this tells
us that we are at 10

01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:51.335
to the 20 of the
critical density.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.370
And a consequence
is that the universe

01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:58.800
is approximately two years old.

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:04.280
I will let Alan pick
it up from there.

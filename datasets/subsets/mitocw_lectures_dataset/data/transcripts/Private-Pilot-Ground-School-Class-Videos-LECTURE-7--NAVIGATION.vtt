WEBVTT

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:17.550
PHILIP GREENSPUN: All right.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.050
We're going to go in
and outline, how do you

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.160
navigate an airplane?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.360
It's become a lot easier
now in the GPS age,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.550
but you still have
to know a little bit

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.950
about how people used to
do it in the old days,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.480
partly to pass the
exam, and partly

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.350
because it's interesting.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.973
All right.

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:37.140
So we're going to talk about
looking out the window.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.200
That's called pilotage,
planning your flight

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.000
and then looking out the window.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.360
We'll talk about the old
non-directional beacons,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.000
basically homing in
on a radio station.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.185
In the 1950s, there was
something called the VOR

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:54.160
that we'll talk about
that lets you figure out

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.260
exactly your magnetic heading
to or from a radio station.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.120
And finally, the
way that most people

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.510
get around these days, the
GPS and the moving map.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.030
OK.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.850
So when you're doing pilotage,
you come up in advance

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.100
with a bunch of visual
landmarks that you think you'll

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.410
be able to see from the air.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.660
You're going to cross a river.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.035
You're going to
find a reservoir.

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:15.770
You're going to see
a big radio tower.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.630
You're going to
pass a town that has

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.530
the name of the town written in
a high school athletic field.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.620
And the VFR charts,
they emphasize--

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.860
I think you saw that,
maybe with the iPad

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.240
or we have charts up here.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.410
We can look at it later--

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.250
but they emphasize objects that
you can, as a practical matter,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.780
see from the air.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.080
So the procedure, and we'll
go through this carefully,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.360
is you plot your planned course
using a pencil and a ruler,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.098
essentially, on the chart.

00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:49.640
You select what
checkpoints are going

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.530
to be visible on your flight.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.950
You measure the distance
from point to point,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.200
and then you've got
this plan of what

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.240
heading you're going to steer.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.370
You get the forecast
winds as well.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.470
So you say, look, I'm
going to fly this.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.470
I'm going to be going 100
knots over the ground.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.770
I'm going to be being blown
off course very slightly

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.995
by a crosswind from the north.

00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:15.870
You plan all of that.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.203
And then you've got your navlog.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.670
So as you reach each checkpoint,
you can make a correction.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.690
Well, it took me a little
bit longer to get here.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.648
I'm a little bit left of
where I thought I was.

00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:27.510
So you can make these
corrections as you go along.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.010
All right.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.040
So here's an example.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.960
Let's say you wanted to go
from MIT to Bennington College

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.820
to visit a friend.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.990
Well, there's an airport
right there called DDH,

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.820
and it's about 90
nautical miles.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.970
I think I did this
with a SkyVector.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.710
So your planning goal is to come
up with this navigation log.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.050
So you're going to say, OK,
I'm going to depart Hanscom

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.320
Field up there at the top.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.670
And it's going to take me--

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.450
looks like it's going to
take me nine nautical miles

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.430
before I reach my cruising
altitude and about

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.810
four minutes.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.160
Then after that, it's going
to take me five minutes

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.230
to reach Fitchburg
Airport, which

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.460
airports are great landmarks.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.550
They're very easy to see and
they have distinctive shapes.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.840
And notice here, the
magnetic course is 298,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.790
but with the wind,
we're going to have

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.660
to correct that and steer 292.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.250
And of course, the compass
card with the deviations

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.600
indicated might give us
another degree or two.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.150
But basically, from the
wind, that wind correction

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.525
is going to have us steering
a slightly different course.

00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:45.150
Anyway, so you're going to come
up with this navlog of how long

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.870
it's going to take,
what course you're

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.140
going to steer from your
compass, and as you go along,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.435
you're basically doing
what's called dead reckoning.

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:01.310
It's tough over the
ocean because there's not

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.000
any landmarks.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.190
So those early pilots who went
over oceans were real heroes.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.432
If you're going over the
land, you can actually

00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:11.390
make these corrections.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.400
So the procedure
is just as I said.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.560
You plot the course
on the chart.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.821
You measure the true course.

00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:18.529
So let's say you're
going straight north.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.320
That's going to be zero.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.970
Then you correct
for the forecast

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.000
wind to find the true heading.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.900
Then you correct for
the magnetic variation

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.760
because remember, you're
in-aircraft sources

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.190
are magnetic heading,
not true heading.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.640
And finally, you're going
to estimate the ground speed

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.340
and estimated time
and route for a leg.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.600
All right.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.070
Let's talk about some terms.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.350
We're using them,
let's reinforce them.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.310
Your course is the
direction over the ground,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.320
but your heading is
going to be, in general,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.460
different from the
course due to wind.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.570
True is if you steer true north,
you'll get to the North Pole

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.330
and hang out with Santa Claus.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.030
If you go magnetic, you'll go
to a slightly different place

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.620
every time.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.300
All right.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.630
Magnetic variation, we had
this chart pretty much before.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.610
So unless you're
somewhere down in Florida

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.480
or it looks like
in Chicago, there's

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.200
going to be some correction
from true to magnetic.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.570
The local magnetic
variation, remember,

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.290
is indicated on the chart.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.880
So it's right here,
14 degrees west,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.480
and remember, again, if you
get confused about how true

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.535
and magnetic relate, just
look at the OR diagram.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.330
Here's an example,
a compass card

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.910
that you might see
in your aircraft.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.400
I haven't seen any that
are quite this dramatic.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.700
I think this is for effect,
but you can see it says, look,

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.550
if you want to fly 60
degrees, a heading of 060--

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.080
oh, if you want to go east,
instead of steering 090,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.640
steer 85 on your compass.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.910
It gets updated every
couple of years, I think,

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.610
and as I added earlier,
if you have things

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.330
in the airplane or systems like
a heated windshield turned on,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.470
the compass may become
kind of worthless.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.970
All right.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.150
So let's get out the tools.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.480
We're going to go through these
more with flight planning.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.750
But basically, you get
your sectional chart.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.960
Tina showed you this.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.590
I have one too.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.060
I just got it yesterday at East
Coast Aero Club, front desk.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.630
Flight schools
usually sell them.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.540
I think they're missing
out on the revenue

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.500
now that it's all free on
SkyVector and similar sites.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.120
You've got your plotter.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.250
So this is basically
a ruler, and the ruler

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.830
is, on top, in statute miles.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.650
I'm not sure when you would
ever want to use that,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.480
but on the bottom, you
have nautical miles

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.300
which is what we generally
use in the aviation world.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.940
And you have this
protractor that you

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.310
might remember from
elementary school that

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.530
helps you figure out,
on the chart, what

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.010
the true course is going to be.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.510
All right.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.630
So I think you guys can probably
figure out how to use that.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.270
This is the E6B flight computer.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.843
So I think the E6B designation
comes from the US military.

00:07:19.843 --> 00:07:21.510
I'm not exactly sure
when this came out.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.820
Probably it says in
Wikipedia, but I'm

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.820
assuming it was a World
War Ii era kind of device.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.180
And it lets you make all kinds
of computations of density,

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:37.850
altitude, of how fast you're
going truly through the air,

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.190
as a function of your altitude
and what you're seeing

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.040
on your airspeed indicator.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.590
It lets you, on the
backside, correct for wind.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.200
You can make pencil
marks and then start

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.040
twisting to figure out whether
the wind is going to give you

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.980
a reduction or a
boost in airspeed,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.620
and also how much of
a course correction

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.580
you're going to need.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.460
So it's a very
useful instrument.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.400
Now fortunately, it
comes with instructions

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.980
because your modern
pilots have mostly

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.850
forgotten how to use this.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.960
It's a historical
artifact at this point.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.200
But we'll go through some of it
so you'll get a flavor for it,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.640
and it is fun.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.210
All right.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.620
So you put your plotter
down on the chart.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.780
And as you can see,
you'll be able to read

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:32.240
from the protractor, depending
on the line that you've drawn,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.289
what the course is.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.500
I will tell you that one of
the most important skills,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.510
if you're old-school
flight instructor,

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.400
is drawing a straight
line from one

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.510
side of the chart to the other.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.760
I can't tell you how to do it.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.100
It's a really complicated
folding system

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.250
that enables you to actually
draw a course line when

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:54.440
you have to flip the chart
over to get from your source

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.150
and destination airports.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.670
OK.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.060
Using the plotter, you
can see people's charts.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.560
They would have to buy new ones
every few weeks because they

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.390
would be so marked
up with pencils.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.740
Here we find the
true course is 038.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.520
So as you can see,
they're just reading that

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.880
off the protractor part.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.360
There are paper
E6Bs and metal ones.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.160
So this is a picture
of a paper one.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:31.550
Again, you can see
that you can just

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.040
set up, for example, that
we're going to go 90 knots,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.050
and then that's here.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.530
If we go 90 knots, then
it will take us 10 minutes

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.560
to go 15 miles.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.340
Not very exciting.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.270
The wind side is
more interesting.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:01.650
You can get your ground speed
and your wind correction angle.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.150
That's the most important thing.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.620
So this one is hard enough
to use that they actually

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.610
put the instructions
right on the top here,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.100
on the back of the E6B.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.393
So they say, place the wind
direction under the true index.

00:10:18.393 --> 00:10:19.310
We'll go through this.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.930
Anyway, the wind's
from 210, and we're

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:28.370
trying to fly straight
south, a true course of 180

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.150
at an air speed of 147
knots through the air.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.740
We've already computed that.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.990
And the wind's 20
knots from 210.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.050
So we're trying to go south.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.560
Let's say, this is south
at 180 and the wind

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.120
is coming from the right.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.400
So when we're all
done, I sure hope

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.900
that the answer
will be that we have

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:51.360
to steer a little bit to the
right of 180, true at least.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:51.860
All right.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.130
So here we are on the wind side.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.840
We start by marking 147
knots, it looks like.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.340
And then we rotate it.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:22.330
You can see that pencil
mark has been rotated off.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.750
It started at 210.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.310
Oh, let's go back.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.910
Yeah.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:31.640
So we had it set up to 210.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.020
Says wind direction
under true index.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.540
Then we marked the velocity.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.590
Then we twisted it a little bit.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.270
So now, we've got
an index of south,

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:52.120
and we can read that our ground
speed will have fallen right

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.800
there under the little
grommet there to 129 knots,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.460
and the wind correction angle
is going to be 4 degrees.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.280
You can read that off of
this little scale here.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.650
See, it says 5 and 10.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.730
Anyway, so we do all of
that, which is very tedious.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.050
It's based on a forecast,
again, of the winds aloft,

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.330
so it's never going
to be exactly right.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.950
And we use it to fill out one
of these navigation log forms.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.420
Once it's all
filled out, you can

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.150
see that it's a lot easier to
do if you just ask some computer

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:28.560
application to do it for you,
like SkyVector is free and will

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.712
do it for you, using
the forecast winds.

00:12:31.712 --> 00:12:33.420
Then when you're flying
along, as I said,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.620
you make corrections.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.080
So here, for example,
unfortunately,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.030
the one bad thing
about SkyVector,

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.300
I put in these user fixes,
a beam to Fitchburg Airport

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.790
and crossing the
Connecticut River,

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.373
I think, because I
thought those would

00:12:46.373 --> 00:12:48.070
be easy to see from the air.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.210
But unfortunately, there's no
way to name them in SkyVector.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.490
So they just come
out as user fix.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.820
But maybe you could write
that in with a pencil.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.550
Anyway, so you can
see here, the wind

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.710
is forecast to be
from 272 at 15 knots.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.750
You're going 140 knots
of true air speed.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:15.440
Your track over the ground
is supposed to be 287 true,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.630
minus 2 degrees wind
correction angle.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.540
I just did this, actually,
for Sunday night, I think.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.720
The true heading,
therefore, will be 285,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.640
but then you'll have
to add 16 degrees

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.300
for the local variation.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.170
So you'll end up with a
magnetic heading of 301.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.320
So you steer that for a
while, see how it goes.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.120
It's supposed to take you about
12 minutes from the time you

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.210
took off to the time
you reach that point.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.640
And you write down
what actually happened.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.010
And if you see the airport--

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.870
let's see, it's supposed
to be on our left.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.412
If you see the
airport on your right,

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:52.070
you say, well, the wind's
not quite what I thought.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.500
I'm going to steer
10 degrees right.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.810
And then, that river
crossing, I guess,

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.990
isn't really ideal for
heading correction.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.170
You probably want to find
some other landmarks as well.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.880
All right.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.110
Pilotage-- oh, question?

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.300
AUDIENCE: How far [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.160
PHILIP GREENSPUN: They do.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.980
Tina might know.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.002
I think the winds aloft are
forecast either 24 or 30

00:14:15.002 --> 00:14:15.710
hours in advance.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.942
Yeah.

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:20.900
That's a good question.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.570
We can look that
up for you later.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.813
But yeah, so you can
predict, to some extent,

00:14:27.813 --> 00:14:28.730
with prevailing winds.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.090
Some of these applications
will work with averages

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.840
and so forth, if it's not there.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.710
But yeah, within 24 hours,
you have a pretty good wind

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.540
forecast.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.440
But again, with a
modern GPS system,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.790
you can immediately see whether
you're going off course,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.380
and the autopilot may
automatically make

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.630
the correction for you anyway.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.675
So this is kind of a
historical lecture.

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:51.425
It's good to know.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.490
What I would say is, well,
yeah, so what I would say

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.760
is, it's still worth doing, but
I would say generate the navlog

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.390
electronically.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.200
It's not really worth doing
anymore, like the full pain.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.980
The knowledge test does have
a built-in electronic E6B.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.490
The tests are not
that demanding,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.428
except that you will
need the plotter.

00:15:15.428 --> 00:15:17.720
So they'll give you a supplement
with a bit of a chart,

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.760
and you need the
plotter to figure out

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.700
how far it is from place
to place on the real test.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:29.120
That's if you want to get 100.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.980
Yeah, you see the
summary of how it works.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.390
It's a fun skill.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.710
I will tell you, I
had two interactions

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.780
on basically the same day.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:44.690
I met an alumna of this course
at the East Coast Aero Club,

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:49.670
and she was tearing
up a storm with an E6B

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.710
and filling out the
navlog, and doing all this.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.480
I said, why are you doing that?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.310
Every East Coast Aero Club
plane has a Garmin 430 in it.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.840
Just punch in your
destination and you can go.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.300
And if that doesn't work,
call up air traffic control

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.830
and tell them you're lost.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.280
So she said, well, like every
flight with my instructor,

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.570
he fails everything.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.680
He makes me go back and assume
that everything's broken

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.690
and do it all old
school and manually.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.190
So she was doing this on every
cross-country flight that she

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.430
was doing, both dual and solo.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.810
And I said, well, that's good.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.227
I'm not sure how
much relationship

00:16:25.227 --> 00:16:27.500
that has to safety because
the other interaction I had

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.740
that day was with a commercial
pilot, instrument rated, who

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.210
wanted to rent the Cirrus.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.630
And I was the previous
user of the airplane.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.370
So I said, how much
fuel do you want?

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.620
He said, I want it topped off.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.840
I said, you're going
to fly for six hours?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.842
Where you going?

00:16:44.842 --> 00:16:46.050
He said, I'm going to Albany.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.815
I said, well, it's an hour away.

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:49.440
What do you want six
hours of fuel for?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.440
He said, the airport I'm going
to doesn't have any fuel.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.180
I said, Albany, the
crosswind runway

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.090
there is longer than
Hanscom's main runway.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.753
It's 7,500 feet.

00:16:58.753 --> 00:16:59.920
They've got a beautiful FBO.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.870
It's basically free.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.370
What do you mean,
they have no fuel?

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.217
And he wanted to go
to this other airport.

00:17:04.217 --> 00:17:05.550
It was on the east side of town.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.425
It was actually farther
from his destination.

00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:10.569
He was taking his
son to Rensselaer,

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.210
and the big airport's
actually closer.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:17.280
And this was a 2,500-foot
airport with a note

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.230
in the chart supplement saying
to call a phone number before

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.900
you even try to go there, to
check out the local conditions.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.619
It's unattended.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.020
If you blow a tire,
there's no way

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.300
to get a mechanic out there
other than maybe driving

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.540
from Albany or Boston.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.000
And it has a displaced
threshold too.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.268
It's 2,500 feet, but because
of the trees on both ends,

00:17:39.268 --> 00:17:41.310
you're not supposed to
land right on the numbers.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.640
You actually land a few, like
500 feet or 400 feet down

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.810
the runway.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.170
So I said, the Cirrus
takes about 2,100 feet

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.360
to land over a 50-foot obstacle.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.580
So you're budgeting
to use more than 60%

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.880
of the runway, which the
airline minimum is, you

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.590
have to plan to land in 60%.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.655
That way if you are
a little bit sloppy,

00:18:00.655 --> 00:18:03.030
you don't go off the end of
the runway and hit something.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.400
So I said, why would you
give yourself, with your son,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.930
less safety margin than
a two-pilot airline crew?

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.180
And so he said,
well, I don't want

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.450
to deal with an FBO, which
was really weird to me.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.260
So basically, there's no point
to that story other than--

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.867
no, there is a
point to that story.

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:22.200
There is no point to that story.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.870
Safety is not about doing
everything really tedious.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.450
It's more about having
reasonable judgment and asking,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.480
why am I better than a
two-pilot airline crew?

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.280
So yeah, she was smart.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.410
She's an engineer
so of course, it

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.840
doesn't overtax her to
do this kind of stuff,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.540
but let's not really confuse
it with adding safety, which

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.300
is more about having the
judgment to know when to take

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.720
a co-pilot or when to
make your life easier

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.490
by going to an airport
with a really long runway.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:53.990
All right.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.850
Let's talk about ADFs.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.510
This was very exciting in 1952.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.320
Have a look there.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.150
That was a Lear.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.250
Some of you have probably
heard of Lear Jet.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.980
So the founder of
Lear Jet was also

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.180
the inventor of the first
practical car radios.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.250
So all the money that
was made on car radios

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.670
was eventually turned
into an aviation company,

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.600
and before the Lear Jet,
there were these avionics

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.820
that made it super
easy to figure out

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.500
where the station was.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.465
I think at the very first,
the pilot would tune,

00:19:29.465 --> 00:19:32.990
or the navigator more
likely would twist this dial

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.970
and hear when this tone
reached some kind of maximum.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.980
Then there was the
automatic direction finder,

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.080
which would just point the
needle in that direction

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.740
of the station.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.948
See here, it's just pointing.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.680
Yeah, here's something.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.410
This is from the
pilots handbook,

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.930
I think, on how to use an NDB.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.630
But you can see that
with a heavy wind,

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:06.130
you don't end up really tracking
exactly towards the station.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:06.640
All right.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.560
So relative bearing is how
far to your left or your right

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.190
the station is.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.980
And then you can get
the magnetic bearing

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.100
if you add your own
heading in there.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.510
So this is not rocket science.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.480
If you're going south, and
the station is 90 degrees

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.810
to your left, then the magnetic
bearing to the station is going

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:33.080
to be, I guess, well, I guess
the bearing to the station

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.410
would be 090, in that case.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.420
All right.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.090
This was an exciting thing
where you could actually

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.030
turn the card on your ADF.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:49.680
So if you were heading
northwest of a heading of 330,

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.160
you would twist that
and then you just,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.960
without having to
think, you can see

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.470
that you have to fly
roughly with no wind.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.420
You would fly 210 to
get to the station.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.210
I guess some planes that
operate in Europe a lot,

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.370
they were requiring
this to later.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.500
Planes that just have a
lot of stuff on the panel

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.530
still may have this,
but in general, they're

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.400
hard to find now.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.100
VORs are still around.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.560
They have 360 radials that
the radio receiver can just

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.410
identify.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.930
So the receiver can just say,
I know that I am exactly south

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:34.190
or I know that I'm exactly east
or I know that I'm exactly 060

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.760
direction from this station.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.700
So you'll be able to
know where you are,

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.520
and if you can tune
in two different ones,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.560
and you've got your
handy pencil out,

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.920
and your chart, in the aircraft,
you can draw intersecting lines

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.680
and figure out where
you are on the chart.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.710
So again, in the
moving map GPS days,

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.985
this is not as exciting
a skill as it once was.

00:21:57.985 --> 00:21:59.360
I think there are
a few questions

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.510
about the symbols on the chart
for different kinds of VORs.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.030
So one thing is distance
measuring equipment,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.480
whereby sending out a pulse
and having the station send

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.540
that back to the aircraft,
it's possible by measuring

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:21.030
the transit time to actually get
your distance in nautical miles

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.970
read out to you in the cockpit.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.050
Be advised that's the actual
distance through the air,

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.240
so it's not the
horizontal distance

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.480
projected over the ground.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.850
But if you're up a few
miles, it might be,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.670
and if you're close to the VOR,
it might be slightly different.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:42.000
Service volumes-- there
are these terminal VORs.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.920
I think a lot of them
may be decommissioned

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.590
or being decommissioned now.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.567
But the FAA has made
various kinds of VORs.

00:22:49.567 --> 00:22:51.150
These high altitude
ones will probably

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.910
be the last to go because
actually, with airliners,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.180
the certification costs of
new avionics are so high

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.360
that the last aircraft
flying without a GPS

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.110
will be some huge Boeing.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:09.460
It won't be a Piper or
a Steerman or something.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.620
OK.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.330
The parts of the VOR--

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:18.130
so you have this thing called
the Omni Bearing Selector which

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:22.870
you can tune here, and on the
canonical instrument here,

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:28.010
all it does is rotate
this card around the top.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.590
So that is to pick out the
radial that you want, and then

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.510
you get the To/From flag.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.160
So you can see here,
this is showing you

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:45.070
that the 360 radial
is off to your left.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.740
And if we were to fly--

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.520
we don't have to.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.228
This is not related
to the actual heading

00:23:49.228 --> 00:23:52.440
of the aircraft-- but if we
were to fly basically north,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.170
we'd be going away from the VOR.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:55.730
OK.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.470
We're going to get
into this more.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.550
The HSI down there offers
you the same information,

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.310
but superimposed on the
aircraft's actual heading,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.260
which makes life a lot easier.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:06.830
OK.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.997
How do you test your VOR
and know that it's actually

00:24:08.997 --> 00:24:10.220
going to work?

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.320
There are these
VOR test stations,

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.590
or VOTs, test facilities.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:19.610
If you can remember
Cessna 182, every VOT

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.430
puts out the same signal,
and what you should see

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.150
is an indication of
2 when you dial up,

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.430
and it should be centered
on the 180 radial.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.360
So that's how you know
if your VOR is working.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.360
If you're going to use
it for instrument flight,

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.440
you have to test
them every 30 days.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:34.940
All right.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.450
Let's have a look.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.450
You're going to probably
have to study and think

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.330
about this a little
bit more at home.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.820
But one easy way
to think about this

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.570
is to build yourself
a virtual HSI.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:54.860
So if you see a test question,
and it shows the indicator set

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.000
up to tune to like
the 030 radial,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.790
just draw a little airplane or
imagine an airplane actually

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.330
heading northeast
on a 030 heading.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:11.380
So you can see this
airplane at left, this one,

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:17.590
it's showing that the 030 radial
is to the right of the wing,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.346
assuming we were
actually heading 030,

00:25:19.346 --> 00:25:23.110
and that we're going vaguely
towards the VOR because the To

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.120
flag is set up.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.110
Over here, it's the same,
but it's the From flag.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:34.450
Over here on the right, we've
got the radial off to our left,

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:38.440
and we're going From
the VOR over here.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.160
Again, the radial's to our
left and we're going To.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.100
So just let that
sink in a little bit.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.980
I think I'm going to show you
an FAA written test question,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.600
so you just know.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:56.940
It says, the VOR's turned
to the Elizabeth City VOR.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.650
That, I believe, is right over--

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:03.910
if you want to know the
value of a marketing degree,

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.850
this Elizabeth City is
right next to a big place

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.420
called the Dismal Swamp,
the Dismal Swamp Park.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.180
Anyway, so if you're anywhere
near the Dismal Swamp,

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.190
and you want to go visit,
and you're at Elizabeth City,

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.310
tune to the VOR.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.040
It says the aircraft is
positioned over Shawboro.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.750
One of the hardest
things about this

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.430
is finding Shawboro on the map.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.350
But I've drawn it there for you.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.570
So we're northeast
of the VOR, and it

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:34.140
says, which VOR indication is
correct, 2 which is at the top

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.750
there, 8 or 9 on the bottom?

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.240
What do you guys think?

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.490
So we're northeast of Shawboro.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.710
Who wants to vote for 2?

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.280
210 from.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.780
Nobody?

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.580
Who wants to vote for 8?

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.660
That's 0302.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.370
Who wants to vote for 9?

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:09.965
A few hands?

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.920
Yay.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.420
OK.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.620
So basically, we're
right on the radial.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.590
So Shawboro, you can
see here at the end

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:26.737
of the arrow, it is, I think,
that actually might say--

00:27:26.737 --> 00:27:28.320
I don't know what
that says, actually.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.490
I have no idea.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.440
10, 20, 30, yeah, it's
right there at the 30.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.940
OK.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.560
So it's definitely
on the 030 radial,

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.830
which is also the 210
radial, the reciprocal.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.690
I mean, this is not a
totally trivial question.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.510
But if we were to fly
210, we would be going To.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.630
The flag should be To.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.480
If we were actually
flying southwest,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.600
we'd be heading towards the
VOR, so it should be a To flag.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.781
If we're flying away from
the VOR, further out on 030,

00:27:56.781 --> 00:28:00.060
and it should be a From
flag which is not an 8,

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.150
and this one is the only one
that's consistent because if we

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:08.350
actually were to fly 030, we'd
be going away from the VOR.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.540
Don't sweat it if
you haven't got it.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.150
There is actually
a cool simulator

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.460
in Adobe Flash which
was actually cool

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.700
when you guys were born.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:25.710
And AOPA, also, I have linked
here to the Airplane Owners

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.540
and Pilots Association,
the big lobbying

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.030
group for private aviation.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.140
They have a list of--

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.890
I don't think they're
free, unfortunately.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.465
That web simulator is free.

00:28:35.465 --> 00:28:36.840
But there's little
simulators you

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.475
can get on your phone for VORs.

00:28:38.475 --> 00:28:39.850
That used to be
really important.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.390
I mean, GPS is now more
important, basically.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:47.460
It was a 1973 US military idea.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.300
If you just broadcast
the time and the position

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.090
of a bunch of satellites
from the satellites,

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.960
then the receiver
can see how long

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.630
did it take to get
from the satellite

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.190
to where the receiver is.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.780
So if you think about it, let's
say one of the transmitters

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.770
is by that exit sign.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.400
So if I know my distance
from the exit sign,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.340
that puts me on a sphere
of uncertainty, right?

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.710
I could be up in the ceiling.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.380
I could be down on
the first floor.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.600
I could be in a lot
of different places,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.920
as long as I know that I'm--

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.760
let's call it 30 feet
from the exit sign.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.390
OK.

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.970
Well, that's not great
because I'm still pretty

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.770
uncertain about where I am.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.410
But how about if there's
another transmitter

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.890
in that corner of the room,
that gives me a second sphere.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.880
Two spheres will intersect
in a circle, I believe.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.267
So now we have a
circle of uncertainty.

00:29:44.267 --> 00:29:46.350
And we pick up another
transmitter maybe somewhere

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.170
over there.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.070
So the more
satellites we can see,

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.080
the more intersecting
spheres we have,

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.010
and eventually, we'll get down
to a very small little area

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.690
of uncertainty, indeed.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:58.950
So that's how GPS works.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.060
You just rely on the fact that
the speed of light is constant.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.140
If you know the distance to
each of a bunch of satellites,

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.302
and you know where they
are, then at that point,

00:30:09.302 --> 00:30:10.260
you know where you are.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:18.570
The 32 satellites,
as of 2016, were up.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.470
31 were in use.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.000
You can always see five.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.690
For IFR, the idea is to
try to get some redundancy.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.300
There are some tweaks
to that system.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.610
I think what I just
described would work really

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.760
well in outer space where
there's no atmosphere

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.400
to bend or distort any
of the radio signals.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.520
But there is a certain amount
of distortion that happens,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.350
and there are these
ground-based reference stations.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.010
So you know exactly
where they are.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.170
They don't move.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.740
And they listen to the signals.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.698
And they try to figure
out how much error there

00:30:56.698 --> 00:30:58.660
is as a result of
the signals traveling

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.120
through the atmosphere
at that location.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.690
Those corrections are then
pushed back up into space

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:06.430
and sent back down
from the satellites

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.960
to ordinary receivers.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.940
And with those corrections,
you can become really accurate.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.340
You can get accurate
enough to actually fly

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.930
down right towards the runway.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:22.963
So the GPS system which launched
in the mid-'90s, that enabled

00:31:22.963 --> 00:31:24.880
the moving map, and you
never were lost again.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.930
You always knew where you were.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.660
But the WAAS system
is what enables

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.600
these GPS approaches where
you navigate in 3D to within--

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.930
I don't know-- 10 feet or
something of precision,

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.390
right down to the runway.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:36.890
All right.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.348
What does it look
like in practice?

00:31:38.348 --> 00:31:40.360
This is the pilot's view.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.700
This is a modern Garmin 750.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.480
It's a single box that
actually has three sub boxes,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.590
and the sub boxes are
the GPS, a nav radio,

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:56.060
which lets you tune up VORs
and instrument landing system

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.120
for approaching a runway.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.037
Tina may talk about that
a little bit tomorrow

00:31:59.037 --> 00:32:03.350
in a little IFR intro,
and also a com radio,

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.030
And they actually, I
think they actually

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.015
have three separate
power supplies.

00:32:07.015 --> 00:32:09.740
So there's a
connection to the box,

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.840
maybe for power,
but after that you

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.290
can have tremendous amount
of failure inside the box

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:21.530
and still have a subset
of the functions working.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.540
I guess if the
screen fails, you're

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.460
out of luck, which is why every
IFR certified airplane that I

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.600
know of that's newish has a
second one of these, usually

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.380
smaller, a Garmin 650,
which is physically smaller.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.560
The Garmin G1000,
it's even bigger.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.840
It's on this huge
multifunction display.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.150
If that fails, you can
swap all the information

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.150
over to the primary flight
display or vice versa.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:51.230
So that just gives you
a little view to it.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.360
Here's your com
radio on the G1000,

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.760
and here's your nav radio,
and see, it's even identified.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.345
The VORs put out a
Morse code signal,

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.720
and the Garmin
has listened to it

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:08.260
and identified it as the
PPG VOR, the FJR VOR.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.490
All right.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:13.150
The G1000, actually, this is
one of the worst human factors

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.340
design I think I've ever seen.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.900
Wonder who else
can identify this.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:22.450
Like what is truly
terrible about this design?

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:23.950
I'll give you a hint.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.320
Well, there's the all the
engine instruments on the left

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.780
there too.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:34.480
So what kind of pretty common
failure, accident causing

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.180
failure, does this really
not help you prevent?

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.620
Electrical-- that's
not very common.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.920
And I'll tell you that most
airplanes that have an accident

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.670
are in perfect mechanical,
electrical, and sheet metal

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.087
condition.

00:33:54.087 --> 00:33:55.170
AUDIENCE: Fuel starvation?

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.920
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Fuel starvation.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.220
Yeah, like your
battery, your amps.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.460
I mean, basically, fuel
is given the same status

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.020
as all of this stuff.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.060
Fuel is almost always relevant.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.090
And this other stuff is
almost never relevant.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:10.989
And here it is.

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:12.072
It's small.

00:34:12.072 --> 00:34:13.780
As you run out of
fuel, as you get really

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.655
down into the red zone,
does this thing grow?

00:34:15.655 --> 00:34:18.160
You think it would grow to
consume half of the display.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.929
But It doesn't do
anything like that.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.469
So I think it's a
terrible, terrible design,

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:27.659
and aviation really
needs some help.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.170
Avidyne is a little better, I
think, on the user interface.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.464
This is kind of a legacy
system from the Cirrus.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.239
This is NEXRAD
data link weather.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.197
We're going to talk about
that in a little bit.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.659
Here is just a little
thing about navigation.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:51.790
If you're going anywhere
near the DC area,

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.310
either get your instrument
rating and file IFR,

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.380
and then it becomes
like everywhere else,

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.310
or you have to take this
online course at some point

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.950
and learn about the special
rules in the DC area.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.080
They're not that hard to
go down to Gaithersburg.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.160
You have to VFR.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.290
You have to go in
from certain gates.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:10.270
You have to file a
flight plan in advance,

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.540
and you have to keep a unique
transponder code so that air

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.270
traffic control can track you.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.170
So if you have any brilliant
ideas for how folks in DC

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.450
could do things
better, you can just

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.120
get in a little Piper
or Cessna or Cirrus

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.060
at Hanscom, zip down
to Gaithersburg,

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.380
and there you are.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.220
All right.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.990
After the navigation
mistakes, so

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.360
let's say you bust into
class Bravo airspace

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:40.390
without a clearance, or
do something else that you

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.220
shouldn't have done.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.450
The FAA and NASA are really
not there to bust you.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.200
There's this special
form you can fill out

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.090
where you if you
write down what you

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.580
did, why you did it,
how you think things

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.780
could be improved--

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.340
maybe it was a user
interface issue.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.920
Maybe somebody else was
using the airplane before you

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.830
and turned off all
the airspace alerts.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.080
You just fill out this
form and mail it in,

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.640
and that limits the
amount of discipline

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.440
that they can subject you to.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.350
I mean it doesn't protect you
from intentional violations.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:12.040
All right.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.690
Here's a summary.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:18.520
Pilotage, NDBs, VOR, and GPS.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.750
That was the progression.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:25.480
You've seen, now, 100 years
of aviation navigation.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.520
Actually, one thing
that I hope this does

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.710
is give you a new
appreciation for some

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:33.940
of the achievements of people
who flew around the world

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.490
in the '60s or the '50s.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.860
There's a woman, Jerrie
Mock, I think, is her name.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.790
A great book.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:43.690
She flew a Cessna tail dragger
around the world in the 1960s.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.580
And she was often lost.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.400
She'd be over the ocean
with icing on her wings.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.660
She would be having to track
NDBs in Egypt or whatever.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.250
So all of that stuff has
gotten so much easier,

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.487
it's almost not fair.

00:36:56.487 --> 00:36:57.820
And you've got these data links.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.320
So we can't compare
our achievements

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.780
to the achievements
of pilots or the risks

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.880
that we're taking to
the risks that folks

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.150
were taking in the old days.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.600
They didn't have EPIRBs
if they went in the water.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.410
They didn't have moving maps.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:14.560
So they just didn't know where
they were most of the time.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.660
They had a vague idea.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.160
All right.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.750
So this is for Francis.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:23.120
This is a quote from Captain
Sully's book, the single pilot

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.060
Airbus hero, according
to most of you.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:34.760
So he's got a failed GPS and
a failed compass, Francis.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.630
He says he could just keep
Venus in the left front

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.350
corner of the windshield, and
we would reach California.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:45.260
What else could
Captain Sully have

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.110
done as an alternative
to using Venus?

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.870
AUDIENCE: The sun?

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.210
PHILIP GREENSPUN: The sun?

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.744
Well, it's nighttime.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:00.750
What?

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.800
AUDIENCE: Polaris?

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.883
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Polaris.

00:38:02.883 --> 00:38:05.010
AUDIENCE: Follow Route 90?

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.190
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yes,
actually, the helicopter

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.530
follow an interstate highway.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.125
That's a common
helicopter technique,

00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:12.750
probably because the
interstates always

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.950
go through the lowest points.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.490
How about this one?

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:20.430
Request vectors SFO.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.710
You could probably climb
right out of Hanscom

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.570
and call it Boston
approach, and they would

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.240
be happy to help at any time.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.710
Actually, that is
a good question.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.470
That's actually a good point
into crew resource management.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:34.080
Don't try to be a
single pilot hero.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.997
Ideally, if it's a challenging
flight, you've got a co-pilot,

00:38:36.997 --> 00:38:38.580
and even if you don't
have a co-pilot,

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:42.990
you always have air traffic
control as another crew member.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.110
All right.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.140
Let's take a few questions.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.171
Who's got questions
about navigation?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.530
AUDIENCE: In your
[INAUDIBLE] use for GPS

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.655
signal at certain altitude?

00:38:58.655 --> 00:38:59.530
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Ah.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.720
So the question is,
can the airplane

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:07.160
show you your true altitude
based on the GPS signal?

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.860
And it's buried in there.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.890
It can't be shown
on your altimeter

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.990
in your primary flight display.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.860
But you can dig it out
of either a separated

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:25.270
GPS like the Garmin 750 or
430, or the integrated glass

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.490
panels like the G1000.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.283
AUDIENCE: Still the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:29.200
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yes.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.460
What you're navigating
from, how you're

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.990
being separated
from other aircraft,

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.090
that's all based on
the static information.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.280
But if you just want to
see, I know that mountain's

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.340
8,000 feet high, I want to
make sure it says at least 8001

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.510
for the actual altitude,
you can dig that out.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.683
And I think the terrain
warning system will use that.

00:39:47.683 --> 00:39:49.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
an older aircraft,

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:54.623
does it have the
GPS or [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:54.623 --> 00:39:56.040
What are the rules
and regulations

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:01.503
about using GPS [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:01.503 --> 00:40:02.420
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yes.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.740
I'll repeat the question
back for the tape and anybody

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.670
who didn't hear.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:17.490
So this phone has more computing
power and better design

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:22.200
than everything inside a
Boeing 747 or an Airbus A380.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.317
In fact, I talked to
some Airbus A320 captains

00:40:24.317 --> 00:40:26.400
and they said they wanted
to get rid of everything

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.950
in the airplane except
the altitude indicator,

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.660
and they just wanted
to navigate off

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.000
of an iPad running
a European app

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.210
called Sky Demon, which is kind
of like the American forefather

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:36.900
of Garmin pilot.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.470
They said, that would
be just way better,

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.480
to just use the
iPad for everything.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.890
So as a practical matter,
in your ancient airplane

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.440
that might not even have
an electrical system, yes,

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.050
of course, you can
navigate quite effectively

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.610
with some battery-powered
electronics

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:57.140
or portable electronics that
you stick around the aircraft.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.680
And the interface
can be very good,

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.110
and they have comprehensive
databases of everything

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.730
you'd want to know.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:06.540
For legal purposes,
and for practical ones,

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:10.230
for instrument flying,
you have to have

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.960
FAA certified stuff that's
hardwired to the aircraft

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.370
and it's in the panel.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.740
And that makes sense
because, think about it,

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.580
your phone may die.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.970
The battery may die.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:19.922
So it's nice to have.

00:41:19.922 --> 00:41:21.630
If you want to do an
instrument approach,

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.650
for example, you're
going to need

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:25.620
to have something like-- even an
experimental airplane-- you've

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.080
got to have one of those
certified, like a Garmin

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.350
750 in there.

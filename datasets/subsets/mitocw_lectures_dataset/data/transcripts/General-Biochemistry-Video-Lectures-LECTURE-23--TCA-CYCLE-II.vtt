MATTHEW VANDER HEIDEN:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.380
Last time, I introduced
the idea of the TCA cycle,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.580
tricarboxylic acid cycle.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.570
Also known as the citric acid
cycle, because citric acid

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.690
is a tricarboxylic acid,
as you'll see later today.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.700
Also known as the
Krebs cycle, named

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.810
after Hans Krebs,
who discovered it

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.540
in the early part
of the last century.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.330
The TCA cycle is the
series of reactions

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.430
that occurs in the
mitochondrial matrix

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.550
and it allows the complete
oxidation of two carbon

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.090
units, derived from many things,
including pyruvate, derived

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.910
from glucose and glycolysis and
enables the complete oxidation

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.520
of that carbon to CO2.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.070
Now, it's a cycle
because those two carbon

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.050
units from pyruvate or other
sources enter the cycle,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.930
combine with 4-carbon
oxaloacetate,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.240
and combine to make
6-carbon citrate.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.540
Hence the citric
acid cycle, or TCA

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.800
cycle, that is then oxidized
back to 4 carbon units,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.560
forming a cycle
that allows cells

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.270
to release lots of energy.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.370
Complete oxygen
enables, ultimately,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.010
complete oxidation
of glucose to CO2.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.560
We've talked many times
how this releases energy.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.750
And it also generates
lots of intermediates

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.260
for the cell that can be
used to make other stuff.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.290
Last time, I alluded to the
fact that citrate can be

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.380
used, say, to make fatty acids.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.360
Today, what I want to
do is I want to dive

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.010
into the details of how
this TCA cycle occurs

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.980
and the consequences
of the way it works,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.640
and how that affects other
aspects of metabolism.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.920
You'll see that it
actually affects

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.440
the ability of
different organisms,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.050
whether or not they
can make things

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.930
from intermediates
in this cycle,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.665
because of how the cycle works.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.395
Now, to start.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.980
Of course, if we're going
to start from pyruvate.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.210
Pyruvate, of course,
has three carbons.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.760
And so if we're going to
generate a two-carbon acetate

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.890
group, we have to lose CO2.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.280
And as I described a
couple lectures ago,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.740
acetate is also
the thing that we

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.710
can derive from
metabolism of ethanol,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.720
showing us two things--

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.750
metabolized glucose to
pyruvate or ethanol itself--

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.820
can both be turned into acetate.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.940
But really, the donor is
this molecule, acetyl-CoA.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.240
Which is basically also a
carboxylic acid, but rather

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.180
than being a carboxylic
acid, instead makes this

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.880
a thioester bond, which
activates this carbon

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:35.760
as a leaving group, such that it
can combine with oxaloacetate,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.130
which you'll remember
from gluconeogenesis,

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:52.760
releasing that S-CoA molecule
to generate six-carbon citric.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.690
So, this is citric.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.110
You can see that we've made
a bond from this carbon

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.700
on the acetate, losing this
S-CoA group to this carbon

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.290
oxaloacetate to make this
six-carbon citrate molecule,

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.170
which is a one, two, three--

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.460
three-carboxylic acid,
or tricarboxylic acid.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.280
Hence the name
citric acid cycle,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.450
tricarboxylic acid cycle.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.590
Now, these six
carbons can then--

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.900
or this six-carbon
citrate molecule

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.740
can then be oxidized, generating
two CO2 molecules that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.400
are released, and
ultimately reforming

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.780
oxaloacetate that can pick up
another two-carbon acetyl-CoA

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.110
to generate another citrate,
and around and around the cycle

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.030
goes, allowing in
the end the net entry

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.840
of two carbons,
effectively from acetate,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.640
and release of two
carbons as CO2.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.190
Now, as I alluded to, this
can come from pyruvate.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.670
It can come from
acetate itself, vinegar.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.200
It can come from alcohol.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.000
It turns out that when
you break down fat,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.180
you also break it
into two carbon units.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.680
And so this cycle becomes
very useful for cells,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.600
because it allows the oxidation
of many different molecules

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.800
to completely turn
that carbon into CO2.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.370
Now, if we're going to
do this from glucose,

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:05.750
however, you'll remember that
pyruvate has three carbons.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.690
And so if we're going
to turn pyruvate

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.440
into acetate, or acetyl-CoA, we
have to lose a carbon of CO2.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.930
We have to lose
this carbon as CO2.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.700
Now, we saw this before,
that we can do this via--

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.800
this is exactly how
we generated ethanol

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.830
when we did fermentation
of pyruvate to ethanol,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.130
but that molecule
didn't generate acetate,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.530
It generated acetaldehyde.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.190
The difference, of course, being
whether or not this carbon gets

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.830
oxidized in the case
of acetate to the acid,

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.200
or in acetaldehyde in
ethanol metabolism,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.570
where it remains an aldehyde.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.330
Now obviously, you can
make ethanol and then

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.580
turn that ethanol into acetate.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.800
And that's a pathway that I
guess certainly would work.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.420
However, that's not the way
it happens in most organisms.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.180
Most organisms actually
directly produce

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.870
acetate, or more correctly,
acetyl-CoA from pyruvate.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.200
So let's take a look
at that reaction.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.370
So here once again is pyruvate.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.910
And if we turn
that pyruvate into

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:34.590
this two-carbon
acetyl-CoA, let's

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.390
look here what has to happen.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.060
Well, the first
thing is that we have

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.050
to decarboxylate this molecule.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.610
And so that generates a CO2.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.420
We have to lose that one carbon.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.010
Also, as I pointed
out, if we do this

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.320
as if we did it in
ethanol metabolism,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.700
we'd be left with an aldehyde.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.930
But this is an acid, and so this
carbon also has to be oxidized.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.040
We know how to do that.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:19.240
We can donate those electrons
to something like NAD,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.050
so the NAD is reduced to NADH.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:30.770
And we had to add this
S-CoA molecule, which

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.450
I'll come to in a minute.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:39.730
And so each of
these steps ends up

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.720
making a fairly
complicated reaction.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.798
Obviously, several co-factors
are going to be involved.

00:08:46.798 --> 00:08:49.090
You should be able to guess
that just by looking at it.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.400
Obviously, I already
drew up there NAD.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.460
If we're going to
decarboxylate, remember

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:03.750
this is a alpha
carboxylic, an alpha

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.170
ketoacid-- the ketone group is
alpha to the carboxylic acid.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.190
And so if we're doing
alpha decarboxylation,

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.500
as you might guess,
we need a co-factor.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.210
That co-factor, as
I told you before,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.850
is the co-factor factor
thiamine pyrophosphate.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.940
And finally, there's
this S-CoA group.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.320
We need to describe
what that is.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.190
However, before delving
into those, and there's

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.160
actually a couple other factors
that are needed as well,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.150
I want to mention
one other issue

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.980
about this reaction, in
that this reaction happens

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.820
in the mitochondria,
because that's also

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.770
where the TCA cycle happens.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.820
So, recall that if we divide
the cell into two compartments

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.880
like an eukaryotic cell,
here we have the cytosol

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.640
and the mitochondria
in a eukaryotic cell.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.640
As we've already talked about,
having different compartments

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.393
helps facilitate different
metabolic reactions,

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:04.560
because you can have different
conditions in the two

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.860
compartments.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:15.240
And so as we said, glycolysis
occurs in the cytosol.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.090
Glucose to pyruvate.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:26.720
And last time I
mentioned, the TCA cycle

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.340
occurs in the mitochondria.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.700
And so that means if we're
going to fully oxidize

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.900
the pyruvate carbon
to CO2 using the TCA

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.510
cycle in the mitochondria,
that pyruvate

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.840
has to get from the cytosol to
the mitochondria, or at least

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.408
carbons from the pyruvate
have to get there.

00:10:47.408 --> 00:10:48.950
It turns out, you'll
see in a minute,

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.870
acetyl-CoA is a
very large group.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.750
And so pyruvate
itself is transported

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.640
into the mitochondria.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.260
And that's where
the reaction occurs

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.620
to turn it into acetyl-CoA that
can then enter the TCA cycle

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.540
and oxidize.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.370
However, what this means is
that a transporter is actually

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.610
needed to get this across
the mitochondrial membranes

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.220
and into the matrix of the
mitochondria where the TCA

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.162
cycle happens.

00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:17.120
And I like to mention
this because it turns out

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.290
the pyruvate carrier--

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.790
that is, the
transporter-- the way

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.820
that it actually gets that
pyruvate from the cytosol

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.220
into the mitochondria
actually was

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.050
an unknown thing
about metabolism

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.380
until 2012, so
not that long ago.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.150
Sometimes one can be
left with the feeling,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.690
listening to these metabolism
classes or reading a textbook,

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.350
that everything about metabolism
has been known forever,

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.940
but it's actually not true.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.510
Here's a very key, central
part of the pathway that

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.760
was actually just
discovered, at least

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.220
at the time of this lecture,
less than 10 years ago.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.340
It also illustrates that not
all metabolism is completely

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.510
understood.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.980
Now, let's get back to this
reaction, how you turn pyruvate

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.590
into acetyl-CoA.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.900
And I want to go through
now and point out

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.000
that several
co-factors are needed.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.460
And so I already mentioned
one of them, S-CoA,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:26.490
which is shorthand
for coenzyme A. So,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.870
I need to tell you what that is.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.850
You hopefully are already
familiar with TPP plus,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.170
thiamine pyrophosphate.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.290
We talked about
that when we talked

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.890
about how you do alpha
decarboxylation to generate

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.440
ethanol from pyruvate,
also used here

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.620
for the alpha
decarboxylation reaction.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.200
Redox reaction
happens, and so we

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.760
needed NAD plus to get
converted into NADH.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.120
We talked a lot about how that
serves as an electron carrier,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.120
but it turns out that there's
two additional electron

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.390
carriers that are
involved in this reaction.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.950
One of them is called
FAD and the other one

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.155
is called lipoic acid.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.700
Now you might say,
why do we need

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.070
all these electron carriers?

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.260
Well, these are just
different molecules

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:30.600
that can carry two
electrons, similar to NADH.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.430
And effectively, what these can
do by having multiple electron

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:35.480
carriers--

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.680
one can build chains of
oxidation and reduction

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.940
reactions.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.120
And it turns out these chains
of oxidation reduction reactions

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.200
really become central to
energy transfers in biology,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.690
because building
these chains allows

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.020
more easy stepwise
release of energy

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.660
as one moves across these
oxidation reduction reactions.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.170
Which remember, as I
alluded to earlier, really

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:06.890
are at the core of bioenergetics
and a lot of what allows energy

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.980
release from these pathways.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.490
What I mean by this
will be more explicit

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:18.350
as we go through what some of
these co-factors look like.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:25.550
So, I'm not going to draw TPP
plus or NAD again, but let's

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:30.090
define what some of these
other cofactors look like.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:39.410
So, let's start with coenzyme
A. So, coenzyme A, it turns out,

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.210
is useful.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:46.360
It's actually involved in
lots of acylation reactions.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.070
What's an acylation reaction?

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.750
Well, that's basically if you're
making a carbon-carbon bond

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.200
by adding a molecule of greater
than one carbon, so two carbons

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.030
or greater, to something else.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.070
That's an acylation
reaction, as we

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.810
did with adding the two-carbon
acetate to oxaloacetate

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.460
to make citrate.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.680
And you'll actually see
coenzyme A will come up

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.110
in this in many, many
lectures throughout the rest

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.400
of the course.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.750
Why this becomes useful
is because it activates

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:25.530
this basically carbon to
the left of, in this case,

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:26.450
the ketone.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.330
Because, by having
that thioester there,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.620
ends up activating that carbon
and allows it to carry out

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.070
these acylation reactions.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.000
Coenzyme A itself is
derived from a vitamin

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.285
called pantothenic acid.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.720
And as a vitamin,
this is something

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.370
that you have to
get from the diet.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.690
Now, when we
abbreviate coenzyme A,

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.440
which is often
abbreviated S-CoA,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.960
you get the sense that it's
this little tiny molecule

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.700
that's just stuck on sulfur--

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.610
stuck on to the end to
make this thioester bond.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.730
But it turns out coenzyme A is
actually a giant molecule, one

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:19.390
of the reasons why you
actually synthesize acetyl-CoA

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.800
in the mitochondria,
because it's

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.170
hard to transport
this giant molecule.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.990
And so this is what
pantothenic acid looks like.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.400
So, if I put an acid group here
and a hydroxyl group there,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.530
that would be pantothenic
acid, the thing

00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:00.075
that's in your cereal, on
the side of your cereal box.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.690
Then there's these
additional pieces.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:17.380
This is the active
end of the molecule,

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.839
that's that sulfur
from the S-CoA,

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:25.180
and then this side of the
molecule is esterified to two

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.810
phosphates, which
are esterified to--

00:17:31.477 --> 00:17:33.060
I'm not going to
draw it out, but this

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:39.200
would have an adenine base
and a phosphate there.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:47.540
So basically, this is
ADP, with a phosphate

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.740
added to the 3 prime
position of the ADP molecule,

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.000
added to pantothenic acid,
added to this short chain

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.560
with the sulfur on the end.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.550
And this whole molecule
together is coenzyme A.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.530
And so when we say
acetyl-CoA, it's

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:12.630
this giant molecule,
S-thioester to the carbonyl,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.950
the acid on acetate, to CH3.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.680
And so that would be,
basically, acetyl-CoA.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.030
And so one convenient
thing about this

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.610
is it's much easier than
drawing that big molecule,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.930
but it is a little bit
misleading in terms

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.670
of its size.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.970
So, that's coenzyme A.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:42.240
Next one I want to
talk about is FAD

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:51.120
which stands for flavin
adenine dinucleotide.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.110
So, flavin adenine dinucleotide
is an electron carrier,

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.835
just like NAD plus.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:11.480
And it's derived from
the vitamin riboflavin,

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.480
also referred to as vitamin B2.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.410
Another thing from the side of
your cereal box, and basically

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.440
looks like this.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:31.670
So, like NAD, it's
a dinucleotide.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:45.270
And so here's ADP, just
like we do for CoA, or just

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.430
like one end of NAD.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.330
One difference is that the
other nucleotide down here

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.010
actually isn't
technically a sugar.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.240
It's ribitol instead of ribose.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240
What does that mean?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.940
It doesn't have an aldehyde.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.710
Instead, it is just
a five-carbon chain

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.010
where all of the
carbons are alcohols.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.250
And so since
there's no aldehyde,

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.200
it doesn't form a ring.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.680
And the base on this
end, as a nicotinamide,

00:20:49.680 --> 00:21:07.180
is this flavin group,
which looks like this.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:15.740
And so this is FAD, which
is in the oxidized form.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.250
Turns out, in the
oxidized form, FAD

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:25.520
is yellow, hence riboflavin--
"flavin", yellow.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.410
And the reason it's
yellow-- you see

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.770
there's a conjugated double
bond here across this part.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.460
It turns out this is the
active part of the molecule,

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.900
and it works as follows.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.540
And so if you have
a hydride ion,

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.600
remember the way we can
transfer two electrons.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.270
Can transfer the two
electrons that way,

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.920
and that allows it to generate.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.620
And I'll just draw
the middle, here.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.320
Active part of the molecule.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.510
So, that would be
these two nitrogens.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.350
We've added two electrons to it.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:20.590
And so this is
abbreviated FADH2,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:24.700
or the reduced form of FAD.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.060
And it is colorless,
because now you no longer

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.810
have that conjugated double
bond system, loses its color.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.590
And so you can follow whether
FAD is oxidized or reduced

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.550
by just looking at color change.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.500
So, that's FAD.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.890
It's an electron carrier,
carries electrons

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.130
by a hydride transfer,
very similarly

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.370
to what we described
for NAD, but obviously

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.890
a different molecule.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:59.000
And the last molecule,
the last co-factor

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.910
that we need for this
reaction, is lipoic acid.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.220
Which, unlike most
things in metabolism,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.840
doesn't have an abbreviation
and also functions

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.700
as an electron carrier.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.040
And so lipoic acid
looks like this.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.810
So, that is lipoic acid.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:45.190
This is in the oxidized form.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.100
And so where it's
oxidized is here

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.660
at this sulfur-sulfur bond.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.380
So, you can think of this as
the same as a disulfide bond

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.110
that you learned about from
Professor Yaffe in proteins.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:01.390
And so this is the oxidized
form of the disulfide bond.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:09.230
If I take this hydride, transfer
two electrons across that bond,

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:13.675
then it goes to-- and I'll
just draw here the active end.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:25.110
Then we go here to the
reduced form of lipoic acid,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.020
and there's no
abbreviation for oxidized

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.700
or reduced lipoic acid.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.960
It's just lipoic acid,
oxidized lipoic acid, reduced.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.210
And how they're
oxidized and reduced

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:41.550
is basically very similar
to the disulfide bonds

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.770
that you saw in proteins being
oxidized, disulfide bond being

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:52.350
oxidized, or it can be reduced
to not be a disulfide bond.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:25:02.760
Now, it turns out that these
cofactors, our TPP, FAD,

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.680
and lipoic acid, are
all stably associated

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:14.060
with different subunits
of a multi-protein complex

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:20.300
that assembles to catalyze that
reaction to convert pyruvate

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.330
to acetyl-CoA.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.610
The enzyme or
enzyme complex that

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.210
carries this out is
referred to as PDH,

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.630
sometimes abbreviated
PDC, which stands

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:46.110
for the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:50.190
So, pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH,
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.790
PDC.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:56.460
This complex is basically
three different polypeptides

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.650
that come together
to form a complex

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.960
and catalyze that reaction.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.610
Now, where this complex sits--

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.640
so, this is the mitochondria.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.770
This is the matrix.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.530
That's where this pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction occurs.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.170
That's where the
TCA cycle occurs.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.630
And this PDH
complex is basically

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.590
sitting here at the
membrane on the matrix side

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.450
of the membrane.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.720
Now, the three
different polypeptides

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.970
that come together
to form this complex

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:35.010
are creatively named
E1, E2, and E3, four.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.680
Enzyme one, two, and three.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.010
And each of these,
as I alluded to,

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.567
is associated with a
different co-factor.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:56.760
And so E1 is associated
with thymine pyrophosphate.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:07.510
E2 is associated
with lipoic acid.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:12.675
And E3 is associated with FAD.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.120
Now, let's go
through the mechanism

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.345
for how this pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction works.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:27.950
So remember, this is the
active part of TBP plus.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.450
It is bound in the
active site of E1.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:43.600
And it reacts with pyruvate to
catalyze alpha decarboxylation,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.550
just like we described
for conversion of pyruvate

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.110
to alcohol.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.800
So, you're going to see
exactly the same mechanism

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.490
that we drew before.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.450
So, that decarboxylates
the alpha-keto acid,

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:27.440
just like we saw to
generate acetaldehyde.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:37.290
The difference is rather
than resolve this such

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.780
that this carbon has
the same oxidation state

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.520
and make acetaldehyde, instead
the next step of this reaction

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:56.230
is going to be oxidized
by reducing lipoic acid.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.040
So, the active
part of lipoic acid

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.530
that is in the active
site of the E2 subunit.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:27.170
So this will now regenerate
E1, but what we're left with,

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.820
then, is this.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.810
Now, this intermediate
bound to E2.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:54.170
Here's where coenzyme
A can come in, which

00:31:54.170 --> 00:32:04.260
will then generate acetyl-CoA.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:19.890
But now we are left with
E2 in the reduced state,

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.950
rather than being in
the oxidized state.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.990
So E2 has to be re-oxidized
in order for this complex

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:32.820
to carry out the next
catalytic cycle, and the way

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.130
that works is as follows.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:41.130
So you have FAD bound on E3.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:54.550
And so you have a hydride
ion from the oxidation of E3

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:58.120
that can be transferred to FAD.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:07.500
That will generate FAD from the
oxidized to the reduced form.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:16.200
So re-oxidize lipoic acid
on E2, reduce FAD to FADH2,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.010
and then that FADH2
can be re-oxidized back

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:26.420
to FAD via transferring
those electrons to NAD

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:31.720
plus to generate NADH.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.180
So in this case, FADH2
re-oxidized the FAD, NAD

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.080
plus reduced to NADH.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.410
And so, effectively,
what this happens

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:49.090
is that enzyme E1
and E2 cooperate

00:33:49.090 --> 00:34:02.830
to call what's referred to as
oxidative alpha decarboxylation

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.090
of pyruvate, while
adding -CoA, so that's

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:15.090
where you get acetyl-CoA, with
reduction of lipoic acid in E2,

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:20.370
and then E3 re-oxidizes
the lipoic acid in E2

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:24.409
while generating NADH.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.677
This NADH, once it's
generated, of course

00:34:26.677 --> 00:34:28.219
those electrons have
to go somewhere,

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:30.409
so they, like in glycolysis--

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:33.889
it also needs to regenerate
to NAD at some point.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:38.120
This is ultimately the
electrons that end up on oxygen,

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.590
and it's really this series
of electron transfers,

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.500
with oxygen being a good
electron acceptor, that

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:50.570
ultimately allows controlled
energy release during carbon

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.739
oxidation.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:55.070
And cells, you'll see, can
use that to make ATP or do

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.940
other kinds of work.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.720
So, the net reaction
and/or another way

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.160
to draw the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:15.390
would be as follows, and that's
taking pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:27.980
And so we're going to take
coenzyme A and release CO2.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:42.500
This is done by TPP
plus, as part of E1.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:52.660
That involves converting
the lipoic acid in E2

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.080
from the oxidized to
the reduced state.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.130
That lipoic acid then
has to be re-oxidized.

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.260
If something's
oxidized, something else

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.790
has to be reduced.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:10.090
That's FAD on E3,
which also then cycles

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.020
between the oxidized
and reduce state.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.440
And ultimately, those
electrons ended up

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:24.010
being transferred to NAD
plus to generate NADH.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:32.380
And so the PDH complex
is basically a chain

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:41.010
of electron transfer reactions.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.690
And it's the first example of
a chain of electron transfer

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.230
reactions.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.630
We're going to see that there
is the electron transport

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.900
chain in the mitochondria,
effectively does

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.870
the same thing.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:56.400
And by coupling oxidation
and reduction reactions

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.480
across chains of molecules like
this, effectively as a preview,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.930
allows the stepwise energy
release of these oxidation

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.170
reactions to occur.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.550
So remember, if we burn glucose,
completely oxidize it in one

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.750
step, where those electrons
are directly transferred

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.510
to oxygen in combustion.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:18.720
Lots of energy released,
but all in one step.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.210
By doing these stepwise
electron transfers,

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:25.110
we can then basically break
up that energy release

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:29.190
in a way that can be
captured by cells to do work.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.050
Here, the way
energy is captured,

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.860
it's not so obvious in this
electron transport reaction.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.580
But effectively,
you're using oxidation

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:46.770
of the ketone on pyruvate, with
decarboxylation to the acid

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.400
to generate, rather than just
the acid, a thioester bond.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.470
And that's that thioester bond--

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.110
as well as NADH, that's
energy as well-- but it's

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.620
really that thioester bond that
then can be recaptured later

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:03.420
to drive synthesis of
citrate in the TCA cycle.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.970
Now, next what I want to do is
I want to discuss the TCA cycle

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:12.600
reactions.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.420
Now that you see how you
can get acetyl-CoA, at least

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.450
from pyruvate, I want to
discuss how you can now

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:23.910
use that acetyl-CoA and
oxidize it back to combine it

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.960
with oxaloacetate,
and oxidize it back

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.350
to make citrate, and then
oxidize it back to oxaloacetate

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:35.490
to run the TCA cycle.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:37.960
OK, great.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:54.120
So, the first reaction
of the TCA cycle.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:00.090
Here's acetyl-CoA.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:13.530
It will combine
with oxaloacetate.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:58.130
This reaction is catalyzed by an
enzyme called citrate synthase,

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:05.480
and generates the six-carbon
tricarboxylic acid citrate.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.340
So, how does this reaction work?

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:52.920
Here's drawing acetyl-CoA
in a slightly different way.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:41:25.620
If I redraw this
as the enol, this

00:41:25.620 --> 00:42:26.340
will generate citrate via,
effectively, that mechanism.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:42.600
Next, citrate is
converted by adding water

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:48.450
across this carbon-carbon,
or by removing water

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:56.790
across this carbon-carbon
bond, to generate

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:59.260
this intermediate
called cis-aconitate.

00:43:31.989 --> 00:43:34.660
So this intermediate is
called cis-aconitate.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.440
so all I did was
dehydrate across that bond

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.340
so there's a double bond there.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:56.180
And then if I re-add
water across that bond,

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:19.640
I generate this molecule
called isocitrate.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.500
So effectively, to convert
citrate to isocitrate,

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.980
I'm moving the hydroxyl
group from that carbon

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.630
to this carbon.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.760
To do that, I basically
dehydrate, make a double bond,

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.710
remove water, re-add
water across that bond

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.950
in the opposite direction
to generate this molecule,

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:43.550
isocitrate.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:45:00.210
This reaction is carried out
by an enzyme called aconitase,

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:05.510
and converts citrate
to isocitrate.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:10.820
I think it's a little
easier to see this reaction

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.090
if I draw it a
slightly different way.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.890
So, this here is
just drawing citrate

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:21.560
by just slightly rotating the
molecule to look like that.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.490
And so I'm basically
removing water here.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:57.100
And then I'm now just
adding water back

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:20.850
in the opposite orientation
to generate isocitrate.

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:33.300
Now, you'll notice
when I drew this--

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.900
if you look at citrate, this
is actually a symmetrical

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:43.380
molecule, so the top half and
the bottom half of citrate

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.700
are identical.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:49.410
And so what's interesting
about nature is

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.510
that it treats these carbons--

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.060
the green carbons that
came from acetyl-CoA--

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.270
different from the side
of the molecule that

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.210
comes from oxaloacetate.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:05.370
And effectively, nature always
moves the hydroxyl group

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:08.820
to this carbon that
came from oxaloacetate,

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.670
and never moves
it to this carbon

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:15.270
that came from acetyl-CoA.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.240
This is an example
where enzymes--

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.950
nature treats a symmetrical
molecule like citrate

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:25.080
in an asymmetrical way.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.910
And this has consequences for
how carbon is actually traced

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.400
through the entire TCA cycle.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.590
Because even though you
might think things could get

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:37.230
scrambled at citrate,
they never do.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:41.580
Meaning an isocitrate-- it's
always these green carbons

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.320
that came from acetyl-CoA.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.180
You never get
those green carbons

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.960
on the other side of isocitrate.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.970
And so when we go
through the TCA cycle,

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.030
I'll keep these carbons
green until the point where

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:58.290
you can no longer distinguish
which carbon came from

00:48:58.290 --> 00:48:59.585
came from which reaction.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:07.740
The next reaction is
we're going to oxidize

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:12.030
this carbon of isocitrate.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:14.550
So if we're going to
oxidize that carbon,

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:17.370
those electrons have
to go somewhere.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:40.150
And so if we oxidize
the carbon, we

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:49.240
can use NAD plus as an electron
acceptor, reduce it to NADH.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:58.250
That generates
this intermediate.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.940
So hopefully this is clear
to everybody at this point,

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.150
but just in case.

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:34.560
So, this carbon
here and isocitrate.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:49.570
If I oxidize that
alcohol to the ketone,

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:51.610
now I generate a hydride ion.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.280
Those two electrons and the
hydrogen can go to NAD plus

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.070
and reduce it to NADH.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.590
That generates
this intermediate.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:06.220
It's called oxalosuccinate.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.860
Which then, if you
notice, the oxalosuccinate

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:16.420
is now a beta keto acid.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:22.420
So alpha, beta.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.730
The acid group is
beta to the ketone,

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.680
so it's a beta keto acid.

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.270
Remember, beta
decarboxylation is favorable,

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:35.860
and so I can lose that CO2.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:55.170
And what I'm left with
is this molecule, which

00:51:55.170 --> 00:52:06.100
is called alpha keto glutarate.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:14.370
So this whole reaction
here, the oxidation

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:16.590
of the alcohol to
the ketone, followed

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:20.010
by beta decarboxylation
of oxalosuccinate

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:22.560
to alpha ketoglutarate,
is carried out

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:28.680
by an enzyme called
isocitrate dehydrogenase.

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:50.662
And of course,
just to remind you,

00:52:50.662 --> 00:52:58.660
here's that beta keto
acid in oxalosuccinate.

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:20.570
And so that can decarboxylate,
leading this enol.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:35.800
Which can, of course, rearrange
back to the ketone that we see,

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:42.250
an alpha ketoglutarate.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:49.710
Now, if you look at
alpha ketoglutarate,

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:56.865
you'll notice that-- and
I will redraw over here.

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:18.630
So, this here is just me
redrawing alpha ketoglutarate,

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:23.960
which is often
abbreviated alpha kG.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.370
Just drew it as a straight line.

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:29.300
Now, if you'll notice,
alpha keto glutarate

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.750
is a alpha ketoacid.

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:37.620
And so here the acid group
is alpha to the ketone.

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.620
So, an alpha keto acid.

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:42.170
It's effectively
just like pyruvate,

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:45.110
but has this additional
pieces on it.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.740
And it turns out the next
step in the TCA cycle

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.820
is the exact
reaction that we saw

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:56.240
with pyruvate dehydrogenase.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.250
It's alpha decarboxylation,
oxidative alpha

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:22.280
keto acid decarboxylation,
as follows.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.090
So, we carry out.

00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:04.710
This is a molecule
called succinyl-CoA.

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:10.830
And so, you'll see what happened
there is decarboxylated here,

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:18.030
this carbon, while oxidizing
this ketone to the acid

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:19.800
and adding -CoA.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.400
That's a redox reaction.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:28.830
So NAD, NADH, it turns out this
is exactly the same mechanism--

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.360
so I don't need
to draw it again--

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.740
that I just showed you for
pyruvate dehydrogenase.

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.720
So it needs all the
same cofactors--

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.770
TPP plus, lipoic acid, FAD.

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:47.010
And in fact, it even shares some
of the same enzyme complexes,

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:51.720
subunits, as pyruvate
dehydrogenase.

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:57.330
And so this is a reaction
that's catalyzed by alpha

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:59.460
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:06.210
Like pyruvate dehydrogenase,
this is a complex,

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:09.650
and so it has a unique
E1, which makes sense.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:12.000
Remember, E1 of
pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.030
was actually the subunit
that bound the pyruvate.

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:17.820
E1 of alpha ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase is unique.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.400
It binds alpha ketoglutarate
instead of pyruvate.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:24.750
However, they share
the same E2 and E3s,

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:28.140
and so the E2s and
E3s would carry out

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:32.340
exactly the same reaction
and play the same part

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:38.400
in the mechanism of how you
do this alpha oxidative alpha

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.100
decarboxylation to turn
alpha ketoglutarate

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:45.330
into succinyl-CoA.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:47.340
Now, remember in
pyruvate dehydrogenase,

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.110
once we got that
acetyl-CoA, we then

00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:52.680
use this CoA group to drive
condensation with citrate.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.540
Well, in this case,
what happens is

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:58.110
you don't want to combine
condensation here.

00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:00.690
Instead, what is
going to happen is

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:08.160
you want to use this CoA
group to now generate ATP.

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:15.210
And so this is going to
couple release of the CoA

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:17.430
to generate an ATP equivalent.

00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:22.750
It's actually GTP that's
generated by the TCA cycle.

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:34.630
And so, this is
going to generate

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:39.490
this molecule, succinate.

00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:47.790
And the enzyme that does this
is called succinic bio-kinase.

00:58:56.930 --> 00:59:01.205
So, let's go through over
here how this enzyme works.

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:24.950
So here's succinyl-CoA,
basically using favorable loss

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:40.920
of the CoA breaking the
thioester bond to generate

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.750
this acid anhydride.

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:48.150
We saw an acid anhydride
before in glycolysis.

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:51.060
Remember, we made
1-3-bisphosphoglycerate,

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:54.180
so that's a good
phosphate donor.

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:59.110
And then that can be used
to generate succinate,

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:05.560
and transferring that
phosphate to GDP to make GTP,

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.620
just like
1-3-bisphosphoglycerate,

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.420
was able to transfer
the phosphate

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:18.370
from the acid anhydride to
ADP to make ATP in glycolysis.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:34.490
So, the next step is to
oxidize this carbon-carbon bond

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:37.400
in succinate.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.690
So if we're going to oxidize
a carbon-carbon bond,

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.090
those electrons have
to go somewhere.

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:53.790
So there's our
carbon-carbon bond.

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:13.200
And so if we
generate hydride ion

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.270
just like we did in other
oxidation reactions,

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:23.880
but this hydride ion is
transferred not to NAD,

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.510
but instead to FAD, a
different electron carrier,

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:34.680
to generate if FADH2.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.370
Now, I should point out
succinate, like citrate, is

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.050
a symmetrical molecule.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.680
But at this point, nature
doesn't tell the difference.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.440
Once it generates
succinate, this molecule

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.750
now gets scrambled.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:51.330
And so everything
downstream of succinate,

01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:54.750
you no longer know which
carbons came from acetyl-CoA.

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:10.540
This generates this
molecule called fumarate,

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:19.020
and this reaction is carried
out by an enzyme called

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:32.020
succinate dehydrogenase,
often abbreviated SDH

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.570
for succinate dehydrogenase.

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:44.900
Now, the next reaction
is, we're going

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:50.520
to add water across this
double bond of fumarate.

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:33.695
And that generates this
intermediate, malate.

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:42.630
This reaction is
carried out by an enzyme

01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:51.930
called fumarate hydratase.

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:55.320
And it's simply adding
a water molecule

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.470
across that double bond.

01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:01.710
Once we have malate,
if you look what's

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:06.450
the difference between
malate and oxaloacetate,

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:11.550
the difference is that in
oxaloacetate, this carbon

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:12.960
is a ketone.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.390
Whereas in malate,
it's an alcohol.

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:18.150
And so if we want to turn
this carbon from the alcohol

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:24.490
into the ketone, that is, of
course, a oxidation reaction,

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:32.470
and so those electrons
have to go somewhere.

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:36.790
Don't need to draw
the mechanism again.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:41.080
It's basically just
the hydride transfer

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.720
to oxidize this to an
alcohol, to the ketone.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:51.180
That oxidation couples to a
reduction of NAD plus to NADH.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:58.093
This is carried out by an enzyme
called malate dehydrogenase.

01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:12.980
And doing this
completes the TCA cycle,

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:16.160
regenerating oxaloacetate,
that can then

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.680
recombine with
another acetyl-CoA

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:24.200
to go through another
round of the cycle.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.700
You'll notice that going
through this cycle,

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:32.090
there's two CO2s lost.

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:39.020
One of them is lost here
at the isocitrate to alpha

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:40.860
ketoglutarate reaction.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:45.415
So, this decarboxylation
from oxaloacetate

01:05:45.415 --> 01:05:46.670
to alpha ketoglutarate.

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:50.000
That beta decarboxylation,
that's the first CO2.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.405
The other one is lost here
at the alpha ketoglutarate.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:00.100
The alpha ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase step,

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.970
where you have this
alpha decarboxylation

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:07.540
to take alpha ketoglutarate
to succinyl-CoA

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:12.280
oxidative alpha decarboxylation.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.670
Now, what's cool about
this, as you noticed,

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:20.770
we just discussed all the
reactions of the TCA cycle.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.460
And I showed you, reminded
you, of some chemistry

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.010
that you've already
seen, but unless you

01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:29.475
count the chemistry we showed
you earlier for how the PDH

01:06:29.475 --> 01:06:31.350
and alpha ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:35.610
reactions work with E1, E2
and E3, with lipoic acid, FAD.

01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:37.300
That was obviously
new for today.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.600
But other than that,
everything else

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.240
was chemistry that
you've already seen.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.890
And this really
points out the point

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:47.460
that I made earlier, that
metabolism is really variations

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.230
on relatively few reactions.

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:52.630
We've just repurposed some of
the same tricks, if you will,

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:55.700
that we're used in
glycolysis, and allowed

01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:00.090
it to now do an entire different
pathway, the TCA cycle.

01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:02.870
It also points out how Hans
Krebs was-- well, is still--

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:06.530
remarkable, able to figure
out from chemistry alone,

01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:09.410
because there's actually quite
a bit of logic to the way

01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:12.030
metabolism works.

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:13.280
Now, I want to say this again.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.280
Note there were two carbons
that entered acetyl-CoA,

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.050
and two carbons that
were lost to CO2.

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:22.690
But if you look,
the green carbons

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:27.190
remain in the same places
until they get to succinate.

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:29.320
and so the two
carbons that enter

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.350
are not lost on the
first turn of the cycle.

01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:37.810
It's actually two carbons
that came from oxaloacetate

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:42.220
that are converted to CO2
as that acetyl-CoA goes

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:43.340
through the cycle.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:47.920
And so to oxidize the exact
carbons from acetyl-CoA to CO2

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.220
requires more than
one turn of the cycle.

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:57.660
You'll also notice that
the cycle is oxidation.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.670
And so oxidation reactions,
of course, release energy.

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:02.670
We've talked about that.

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:05.070
And so it's favorable.

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:12.035
And the products, if you will,
are three NADH molecules.

01:08:12.035 --> 01:08:16.500
You can say plus one more NADH
if we're going all the way

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:21.029
from glucose or from pyruvate.

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:24.120
Glucose derived pyruvate because
the pyruvate dehydrogenase

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:29.649
reaction also generates an
NADH to make that a acetyl-CoA.

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:38.359
One FADH2, as well
as one GTP molecule.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:41.569
And so lots of
oxidation going on here.

01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:44.350
We completely oxidized
two carbons to CO2,

01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:47.229
so that's energy release.

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:52.279
But you notice you only get
one GTP from the molecule.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:55.510
Now, this GTP, of
course-- that reaction,

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:57.939
the succinic
thiokinase reaction,

01:08:57.939 --> 01:09:00.010
like the reactions
we saw on glycolysis,

01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:04.540
is such that it can generate
GTP at a high DGP-GDP

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.218
ratio, or ATP-ADP ratio.

01:09:06.218 --> 01:09:07.510
Remember, those are equivalent.

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:10.899
Those energy charge are similar,
and so that makes sense.

01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:15.250
But most of the energy
released is actually

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:19.960
reducing NAD and FAD
to NADH and FADH2.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.300
And of course, these need
to transfer their electrons

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.420
somewhere else, and
that's the role of oxygen.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.250
Oxygen, remember, is a
very good electron donor,

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.479
and so it's the ultimate
transfer of those electrons

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:40.750
from these molecules to oxygen
that also provide energy

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:44.740
that the cell can use to do
work, but it does so, in a way,

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:49.910
by charging up different
ratios in the cell.

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:56.830
So the NAD-NADH or
the FADH2-FAD ratios.

01:09:56.830 --> 01:10:02.020
And just like we talked about,
the ratio or the energy of ATP

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:05.170
is in the interconversion
between ATP and ADP.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:09.190
It's the ratio that drives
the free energy change.

01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:13.780
The same thing exists for an
NADH and NAD, FADH2 and FAD.

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:16.990
And so charging up these ratios
while passing through the TCA

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:19.810
cycle, and the ultimate
downstream transfer

01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:22.540
of those electrons
to oxygen, really

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:26.650
is where most of the energy
is captured as carbon

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:30.220
is oxidized through
the TCA cycle.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:35.080
And exactly how that works and
how it can be related to ATP

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.750
will be something that'll be
more explicit in the coming

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.300
lectures.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.200
Now, I want to point out
apart from the oxidation,

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.360
there's actually lots of
intermediates made here.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.450
And it turns out, a bunch
of these intermediates

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:51.610
are useful for
cells to make stuff.

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:53.250
So we talked about
gluconeogenesis.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.170
Gluconeogenesis needs
electron balance.

01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:58.140
We get NADH from the
TCA cycle, and so you

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.290
can think of gluconeogenesis
as an alternative

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.440
to fermentation to
dispose of electrons.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.000
Well, you can use the
NADH from the TCA cycle

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.980
to run gluconeogenesis as well.

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.620
But beyond the cofactors,
the carbon itself.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:14.460
So citrate, I've alluded
to now a few times,

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:17.130
is important as a
precursor to make fat.

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:19.620
We'll discuss that in
later lectures, too.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.710
But other intermediates
in this pathway

01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:26.710
are useful for various amino
acids and nucleic acids.

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:29.340
And so there's
lots of things that

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:32.490
can come from the
TCA cycle that cells

01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:37.840
can find useful to do,
not just catabolism,

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.880
but also anabolic processes.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.090
Now, the way the TCA
cycle works, though,

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:48.660
is that there's
actually an issue

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.140
if you want to use the
intermediates from the TCA

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:55.120
cycle to make stuff.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.890
And so what is that issue?

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:05.418
Well, the TCA cycle functions
at a site as a cycle.

01:12:05.418 --> 01:12:07.710
And so, if we're going to
take things in and out of it,

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:11.730
that has consequences
for how the cycle runs.

01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:14.740
Now there's a couple
words for this

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:17.200
that I want to just
introduce to you.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.370
The first one is cataplerosis
and the second one

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:23.200
is anaplerosis.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:32.680
And so cataplerosis is
the act of removing stuff

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.225
from a metabolic cycle.

01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:39.680
So, we're going
to remove citrate

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.120
from the cycle to make fat.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.860
That's cataplerosis.

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:57.540
And anaplerosis is adding
stuff back to a metabolic cycle

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:01.380
so it can continue to function.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:05.130
Viewing this is really evident
if you think of the TCA cycle

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.330
as a chicken and egg problem.

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:09.670
So, the very first
time acetyl-CoA

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.720
was generated, how
do you start the TCA

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.490
cycle in the first place?

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.800
You can't add it
to the TCA cycle

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.920
unless you have
oxaloacetate to combine

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.050
with the acetyl-CoA,
which can then

01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:25.170
generate another oxaloacetate.

01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:29.500
So where does the first
oxaloacetate come from?

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.560
Well, we already talked
about one reaction.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.040
We talked about it in the
context of gluconeogenesis.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.400
That can solve this problem.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.220
And so we have pyruvate.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.380
And so we talked
earlier today how

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:45.720
we can do oxidative
decarboxylation of pyruvate

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.450
to give acetyl-CoA.

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:50.160
But we talked to in
the gluconeogenesis

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.470
lecture how we can add a
CO2 pyruvate to generate

01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:57.270
oxaloacetate.

01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:59.910
So if I do those
two reactions, now I

01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:06.400
have all the carbon I
need to generate a citrate

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.190
and start off the TCA cycle.

01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:16.130
Now obviously, if
I do cataplerosis

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:19.220
and I remove that citrate
I made to make fat,

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.200
well, now I need
two pyruvate again

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.940
to generate the next citrate
if I'm using this pathway,

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:29.420
because every time I bring
an acetyl-CoA into the cycle,

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.660
I need an oxaloacetate
to combine it with.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.840
And so if I remove something,
I have to add something back.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.740
And so pyruvate to oxaloacetate,
the pyruvate carboxylase

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:45.850
reaction is an example of
an anaplerotic reaction.

01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:49.900
Now what this means,
though, is that in order

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:52.600
to do an anaplerosis,
you have to be

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.950
able to generate
four-carbon oxaloacetate,

01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:59.780
or a four-carbon molecule.

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.590
Now, pyruvate carboxylase,
pyruvate to oxaloacetate,

01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:03.802
allows you to do that.

01:15:03.802 --> 01:15:05.260
We can take a
three-carbon molecule

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.080
and generate four-carbon
oxaloacetate.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.940
However, if we start from
a two-carbon molecule

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:20.210
like acetate or acetyl-CoA
that enters the cycle,

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:24.410
it's actually not so simple to
take that two-carbon molecule

01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:27.350
and turn it into
four-carbon oxaloacetate.

01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:31.070
And in fact, humans
lack any enzymes

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:33.440
that allow them to
take a two-carbon unit,

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.680
to take acetate or
acetyl-CoA, and turn it

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:41.000
into anything that's
longer than net-- turn

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.270
it into anything that's
longer than two carbons.

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:46.100
And this has
important implications

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:49.070
for human physiology,
because what it says

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:52.370
is that we can't make
glucose from anything

01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:56.580
that starts with something
less than three carbons long.

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:59.750
So if you drink alcohol and
you metabolize that alcohol

01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:02.510
to acetate, it turns
out you take fat

01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:05.330
and you break down fat
also to acetyl-CoA,

01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:07.520
to acetate two carbons long.

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:13.460
There is no way to turn
those molecules into glucose,

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.610
because you cannot generate
the oxaloacetate to do

01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:21.480
the anaplerosis that's
necessary to get it there.

01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:30.020
What this means is
that our body can only

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:33.200
store calories that come
from two carbon units,

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.600
fat or alcohol, as fat.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:41.202
We can never turn them back
into glucose or make glycogen.

01:16:41.202 --> 01:16:43.160
And this is very relevant
for those of you that

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.577
go to medical
school, because it's

01:16:44.577 --> 01:16:46.670
relevant to our physiology.

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:48.710
And that is, when
our bodies exhaust

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:51.320
all of our stores of
glucose, what happens?

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.140
Our liver can no longer
do gluconeogenesis.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.130
And so what happens?

01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:57.450
Now it has to switch over
to doing something else.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:59.370
It has to work with
two carbon units.

01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:02.150
And ultimately, this is
ketone metabolism, which we'll

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:05.600
talk about in a few lectures.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.655
It also said that the body--

01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:15.060
that this is also the basis
of a very old adage that's

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:17.280
out there that some of
you may have heard--

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.220
that you need to have
some other fuel if you're

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.260
going to burn fat.

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:25.740
The basis for that is that
fat is turned into two carbon

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.840
units, acetyl-CoA units.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.180
And so if you're going to
take those acetyl-CoA units

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.090
and ultimately burn them
away, turn them into CO2,

01:17:33.090 --> 01:17:35.190
you need a source
of oxaloacetate,

01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:37.590
or your TCA cycle won't work.

01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:40.290
And you don't need a lot of
something, but it is true.

01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:45.000
You can't start just with
acetyl-CoA as a human and turn

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.860
it into CO2, so you need some--

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.200
at least a little
bit of oxaloacetate

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.410
to get your TCA cycle started.

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:57.335
Now, that's a problem that we as
humans and other mammals face,

01:17:57.335 --> 01:17:59.460
but it turns out there's
lots of microbes out there

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.880
that grow just fine on
acetate or on alcohol,

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.980
even if it's only carbon source.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:08.550
And so those organisms
must have some way

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.830
to build stuff from
two carbon units.

01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:15.280
That is a way to use two carbon
units and do an anaplerosis.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.610
And it turns out the way
they do this is via something

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.410
called the glyoxylate cycle.

01:18:23.050 --> 01:18:26.220
And so the glyoxylate cycle
is an alternative version

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:29.610
of the TCA cycle that
effectively uses two enzymes

01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:32.010
that we lack as mammals.

01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:34.230
And so I'll quickly
tell you about it here.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:57.420
So, this is isocitrate
from the TCA cycle.

01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:08.270
And some microbes have an
enzyme called isocitrate lyase.

01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:18.430
And what isocitrate lyase does
is basically splits citrate

01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:23.260
in half, such that the top
portion of the molecule

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:30.190
is another TCA cycle
intermediate, succinate.

01:19:30.190 --> 01:19:34.150
And the bottom
portion of a molecule

01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:42.850
is this two carbon
aldehyde called glyoxylate.

01:19:42.850 --> 01:20:00.890
Glyoxylate can react with
acetyl-CoA by another enzyme

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:08.390
that we lack as humans
called malate synthase.

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:14.880
And I don't have time to
show the mechanism again,

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.160
but malate synthase basically
adds the two carbons

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:26.180
from acetyl-CoA to the
aldehyde, the carbonyl,

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.900
the aldehyde carbonyl of
glyoxylate in a reaction that

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:33.620
is, for all intents and
purposes, exactly what happens

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.050
in citrate synthase.

01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:51.930
That will generate this
molecule, which is malate, also

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.370
in the TCA cycle.

01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:57.990
And so having these two extra
reactions, isocitrate lyase

01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:01.920
and malate synthase,
gives microbes

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:08.040
the ability to have
acetyl-CoA be anaplerotic.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.450
And so how does that work?

01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:15.840
Well, that's because if we start
with one oxaloacetate, four

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:26.400
carbons, and acetyl-CoA, two
carbons, can run the TCA cycle

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:31.110
and make citrate, six carbons.

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:33.884
Turn that citrate
into isocitrate.

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:49.090
Use isocitrate lyase to generate
glyoxylate, two carbons.

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:51.550
Plus succinate.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:22:02.070
That succinate can run through
succinate dehydrogenase

01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:04.050
to generate malate,
which you can

01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:08.190
go through malate dehydrogenase
to generate oxaloacetate.

01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:15.930
This glyoxylate can start
with a second acetyl-CoA.

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.890
Two carbons come
together, generate malate.

01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:22.770
That generates a
second malate molecule,

01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:30.180
which can then exit the cycle
as malate or oxaloacetate

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:32.130
or whatever you want.

01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:36.420
And so basically, it allows
two acetyl-CoAs to net

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:41.040
generate an oxaloacetate,
and so net generates a way

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.090
to do an anaplerosis
from two carbon units

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:51.160
by having this malate
synthase reaction

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:57.360
and this isocitrate
lyase reaction

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.930
and run this alternative
version of the TCA cycle,

01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:03.990
called the glyoxylate cycle.

01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:08.100
And it's a nice way how life--
again, no new chemistry here,

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:10.740
just variations on what
we've already shown--

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.690
repurposed the
similar chemistries

01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:16.620
that it's already using
as a way to live off

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:24.540
of carbon sources that contain
only two carbons, like ethanol

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:27.350
or acetate.

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:31.400
So in closing today,
the last thing

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.430
I want to talk
about, very briefly,

01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:40.610
is how the TCA
cycle is regulated.

01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:42.620
And we don't need to
spend a ton of time

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:48.710
on this, because it really
follows principles that

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:54.340
make sense, particularly when
we think about things that we've

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:55.820
already talk about.

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:59.800
And so, regulation of the TCA
cycles is of course important,

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.430
and it's really a critical hub,
both for anabolic and catabolic

01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.950
pathways.

01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:06.940
So, you needed to get energy
to fully oxidize carbon,

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:10.252
but it's also a useful
place to get stuff.

01:24:10.252 --> 01:24:11.710
And before I talk
about regulation,

01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:14.590
I just want to point out that
many of the enzymes in the TCA

01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:17.650
cycle, even though we talk
about it in the mitochondria

01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:19.990
and we're about to talk
about regulation in terms

01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:22.660
of catabolism--
that is oxidation,

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:25.060
ways to release energy--

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.700
many of these enzymes are
also in other locations

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:32.170
in the cell, because there's
functions for them in making

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:35.020
stuff that is very different
than what goes on in the TCA

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.010
cycle.

01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:39.460
And the regulation that
I'll tell you about,

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:42.280
and that comes up on
MCAT exams and stuff

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.460
like that, usually
talks about this pathway

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:49.940
as a catabolic pathway, as a
way to make CO2, to make ATP.

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:53.380
However, recognize
that there's also

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:57.610
variations on this pathway that
can use in anabolic things,

01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:58.720
making stuff.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.700
And that regulation is something
that really is not necessarily

01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:05.590
what we're going
to talk about here

01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:09.790
and is a little bit
less well-understood.

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:11.530
But at least the
regulation, in terms

01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:18.920
of catabolism, if we put it in
context of glucose metabolism--

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:25.890
so here's glycolysis, turning
glucose into pyruvate.

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:35.550
And then that
pyruvate can operate

01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:40.290
through the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction

01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:44.430
to generate acetyl-CoA.

01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:50.190
That acetyl-CoA can
combine with oxaloacetate

01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:53.782
to generate citrate.

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:57.530
That citrate, of course,
can be used to generate fat,

01:25:57.530 --> 01:26:00.400
as we've talked about.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.080
That can go to isocitrate.

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:09.270
Isocitrate to alpha
ketoglutarate.

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:13.500
That's catalyzed by
isocitrate dehydrogenase,

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.630
which I will abbreviate IDH.

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:19.750
Alpha ketoglutarate
to succinate.

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:30.830
More correctly, to succinyl-CoA
by alpha ketoglutarate

01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:35.240
dehydrogenase, Alpha KGDH.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.150
And then this back
to oxaloacetate.

01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:41.210
And so the main enzymes
that are typically

01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:45.130
discussed as being regulated
are alpha ketoglutarate

01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:48.110
dehydrogenase,
isocitrate dehydrogenase,

01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:50.180
and pyruvate dehydrogenase.

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:53.190
I also drew glycolysis.

01:26:53.190 --> 01:26:58.260
And I'll just write over
here, gluconeogenesis up here,

01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:04.570
because we can now see
more fully how this plays

01:27:04.570 --> 01:27:09.760
in with citrate acting
as a positive regulator

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:15.830
with gluconeogenesis and
an inhibitor of glycolysis.

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:21.410
Again, we're full in citrate,
stop running glycolysis,

01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:24.950
start running gluconeogenesis.

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:26.690
Now, the other regulation.

01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:30.080
If you have a lot of
acetyl-CoA, stop making it

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:34.820
from pyruvate. acetyl-CoA is
a negative regulator of PDH.

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.550
This is carbon oxidation.

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:41.030
Releases a lot of energy,
generates a lot of ATP,

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:44.150
generates a lot of NADH.

01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:46.010
If you have lots
of those things,

01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:49.390
no reason to keep
sending carbon into

01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:52.960
acetyl-CoA to go
into the TCA cycle.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.733
Ultimately, we have to send
those electrons somewhere.

01:27:56.733 --> 01:27:58.150
So if there's
nowhere to put them,

01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:02.500
low oxygen also inhibits
pyruvate dehydrogenase.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:06.670
And of course, if you need
more energy, if ADP is high,

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:10.000
that activates
pyruvate dehydrogenase.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.320
So at least in terms of glucose,
complete glucose oxidation,

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.280
a lot of regulation happens
at pyruvate dehydrogenase.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.050
And a lot of it
really makes sense.

01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:27.450
High levels of ATP,
high levels of NADH,

01:28:27.450 --> 01:28:34.170
also inhibit isocitrate
dehydrogenase and alpha

01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:38.690
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:39.840
Makes sense.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:44.990
Succinol-CoA high, inhibit alpha
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:52.220
High levels of ADP, need
to release more energy,

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.300
activate alpha
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:02.030
Again, these are the feedbacks
that people talk about

01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:03.590
on board exams.

01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:06.230
Good to know, but you can
almost guess what they

01:29:06.230 --> 01:29:08.210
would be from first principles.

01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:09.800
Because remember,
this is a pathway

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:11.660
that releases a lot of energy.

01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:14.870
High energy high
ATP, high NADH--

01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:18.170
don't run the cycle, don't
enter carbon in the cycle.

01:29:18.170 --> 01:29:23.900
Low energy, high ADP,
put carbon in the cycle,

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.760
run the cycle faster.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:26.900
Makes sense.

01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:29.480
Also makes sense of the
reciprocal regulation

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:33.060
of glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis.

01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:33.560
Great.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:38.120
Next time, we will
talk more about

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:46.760
how we can oxidize fatty acids,
fat, by accessing acetyl-CoA

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.380
and entering it into the cycle.

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:49.930
Thanks.

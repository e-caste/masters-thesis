00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.120
PROFESSOR: So welcome to
Lean Thinking Part II.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.840
We're essentially
going to pick up

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.930
where we left off last
time in discussing

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.540
the Lean framework of thinking
about value, the value stream,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.370
flow, pull, and perfection.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.830
Hopefully the video gave
you some real active sort

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.500
of visual representations of
what some of these concepts

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.280
might mean.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490
So let's talk about flow.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.258
We would like, if we
have a value stream--

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:55.550
this is a patient value stream.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.380
We have people
coming in and going

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.800
through diagnostic procedures,
and hopefully leaving in better

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.240
shape than they came in.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.152
And we would like to
create flow in this system.

00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:06.860
We have to think about
a bunch of things.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.410
We obviously want to
focus on what is flowing.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.090
Again, the value stream map is
a map that looks at the product,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.910
in this case, the patient
flowing through the process.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.450
We don't want to be limited
by organizational or people

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.950
boundaries.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.490
It's not a value stream map if
it follows organizational work

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.990
or an individual's work.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.650
It's really about the product.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.600
And first order, we
want to make sure

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.010
that there's the minimum amount
of buffers in there, inventory.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.630
Here's a waiting
room full of people.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.460
That's not flow, right?

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.090
And it's interesting to me,
as a non-medical professional,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.160
to just sort of observe things
from a Lean perspective.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.690
I have had both good and bad
experiences as a patient,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.190
or the parent of patients.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.400
Sometimes it's this.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.370
You're sitting in the waiting
room for five or six hours.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.180
And sometimes it isn't.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.360
I've had sort of
astonishing experiences

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.980
with well-organized
medical facilities, where

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.990
literally once, I didn't
have time to sit down.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.670
They gave me a little
form to fill out,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.100
and before I had finished
filling out the form,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.290
they were calling my
name to see the doctor.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.920
It was it was a well-organized
system that had flow.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.350
But bottlenecks are
going to slow that down.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.780
Buffers, essentially the same.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.270
Wait time in between steps.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.560
Sometimes that's necessary.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.230
You have an expensive
facility like a CAT scanner.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.238
You're not going to risk
not using that facility,

00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:42.030
so people are going to
have to wait for it.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.430
But to achieve flow, you
need to minimize that.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.980
And one of the key
things to think about

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.290
is time it's an
essential metric.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.270
Our discussion today
is going to really

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.440
be about how do we
measure and define time.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.180
Time is sort of
an obvious thing.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.030
But when you start thinking
about measuring and defining

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.000
it, it does get a
little bit complicated.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.730
You have to think
about it carefully.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.420
And the key is really to
understand the definition

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.830
of how the time is measured.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.970
And one of the problems here
is that the terminology--

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.010
there's some terminology here--

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.190
is not standardized.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.870
So in different fields,
industrial engineers and supply

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.450
chain people will talk about
things using the same words.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.310
They mean different things.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.190
Sometimes the words are used
in a way that isn't intuitive.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.200
So rather than try to
teach you the jargon

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.050
of any particular field, what
we're going to ask you to do

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.280
is think about time and
make sure you understand

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.620
and communicate your
definitions of time.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.870
And we'll actually have a
little exercise about that.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.710
So wait time.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.840
That's relatively simple.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.660
If something is just sitting
there, it is waiting.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.460
So there is work in progress.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.960
The work that you're trying
to do is not moving forward.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.980
That's wait time.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.140
And it's also called
queue time, delay time.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.630
Again, the terminology
isn't particularly standard.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.737
The concept is pretty easy
to understand, though.

00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:06.070
Processing time, on the other
hand, is a little bit more

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.670
complicated.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.990
So now something is happening
to the work product.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.180
Some sort of resources
are being consumed.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.830
Maybe a person is working on it.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.570
Maybe a machine
is working on it.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.180
And that could be value
added or non-value added.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.950
It could be an active or
relatively passive use.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.510
There are multiple names for it.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.860
Touch time-- I kind
of like touch time

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.740
because it's
intuitive-- means, in,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.440
for example, engineering
or health care work--

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.780
someone is working on it.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.150
Both of those fields are
very people intensive.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.160
If somebody is working
with the patient

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.400
or working with the diagnosis
or working with the engineering

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.890
drawing, that's touch time.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.100
It's also sometimes called
in process time or response

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.730
time in the sense of how
quickly can the people respond

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.330
to a demand that they
get something done.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.692
And these things tend
to pile up in ways that

00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:01.900
are kind of illustrated here.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.120
In a simple case, if you had
some work you need to get done,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.370
well, first it waits.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.010
Question.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] there
was an oven [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.072
shoes, and you
heat the thing up,

00:05:14.072 --> 00:05:16.130
but then you would open
the oven to let it sit

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.200
and not touch it because
it was cooling off.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.058
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:05:20.058 --> 00:05:20.600
That's right.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.560
That's classic, right?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.260
OK, so is that wait time
because it's cooling off?

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.060
But it's occupying the oven.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.272
It's not touch time.

00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:29.480
The guy is not working on it.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.400
He can go do something else.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.860
But the equipment is used.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.910
So that's classic.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.740
And I don't have an
easy answer for you.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.240
It depends on what
you're measuring.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.370
If you're measuring
the equipment,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.510
how many ovens do we need?

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.680
You better account
for that cooling

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.680
because they probably
don't want to yank it out.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.580
It'll cool too fast.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.550
So if your concern is the
oven, you got to count that.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.860
If your concern is the worker,
that part doesn't count.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.450
If your concern is the shoe,
it's in process in some way.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.610
It's cooling off.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.890
You can't say that's
wait time because you

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.320
can't make that go faster.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.450
Another classic one is painting.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.010
You can't make paint dry faster.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.640
Well, you can.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.250
You can blast hot air on
it, but that may or may not

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.920
be a good thing.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.350
And that's exactly what I'm
trying to get across here,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.150
is that the time has a lot of
sort of unexpected complexity

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.860
when you're looking
at these things,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.030
and you have to think
pretty straight about it.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.150
So you could be
waiting, you could

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.650
be doing value added
work, you could

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.560
be non-value added, but
still in processing.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.270
We stuck the glue on.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.770
Now we're cooling off.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.170
We're still using the oven.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.590
We can't leave the oven, but
it's not really value added.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.340
Maybe we could do that
in a different way.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.740
Maybe it's necessary
non-value added.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.110
Maybe we'll call that yellow.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.640
At some point the
processing ends

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.310
and we go back into inventory,
and we're waiting again.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.400
Sort of imagine that cycle
repeated lots of times

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.770
to finish our overall process.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.280
And cycle time is
our overall time.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.160
There isn't a whole lot of
confusion about cycle time

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.210
means overall time,
wait plus processing.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.928
There's some other names for it.

00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:11.720
The thing you have to
really watch out for,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.690
cycle time is cycle of what?

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.220
It could be the
cycle of a machine,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.900
ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunk.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.250
That's seconds.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.070
It could be cycle of the
overall shoe manufacturing

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.190
process, which, in New
Balance, was an amazingly short

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.810
three days.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.140
But in aeronautical,
engineering, cycle time

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.083
of an aircraft life
cycle, 20 years.

00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:35.000
Cycle time can mean a
lot of different things.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.750
You've got to just define
your boundaries very carefully

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.340
when you're talking
about cycle time.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.860
So now we have a
little exercise.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.800
We're going to ask you to tackle
some of these complexities.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.280
I hope everybody held
on to this sheet.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.980
You were using this before.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.170
We call it 5Sing
out of existence.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.550
You clean up something
you really need,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.900
and then it's gone.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.730
I hope that didn't
happen because now we're

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.590
going to look at
the times, and we're

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.160
going to do a little exercise.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.150
We're going to add up the
overall cycle time of an order

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.800
from the time the
customer walks up

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.660
to the time they
get their hot dog.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.090
The tricky thing is
these times are not

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.460
necessarily in the right units.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.910
Make sure everything is
converted to time per order.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.800
Is it time for a hot dog?

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.760
Subtle.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.960
What's the average order?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.660
Does anybody remember?

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.510
Two hot dogs, right?

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.190
And we got to
worry about rework.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.120
There's some percentage
chance- we're

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.120
looking at the average--
there's some percentage

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.630
chance that things are going
to have to be done over.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.750
So this actually
gets pretty well

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.490
at how tricky this
can sometimes be.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:44.990
so?

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.530
Try to normalize the times,
sum them up, and use the sheet.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.450
This is actually
a group exercise.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.280
If you guys want to
divide and conquer,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.760
or if you just want to
see what people get,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.560
whatever, whatever strategy
you want to take to puzzle

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.370
this out is fine.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.410
But you only have a
little under 10 minutes.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.180
Why don't we give
it till, like, three

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.950
after to do this exercise?

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.040
AUDIENCE: I see
what you're saying.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.860
It shouldn't take 20 seconds
to put a hot dog in a bun.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.930
So 20 seconds to put it in the
bun, and then about 10 seconds

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.550
putting it [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.600
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.130
That's how I interpret it.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.400
PROFESSOR: All righty,
what do we got?

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.950
One of the fun things
about this class

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:41.280
is our sort of unintentional
experimenting and work styles.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.550
Some people were
just doing away.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.880
Other people were talking
waving their arms and stuff.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.570
It was interesting.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.760
Let's see if what
this process yielded.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:00.150
I'm numbering you guys
M1-3 and E1 and 2.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.100
So first medical option table.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.030
What do you got?

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.620
449.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.180
OK.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.560
Interesting.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.660
M2.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.440
393.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:19.940
OK.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.850
What do you guys got?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.330
You have different things.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.710
Give me a sample.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.537
See, this is the table
that didn't talk.

00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:32.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
around 300.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.200
PROFESSOR: Around 300.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.490
OK.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.650
Plus or minus.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.220
All right.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.560
And E2.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.820
432.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.600
OK.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.260
There we go.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.470
There we go.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.720
So we didn't exactly agree.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.300
We're going to give you
guys sort of an answer sheet

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.820
later so you can figure out.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.960
But it sort of
illustrates the issue

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.240
of the squirminess of this.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.480
It's a very simple process.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.897
We gave you the times.

00:11:07.897 --> 00:11:09.480
But how do you
interpret them exactly?

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.522
How do you do the rework?

00:11:10.522 --> 00:11:12.300
Do you average that in?

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.190
Probably the most
reasonable thing to do

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.030
would be to add 10% to
all of the things that

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.550
might have to be done over.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.740
But there's actually a
couple of do over loops,

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.170
so do you add 20% to that one?

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.980
I'm not sure.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.440
You could interpret that a
couple of different ways.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.940
More importantly, or
more significantly--

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.770
it has a bigger impact
on the numbers--

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.360
what do you do with
the stuff that's

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.570
kind of off the main process
loop there, the cleanup?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.590
Do e you average that and
put it in as a sort of tax

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.600
against each hot dog order?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.060
Or do you say nah, they'll
do that when it's quiet.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.950
It shouldn't count.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.320
And that's probably the
difference between the people

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.520
that we're up above 400 and
the people down around 300.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.210
Does that make sense?

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.150
I have the 300 people
were leaving that out

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:05.220
because otherwise it's hard
to get a number that small.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.170
This is pretty much--

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.500
that's somehow one second
higher than the number

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.430
you get if you add 10%
to everything and tax

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.350
with the cleanup.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.840
So that's real close
to that number.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.750
So there's different ways to do
it, and they're all legitimate.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.920
But it gives you a feel for how
this is not an exact science.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.900
And again, if we wanted
to get more exact,

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.160
we would have to go
to the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.720
We might have to stand
there with a stopwatch

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.220
and watch the
customers come and go,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.790
and see what
actually does happen.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.733
For example, the cleanup issue.

00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:43.650
Do they really have time
to do it on the side,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.480
or do they have to
actually make customers

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.590
wait while they do that?

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.330
You don't know
until you go look.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:54.812
So again, an illustration in
how this can be a little tricky.

00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:56.520
And we're going to go
even deeper on this

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.670
later this afternoon.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.150
But for now, that
exercise is done.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.310
Just an explanation
of something we've

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.610
had kind of across the bottom
as an icon for a while.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.590
These things are called
time value charts.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.530
They're useful if you
want to make broad points

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.960
about the use of time.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.210
This is a typical
example, in a lot of ways.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.870
Here's a process
that takes a while.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.870
Apparently there are
two spans of four days

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.250
of solid work in this process,
as well as a lot of wait time

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.625
and a lot of non-value
added working time.

00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:32.500
One of the key things
that this kind of chart

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.743
will tell you about
almost any process--

00:13:34.743 --> 00:13:36.910
it's very bizarre if you
come up with a process that

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.260
isn't this way--

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.990
is that the big time savings
are in the wait times

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.030
and the non-value added times.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:51.700
And people were talking about
the issue of standardizing work

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.790
and eliminating creativity.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:14:00.610
What I always tell the engineers
is this is you doing your work.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.130
We almost don't care how
you do it because it's

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.890
a tiny percentage of the time.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.140
To keep the customers happy,
we got to take this out

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.640
and we've got to take this out
, and that's what we're going

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.860
to worry about.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.480
And in a way, the same
goes with medical care.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.800
A lot of the customer
dissatisfaction

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.940
comes from this kind of stuff.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.500
If my son gets injured, I
take him to the hospital.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.430
I was absolutely delighted
with the 45 seconds of care

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.590
that he received in
our nine-hour visit.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.740
So I was not going to tell
the old male nurse who

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.310
was really good at
stitches how to do his job.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.070
I was delighted with his job.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.620
But there was a bunch of
other processes involved

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.270
in that particular
experience that

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.880
could have used
improvement, which gets

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.980
to the issue of pulling value.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.660
I was the customer there.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.240
I didn't really perceive
value pull in that experience,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.160
although I've had
some where I did.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.587
So what does this mean?

00:15:02.587 --> 00:15:04.170
This is a kind of a
difficult concept,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.908
and it exists on a
couple of scales.

00:15:06.908 --> 00:15:08.700
Sometimes the easiest
way to think about it

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.110
is to think of its opposite.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.160
A push system is an
old-fashioned mass production

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.960
system where what
you're trying to do

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.160
is optimize the
productivity of each step.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.680
What that means is we
set up our machine,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.608
or we set up our process,
and we push a lot of material

00:15:26.608 --> 00:15:28.650
through it because that
is the most efficient way

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.710
to do most things is
to set something up

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.230
and then just bang
stuff through it.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.300
And people sort of
intuitively understand that.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.640
There was a question of why
don't we just automate it?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.880
Well, to automate something,
you have to set up a process,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.620
buy expensive
equipment, and then

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.830
when you're all done after
doing all that prep work, voom,

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.810
the shoes just fly
out the end, and you

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.460
can build huge piles of them.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.440
But then the question
is, do people want them?

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.970
Are they good?

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.170
Is there quality issues?

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.230
Is there issues if you
want to change the style,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.320
how hard is that to do?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.670
So that's a push system.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.680
A pull system is kind of the
conceptual opposite of that.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.440
Stuff only happens if
the customers want it,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.750
and it happens,
hopefully, quickly enough

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.480
that the customer is
satisfied by the process.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.270
So it's triggered
by the customer.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.090
And that is what New
Balance is really

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.700
striving for they had
a three-day turnaround.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.230
So the shoe store ordered
shoes, and in three days

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.350
the shoes were manufactured
all the way from raw materials

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.790
and sent to the shoe store.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:37.320
This both results in and
necessitates a smooth flow

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.670
with relatively modest batches
and relatively small wait time,

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.500
or it doesn't work.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.333
So as sort of an ideal,
it's worth trying for.

00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:48.000
And inherently there's
very little waste

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.800
in that kind of system.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.100
Trouble is, of course,
that's relatively hard to do.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.900
So let's think
about what we need

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.340
to do to do a pull system
like we saw at New Balance.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.990
Pretty much requires flow.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.700
You don't have to
have perfect flow,

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.130
but if you don't have a system
that flows reasonably well,

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.200
it's very hard to
make it a pull system.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.349
And you would like to have a
fairly predictable cycle time.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.400
Here's a bunch of tools.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.319
We're going to get
into those in a while.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.380
The point, really, with this
slide is that to have pull,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.440
you need if not all of
these, most of them.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.089
You have to have a
pretty Lean system.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.480
And again, we'll get
into what those are.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.780
And a pull system starts with
the customer, and essentially

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.780
the signals work backwards
through the system.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.920
What does that mean?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.810
From the customer's
point of view,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.840
it means that either
the cycle time

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.180
is lower than my
expectation for when

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.100
my product will be
delivered or when

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.600
my service will be delivered.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.360
Or there's inventory
in the system.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.540
As a for example, I ordered
a computer a while ago,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.980
that computer right there.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.133
And I sort of mentally
budgeted a couple weeks.

00:17:53.133 --> 00:17:55.050
You get the new computer,
put the files on it,

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.420
get used to the system.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.730
I ordered it online.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:05.970
And it came in from China
in less than 48 hours,

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.230
less than two days.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.300
So to me, that
was a pull system.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.420
It was way inside
my expectations.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.240
So as far as it felt, I
wanted it and it came.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.498
So that's a very nice system.

00:18:20.498 --> 00:18:22.290
The system was actually
originally invented

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.220
by Dell Computer.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.690
Apple's really good at it.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.570
Dell still is, actually,
although interestingly,

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:32.160
their market has shifted more
to servers and industrial uses

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.190
of computers than consumers.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.640
But they were one of
the original inventors

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.640
of essentially ordering
something on the web,

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.790
and then having it built
for you in a process that's

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.710
not really automated,
but the process

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.680
itself creates your computer.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.810
People don't think
about the McManus order.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.670
It's just you order
that computer.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.410
It goes into the system.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:59.560
That initiates the
production of the computer,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.520
which goes very fast so
it can ship the same day.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.140
And then they have a really
nice supply chain operation

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.950
so it can come all the way
from China in about 24 hours,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.320
and you get your computer.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.320
This has become pretty standard
for a lot of consumer products.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.940
So the bar has gone up.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.540
People are no longer
mega impressed by this,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.310
but it's actually
pretty impressive

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.810
that people can do that
on the customer end.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.930
A very useful concept
when thinking about pull

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.720
is takt time.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.930
If I want one, I'm really
thinking about what's

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.880
the cycle time I expect?

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.080
I want a computer
inside of a week,

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.530
so if I get it in two
days, I'm delighted.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.440
But if I'm Dell's
current customers--

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.850
they're people like Google--

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.780
and I want 100,000
computers, then

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.280
what we have to
start thinking about

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.350
is what is the pace
at which I want

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.268
those computers to show up?

00:19:54.268 --> 00:19:56.310
And that's a really simple
calculation, actually,

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.740
and one that's very
much worth doing even

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.400
in processes that are less
predictable than production.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.900
Things like engineering
and hospital

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.370
processes, this is
actually very useful to do,

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.850
which is to just think about
what's your available time--

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.010
a day, a week, a
year, whatever it is--

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.250
and what is the customer
demand during that time.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:22.680
So if I have a day and I
have to see 16 patients,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.260
what's my takt time?

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.620
Eight hour day, 16
patients, half hour.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.920
If I'm not seeing a patient
every half hour, I'm behind.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.790
It's not rocket
science, but it's

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.970
a way of understanding what
the customer demand is,

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.540
and if I hope to have anything
resembling a pull system, what

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.150
kind of time constraints
I have to stay within.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.160
So that's a very simple
calculation here,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.250
which is basically
the same one that we

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.360
did for our medical example.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:59.870
This is for 40 orders across
a year of 235 working days.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.940
Same idea.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.980
This is basically
what is the pace

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.430
at which we need to do work
to satisfy the customer need?

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.500
AUDIENCE: So that's presuming
that this is like on average.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.220
But what if all 40 orders
came in on the same day?

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:16.940
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.200
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.930
Takt time is an average.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.640
The issue of irregularity we're
going to explore a little later

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.690
in the class.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.910
It definitely makes
things harder.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.920
On the other hand, if
you're dead on average,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.130
then no amount of variation
is going to help you.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.870
Variation almost
never helps you.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.850
So you start here.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.570
But yeah, there is
that issue of what if--

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.503
sorry for the aside, but
I was visiting Walmart,

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:45.920
one of their
distribution centers.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.360
They have an awesome
supply chain.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.100
They're very, very
good at what they do.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.550
They had this enormous warehouse
in the middle of nowhere

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.450
with about a cubic mile
of lawn mowers in it.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.040
I exaggerate a little
bit, but I think

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.347
it was a good chunk of a mile
long, only maybe 100 feet wide,

00:22:04.347 --> 00:22:06.930
and as many lawn mowers as you
could stack before they started

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.220
crushing each other.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.480
Not very Lean, right?

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.670
But that's because everyone
wants a lawn mower when?

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.700
Yeah, like May, right?

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.750
So sometimes you're
just screwed.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:26.070
But on the other
hand, the reason

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.500
that they stack the lawn
mowers up into the big cube

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.780
is because the lawn mower
factory was working to takt.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.430
They just figured out,
over the whole year,

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.680
how many lawn mowers they did.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.940
And they were just banging
them out real efficiently

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.860
at that rate, and
they just decided

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.080
that the best thing
to do, although they

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.690
weren't happy about it, was
to pile them up and sell them

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.470
all in May.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.870
So the takt still, actually,
over a year, made sense.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.090
Just happened that they had
to keep them all until May.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.590
OK.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.780
So what's our takt time
at our hot dog stand?

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.717
If we had 50 customers,
what would our takt time be?

00:22:59.717 --> 00:23:02.050
Somebody that's got a calculator
they can bang that out?

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.010
Four hours, which is some
number of minutes, which

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.630
is some number of seconds.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.470
12.5 customers per hour.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.460
So how many hours per customer?

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.290
And let's try to
express that in seconds.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:15.790
Let's see.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.790
We got 240 minutes.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.620
So we got about four
and 1/2 minutes.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.880
How many seconds is that?

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.100
Can somebody
multiply that by 60?

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.505
280 seconds.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.500
All right.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.050
And if we wanted 75 customers,
we'd need even less 192.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:35.810
OK.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.850
That's for 50.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.290
192.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:47.700
475 So we've computed a
takt time and a cycle time

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.440
for our hot dog stand.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.090
And first order
doesn't look good.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.850
Our cycle time is longer
than our takt time.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:57.510
But that's a little deceptive
because there's two workers.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.870
It takes one hot dog, this
one to order of two hot dogs,

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.750
about this many seconds
to get through the system.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.460
But it's trading off
between two workers.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.820
So we can't just
directly compare those.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.220
Still, it probably makes
us a little nervous

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:16.890
that our takt time, the sort
of average time we have to hit,

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.250
is considerably lower
than the amount of time

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.870
it actually takes.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.510
We'll save that thought
for a little later

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.820
and move on to the
thought of balanced work.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.980
Actually, again, in this
example it's pretty easy.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:32.900
We've got two workers.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.520
If their work is
perfectly balanced,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.150
they're kind of doing
half the work each.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.470
Is that the case?

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.560
Don't know.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.060
OK.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.900
So we have this example
of a product that needs

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.320
to be delivered every six days.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.017
If it takes 30 days to
build, how can we do it?

00:24:52.017 --> 00:24:53.850
Well, one thing we could
do is split the job

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.910
the job up into five pieces.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.940
And then they should
take six days each.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.500
So that would work.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.240
And as unit one goes into
the production there,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.850
it takes a couple of days
to get things started.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.143
Well, [INAUDIBLE] has
taken off by itself.

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:12.810
I don't have to push
the button anymore.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:17.010
Every six days a unit comes out,
so we're making our takt time,

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.930
even though our
cycle time is longer.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.940
But we have five steps, five
workers, five units of work.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.260
And they're balanced.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.130
They take the same.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:31.920
If one of those processes took
eight days, would that work?

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.640
No.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.020
It would take eight days.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.800
get The takt time would
basically go to eight days.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.660
So again, not rocket
science, fairly simple.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.057
But if we look at
existing processes,

00:25:43.057 --> 00:25:44.640
if we're plotting
this out, it's easy.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.020
If we look at
existing processes,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.820
they're very rarely balanced.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.330
There usually is a
bottleneck process

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.420
or a problem where
one step takes longer

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.020
than some of the other ones.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.410
So balance is a key concept.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:59.110
Standard work.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.230
We've talked quite
a lot about the fact

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:07.200
that if we can't
standardize work, then

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.970
it's very difficult
to improve it.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.840
Single piece flow is a key
concept that's kind of integral

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.990
to the idea of pull, that we're
processing one unit at a time,

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.430
just like that
illustration, through all

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.740
the steps to completion.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.240
That's kind of an ideal.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.880
It works great on a PowerPoint.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.860
Things are going
one step at a time.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.820
No inventory.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:27.465
That's great.

00:26:27.465 --> 00:26:30.630
In practice it's sort of an
ideal that we shoot towards.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.210
We try to keep
our batches small.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.210
We try to make
processes, when we can,

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:39.660
line up so that the
flow is single piece.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.120
That's kind of the opposite,
again, of a batch and queue,

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.860
where we make big
batches of stuff

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.980
and then it waits until the
next step is ready to take it.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.020
This is a key conceptual tool
for any kind of pull process.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.060
It's called a
manufacturing cell.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.350
And we actually saw these
in action at New Balance.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.050
The classic cell is
actually U-shaped.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.270
People actually
arrange the stuff

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:08.130
in a U on the factory floor
because then the in and out

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.850
are basically in the same place.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.560
Makes moving stuff
around easier.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.400
There is even interesting
rules about whether they should

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.220
go clockwise or counterclockwise
depending on whether you're

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.152
right-handed or left-handed.

00:27:20.152 --> 00:27:21.860
If you want to get
into the ergonometrics

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.860
you can get very clever.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.380
But the basic idea is, OK,
if we have some tasks that

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.720
can be balanced,
that can be made

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.150
to take about the
same time and that

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.570
aren't dependent on a big batch
machine like those cutters,

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.570
then we can line
them up, balance them

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.460
so they take about
the same time,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.970
and then put in a
very interesting rule.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.610
Instead of a big, complicated
scheduling system,

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.210
we're going to say don't work
unless the downstream process

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.410
needs you to.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.990
And you can tell whether
it needs you to--

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.400
you don't even have to ask--

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.620
by the fact that their
inventory bin is empty.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.360
So very simple rule.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.970
So in practice, OK,
everybody has inventory,

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:06.370
nobody works until
the next process

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.560
in line, the internal
or external customer,

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.590
takes product away from here.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.690
Now task four starts to work.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.935
To do that, they start
using their inventory, which

00:28:16.935 --> 00:28:18.310
means three starts
working, which

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.110
means two starts working,
which means one starts working.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.120
So now everybody's working.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.900
Oh, and of course,
now we're out here.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.940
So we have to go ask our
internal or external supplier

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.890
for more parts, for more stuff.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.260
If everybody takes exactly
the same amount of time,

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.710
my next click would get
us back to the beginning.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.300
Everything would go
back to everybody

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.460
having work in front of them.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.530
So they stop working.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.450
No inventory.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.070
Direct customer pull.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.880
It's just triggered by the
customer taking the item out

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.250
of the inventory
of one at the end.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.610
In the real world, some
tasks, maybe the balance

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.210
isn't perfect, these
tasks finish first.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.640
They notice now that there
is inventory sitting there

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.077
because this task is
not ready to take it,

00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:04.910
so they're finished.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.530
They stop working.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.527
That seems inefficient,
but what good

00:29:09.527 --> 00:29:10.860
does it do if they keep working?

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.105
What happens if
they keep working?

00:29:13.105 --> 00:29:13.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it just
creates more inventory.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.100
We can just pile
up inventory here.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.670
That would be a waste
of overproduction.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.820
So that's very
simple, but this is

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.930
very practical in the
manufacturing system.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.930
And conceptually, you
can use it for things

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:29.670
like engineering work.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.170
Rapid drawing release,
people have set up cells.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.600
That horrible value stream
we saw at the very beginning

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.100
with all the lines
going everywhere,

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.260
well, that was to
get one drawing out.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.390
So if you just line the
engineers up like this,

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.560
makes as much sense
ever as anything else.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.960
It may not be
perfectly efficient

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.000
from the engineer's
point of view,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.990
but it minimizes, without any
complicated control system,

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.550
the time the product
spends in the system.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.160
And that's the advantage
of a pull system.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.180
Another example of pull
as a kanban system.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.520
We talked about that
a little bit before.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.760
Essentially, same rule.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.060
Appearance of a kanban bin means
that the downstream process

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.790
wants parts.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.970
Kanban card or bin,
some kind of signal.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.260
The difference here is that
we're no longer in a cell.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.360
We're no longer right
next to the other process.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.210
So we need some kind of signal.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.240
Now it could be a complicated
order with legal and pages,

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.570
or it could be a bin or
a card, something simple

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.540
that we've prearranged
that says, I need work.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.970
I need you to do work for me.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.670
Of course, you have to have
standard processes for this.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.760
You have to agree
what this card means.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.760
But it does allow us to control
even a fairly complicated

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.330
system visually, and even
if it's geographically

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.190
or organizationally separated.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.790
Again, a very simple example.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.020
If we have a supplier
and a manufacturer--

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.030
in this case, we
have physical bins.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.250
In the New Balance
video, you saw

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.050
those plastic bins
that everybody was

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.940
using to move the parts around.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.260
It's very real, very
direct and physical.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.020
If we run out, we send the
empty bin to the supplier.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.350
They know what that means.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.227
It means fill it up.

00:31:11.227 --> 00:31:13.060
So they work on it and
they fill up the bin.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.340
When it's full,
shipping department

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.130
knows that means
to take it away.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.170
When it shows up,
the manufacturer

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.180
uses it until the bin is empty.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.350
Back to the supplier.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.180
Self-perpetuating system.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.180
Even if these systems are not
particularly well-balanced,

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.000
or even if demand
is intermittent,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.450
it will operate with no outside
interference, no management

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.910
effort, and minimum inventory.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:43.360
About the only trick in this
is essentially how many bins.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.420
If you only have one
bin, what's the problem?

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.530
Yeah.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.445
You have to wait, right?

00:31:50.445 --> 00:31:51.820
You have to wait
for the supplier

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.440
to be finished before
you can start working

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.390
again, which might be
OK if it's a low demand

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.640
product or something.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.190
In this example, we have
four, so it kind of continues

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.012
round and round.

00:32:01.012 --> 00:32:02.470
Worst thing that
can happen here is

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.220
if there's no demand,
four bins worth pile up

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.490
because the supplier will keep
moving until all the are full.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.982
So we could pile up four bins.

00:32:10.982 --> 00:32:12.940
That's probably not
horrible unless, of course,

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.590
they're really expensive things.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.440
So there's essentially
a design knob

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.150
on the system, which is how
many bins, but that's it.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.970
It's very simple.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.980
And we can tweak it as necessary
by changing the number of bins.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.520
OK.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.780
So that's kanban.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.000
Kanban itself is kind
of a visual control.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.650
You see an empty bin, you work.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:38.410
There's other kinds
of visual controls

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.900
that are referred to
generically, again,

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.510
with another Japanese
word, the word Andon.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.150
Andon is kind of an
adjective that means

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.320
visual control, more or less.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.100
And you can have, for
example, Andon lights.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.060
Again, in the video, you may
have noticed in the background

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.610
some lights like this.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.700
Very standard practice
now in manufacturing

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.160
to have a little
light tower like that.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.140
Red means the machine
is broken or there's

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.370
some serious problem.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.540
It needs attention.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.070
Green means it's going fine.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.410
Yellow means maybe were
behind a little bit.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.320
It allows you to just look
across the factory floor,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:14.980
see the state.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.690
If everything's
green, it's dandy.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.880
If there's red stuff,
you got to go fix it.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.790
If there's yellows, that
tells you what to worry about.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.940
It's only really useful if you
do something about it, though.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.590
It's part of an active
management system.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.180
Another one is the Andon cord.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.340
This is the famous
counterintuitive Japanese

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.940
practice of basically having a
cord in front of every employee

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.630
that they can pull that
stops the entire factory.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:46.930
This is very scary, even to this
day, to North American managers

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.910
because any disgruntled
person can pull the cord

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.300
and stop the entire factory.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.820
What's that about?

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.250
But of course, the way they
use that is to draw attention

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.900
to a serious problem.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.730
If a quality problem is
happening, the parts don't fit,

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:07.530
that's unacceptable at a high
quality production operation.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.889
So they stop the line because if
they don't, that defective part

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:12.960
is going to continue
down the line,

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.020
get more parts piled on
top of it until you have,

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.760
essentially, a defective car.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.280
So a washer or whatever is
turned into a big problem.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.230
It's actually better
to stop and fix it.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.239
It also provides a
lot of motivation.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.100
Everybody comes over
and fixes it right away

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.179
because the line is stopped.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:31.290
So the team leader,
engineers, whoever

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:34.710
needs to come on over
and solve the problem.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:41.900
That's the Andon cord concept.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.860
Medical example.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.830
Virginia Mason Medical Center.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:50.000
They have essentially
a policy that

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.500
says that any of their
5,000 employees can--

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.380
they don't exactly
stop seeing patients--

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.260
but all attention is
paid to this person

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:05.450
if they declare it
an Andon cord action.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.280
If there is a patient
safety issue that

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.240
needs to be dealt
with immediately,

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.390
they can get as much
attention as they need.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.870
And this happens quite a bit.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:20.200
But it has also surfaced
a lot of problems.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.330
And the real key
here, by the way,

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:26.688
is not that this is a very good,
quick problem-solving method,

00:35:26.688 --> 00:35:28.230
because it isn't--
it stops the line.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.813
It could be potentially
very expensive

00:35:29.813 --> 00:35:31.360
over something very small--

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.390
but that it surface problems.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.590
If you have a problem
of this magnitude,

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.140
you don't want to see it again.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.530
So it surfaces the
problem and allows

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.380
people to pay attention to
it, find the root cause,

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.820
make it go away for good.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.390
OK.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.460
Final step, pursuing perfection.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.980
This is all about not quitting.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.720
There's always more
ways to eliminate.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.660
There's always ways you
can do things better.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.260
There's always ways you can get
the employees more involved.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.780
So it's a continuous process.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.910
And we'll be talking
about that more later.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:13.080
Another tool, a final tool
for this afternoon, five whys.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.180
The eight wastes
and the six S's.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.760
These are the five whys,
not the letter, the word.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.180
And the point of the five
whys is to keep asking why.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.430
The fact that there's a
number is actually kind of bad

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.680
because you may not
want to quit at five,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.280
and three might be enough.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.640
But here's an example.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.990
Possibly apocryphal example
about the Jefferson Monument.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.330
Why is the Jefferson
Monument deteriorating?

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.740
Because they wash
it all the time.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.140
Why is it washed all the time?

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.690
Because it has bird poop on it.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.840
Why do they do that?

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.170
Well, because the birds
are eating the spiders.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.770
Why are there spiders?

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.470
Because they're eating gnats.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.700
Why are there gnats?

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.220
Because the lights
are on all the time.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.933
Of course, I had somebody at
a class a couple of times ago

00:37:00.933 --> 00:37:02.850
that said, why are the
lights on all the time?

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.500
Because it's in a
bad neighborhood.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.340
So maybe five is not
the right number.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.510
Maybe less is OK.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.560
Maybe you need to go deeper.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.070
So the five fundamentals
kind of work together.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.640
Pursuing perfection may
send you all the way back

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.630
to the beginning.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.880
This is kind of
a strategic view.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.280
The tactics-- and we're going
to be talking about this

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.380
for the rest of the week
so I won't dwell on it--

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:33.300
are, in this loop, the
Plan, Do, Study, Act loop.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.930
So whenever you find
something you need to fix,

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.180
you don't just
willy nilly fix it.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.070
You go through an
ordered process,

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.310
and it is through a series
of these ordered processes

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.600
that you actually improve
your value stream,

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.710
achieve your flow,
push towards pull.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.932
So we've actually gone
through a bunch of stuff.

00:37:54.932 --> 00:37:56.640
Remember that huge
chart at the beginning

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.270
that nobody knew hardly
any of the turns on?

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.220
Well, now you have at
least been introduced

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.510
to all of these, quite a few.

00:38:06.747 --> 00:38:08.830
I don't know whether you've
absorbed all of those.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.455
Hopefully at the top
level, the concept

00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:15.060
of process, the concept of
thinking about customer value

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.340
has sunk in, and that some
of the thoughts about making

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.400
value flow, a couple
of the simple tools

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.440
have stuck, particularly--
not on the chart,

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.490
but always a favorite of mine--
is that you've at least started

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.530
to appreciate the
complexity of what

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:32.720
time means in these processes.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.050
And again, we'll be doing a
considerable exercise on that

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.500
starting in just a few minutes.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.270
So that's it for now.

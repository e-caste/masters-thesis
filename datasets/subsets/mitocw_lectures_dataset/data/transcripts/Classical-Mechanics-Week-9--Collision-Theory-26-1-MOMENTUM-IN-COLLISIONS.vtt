00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:05.680
Let's consider our
one-dimensional collision

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.420
again, object 1 moving
with velocity V1 initial,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.740
and object 2 moving
with V2 initial.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.150
Let's call this or
i hat direction.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.610
And this is our initial state.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:30.140
And our final state after the
collision, we have object 1.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.170
We'll say it's moving this,
V1 final, and object 2 moving

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.630
that way, V2 final.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.240
Now recall our principle
of impulse and momentum.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.240
We said that if there
is an external force

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.220
during the time of a collision
delta t, then physically that

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.260
will cause the momentum
of the system final

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.130
minus the momentum of
the system initial.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.380
Now when we do this analysis,
this side was a description

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.720
and this side is physics.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.539
Now for our
one-dimensional collision,

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.580
we need to look
at this collision

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.370
and ask ourselves are
there any external forces

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.640
acting on the system, which
is consisting of particle 1

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.070
and particle 2?

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.560
So what we're going
to identify here

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.789
is that the surface
is frictionless.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.340
And we'll ignore
all air resistance.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:42.090
And so by our assumptions that
there are no f external is 0.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.780
And therefore, the momentum of
the system remains constant.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.370
So here our statement is-- many
people call this conservation

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.880
of momentum, but we're
saying in this example based

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.760
on our assumptions that
the momentum of the system

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.436
is constant.

00:02:07.172 --> 00:02:10.780
Now how do we actually
write that down?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.250
Well, let's now write it
first as vector expressions.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.890
So we have the initial momentum,
V1 of the system, m1 m2 V2

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.100
initial is equal to the
final momentum of the system,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.630
V1 final plus m2 V2 final.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.320
Now, how do we represent
these equations?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.020
Well, you could treat them
as vectors if you wanted.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.620
But what we're going to do is
express them as components.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.780
So if we wrote
this as components,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:55.450
we would have m1 Vx initial i
hat plus m2 V2 x initial i hat

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:06.670
equals m1 V1 s final i hat
plus m2 V2 x final i hat.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.310
So that's the vector
expression expressed

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.750
in terms of components.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.940
The advantage of this
is that we really

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.120
don't know the signs of
these two final components.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.100
That's our target quantities.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.200
But we could just
write this equation--

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.340
instead of writing it
as a vector equation,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.250
let's just now write this
as a component equation.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.000
And when we write this equation
in terms of components,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:43.660
we have m1 V1 x initial plus
m2 V2 x initial equals m1 V1 x

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.540
final plus m2 V2 x final.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.530
And this equation
here is the equation

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.590
that we use to
express the constancy

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.420
of the momentum of the system.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.740
We'll call this equation 1.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.620
Now our next approach
is to ask are there

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.600
any other quantities in the
system which are constant?

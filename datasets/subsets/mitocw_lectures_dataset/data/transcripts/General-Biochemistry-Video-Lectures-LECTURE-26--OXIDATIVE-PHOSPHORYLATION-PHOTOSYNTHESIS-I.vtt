MATTHEW VANDER
HEIDEN: Last time, we

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.220
discussed oxidative
phosphorylation, which

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.710
is how to couple the NADH
generated from sugar,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.390
fatty acids, et cetera; the
oxidation of carbon as a way

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.200
to carry out favorable
electron transfer to oxygen

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.650
and use that energy release
to charge a battery--

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.890
that is, create
this delta psi/delta

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.360
pH that can subsequently be
used by the battery to do work,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.230
including the synthesis of ADP.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.640
And of course, this can occur
at a physiological ATP/ADP ratio

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.620
and, therefore, allow
the cell to couple ATP

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.220
to ADP conversion to other
unfavorable processes

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.760
in the cell.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.450
Now, all of these reactions
occur at the mitochondria.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.510
And I drew, here, a
schematic mitochondria for us

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.570
just to start.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.290
Remember, the mitochondria
has its own genome.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.180
This is a vestige of the
symbiotic relationship that

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.580
developed long, long ago, where
two prokaryotes came together,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.720
leading to this symbiotic
relationship-- but of course,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.170
the mitochondrial
DNA encoding many

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.310
of the key components of
this electron transport chain

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.480
and ATP synthesis machinery
that remains in the mitochondria

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.530
today.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.370
Now, ultimately, this process
involves the reoxidation

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.060
of NADH back to NAD that occurs,
that complex I of the electron

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.410
transport chain.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.230
Those electrons are transferred
into the Q pool, which

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.160
then go into complex III to
cytochrome c to complex IV,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.130
ultimately being transferred
to oxygen as the final electron

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.850
acceptor.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.300
And it's this process of
favorable electron transport--

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.670
that is, electrons
moving from a lower

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.190
to a higher standard
reduction potential-- that

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.380
is coupled to the
pumping of protons

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.830
and the generation of
this delta psi/delta pH.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.460
Now, we also discussed complex
II of the electron transport

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.120
chain, which is identical
to succinate dehydrogenase

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.500
in the TCA cycle.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.020
This is involving that
FAD/FADH2, which can, itself,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.600
also transfer electrons
to the Q pool,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.940
ultimately passing
those to complex III

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.850
to cytochrome c to
complex IV, again,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.730
with oxygen as
electron acceptor,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.430
ultimately forming
what is essentially

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.300
two different variations
on the electron transport

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.470
chain as a way to generate
delta psi/delta pH.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.090
Now I show here, on the
slide, that there's really

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.030
many versions of this
electron transport chain,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.470
and another one we discussed
is shown down here.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.220
So up here is the typical one to
regenerate NAD+ using complex I

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.770
to the Q pool to III to c to IV.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.990
Here's the one involving complex
II, so dehydrogenase reaction

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.580
via complex II to the Q
pool, complex III, c, IV.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.250
And then there's yet a third one
here from fatty acid oxidation.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.880
So this is Acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.960
Again, like complex
II, involves FAD/FADH2.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.870
This occurs at the
membrane, transfers

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.990
electrons to the Q
pool to III to c to IV,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.150
ultimately reducing
oxygen to water.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.920
And so the net effect of
these various electron

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.530
transport chains
were shown up here

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.670
is generating this delta
psi/delta pH, which

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.140
can then be used to do work.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.040
Now, the cool thing
is is that this

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.410
is occurring, in this case,
at the inner mitochondrial

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.230
membrane.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.890
And so you can do work in
lots of different ways.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.640
It doesn't have to be
next to the complex.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.610
You have a charge
across the membrane that

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.660
can be used different
places in space,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.850
such as so-called complex
V or the F1F0-ATPase,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.330
which can use dissipation
of that proton gradient

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.990
to drive that rotational
catalysis machine we described

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.140
last time and, ultimately,
take ADP plus phosphate

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.450
and synthesize ATP.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.100
But that's not the
only work it can do.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.230
You can uncouple
the whole thing.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.540
We discussed these
uncoupling proteins,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.120
which, effectively,
just let protons leak

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.570
back across into the membranes,
that short-circuiting

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.710
this potential.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.320
And that's a way
to generate heat.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.180
Other type of work
we can do is we

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.200
can use this proton
gradient to power

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.870
the transport of other ions.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.830
We discussed this happening
with ADP/ATP exchange

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.470
because, of course,
ADP-to-ATP conversion

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.830
needed in the cytosol to favor
unfavorable processes there.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.120
Need to exchange those in
and out of the mitochondria,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.950
so you can regenerate ATP with
the ATP synthase machinery.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.630
And yet another thing
we talked about is

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.680
you can use this as a
way to concentrate ions,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.110
such as calcium.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.840
And the mitochondria ends
up being a major calcium

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.860
store for cells.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:19.170
Now, we discussed last time
that this is great having all

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.870
of these oxidation
processes-- the TCA cycle,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.490
fatty acid oxidation--

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.230
all occurring in the
matrix because it

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.180
gives a location for
NAD/NADH to happen where

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.590
it has easy access to this
electron transport machinery

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.550
and the ability to regenerate
the NAD necessary to keep these

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.180
processes going.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.050
But of course, the very first
process we talked about happens

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.930
in the cytosol, and
that's glycolysis.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.240
And we discussed how
you can bring pyruvate

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.800
into the mitochondria through
this mitochondrial pyruvate

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.840
carrier.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.660
Then it has access to the
pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.800
reaction, which, of course,
generates acetyl-CoA

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.310
and NADH in the right place.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.360
However, if you go way back to
when we discuss fermentation,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.020
remember, the reason we had to
send pyruvate to fermentation

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.130
was to regenerate that
NAD in the cytosol that's

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.230
necessary to keep
glycolysis going.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.910
Now, of course, if we're
going to fully oxidize

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.220
pyruvate carbon in
the mitochondria,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.340
we still have to solve
this electron balance

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.500
problem for glycolysis.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.660
And as we discussed,
we can solve that

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.790
by giving those
electrons to oxygen.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.000
But now you see that there's
this additional complication--

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.480
is that these electrons
in the form of NADH

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.420
need to get inside the
mitochondrial matrix

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.060
or get to the electron
transport chain

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.740
as a way to use oxygen
to ultimately dispose

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.800
of those electrons.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.400
And so, effectively,
that NADH needs

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.430
to be gotten to
complex I, which would

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.900
be the matrix in the
way we've drawn it here.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:04.450
Now, really, the way that
this happens is not direct.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.250
So you don't transport
NADH from the cytosol

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.590
into the mitochondria.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.910
And that's partially because
one of the benefits, remember,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.460
of having compartmentalized
metabolism

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.260
is your ability to have
different conditions;

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.467
different ATP/ADP
ratios, NAD/NADH ratios

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:26.050
in different
compartments because that

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.070
can favor different chemistry.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.850
And so the way that you get
electrons into the matrix

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.850
or get electrons to the
electron transport chains

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.260
doesn't occur directly.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.370
You do not transport
NAD or NADH directly.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.220
Instead, you use
so-called shuttles,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.490
which are analogous to some
of the other shuttles we've

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.640
talked about, in order to get
materials across membranes.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.470
In this case, this
is a way to get

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.350
electrons generated
from oxidation

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.090
reactions in the cytosol--

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.400
production of NADH in
the cytosol, things

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.040
like glycolysis--

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.520
to the electron transport chain
so that they can ultimately

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.120
be transferred to oxygen.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:20.300
And so these shuttles,
or redox shuttles,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.540
actually come in
several different ways

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.900
that cells can deal with
cytosolic electrons.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:34.230
And so these shuttles
also, in essence,

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.850
help cells also establish
these different conditions,

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.560
these different NAD/NADH ratios
in different compartments.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.060
And so you can imagine that the
shuttles themselves could be

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.700
regulated as a way to do this.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.700
Now, there's two
major redox shuttles

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.390
that allow you to move
electrons from the cytosol

00:08:54.390 --> 00:09:01.470
into the mitochondria, and we'll
discuss those two here next.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.570
These are the two
that probably are

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.700
being looked for if you get
this question on an MCAT exam

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.302
or something like that.

00:09:10.302 --> 00:09:11.760
They're the ones
that are described

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.090
in the text as the way to
get electrons to the electron

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.380
transport chain.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.910
But however, as we
go through them,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.730
you will see that there's
a couple different ways

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.470
one can do this.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.710
They basically involve
oxidation and reduction

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.670
of a pair of molecules on
either side of the membrane.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.160
And there's lots of ways
you can do that in addition

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.290
to these other shuttles.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.240
It'll become more clear
what I mean by this,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.030
but I guess I just want you
to know that these are not

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.820
the only ways one
could shuttle electrons

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.260
into the mitochondria.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.450
These are just the major
ways that have been discussed

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.630
and are usually
discussed in textbooks.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:57.000
So the first shuttle
system is something called

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.865
the glycerol phosphate shuttle.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.910
And so the glycerol
phosphate shuttle

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.080
involves a reaction that
we've already discussed.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.610
So here's our old friend,
dihyroxyacetone phosphate

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.920
from glycolysis.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.850
Remember when we talked
about the generation of

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.770
and metabolism of
glycerol, in order

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.530
to make triacylglycerides,
phospholipids--

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.140
remember we described
that you can

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.330
take dihyroxyacetone phosphate.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:11:02.260
If you use NADH to reduce
that ketone to the alcohol,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.580
that generates this
molecule, glycerol phosphate.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.130
And of course, because
you're reducing the ketone

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.470
to the alcohol, something
else has to be oxidized.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.430
You reoxidized
NADH back to NAD+,

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.610
effectively disposing of
those electrons from, say,

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:28.150
glycolysis that generated
NADH to regenerate NAD+.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.880
Now, rather than use this
glycerol phosphate and lipid

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.090
synthesis, turns out
there's a complex that

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:44.940
can directly transfer
those electrons to FAD

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.740
to generate FADH2.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:56.750
And this complex sits within the
inner mitochondrial membrane,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.040
facing the cytosolic
side of the membrane.

00:12:04.232 --> 00:12:06.260
Here's the inner
mitochondrial membrane.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.170
This would be the matrix.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.920
And so transferring
those electrons

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.090
to FAD to reduce
to FADH2 reoxidizes

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.920
the glycerol phosphate back
to dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.520
And of course, in this membrane,
you can, in this complex,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.480
transfer those electrons
by oxidizing the FAD

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.070
and sending them to
the coenzyme Q pool.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.370
That can take the
ubiquinone, makes ubinquinol.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.410
Those electrons can
go to complex III.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.790
That can go to cytochrome C.
They can go to complex IV,

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:51.070
ultimately ending up reducing
oxygen to water using oxygen

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.260
as a final electron acceptor.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.330
Again, this is effectively
another alternative

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.620
to the electron transport chain.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.340
And so I show that
here on the slide.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.630
And so we've discussed--

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.750
the complex II-- this is the
FAD/FADH2 containing enzyme

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.780
is complex II.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.190
Succinate dehydrogenase sits
in the inner mitochondrial

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.160
membrane, converts
succinate to fumarate.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.280
Those electrons
end up on up FADH2,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.725
can get transferred
to the Q pool,

00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:31.420
reoxidizing FAD to complex III
to cytochrome C to complex IV

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.030
to oxygen to water.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.540
We already discussed acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase-- same thing.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.290
FADH2 containing reaction in
there is also in the membrane--

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.200
ultimately allows another
version electron transport

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:44.980
chain.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.240
And here's yet a third one
involving an FDA using enzyme.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.860
The difference is is that these
have the oxidation reduction

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.110
reaction occurring
on the matrix side--

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.900
succinate to fumarate
on the matrix side--

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.090
the introduction
of a double bond

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.610
for fatty acid oxidation
and the matrix side.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.120
This one here instead
faces the cytosolic side.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.130
So glycerol 3 phosphate
can be reoxidized

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:17.220
to dihydroxyacetone phosphate--

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.970
looks like I have those arrows
drawn backwards, sorry--

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:25.010
ultimately sending electrons
into this glycerol phosphate

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.890
shuttle, reducing FADH2,
which can be reoxidized

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.170
by giving those electrons to
the Q pool to complex III,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.400
to cytochrome C, to
complex IV, ultimately

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.900
with water serving as the
final electron acceptor,

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.460
as I've drawn here.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.980
Now, if you notice, if
we use this system or any

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.680
of these systems, these
alternative FAD/FADH2 using

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.390
electron transport chains,
you don't use complex I.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:05.250
Remember, complex I will pump
a proton, complex II will not.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.130
And that means that if you
use any of these FADH2 using

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.380
alternative electron
transport chains,

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.740
you pump fewer protons
into the cytosol.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.580
And so if you donate the
electrons to complex I

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.280
from the matrix,
you pump a proton

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.890
as you go through
complex I to the Q pool

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.620
if you go through the
glycerol phosphate shuttle,

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.550
you avoid complex I, because you
give those electrons directly

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.380
to the glycerol
phosphate shuttle.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.890
And FAD/FADH2 enzyme--
those end up in the Q pool.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.960
Less protons are pumped.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.540
And this is why sometimes
in textbooks, you'll

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.070
see that you get less ATP per
NADH produced in the cytosol

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:51.420
than you get for NADH
produced in the mitochondria.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.280
And this is one of the
ways that you end up

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.480
with these accounting yields for
glucose oxidation-- something

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.430
we'll talk about in a minute.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.390
But the deeper reason for this,
which I want you to appreciate,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:12.180
is because FADH2 has a higher
standard reduction potential.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:20.210
So the standard reduction
potential of FAD/FADH2

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.245
is greater than it
is for NAD/NADH.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.070
In essence, that
means that there's

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.780
less change in
standard reduction

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:37.780
potential for transferring FADH2
electrons to oxygen as there is

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.290
for transferring
electrons to oxygen.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.950
And so less energy released,
less protons pumped,

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:49.600
and so that's why you get
less ATP, if you will,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.600
produced going through the
glycerol phosphate shuttle.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.450
All right.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.370
Next, I want to discuss
another alternative shuttle

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.930
to get electrons into
the mitochondria.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.310
And this involves much more
what I was alluding to earlier.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.500
And that's oxidation
and reduction

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.045
of a pair of metabolites
that are transported

00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:15.170
across the membrane on
either side of the membrane,

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.490
effectively moving electrons
from one compartment

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.390
in the cell to another.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.755
Now, to understand how this
shuttle works, I have to--

00:17:25.755 --> 00:17:27.380
because it's a little
more complicated,

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.750
I have to first
describe that there's

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:34.830
a relationship between amino
acids and alpha-keto acids.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.240
And so, what do I mean by that?

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:44.150
Well, here's a alpha-keto acid
that we've talked about a lot.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.600
So this is oxaloacetate.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.050
Remember, it's an alpha
keto-acid because this ketone

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:56.160
is alpha to this
carboxylic acid--

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.860
so an alpha-keto acid.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.200
Turns out that
alpha-keto acids are

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:09.930
related to amino acids
in the following way.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.550
And so if I take
that alpha-keto group

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:19.780
and instead make
it an amino group,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.590
this here is the
amino acid aspartame.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.440
Now, we'll discuss
later in the course

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.710
the chemistry that allows
you to interconvert

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.650
this alpha-keto group
with this amino group.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.700
But that's effectively where
your amino acids come from--

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.130
how your amino acids are related
to other aspects of carbon

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.910
metabolism--

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.090
Alpha-keto acids that are
generated in metabolism.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.910
And so there's one example--

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:59.310
oxaloacetate and aspartate, an
alpha-keto acid, an amino acid.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.215
Here's another one.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.720
So this is alpha-ketoglutarate--

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.310
an alpha-keto acid.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:30.770
And if we change that alpha
group to an amino group,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:39.190
now we get the amino
acid glutamate.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.120
All right.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.380
To remind you, the three letter
abbreviation for aspartate

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.400
is a-s-p.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.580
The one letter is D. The
three letter abbreviation

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.480
for glutamate is g-l-u.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.270
And the one letter
abbreviation is E.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:00.890
And I just remind you of that in
case I use those abbreviations.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:06.200
But effectively, you can note
that if you couple these swaps

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.190
to each other--

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.450
that is, if I take
oxaloacetate and turn it

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:19.620
into aspartate while at the
same time taking glutamate

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.280
and turning it into
alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.630
you can see that that
is a reaction where

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.700
all atoms are conserved.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:35.970
That is, if I turn this amino
acid into this alpha-keto acid

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.250
while at the same time
turning that alpha-keto acid

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:43.680
into this amino acid, I have
not gained or lost any atoms

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.710
or molecules in the process.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.780
And we will see
later in the course

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.850
that these types
of interconversions

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:57.090
is exactly how you run
these reactions to do

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.310
these interconversions
between alpha-keto acids

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.980
and amino acids.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.910
OK.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.410
Why am I telling you this now?

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.200
Because it turns out this
is central to understand

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.850
the other major shuttle,
which is referred

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:22.500
to as the malate-aspartate
shuttle as another way

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.730
to get electrons and
NADH from the cytosol

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.300
into the mitochondria.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:29.800
All right.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.370
So how does this happen?

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.060
So here if you have--

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.260
here's oxaloacetate.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:48.270
This is occurring up
here in the cytosol.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.320
OK.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:55.140
And if we take oxaloacetate
in the cytosol and we

00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:01.490
utilize the malate
dehydrogenase reaction

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.755
that we heard about
from the TCA cycle--

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.590
so basically this is the reverse
of the malate dehydrogenase

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.960
reaction we discussed
in the TCA cycle.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.470
We're going to reduce this
ketone to the alcohol.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:25.430
NADH is reoxidized to NAD+.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:38.950
That will generate malate.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:45.820
And now we've regenerated NAD+
in the cytosol by putting those

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.605
electrons onto oxaloacetate
to make malate.

00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:52.060
All right.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.610
Now, we can take
that malate, send it

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:10.360
across the mitochondrial
membranes via transporter

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.470
to generate, on the matrix
side of the membrane,

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:25.620
malate, whereas
from the TCA cycle,

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:40.920
we also have malate
dehydrogenase that can now

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:52.780
reoxidize that carbon from
the alcohol to the ketone

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:58.000
and regenerate
oxaloacetate effectively

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.320
by carrying out the same
reaction through a redox pair

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.850
on two sides of the membrane.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.900
Effectively what
I've done is I've

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.340
moved the electrons
from NADH in the cytosol

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.780
to now being NADH in the
mitochondrial matrix, where

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.510
this can now donate the
electrons to complex I,

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:21.460
to the Q pool, to complex III,
to cytochrome C, to complex IV,

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.300
and ultimately to
oxygen, just like it

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.350
would for the TCA cycle.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.850
All right.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.990
Now, the simplest
thing, of course,

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.470
would just be to send
the oxaloacetate back out

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.480
to the cytosol.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.400
But that's not what happens.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.600
Instead, what happens is
you turn that oxaloacetate

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.460
into aspartate.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.080
This is an alpha-keto acid.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.360
Turn it into the amino acid.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:56.130
If you do that, you
basically at the same time

00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:01.890
turn glutamate into
alpha-ketoglutarate all right.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.170
Turns out it's that
alpha-ketoglutarate

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:10.890
that is exchanged when you
bring malate into the cell.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.720
So malate is exchanged
for alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:41.320
And at the same time, you
exchange the aspartate

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.560
for a glutamate.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.470
All right.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.700
So now you can take
that aspartame,

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.360
turn it back into oxaloacetate.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.720
To do so you need
to balance this.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:19.550
So you return your
alpha-ketoglutarate back

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.620
into glutamate.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:32.960
And effectively, this is the
malate aspartate shuttle.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.530
OK.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:41.590
So electrons from oxaloacetate
to malate, and then malate back

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.770
to oxaloacetate moves
the electrons on NADH

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.890
from the cytosol into
the mitochondria.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.960
To get that malate
across the membrane,

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.390
you exchange it for
alpha-ketoglutarate

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.480
and to maintain carbon
balance across the--

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.030
and nitrogen balance--
across the whole thing.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:01.840
At the same time, you
also exchange an aspartate

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:10.170
for a glutamate, which allows
you to basically interconvert

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.380
the oxaloacetate
and the aspartate

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.650
on either side of the
membrane via interconverting

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.440
glutamate and
alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.910
So somewhat confusing
systems, but

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.840
recognize that the net
effect is moving NADH

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.490
from one side of the
membrane to the other.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.740
And that occurs because you're
interconverting to redox pairs

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.250
in opposite directions-- in this
case oxaloacetate and malate--

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.860
on either side of the membrane.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.710
And that's why what
I alluded to earlier,

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.820
you can imagine that
you could easily come up

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.430
with other shuttle systems
where you have a redox

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.410
reaction on one
side of the membrane

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.810
and the reverse of that redox
reaction on the other side

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:55.800
of the membrane.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.440
And as long as you can
maintain carbon balance,

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.580
the net effect is moving
electrons across the membranes

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.920
from one compartment to another.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.810
And that is a way to allow
you to generate NADH that's

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:11.760
now in the matrix,
which has access

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.210
to complex I of the
electron transport chain

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:20.230
as we discussed
now several time.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.130
All right.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:27.010
Now we're ready to go through
and discuss the accounting

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.320
that you see--

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:38.130
the accounting that comes up all
the time that is in textbooks

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.160
and perhaps you memorized
from previous classes

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.560
about how the ATP yield
works for different pathways.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.540
So hopefully it's
clear to you by now

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.450
that these numbers that
you get are estimates.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.830
And that's because there
is no direct relationship

00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:00.880
between NADH or FADH to NATP.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.840
These interconversions occur
via oxidative phosphorylation,

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.800
these electron transport
chains, delta psi/delta pH.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.900
And so all of these
estimates take

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.640
into account various
assumptions about how efficient

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.820
the electron transport chain
is, oxidative phosphorylation

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:23.650
works, bounded, of
course, by the change

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.640
in standard reduction potential,
what's the free energy released

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.510
from that?

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:33.190
What's the free energy
to synthesize ADP to ATP.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.740
Of course, those
require assumptions.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.420
And it's, in the end, why if
you read different textbooks

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.120
and different sources
you will find numbers

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.810
that are actually a range.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:49.420
There is no fixed number
for what the equivalent is

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.760
of an ATP for an NADH.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.950
And that's because it really
depends on several variables.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.510
So let's go through what
those variables are,

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.950
because if we can
understand that,

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:03.450
you really understand
how this system works.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.420
So the first variable--

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.210
at least if we're talking
about something like glucose,

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:12.180
where we generate
NADH in the cytosol,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:17.090
we have to consider
the redox shuttles.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:21.110
And hopefully you appreciate
now that you have this need

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:24.560
to regenerate NAD in the cytosol
to keep glycolysis going.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.050
You got to get those electrons
somehow to the electron

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.310
transport chain.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:32.750
And I just described for you two
different ways you can do that.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.970
Now, if I use the glycerol
phosphate shuttle,

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.860
I'm skipping complex
I altogether.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.040
And so that's not
pumping any protons.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.620
If I'm using the malate
aspartate shuttle,

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.620
well, I have all the energetics
of doing this gymnastics.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.210
But in the end, now I can use
complex I and pump protons.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.710
And so the yield of ATP,
if you will-- how many

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:59.180
protons I can pump to generate
delta psi/delta pH will

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.370
be different if I use
the glycerol phosphate

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:06.370
shuttle or a shuttle like
the malate aspartate shuttle.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:09.400
The second variable
in consideration

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:15.550
is, what is the
efficiency of proton

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:24.670
pumping by the various electron
transport chain ETC complexes?

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.040
That's not so straightforward
and, of course,

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.850
is going to depend on
a couple of things.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.660
Remember, we spent a long
time talking about ATP/ADP,

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.260
and how it's the ratio of
ATP/ADP that was really

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.180
the energy there,
because, remember,

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.110
thermodynamics is
dependent on that log

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.800
of the reactants over the
product's term in the delta G

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.220
equation.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.500
Well, that's true also
for the NAD/NADH ratio.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.650
And it's also true for how
high the membrane potential is.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.200
And so how efficient
this pumping

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.930
is going to be is going
to be depending on what

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:10.800
is the delta psi to begin with,
and what is the NAD/NADH ratio

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.690
or the FAD/FADH2 ratio,
because all of those things

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.150
will affect how much
free energy there

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:21.930
is to be able to move protons
from one side of the membrane

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.540
to the other.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.180
Once I get those protons
across the membrane,

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.480
then there's the
question of how--

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.010
and for lack of a
better word, I'm

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:41.720
going to say tight the
membrane is to proton leak.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.200
That is, you can imagine
that to make ATP,

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.420
I have to send
those protons back

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.930
through the ATP synthase,
complex V, F1F0-ATPase,

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.010
whatever you want to call it.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.190
And if some of
those protons just

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.160
leak back across the
membrane, well, that's

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.720
how we generate heat.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.480
And so how tight
that membrane is,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:09.380
that is how coupled
delta psi is,

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:15.330
delta pH is to ATP synthesis
is another variable.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:28.180
And of course, the last one is,
is the efficiency of H+ turning

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:33.730
the F0F1-ATPase, which is the
same considerations that we

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.230
already talked about
for number two.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:39.160
That is, the higher delta
psi/delta pH, the more free

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.850
energy that's stored there
and the higher or lower

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:49.030
the ATP/ADP ratio is, the easier
or harder it is to synthesize

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.530
ADP.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:54.790
And so basically,
these different things,

00:33:54.790 --> 00:34:00.040
two through four, in
general takes into account

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.290
a term called
coupled respiration.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.720
By coupled
respiration is really,

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.870
how tightly is oxidation--

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.230
moving electrons on the electron
transport chain to oxygen--

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:19.690
to phosphorylation--
synthesizing ATP from ADP?

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:23.290
And so, how tight
or how well-coupled

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:28.719
is respiration to
phosphorylation really

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:34.360
is a variable that is going to
very much depend on conditions.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.840
And so ultimately,
to give numbers

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:42.130
for what is the ATP produced
from various oxidation

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:44.710
processes, one has
to make assumptions

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.560
about all of these things,
how coupled respiration is

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.179
and which redox
shuttles are used?

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.219
If it's something
like glycolysis,

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.040
it involves the cytosol.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.170
And this is why these
numbers are made up.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:00.490
And it makes no sense in my
view to memorize these numbers.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:04.030
But I think it is
important to understand

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.170
where those numbers come from.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.160
Because if you understand
that, that means you understand

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.700
all the assumptions and why
the numbers are variable,

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.250
you really understand
the bioenergetics

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.870
of what's going
on in metabolism.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:18.370
All right.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.760
So now let's go through
one of these calculations

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.340
just to fully illustrate
what I'm talking about.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.930
So let's go through the
calculation for glycolysis.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:34.900
So if I run glycolysis and
turn glucose into two pyruvate.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.100
So what do we get from that?

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.160
Of course, we get
2 ATPs produced

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:48.570
and we get two NADHs
produced in the cytosol.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.940
OK.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.290
So this is the cytosol.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.850
This is the mitochondria.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.300
All right?

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.540
We're going to completely
oxidize that pyruvate.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.140
We send that pyruvate
into the mitochondria.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.810
We run the PDH reaction.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:14.470
That gives us two
acetyl-CoA, which

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:20.960
is a yield of two more NADHs.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.010
All right?

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:27.650
If we now take those acetyl-CoAs
and we burn them completely,

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:31.250
two cycles around the TCA cycle.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:43.180
OK, now we get two more
FADH2s and six NADHs--

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.710
one FADH2, three NADHs from
each turn, as well as a GDP.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:54.250
And so that's a total of two
FADH2, six NADHs, and two GTPs.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:59.440
And so now if I come
together, what is our yield?

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.250
Well, from the
mitochondria I've generated

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:10.254
a total of two FADH2s and
six, seven, eight NADHs.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.280
And then up here, there's
an additional two NADHs

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.680
that are made in
the cytosol, and so

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:26.310
have to access the electron
transport chain via a shuttle.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:31.890
A typical number that's
given is you get 1.58 ATP

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:35.250
for something that has
to access via shuttle,

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:40.770
or on FADH2, that
would make sense,

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.370
because FADH2 is really the
same as a glycerol phosphate

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.240
shuttle.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:50.580
And so if I do that, that
would be three ATP from the two

00:37:50.580 --> 00:38:00.720
glycolysis NADHs and three ATP
from the two TCA cycle FADH2s,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.940
because the NADHs produced
in the matrix can generate

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.930
POM protons via complex I.
Oftentimes, that's said to be,

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.150
oh, that's about 2 and 1/2 ATP.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:16.060
So 8 times 2.5 is 20 ATP.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.790
And if we had all
these numbers together,

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:27.210
20 plus 3 plus 3 plus 2 plus
2, that is a total of 30

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:35.040
ATP per glucose that's
completely oxidized to CO2.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.180
OK?

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:46.010
So 26 ATP over here plus another
2 from GTP plus another 2

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.570
from glycolysis is a total
of 20 ATP per glucose.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:51.470
That is a number.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.000
It made certain assumptions.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.400
Obviously, if I assume that this
is not the glycerol phosphate

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.800
shuttle but instead the
malate aspartate shuttle,

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.150
maybe I bump this number up
by multiplying that by 2.5.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.240
Maybe I use different
conversion factors.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.610
And if you read
in textbooks, you

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:14.090
get numbers that
range from 30 to 36.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:19.490
I think the highest I've ever
seen is 38 ATP per glucose.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.370
And the fact that you
actually see this range really

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.030
reflects the different
authors of textbooks,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.120
or whoever writes these things,
makes different assumptions

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.630
about all of these
things over here

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:35.180
to understand how to
make these conversions.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.580
But the important thing is
realizing that these are not

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.220
real numbers.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:39.720
All right.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.150
Let's quickly go
through and just do

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.090
the similar exercise one last
time just to come back to.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.610
I'm not going to go
through as much detail.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.640
But we talked about
that 6:0 fatty acid

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.650
that we did accounting
for earlier.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.440
If you look back in your
notes, what we wrote down

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.210
is that from completely
oxidizing that fully saturated

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:09.970
six carbon fatty acid, we got
one ATP, 11 and ADHDs, and five

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:10.470
FADH2s.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.260
Remember, all these
are being generated

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.850
in the-- all these NADHs
and FADH2s are already

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.320
in the mitochondria.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.070
And so if we just use the
same conversion factors

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:31.170
that we used for over there in
our calculation for glycolysis,

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:44.280
what we get is 27.5 ATP
for the NADHs and 7.5 ATP

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:54.640
for the FADH2s, which is
a total of 35 ATP for--

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:05.320
35 plus the one,
so a total of 36

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:11.327
ATP from complete oxidation
of our six carbon fatty acid,

00:41:11.327 --> 00:41:12.910
which is certainly
greater than the 30

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:17.200
ATP we got from complete
oxidation of glucose.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.730
That makes sense.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.460
Fatty acids are more
reduced than glucose--

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.640
more calories, should be
able to get more from it.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.470
And this calculation
illustrates that we get that.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.110
The typical
calculation in textbook

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:35.730
usually describes complete
oxidation of a 16:0--

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.600
a fully saturated 16
carbon fatty acid.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.530
That's palmitate.

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.830
That's one of the most abundant
fatty acids in the cell.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.350
This, if you
completely oxidize it,

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:48.420
the number and a
lot of textbooks

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:57.540
is 106 ATP per palmitate
completely oxidized to CO2.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.790
If you're so inclined,
you can go through

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:04.150
and do the calculations yourself
and see if you agree with that.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.350
But the key point of all of this
accounting is that none of this

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.980
are real numbers.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.850
And I hope you now
better appreciate

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.730
what energy really means--

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:19.440
that is, how oxidation of
carbon by being favorable

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:26.220
can be coupled either to direct
charging of an ATP/ADT ratio

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:31.440
as occurs in the GAPDH
step of glycolysis,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.380
as well as the
succinic thiokinase

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.330
step of the TCA cycle.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:39.510
But most energy
transduction involves

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:43.800
this charging up
NAD/NADH ratios,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.670
or reactions that are
coupled to FAD/FADH2

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:52.050
via these membrane complexes
that ultimately lead

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:54.930
to this favorable
electron transport

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:59.700
from lower to higher standard
reduction potentials.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.160
That favorable
electron transport

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.030
can be used to create a battery,
a delta psi/delta pH, which

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.470
can then be coupled
to do other work,

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:13.170
including synthesizing ATP at
the high ATP/ADP ratio that

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.630
can then be used
by other reactions

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:20.100
in the cell that would otherwise
be unfavorable and allow cells

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.790
to basically extract
energy from its environment

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:28.530
in order to fuel the processes
that are unfavorable and are

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.860
necessary to sustain life.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.785
All right.

00:43:33.785 --> 00:43:34.285
Great.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:47.270
So thus far, we have
focused almost entirely

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:54.160
on how you oxidized carbon
as a way to release energy.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.590
And that's great.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.880
But of course,
that reduced carbon

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.300
has to come from
somewhere to begin with.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.870
And every one of us
learned in grade school

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:09.220
that the energy for all life
ultimately comes from the sun.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.080
And that's, of course,
photosynthesis.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.600
And now I want to
turn to beginning

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.110
to discuss photosynthesis
and how it works.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:21.880
In other words, how does
life harvest solar energy

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:31.550
in a usable form that ultimately
involves using atmospheric CO2,

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:35.540
which gets reduced
to generate reduced

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:38.060
carbon that, of
course, originally

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.790
occurred because plants--

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:44.990
or, any photosynthetic organism
has the same issues as us.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:48.650
That is, to fight
thermodynamics, maintain,

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:49.730
and survive.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:54.410
It constantly has to be charging
an ATP/ADP ratio in order

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:58.070
to fuel the otherwise
unfavorable processes that

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.600
are required to maintain
order in the cell.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.450
This has to occur during
the day when the sun is out

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:08.150
and there's light
energy photosynthesis.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.820
But also has to occur
at night, or at times

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.320
when there is no sun.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:19.070
And so thus, plants basically
stored energy as reduced carbon

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:21.770
so that they had something
to eat at night-- that is,

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:24.620
to keep their
ATP/ADP ratios high--

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.830
at night so they can do all
these catabolic processes

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:29.210
at night.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:32.540
Now, fortunately
for us, the fact

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.590
that photosynthetic organisms
stored all this reduced carbon

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:39.950
allowed other life,
like us, to evolve

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:45.200
that is entirely dependent
on photosynthetic organisms

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.380
either directly or
indirectly for food.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:55.160
And so photosynthesis also is
the process that ultimately

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:59.670
oxygenated our atmosphere.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:03.120
Aerobic life, also something
that was necessary for us

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.770
to survive because oxygen is
such a key electron acceptor,

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.750
really key to our energetics--

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.140
well, the fact that
photosynthetic organisms

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.200
put oxygen in our
atmosphere also

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:23.370
was really essential for aerobic
life, us, to ultimately evolve.

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:28.530
And so photosynthesis is often,
in biochemistry courses, almost

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.660
a sidelight and
forgotten process.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.410
But of course, it is
really, really central

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.840
to how life works,
because no life

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.940
could exist without
photosynthesis

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.700
and the conditions
that allowed aerobic--

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.710
most multicellular
life that we know

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.890
of that's not photosynthetic,
including ourselves,

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:50.130
could not have evolved
without photosynthesis

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:52.770
oxygenating the
atmosphere and generating

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.390
all this reduced carbon.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:59.370
That, really, is where we
get our energy from as food.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.760
Now, you also learned
in grade school,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.330
when you learned that life
depends on energy of the sun,

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.390
that the process
that life uses is

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:13.080
this mysterious photosynthesis.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.360
Well, as we go through
this over the rest of today

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.790
and in the next lecture,
I want you to appreciate

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.220
what photosynthesis is.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:26.130
And that is how life
really takes solar energy

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:30.990
and harvests that energy in
a biologically useful form,

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:35.310
bearing in mind all of the
concepts that we've already

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:41.110
talked about, because that will
ultimately help you understand

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:45.730
how that energy from the
sun is used to make all

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.180
this reduced carbon,
this carbohydrate and fat

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:53.420
that is energy that we can use
for later, and also, of course,

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.220
allows how photosynthetic
organisms can use light

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.680
from the sun to just
power things directly

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.090
from that solar battery,
and ultimately, of course,

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:09.030
you should appreciate that
these things all came first.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.730
Photosynthesis
obviously existed first.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.520
And so most of what we
already talked about--

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.700
well, we'll draw parallels when
we talk about photosynthesis

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.320
to the stuff we already know.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.290
Of course, photosynthesis
came first.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.040
And the stuff you've
already learned about

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.490
evolved from photosynthesis.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:27.600
All right.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.770
Now, like all pathways,
photosynthesis also

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.670
has to follow the same rules
and laws of thermodynamics that

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.530
were true for all pathways.

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:41.890
So plants and animals have
to follow the same rules.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.220
And so what is photosynthesis?

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.840
Well, it's ultimately CO2
in the atmosphere that

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.100
gets reduced to carbohydrate.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.240
That's classically
photosynthesis.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:03.070
But, of course, plants
also make fatty acids.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.450
OK?

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:08.830
This is carbon reduction.

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:13.090
Remember, carbon oxidation
generally is favorable.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:15.340
Carbon reduction is not.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:20.830
Delta G naught prime for
this is greater than 0.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.510
This direction is favored.

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.760
That direction is
not, which means

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.750
you need energy input
to reduce that CO2

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.940
to carbohydrate or fatty acid.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:35.290
And of course, it's the sun's
energy, the solar energy,

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:40.530
that ultimately must be
done to make this favorable.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.960
Now we're reducing carbon.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.750
That means we need
to add electrons.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.430
Those electrons have
to come from somewhere.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:51.750
And so we're
reducing the carbon.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.210
That means something
else has to be oxidized.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.550
Just like when we
oxidized carbon,

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:58.170
those electrons had
to go somewhere,

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.300
something else
had to be reduced.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.910
That was pyruvate to
lactate and fermentation,

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:08.070
or oxygen to water via all of
the oxidative phosphorylation

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:09.690
things we just talked about.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:11.190
And so in this case,
those electrons

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:12.700
have to come from somewhere.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.340
And those electrons ultimately,
for photosynthesis--

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.650
this reduction,
the electrons come

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:26.420
from oxidation,
ultimately, of water,

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:34.020
which will generate oxygen.
And this is effectively then

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.390
the reverse of what
you learned about

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.840
for the mitochondrial
electron transport.

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.890
Why this?

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:49.980
Well, water is very abundant,
has been for all of life

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:50.700
on Earth.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:55.480
Water is-- obviously,
life depends on water.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:02.820
And so you can oxidize
the water to generate

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:06.030
oxygen. This will obviously
generate electrons that

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.390
can be used to reduce carbon.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:13.140
And it's effectively the
photosynthetic oxidation

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.970
of water to make oxygen that
was the source of oxygen

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.030
in the atmosphere
that, really, today

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:24.040
makes aerobic life possible.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.358
Now, of course, the fact that
oxygen is a good electron

00:51:27.358 --> 00:51:29.400
acceptor-- we've been
talking about this forever.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.710
This means that, of
course, you might

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:36.180
guess that delta G naught
prime for this process

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.660
is not going to be favorable.

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.690
To put it another way,
oxygen is a great electron

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:46.360
acceptor and water is
a poor electron donor.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.350
And so, really, the
way photosynthesis--

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:51.780
the magic of
photosynthesis, if you will,

00:51:51.780 --> 00:52:00.300
is making water a good electron
donor, because, ultimately,

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.840
that is what is going
to make this whole thing

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.330
work energetically.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:13.620
And so you probably could guess
that if these processes are

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.990
really about these
electron transfers,

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:17.760
we need electron carriers.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.460
This is true for
photosynthesis, just

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:25.080
as it was true for
oxidative phosphorylation.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.660
But remember, we'll describe
a lot of the same electron

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:28.830
carriers that are used.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.510
But as we described
them, remember

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:32.410
that the photosynthesis
came first.

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:36.540
And so the other processes, like
OXPHOS, that use these electron

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.490
carriers, use them
because they were first

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:39.990
used in photosynthesis.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:45.610
And then they were repurposed
for oxidative phosphorylation.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.370
Now, to discuss this,
I want to first start

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:52.540
by introducing an
electron carrier that's

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:57.370
important for this that's
really a variation on NADH.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:00.520
And it's an electron
carrier that's found in--

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.050
excuse me-- all plants,
all animals, all life,

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:08.440
and is very important
in anabolic pathways

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.960
like photosynthesis.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.840
Remember that anabolism,
building stuff,

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.020
has to be distinct from
catabolism, breaking stuff

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.820
down, for a number of reasons.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.910
We saw this in glycolysis
and gluconeogenesis, glycogen

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:24.430
synthesis, glycogen breakdown.

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:28.160
Remember, delta G naught prime
can only favor one direction.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.117
And so in the direction
that's favorable, it works.

00:53:31.117 --> 00:53:33.200
In the other direction to
actually make it happen,

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.770
we have to make delta
G less than zero.

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:37.660
That has to happen
by energy addition.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.900
And so now we had to have
these separate pathways.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.820
You also need separate
pathways because that

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.270
allows separate regulation,
avoids futile cycle,

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:49.840
and enables cells to match
needs with processes.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.450
And as we already
discussed, one way

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:55.660
to keep these anabolic and
catabolic processes distinct

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.730
is by building separate
compartments, right?

00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:59.863
It's useful to have
separate compartments,

00:53:59.863 --> 00:54:01.780
different conditions in
different compartments

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.820
that can favor different
things happening.

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.630
However, not all cells
have separate compartments.

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:09.130
Prokaryotes don't.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:11.830
And you might
think of situations

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:14.440
where you clearly
want to have two

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:16.270
different types of
reactions happening

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:17.680
in the same compartment.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:22.120
And so what if you want to
both do oxidation and reduction

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.230
in different reactions
in the same compartment?

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:28.630
Well, clearly you
need some way that

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:31.780
will favor some
reactions being oxidation

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.600
and other reactions
being reductions.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:42.940
And if you simply rely on
NADH/NAD+ as your oxidant

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:47.490
or your reductant, this
now becomes a problem.

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.940
All right?

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:53.590
So a solution is, well, let's
make a distinct electron

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:57.410
carrier for the oxidation
reactions in the cells.

00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:00.130
So that's what this is.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.740
Turns out, you
keep your NAD/NADH

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:06.940
to largely favor the oxidation
reactions you want to do.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.570
And let's create a different
currency for reduction.

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:14.326
And this currency ends up
being a different molecule,

00:55:14.326 --> 00:55:15.300
NADPH/NADP+.

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:24.415
And you use this as a
cofactor pair for reduction.

00:55:24.415 --> 00:55:26.380
Well, what is NADPH?

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:34.130
Well, it's effectively
the same thing as NADH.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.770
But now you mark it
as a separate pool

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:42.290
with a two prime phosphate
on the ADP portion

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:43.765
of the molecule.

00:55:43.765 --> 00:55:44.890
Let me draw it out for you.

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:27.010
OK.

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:30.400
So this here is NA--

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.600
so if I took this phosphate
off, this would be NADH,

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.480
put a two prime
phosphate on, now I

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.500
mark this as a separate
molecule pool, NADPH.

00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:50.600
A is an adenine.

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:54.630
Remember, it's a nicotinamide
adenine dinucleoside.

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:55.130
OK?

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:59.510
So here's a adenine, phosphate,
phosphate, other nucleoside

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.100
with the nicotinamide group.

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.890
This here is in
the reduced form.

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:12.000
Seen this now a
million times, but we

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.760
can oxidize it as possible.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:19.280
That generates this two
electron hydride ion.

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:35.500
So remove two electrons and now
this nicotinamide form is here

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:45.860
in the NADP+ or oxidized
form of the molecule.

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:49.300
And so effectively by marking
this as a separate pool with

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:55.300
that two prime phosphate, you
can have a different NADH/NAD+

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.740
ratio in cells.

00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:01.870
Then you have NADH/NADP+
plus ratio and cells.

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:04.510
Use one co-factor
fair pair to favor

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:07.390
oxidation and the
other co-factor pair

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:10.490
to favor reduction.

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:14.480
And so I want to give
a quick aside on NADPH

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.510
because it's really
also NADPH that

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:22.640
can be very important in keeping
the cytosol of cells reduced.

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.900
So what do I mean by that?

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:27.370
Well, you remember you
learned from Professor Yaffe.

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:30.530
We talked about proteins
that you can have

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:32.900
these inside the side cytosol.

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:36.170
You'd have your cystine
residues on proteins

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:38.480
be in this reduced form.

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.950
And outside the cell, you'd form
these disulfide bonds, which

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:45.440
is basically oxidized cystine.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:50.150
And so in the cytosol, you want
your cystine residues reduced.

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:52.100
And outside of the
cell, you end up

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:56.380
with these disulfide
bonds on proteins.

00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:01.330
Why does cystine tend to get
oxidized outside the cell?

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:04.420
Well, there's lots of
oxygen in our atmosphere.

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.580
Oxygen's a good
electron acceptor.

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.650
It's very good at oxidation.

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:12.100
In fact, that's what gives
it this property that makes

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.410
oxidative phosphorylation work.

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:17.530
And so it turns out
that these cystines,

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:20.890
these sulfhydryl groups, like to
give their electrons to oxygen.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:24.100
And that leads to these
more oxidized things

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:25.760
outside the cell.

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.960
In fact, oxygen is very
good at accepting electrons

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.940
from lots of donors.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:35.740
So if you have iron 2+ sitting
around outside the cell,

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:41.950
oxygen is very good at oxidizing
that iron 2+ to iron 3+.

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:43.840
That's rust.

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.130
And this process, in the end,
ends up transferring electrons

00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:52.850
to oxygen and can generate
lots of oxygen species,

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:54.830
including oxygen radicals.

00:59:54.830 --> 01:00:00.000
And so you can get things
like this O2- superoxide,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:11.170
ultimately hydrogen
peroxide, also

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:15.380
comes from oxygen
picking up electrons.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.090
And as you know, very
reactive molecules like this

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:23.380
can damage membranes,
damage proteins, kill cells.

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.930
What do we use hydrogen
peroxide for in daily life?

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:29.080
Use it to clean wounds,
kills a bunch of bacteria.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:34.900
And ultimately, production
of these so-called ROS,

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:42.260
or reactive oxygen
species, in excess

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.170
can be very bad for
biological systems.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.300
And this is one of
the arguments for why

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.860
antioxidants are good for us.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.900
They protect us and ourselves
from these reactive oxygen

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.940
species.

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:56.960
OK.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.260
Now, cells, of course,
have endogenous ways

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:03.560
to deal with this, to keep
cystines in our cytosol

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.440
reduced, to keep our cytosol
in this reducing environment,

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.200
prevent this ROS damage.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.480
And really, if
you're going to have

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.760
things to deal with these
reactive molecules, what do

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.180
you want?

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.722
Well, you want
something that's going

01:01:15.722 --> 01:01:19.963
to buffer the damage that
these things can cause.

01:01:19.963 --> 01:01:21.380
That is, if these
things are going

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.800
to react with lipids and
proteins and cause damage

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.510
and you want to keep
the cytosol reduced,

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:28.520
you really want to have
a series of molecules

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.050
that will actually, instead,
undergo this process before it

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.840
can damage critical
structures in the cell.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.270
And a key system cells
use to do this is

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:42.020
something called glutathione.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.120
So what is glutathione?

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.480
Well, glutathione is a
small molecule tripeptide.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:48.980
All right?

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:54.320
And it's among the most abundant
small molecules found in cells.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.480
And effectively,
what glutathione does

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.680
is it serves this purpose
of reacting with nasty stuff

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:06.530
before it can damage other
biomolecules and hurt the cell.

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:09.440
And so by tripeptide,
what it is is it's

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.810
a tripeptide of glutamate
with a gamma peptide bond

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:16.790
to glycine and then cystine--

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:20.900
so glutamate glycine
cystine tripeptide

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.190
that looks like this.

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:38.670
OK.

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:43.520
So this here is the
amino acid glutamate.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.602
Here's the alpha carbon
with the carboxylic acid

01:02:48.602 --> 01:02:49.310
and amine groups.

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:52.490
So you would typically think of
the peptide bond of glutamate

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:55.910
was in a chain as being
from this nitrogen

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:59.480
to the next amino acid and that
carbon to the next amino acid.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.210
But in this case, it uses the
nitrogen on the side chain,

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.560
the so-called
gamma linkage here,

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.380
to form a peptide bond with--

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:15.400
oops, sorry.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.620
This would be glutamic acid.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.410
It uses this gamma
carboxylic acid

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:26.790
on the side chain of glutamate
to form a peptide bond

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:29.790
with glycine.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.180
OK.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:39.210
So this is glutamate.

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:41.730
This is glycine.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:59.740
And then this has a
peptide bond to cystine,

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:03.610
which contributes that
sulfhydryl group that

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:07.720
can either exist in
this reduced form.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:14.780
Or, if there's two
of them together,

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.340
you can go into
this oxidized form.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:25.330
And so, often, this is drawn as
glutathione GSH in the reduced

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:26.450
form.

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:32.260
And if you have two glutathione
molecules that then basically

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:37.150
form a disulfide bond
to give you this GSSG

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:41.050
oxidized form of the molecule.

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:45.430
And NADPH plays a
key role in the cell,

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:46.990
because that's an
oxidation reduction

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:50.800
reaction in keeping glutathione
in the reduced form.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.480
So if you have two
GSH molecules that

01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:00.070
can cycle to a oxidized GSSG--

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:06.230
so this is reduced,
this is oxidized.

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:09.880
On the other side you can
cycle those electrons.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.630
If something gets
oxidized, something else

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:13.260
has to be reduced.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:18.410
So you can have NADP+ and NADPH.

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:26.660
This is reduced.

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.100
This is oxidized.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:34.640
And so by maintaining a
high ratio of NADH to NADP+,

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.590
you can keep a high ratio of
reduced to oxidize glutathione

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:44.030
in the cell and keep the
cell in a protected reducing

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:49.220
environment where you have these
glutathione molecules to react

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:53.630
with other things before it
causes damage to the cell.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:54.510
All right.

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:58.250
A little bit of a diversion,
but a very important system

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:02.720
that cells use related to
oxidation reduction and NADPH,

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.420
and needed a place to talk about
it somewhere in the course.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:06.920
All right.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.440
Now back to photosynthesis.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.090
Now, for photosynthesis,
this reduced

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:17.000
NADPH molecule's
of course useful,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.970
because it can serve as
a source of electrons

01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:23.660
to donate carbons to reduce CO2.

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:29.330
So if you're going to reduce
CO2 to make carbohydrate or fat,

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:30.860
you need this
source of electrons.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:38.020
Those can come from NADPH,
which can be oxidized to NADP+.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.120
And so perhaps at
this point, you've

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.040
already guessed or
maybe already know

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:48.340
that photosynthesis uses the
favorable electron transfer

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:52.690
from water to generate NADPH.

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:56.540
And to do that, you use
the energy of the sun.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:00.760
Now, of course, if you're going
to do a favorable electron

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:06.220
transfer, that can be coupled,
just like we talked about

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:12.640
for oxidative phosphorylation,
to make delta psi/delta pH.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.550
And if we can use that
favorable electron transfer

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:18.460
to make delta psi/delta
pH, we can also

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:23.920
use it to do other work,
including making ATP exactly

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.540
as we described for
oxidative phosphorylation.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.500
And at the highest level, this
is exactly how photosynthesis

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.920
traps solar energy
and uses that energy

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:41.820
to both remake reduced
carbon and generates

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.970
a battery for the
photosynthetic organism that

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:48.390
can be used to make
ATP or do other work,

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:52.410
provided that sun is available.

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:55.770
And so classically,
photosynthesis

01:07:55.770 --> 01:08:00.090
can really be separated into, I
guess, two distinct processes.

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:00.940
All right?

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:09.240
So you have this process
of taking solar energy,

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.680
using that solar
energy to charge up

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.210
a battery, delta psi/delta pH,
which of course can be used

01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:22.620
to generate ATP or do other
work, and at the same time

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:27.630
gives you an electron
donor, NADPH,

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:32.010
that is useful to
generate reduced carbon.

01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:40.319
Once you generate, high ATP/ADP
ratio, high NADPH/NADP ratio.

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:45.120
Now we can use that to
be couple to do something

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.370
else unfavorable.

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:51.870
And that would be
something like reduced CO2

01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:54.000
to generate a carbohydrate.

01:08:57.310 --> 01:09:00.580
And typically, when we
talk about photosynthesis,

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.350
the way it's often
described is how you

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:04.210
reduced CO2 to carbohydrate.

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:05.470
And we'll do that too.

01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:09.399
But of course, we'll then see
once you have carbohydrates,

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.800
obviously, it's just
further reduction of carbon

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.569
to make fatty acids and lipids.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.460
We'll discuss later
how we can use

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.109
those to make amino
acids, which would

01:09:20.109 --> 01:09:21.800
allow you to make proteins.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:28.890
And, of course, we can also
store those carbohydrates

01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:32.920
as disaccharides or
polysaccharides, storage

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.140
sugars, which is what plants do.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.930
They make starch, they
make sucrose, et cetera,

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:41.229
as a way to store
that reduce carbon

01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:44.439
so that they can have
a source of energy,

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:47.950
do the oxidation reactions, to
deal with their energetic needs

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:50.710
when the sun is not shining.

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:52.189
All right.

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:58.150
So let's break down
these two processes.

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:01.510
And so to just be very
explicit, the first part

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:06.400
is basically trapping
energy to make a battery.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.540
All right?

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.830
And so this means that we need
to generate delta psi/delta

01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:16.810
pH via favorable electron
transport, exactly what we

01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:17.960
describe for OXPHOS.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.200
But, of course,
photosynthesis was first.

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.440
This would then allow us to use
ATP to fill our energy needs.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.550
And we get NADPH if we set it
up in the right way, which is

01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:30.360
important for carbon reduction.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:34.170
Then we need to use NADPH
and ATP via pathways

01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:38.370
to describe how we can use that
to reduce CO2, and ultimately

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:42.940
produce glucose, which allows
us to store energy for later.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:43.440
All right.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.890
So that is, at a very high
level, what photosynthesis is.

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:50.100
And, of course, this
occurs in plants.

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.730
All right?

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:53.680
But perhaps more
importantly, it also

01:10:53.680 --> 01:11:10.190
occurs in algae and other
unicellular eukaryotes

01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:17.670
as well as in prokaryotes--
photosynthetic prokaryotes,

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.050
bacteria.

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.870
And, of course,
photosynthetic bacteria,

01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:24.210
unicellular eukaryotes, algae--

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:26.890
these really are
the heroes of life.

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:30.450
These are the things that life
started from, and generated

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:32.670
the oxygenated
atmosphere, and ultimately

01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:35.280
led to the evolution
of higher plants,

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.660
but also enabled the
formation of animal life,

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:44.880
and really anything that lives
off of eating other organisms.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.610
Just a few facts
about photosynthesis

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:51.310
because it's really quite
an amazing process--

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:56.850
and so about 10 to the
17th kilojoules, at least

01:11:56.850 --> 01:12:04.730
by some estimate, of energy
is harvested on our planet

01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:07.400
from photosynthesis every year.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.950
Just to give you a perspective
of what that number means,

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:14.180
that is 10 times the
worldwide energy use

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.530
by all people on Earth.

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:18.680
So if you add up all the
energy that we as humans use

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.210
in the world, it is tenfold
less than the amount of energy

01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:27.630
that is harvested
by photosynthesis,

01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:31.720
by photosynthetic
organisms around the world.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.550
Photosynthetic organisms, when
they do this, consume CO2.

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:37.330
All right?

01:12:37.330 --> 01:12:40.060
So that is removing
CO2, the greenhouse

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:43.820
gas from our atmosphere.

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.970
And this occurs on
a massive scale.

01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:51.700
So this is better than any
man-made engineering solution

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.040
that we have come
up with by far.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.100
And I think this
really illustrates

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.640
the awesome power
of biology to solve

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.790
some of the biggest problems
that face our society today.

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:08.930
So world energy problems--

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:16.250
photosynthesis harnesses
a ton of energy.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:18.230
Global warming,
greenhouse gases--

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.990
photosynthesis, better
than almost anything

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:26.190
at dealing with these
CO2 that is produced.

01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:31.567
However, this also illustrates
what some of the problems are

01:13:31.567 --> 01:13:33.650
and what some of the issues
are with fossil fuels,

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:35.600
because what are fossil fuels.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.790
Well, they're
effectively reduced

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:41.900
carbon that is trapped in
the ground somewhere, that is

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:44.430
effectively old photosynthesis.

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:50.000
So these are organisms in many,
many, many, many years ago

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.750
that did photosynthesis,
made reduced carbon that

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:56.480
was effectively
trapped in the ground.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.970
And so the fact that
photosynthesis transducers 10

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:06.380
to 17th kilojoules of energy
per year and we're using 1/10

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.620
of that amount of energy, if
that's all coming from fossil

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:13.790
fuels, that means we're
using 1/10 of a year's worth

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:15.470
of photosynthesis--
and, of course,

01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:18.290
a year is not entirely
stored in the ground--

01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.980
per year.

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.240
So that's a lot of energy.

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.710
And it really comes down to why
people say fossil fuels can't

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:30.890
last forever, and also why the
net release of these things

01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:33.560
can change our atmosphere,
because, of course,

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.370
once upon a time, there was
much more CO2 in the atmosphere.

01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:39.890
And photosynthesis,
over millennia,

01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:42.980
trapping these things
as fossil fuels really

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:46.640
has lowered CO2 in our
atmosphere to the levels

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:51.320
that they exist today,
and how, basically,

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.950
burning fossil fuels on
the scale that we are

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:59.370
is able to change
our atmosphere.

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.880
So you can view this both
as glass half full and glass

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.080
half empty.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.330
It really says
understanding photosynthesis

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:08.430
could be a key to solving
some of these problems.

01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:11.780
But it also points out
why some of these things

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.200
might be problems to begin with.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.310
All right.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:20.380
Now we want to discuss first
how photosynthesis traps energy.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:24.190
And you'll see that it
is similar to oxidative

01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:29.060
phosphorylation in
many, many ways.

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:33.430
So it's going to
occur at a membrane.

01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:35.250
All right?

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:44.220
It's going to involve a
series of protein complexes

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.590
where we're going
to favor, we're

01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:49.320
going to couple
favorable electron

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.760
transport along a
electron transport chain

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.670
to favor proton pumping.

01:15:56.670 --> 01:16:01.730
That is going to generate
a membrane potential delta

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:02.490
psi/delta pH.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:07.190
In order to do
that, of course, we

01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:09.560
need favorable
electron transport

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.360
from something that is
lower standard reduction

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.350
potential to something that
is higher standard reduction

01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.890
potential.

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:21.200
That is what is going
to make it favorable,

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.050
allow proton pumping.

01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:28.370
That, when it generates
delta psi/delta pH,

01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:35.560
we can now harness that
as a way to synthesize

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:42.296
ATP or do other work, as
we've now talked about a lot.

01:16:42.296 --> 01:16:44.046
Looks a lot like
oxidative phosphorylation

01:16:44.046 --> 01:16:45.350
and it makes sense.

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:49.460
Oxidative phosphorylation
came from photosynthesis.

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:52.550
However, there are some
really big differences

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:54.020
between the two.

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:57.260
And that is in photosynthesis,
as I've already alluded

01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:03.710
to, the electron donor
is going to be water,

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:11.960
which will generate oxygen. And
the electron acceptor is NADP+,

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.710
which will generate NADPH.

01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:22.080
And you might now be
asking, well, how on Earth

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.790
can this be possible?

01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:33.830
Because, remember, the standard
reduction potential of NADH

01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:38.630
is less than the standard
reduction potential

01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:42.320
of our oxygen water pair.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:46.430
And it's really this
that makes the change

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:49.580
in standard reduction
potential positive, which

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:53.790
means that delta G is
going to be negative,

01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:56.150
which is why electron
transport and oxidative

01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:58.700
phosphorylation is
favorable and can be coupled

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.510
to make delta psi/delta pH.

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:06.800
Now, adding a
phosphate to NAD/NADH

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.800
does not change its
standard reduction potential

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.980
in a way that is at all
meaningful to impact

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.270
what goes on.

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:19.700
And so this is really where
energy input from the sun

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.410
becomes critical.

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:28.640
And that is-- it is this light
energy from a photon that

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.820
in the end makes water
a good electron donor,

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:36.920
such that all of these other
things are satisfied that

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.180
electron transport is favorable
going from lower to higher

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:47.090
standard reduction potential
with NADP+ ultimately being

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:51.590
the final electron acceptor,
such that the change

01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:55.340
in standard production
potential is positive.

01:18:55.340 --> 01:19:00.385
And that really is the
magic of photosynthesis.

01:19:00.385 --> 01:19:01.760
And, of course,
once you do that,

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.830
now you have delta psi/delta pH.

01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:06.200
You can use that to
make ATP, do other work

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.060
for the photosynthetic organism.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:10.370
And you also get NADPH,
which is an electron

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:12.800
donor for carbon reduction.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:19.370
And the net result is that
you get this familiar formula

01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:22.340
that you learned in grade
school for photosynthesis--

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:32.290
CO2 plus water with light goes
to oxygen plus carbohydrate,

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:37.800
which is, of course, the
exact opposite of combustion.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.740
We talked a lot about how
burning wood combustion is

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.710
the opposite reaction that's
favorable-- lots of energy

01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:48.130
released.

01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:52.650
And so the energy
input here is obviously

01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:58.440
the opposite of that to do
this opposite of combustion

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.510
and stores lots of energy.

01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:05.830
All right, so again,
I want to say why

01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:08.920
use water as an electron donor?

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.180
Well, because it's abundant.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.360
There's nothing particularly
special about water other

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:18.070
than its abundance, just like
we talked about in oxygen is not

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:19.990
really being special
other than that it's

01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:23.170
a good electron
acceptor and abundant.

01:20:23.170 --> 01:20:26.380
You could obviously build
systems that do something other

01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.670
than oxygen and water.

01:20:28.670 --> 01:20:31.000
And so there are
extremophiles out there

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.360
that instead do
hydrogen sulfide to make

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.140
reduced sulfur as another--

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:49.470
sorry, oxidize sulfur as a
way of doing photosynthesis.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:52.170
Exact same concepts
would apply is what

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:55.140
we're going to talk about here.

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:55.650
All right.

01:20:55.650 --> 01:21:00.450
Now, the parts of
photosynthesis,

01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:03.880
as you might guess,
are spatially distinct.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:12.900
That is, we're going to generate
delta psi/delta pH and NADPH.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.690
Those are basically
this electron

01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:19.960
transport chain reactions,
charge the battery, et cetera.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:30.080
And then imagine if we're going
to fix CO2 as carbohydrate.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.480
Well, effectively that's more
like what we talked about

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.130
with gluconeogenesis.

01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:38.960
That's the chemical
reactions that we just

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.440
have to build a pathway
for, like gluconeogenesis.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.480
Now these two things
are often referred

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:56.210
to as the light and dark
reactions of photosynthesis.

01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:59.360
And that's because the
first set of reactions

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.200
generating the membrane
potential and making NADPH

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:07.430
requires solar energy inputs
or requires light from the sun.

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:13.400
This fixing of CO2, which will
just use electrons from NADPH

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.268
to reduce CO2, can occur--

01:22:16.268 --> 01:22:17.810
of course, it can
occur in the light.

01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:19.020
But it doesn't need light.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.960
So it can occur in
the light or the dark,

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.550
hence called the dark reactions.

01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:28.850
And so these light reactions can
really be broken up into water

01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:39.050
plus NADP+ goes to
NADPH plus oxygen.

01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:50.870
And the dark reactions are NADPH
plus CO2 goes to carbohydrate

01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:58.850
plus NADP+, which of
course gives us our net--

01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:07.950
water plus CO2 goes to
carbohydrate plus oxygen.

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:10.860
And in the next lecture,
what we'll talk about is

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.560
we'll go through
the details of how

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:17.520
these light and
dark reactions work.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.310
But when we do so, bear
in mind that we're really

01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:25.350
going to follow all of
the concepts and rules

01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:30.120
that we talked about for past
thermodynamic considerations

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.610
of pathways as
well as what we've

01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:35.820
been discussing about how
oxidative phosphorylation

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.570
works.

01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:38.120
Thanks.

YEN-JIE LEE: So to make
the demo done coherently

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.770
with your lecture,
a lot of preparation

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.020
is actually needed in advance.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.230
So first of all,
you need to make

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.660
a list of the demo
which you would like

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.850
to include in your lecture.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.600
And secondly, you need to work
with our technical instructors

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.210
to set up those demos
so that they work nicely

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.760
during the class.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.800
Usually, I come to
the class, like,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.830
half hour to one hour
before the lecture

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.770
to make sure that everything
is working as I expect.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.220
And also there were a
lot of communication

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.060
between me and my
technical instructors

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.850
to tune the parameters
to what we would

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.360
like to demo during the
class, and to make sure

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.160
that the physical phenomena
can be seen clearly

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.220
from the demo of our choice.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.270
And finally, you
need to decide when

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.220
do you want to do those demos.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.200
And what you are going
to get is that, OK,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.580
omega, omega D
around omega 0, then

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.350
you are going to get
large type amplitude.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.450
OK?

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.100
So now, what I am going
to do is to continue--

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.380
As I mentioned
before, I usually like

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.610
to include the demo after
the calculation is done.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.810
Sometimes maybe it's a
good idea to use the demo

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.050
as a teaser for the
calculation and see that, OK,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.870
we can reproduce this
result by physics intuition

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.400
and mathematical calculation.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.360
So that's actually the
kind of consideration

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.630
when I choose which kind
of demo to be included

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.930
in the lecture and the kind of
preparation before the class,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.070
and finally, the
timing, which I decide

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.420
where to insert those
either experiments

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.273
or analytical calculation using
program during my lecture.

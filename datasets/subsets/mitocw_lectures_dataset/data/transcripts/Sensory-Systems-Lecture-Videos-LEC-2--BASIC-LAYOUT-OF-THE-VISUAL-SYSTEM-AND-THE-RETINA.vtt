00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.560
The first thing I
would like to tell you,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.140
which I did not mention the
last time-- that in the reading

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.160
assignment, the syllabus that
we handed out-- and by the way,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.810
does everybody have one?

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.800
If you don't, we have
some extras here.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.900
You all have one?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.710
Good.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.350
Anyway, as you can
see on the first page,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.600
there is a section called
preparatory reading.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.710
So I would recommend that
if you can each time read

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.460
this recommended reading,
which is available, of course,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.879
on the internet.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.140
And that will make it easier
for you to follow the lecture,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.480
because this course is both
in vision and audition,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.380
and relies on imparting
a great many facts

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.280
about the workings
of these two systems.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.320
And it's easier to be able to
memorize these facts by doing

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.020
the preparatory
reading, if you can.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.770
All right, so today, then,
what we are going to do

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.410
is initially start to
talk about the layout

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.020
of the visual system.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.757
And then we're going to talk
about the retina for much

00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:42.340
of the course.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.210
At the very end, we'll
talk a little bit

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.915
about the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.870
In each case, I
will try to tell you

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.680
about how some people
thought about things,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.620
and what the progression
is of the discoveries that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.810
have been made about
the visual system.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.380
It is certainly an
area of research

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.220
which has been
incredibly successful,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.630
and has resulted in
quite a number of Nobel

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.040
Prizes for the discoveries
that individuals

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.140
had made in uncovering the
workings of the system.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.340
Furthermore, many of the
uncoverings that investigators

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.300
had done came about as
incredible surprises,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.410
because so many of the
findings were quite unexpected.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.000
And I will try to point these
things out during the course.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.390
And my section, as
I mentioned before,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.820
will consist of 12 lectures.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.820
And then that will be
followed on October 23rd

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.540
by a midterm exam.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.010
And again, to
reiterate, that's going

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.190
to consist of a series of
multiple-choice questions.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.730
And then following
that, we'll move on

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.540
to talk about the
auditory system

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.650
that Chris Brown is going
to be presenting to you.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.260
All right, so the first
thing I want to do,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.110
then, is to talk about the basic
wiring of the visual system,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.780
which in itself has yielded a
number of unexpected surprises,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.390
and also raised some
interesting questions.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.880
So what I want to
start with first of all

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.620
is that when you look
at some animals that

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.160
have sideways-looking eyes, like
the rabbit and most amphibians,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.140
the two eyes look out in
two different directions--

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.700
to the left and to the right.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.560
And that enables them to
see a very large portion

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.515
of the visual field.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.710
And when that is the case,
as in this picture shown here

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.460
for the rabbit, what
you find is that there's

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.810
only a small area which
is seen by both eyes.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.630
But then when we look at higher
mammals, and particularly

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.790
primates and humans,
what you find

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.950
is that there was a huge change
in the course of evolution,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.490
bringing the eyes to the front.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:22.670
Now that change is very
interesting, and we can ask,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.660
why on earth did that happen?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.450
Because it meant
that, obviously,

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.470
a human cannot see
behind themselves,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.825
where these rabbits can
see a much larger portion

00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:35.200
of the visual field.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.900
And so you sacrificed
ability to see all the way

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.250
around the world for being
able to see with both eyes

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.400
to the front.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.170
And so the question is,
why did this happen?

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.360
Now we are going to discuss
this in some detail,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.250
because one of the prime
reasons-- I believe

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.470
at least-- that
this has happened

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.060
is to be able to process
information about depth better

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.670
than it can be done by
rabbits and other animals.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.950
And so when we talk
about depth perception,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.650
we are going to deal with
this issue in more detail.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.040
Now if you look at an animal
like a rabbit, what you find--

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:25.810
and also animals which are,
as I've mentioned already,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.940
that you also have in
fish and amphibians,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.090
you have these
sideways looking eyes.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.650
And now we can ask
the question, how

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.250
do these two eyes
make their connections

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.070
through the ganglion cells to
the central nervous system?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.450
And that, in fact, was
quite an issue at one time,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.817
believe it or not, before
anatomical techniques

00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:47.900
became more sophisticated.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.070
And the reason it
became an issue is

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.150
because it was discovered
predominantly, actually,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.890
by Cajal, who I've mentioned
had received the Nobel Prize

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.750
for the beautiful work he
had done on not only vision,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.820
but in general about the
nervous system, in 1906

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.350
with Golgi, he
discovered, as did

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.630
several other investigators,
that the optic nerve crosses

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.190
over at the so-called chiasm.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.810
And so the input
from the left eye

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.440
projects into the right
half of the brain,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.110
and from the right half to
the left half of the brain.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.350
And that became a huge issue--
why on earth would this happen?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.210
And we are going to deal
with this repeatedly.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.600
It's a very interesting issue.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.380
And even more
interesting is the fact

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.040
that when the eyes move to
the front, what happened

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.600
is that this kind of connection
became much more complicated.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.870
But before I do that, let me
just say a few more words here.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.330
First of all, that in
fish and amphibians,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.790
you have a huge structure
called the optic tectum,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:08.100
which is the primary visual
processing center in the brain.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.930
And there is also the
lateral geniculate nucleus

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.900
of the thalamus
in these animals.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.520
But that's quite small, and
not very well developed.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.100
And there is a cortex
in these animals,

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.400
but it is, again, a
primitive area compared

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.590
to primates, for example.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.820
And the lateral geniculate
nucleus projects to the cortex.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.120
So the left cortex
in these animals

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.710
gets input from the right
eye, and the obverse

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.140
is the case for
the right cortex.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.634
And so consequently,
this cortex is

00:07:41.634 --> 00:07:43.550
this part of the visual
field, and this cortex

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.360
is this part of
the visual field.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.060
It's almost like an inversion.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.520
Now we come to what happened
as a result of the eyes

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.350
moving to the front.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.200
When the eyes move to the front
in the course of evolution,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.760
that necessitated a major
rewiring in the visual system.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.330
So that's what we are going to
look at next, because that's

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.090
us.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.630
All right, so what
we have here then,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.900
we have the two eyes
looking to the front.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.440
And imagine that these two
eyes are looking at something.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.790
There's a dot here.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.220
And both eyes are
looking at the same dot,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.570
so that you only
see a single dot.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.260
OK.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.300
So now what happens is
really something surprising.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:33.450
What happens is that the--
let me interrupt for a second

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.309
and tell you that imagine that
you cut your eye-- I mean,

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.570
don't do it-- but imagine that
you cut your eye vertically

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.100
in half, each eye, OK?

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.510
And that means that each
eye has, if you will,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.200
a nasal half and a
temporal half, all right?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.930
So here we have the two eyes.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.340
Here's the left eye.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:59.890
And what we have is a nasal
half, projects across,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.790
and the same thing is
true for the right eye--

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.380
projects across.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.430
But now if you look at
the temporal hemiretinae--

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.660
hemiretinae, remember
that's the word for it--

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.780
something very
interesting happens.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.170
The temporal hemiretinae
don't cross over,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.570
but they remain
on the same side.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.960
So we have a color code here
that the red parts project

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.250
across, and the black parts also
project across from one eye,

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.230
but stay ipsilateral
for the other eye.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.270
So you say, my god,
why did this happen?

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.780
What on earth is going on?

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:44.330
And then if you study this, you
realize that this is actually

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.970
one of the few
truly logical things

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.010
that you encounter when
you study the brain.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.600
Many of the things
you study in the brain

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.460
don't seem to be too
logical, because in the force

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.820
of evolution, you
have to change things

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.510
in very peculiar, subtle
ways to make things work.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.980
You couldn't just redo the
whole system from scratch.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.820
But this is certainly
a logical one,

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.660
and I'll explain it to
you in just a minute.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:14.170
OK, so now what we do
next is that again, we

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.500
have the two lateral
geniculate nuclei,

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.030
but now these are
in the thalamus.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.000
These two nuclei have
grown tremendously in size,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.370
and became much more important
in visual processing,

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.160
as did, then, the cortex.

00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:32.560
This process, by the way,
is called encephalization.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.290
So in primitive animals, they
have a very small cortex.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.300
And then the course of
evolution, the cortex

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.990
grew, and grew,
and grew, and grew,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.500
and became a more
and more important

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.720
structure in being able to
analyze just about anything,

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.090
and certainly analyze vision.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.360
Now here we have a cortical
area in the posterior part

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.640
of the brain, as I pointed
out to you the last time.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.330
And what you have
is a whole series

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.400
of visual areas in the cortex.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.640
The most central
one, I guess, would

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.830
be area V1-- the so-called
primary visual cortex to which

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.040
the lateral geniculate
projects most profusely.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.150
Then we have a whole bunch
of other visual areas,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.650
as we'll discuss in
more detail later on.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.510
And then what happens is that
we have several other cortical

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.060
areas.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.520
The cortex-- I
think you all of you

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.400
know that-- is divided
into four lobes, OK?

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.320
The frontal, temporal,
parietal, and the rear one

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.010
is called the occipital lobes.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.140
All right, now the visual
areas that you see in the back

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.790
here make extensive
interconnections

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:50.060
and connections to these
other lobes in the brain

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.380
to be able to analyze
the visual scene.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.820
Now in addition,
what we have still--

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.570
as we had in more
primitive animals--

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.320
we have a superior colliculus--
actually two of them,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.970
one on each side-- and then
we have another set of areas

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.890
called the terminal
nuclei, the nucleus

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.330
of the optic tract,
about which we will just

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.780
talk a little bit,
because they are

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.260
specializing in certain
visual functions,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.870
but not nearly as compelling
and interesting as the work that

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.010
has been done in
the cortical areas

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.900
and in the superior colliculi.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.440
So this is the arrangement.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.660
But now we want to
understand, why do you

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.660
have this strange
connection here?

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.450
So to understand that, what
we are going to talk about

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.960
is the so-called horopter
or the Vieth-Muller circle.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.850
Now what is that?

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.970
Some clever guy came up
with this observation.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.540
They made a circle that
goes through the nodal point

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.590
of the eye.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.890
And its diameter depends
on where you're fixating.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:13:01.700
So fixating here, in
this case, the red area,

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.850
which is your left
visual hemifield,

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.630
impinges on the nasal
retina of the left eye

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.565
and the temporal retina
of the other eye.

00:13:10.565 --> 00:13:14.710
So if you have an
object here, that

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:20.070
hits corresponding retinal
elements in the two eyes.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.870
And that is a basic rule.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.500
Anywhere along this
horopter, a spot

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.970
will activate corresponding
regions in the two eyes.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:35.020
And then what happens is that
those corresponding points

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.340
go to the same location in the
lateral geniculate nucleus,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.830
and in the superior colliculus,
and in the visual cortex.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.210
So the logic of
this arrangement is

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.120
to be able to have the
two eyes have input

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.080
to corresponding
points in the brain.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.010
That way, you can see
something uniform and clear,

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.660
rather than seeing double.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.500
So that is, then,
the arrangement

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.655
that you have in primates.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.210
Now just to anticipate a
little bit-- whenever images

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.470
fall inside or
outside the circle,

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.832
they do fall on
non-correspondent points,

00:14:11.832 --> 00:14:13.290
and that will have
something to do.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.880
And I keep you just curious
about that for the time being,

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.260
about how we process depth.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.710
And that is a mechanism
that is involved,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.160
so it's called stereopsis.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.660
I've mentioned that very
briefly the last time.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:34.700
OK, so that then summarises
the basic connections

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.800
of the system.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.780
And then what we
are going to do next

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.420
is we're going to
go to the retina,

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.770
and look at in more detail
about how the retina is made.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.380
And then we will go
in successive steps

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.490
to higher areas, sometimes
going back and forth,

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.510
to try to understand visual
processing in general.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.350
All right, so now let's
begin by looking at the eye.

00:14:58.995 --> 00:15:04.380
Now I don't expect you to
know all these names here,

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.640
but you should remember, of
course, the lens, the cornea.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.980
You know that already.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.434
You know the iris, right?

00:15:10.434 --> 00:15:11.100
What's the iris?

00:15:12.214 --> 00:15:13.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.340
PROFESSOR: OK, now
what do we base

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:22.580
our views on the color of
the eye when you say somebody

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.920
has blue eyes, or
somebody has brown eyes?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.720
It's based on the fact
of what the coloring is

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.330
of the iris, all right?

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.530
Now, what's the iris?

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:39.210
The iris can get
bigger and smaller

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:44.860
to control the size of
the opening into the lens.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.050
All right?

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.780
It's much like what you
have in cameras, where

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.700
they have the so-called
f-stop, right?

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.360
So if you have a
large number, say f/16

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.910
on a camera, that is set
to 16 if you do it manually

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.480
when it's bright out there.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.020
But when it's dim out there,
like we have in this camera

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.580
here, we have the lens
wide open because it's

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.130
pretty dark in here.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:17.830
Then you have a low f-stop,
like an f/4 or even lower,

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.540
to allow more light to come in--
more photons to enter the eye.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.590
Now next is-- here's the lens.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.747
And the fascinating thing about
the lens is that in the eye,

00:16:30.747 --> 00:16:35.380
the lens is totally different
from the way it is in a camera.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.740
Now, maybe by now
many of you don't even

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.750
know the details about a
camera, but one of the details,

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:53.680
of course, is that to
bring an image into focus,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.510
you have to adjust the distance
of the lens from the film

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.080
onto which the
image projects, OK?

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.520
So the closer an image, the
further out the lens has to go.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:10.829
Now, if that were the case
in animals and humans,

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.607
you would have a
super-bulging eye,

00:17:12.607 --> 00:17:14.190
so when you look at
something closely,

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.525
the eye would go out like that.

00:17:15.525 --> 00:17:17.500
And that would be
really disturbing.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:23.869
So that is not the case,
because what happened instead

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:28.780
is something very clever that
you don't see in cameras, which

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.520
is that you have this lens here,
which is-- at least in younger

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:41.140
people-- is an organ that
can vary in thickness.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.700
So you have here some
muscles, the ciliary muscles,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:53.680
which are just the
thickness of this lens,

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.470
to allow it to focus
properly on the retina.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.710
Now here, the
retina goes around,

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.750
is against the inner
wall of the eye.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.000
You all know that, of course.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.860
And to explain how this
is done, then-- very,

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.680
very crudely-- here we have it.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.630
If you have an
object really near,

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.570
you want the lens to be
thick to properly focus

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.950
the image on the retina.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.220
And if the image is
far, you have to thin

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:29.060
the lens to get the proper
focus on the retina.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.862
So that's how the
lens works, at least

00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:35.070
when you're reasonably young.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.120
But then when you get
older, what happens

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.210
is that the lens
becomes progressively

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.150
stiffer and stiffer.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.440
And because of that, you have
to start wearing glasses.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.860
Now, in the olden
days, they used

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.890
to have lenses which came
in two parts-- bifocals.

00:18:58.892 --> 00:19:00.350
So if you looked
in the upper part,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.558
you could look at a distance.

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:04.320
If you looked in the lower
part, you could look close.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.200
Nowadays, they have
graduated lenses,

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.580
so if you look in the upper
part, you can look far.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.200
And if you want to
look [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.370
look down below, and then
you can see that in focus.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.000
So once you get
older, these lenses

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.960
don't adjust as much--
still a little bit.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.890
But the proof that this is
not that important, thank god,

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:34.380
now that we have these graded
lenses and we have bifocals--

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.040
is that a lot of
people in old age,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.040
who develop-- and sometimes
not even in old age-- in India,

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.205
for example, there are a lot of
young kids who have cataracts.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.970
Now what are cataracts?

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:54.380
Cataracts interfere with
the processing of vision

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.270
through the lens system,
and things become unclear,

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:03.980
because all kinds of blockage
occurs in the lens itself.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.650
So how is that corrected?

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.590
The way that's corrected
nowadays, is that you have

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.860
what is called cataract surgery.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.420
So what they do,
then, is they actually

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.440
literally remove the
lens from the eye,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.760
and they put in a fixed lens
made out of plastic or glass.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.240
And then, obviously, since
there's no adjustment,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.610
you do have to wear glasses
to look at things far away

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.210
and look at things close.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.720
And most of the time, those
would be graduated lenses.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.420
And so people who
have cataract surgery

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.510
can see extremely well,
certainly a lot better

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.825
than having to try to deal with
lenses that have cataracts.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:58.460
All right.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.970
Now there's one other point
I want to make about the eye

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.020
here before we move
on-- maybe two points.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.440
One is about this
part of the eye--

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.130
that you have here your
so-called iris, OK?

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.610
And what do you call what's
in the center of the iris?

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.540
AUDIENCE: Pupil.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.170
PROFESSOR: Pupil, very good.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.300
Now what is the
color of the pupil?

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.240
In most people,
it's black, right?

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.500
Why is it black?

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.661
How come the pupil is black?

00:21:32.661 --> 00:21:33.660
Any thoughts about that?

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.870
OK, well, let me tell you.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.400
And I think what I'll do
is actually I'll move on.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.280
First I'll leave this unanswered
for just a few minutes.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:50.410
This I've shown
you before, which

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.480
is another amazing
thing about the eye--

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.980
namely that in the
fovea, you have something

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:05.910
like 200,000 cones per
square millimeter-- 200,000.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.990
As you go five degrees out,
it reduces tenfold to 20,000.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.170
And then you go 10 degrees,
it reduces by half.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.070
So because of this
very high density--

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.120
I've mentioned this
before-- in the fovea,

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.510
you have high acuity.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.120
And that is one of
the prime reasons

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.260
you have to move your eye around
so that you can see things

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.070
in fine detail.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.430
All right, so now let's
take another step here,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.425
and look at the retina itself.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.800
And let me first of
all point out to you,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.732
I have reversed the image
to have it right-side up.

00:22:47.732 --> 00:22:49.565
The light actually comes
in from the bottom,

00:22:49.565 --> 00:22:52.500
and goes through all
these cells until it

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.500
hits the photoreceptors.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.320
Here are the photoreceptors.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.680
And at the closest
point to eye, what we

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.300
have is called the
pigment epithelium.

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:07.070
OK, so what's the
pigment epithelium?

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.850
The pigment epithelium
is a single layer

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:16.210
of cells that are
pigmented to such a degree

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.180
that when photons
come into the eye

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.990
and get to the
pigment epithelium,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.530
they get absorbed just
like a black surface,

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:33.050
that you see as a black
surface, absorbs the photons

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.200
and doesn't reflect them.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.875
So because of that, there's
no reflection back out.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:48.480
And that explains why
the pupil looks black,

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.860
because the light that
comes into the eye

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.880
doesn't reflect back out.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.080
Now there's a good
reason for that,

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.060
because if it were to reflect
back out, it would scatter,

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:06.090
and it would activate many
more photoreceptors receptors

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.750
than it should, and because of
that, you get blurred vision.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.940
Now how do we know this?

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:20.280
Can you think of any
one species of animal

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.708
where the pigment
epithelium is not black?

00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:25.458
AUDIENCE: In cats.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.940
PROFESSOR: OK, in cat, OK.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.260
So there's some
animals, you see mostly

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:39.060
in animals that specialize
in nocturnal vision, that

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.860
have a pigment epithelium
which actually has purposefully

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.180
reflecting molecules in it.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.590
For them, this is called,
actually, the tapetum.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:57.070
And the purpose of that
is to improve the ability

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:01.080
to see so that the photons
activate the photoreceptors not

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.170
only in one direction, but
also when they bounce back.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.630
Now the tapetum is arranged in
such a way, in most animals,

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.910
that it doesn't freely
scatter the light,

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:14.180
but scatters in a fairly
directional manner.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.860
And because of that,
you can see pretty well.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.450
Now I'm sure that many
of you have noticed

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:28.120
that when you drive at
night, in a the deserted area

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.750
in the United States-- which
are decreasing, of course--

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:39.070
you can see sometimes
deer on the highway,

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.190
or rabbits for that matter.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.870
And when you see them,
it looks like they

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:48.970
have two flashlights
projecting at you.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:49.720
It's almost scary.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:56.420
But it also helps you by being
able to avoid hitting them.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.530
Now that's because they have
that reflecting tapetum,

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.030
all right?

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.500
Let's look at a
different example.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:08.930
What other human can you
think of who does not

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:14.030
have a black pigment
epithelium or for that matter,

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.100
some animals as well.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:15.600
Yes?

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.180
AUDIENCE: Albino.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.570
PROFESSOR: Very good-- albinos.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.880
Now what's albinos?

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.580
Albinos are
individuals, or animals,

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:30.720
who lack pigment in their
skin, and, of course,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.560
in their retinae.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:39.770
So if you look at
the eye of an albino,

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.390
actually their
pupil is not black.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.354
Their pupil is--

00:26:44.354 --> 00:26:45.410
AUDIENCE: Red.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.960
PROFESSOR: Reddish, very good.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.500
Why is it reddish?

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:59.280
Because you have thousands
of-- in the retina,

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.240
especially mostly on the
outside here as well,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.125
you have blood vessels.

00:27:06.535 --> 00:27:07.910
And the blood
vessels, since they

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.030
carry blood, when light
reflects from them,

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.400
they will have a
reddish color to them,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.980
and thereby endow, if you will,
the pupil with a reddish color.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:23.100
The pupil with a reddish color.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.625
Now, the proof that the
main function of the pigment

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:31.530
epithelium is to absorb the
incoming light, to prevent

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.740
scattering, is in
the fact that albinos

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.810
that lack this pigment
epithelium have

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.740
very poor vision.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.490
They often have vision to
20 over 200 or something,

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:51.120
because the light scatters
from the epithelium which

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.840
is no longer pigmented
in these people,

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.370
and activates many
photoreceptors,

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.415
thereby reducing the ability to
see things clearly and sharply.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.090
All right, so now let's go
through this retina here.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.375
First of all, we have
the rods and the cones.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:18.370
Now this brings me to a very
interesting story-- at least

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.720
for me an interesting story.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:27.590
Back in the 19th century,
there was a person

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:36.260
whose name was Max Schultze.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.880
I'm trying to remember
when he lived.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:45.390
He lived from 1825 to 1874.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.355
He developed some new
anatomical procedures.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:57.020
And as I mentioned before,
whenever new techniques emerge

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.000
or are invented, it's
likely that you're

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.170
going to make some
interesting new discoveries.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:11.280
And so he was the first person,
by then looking at the retina

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.300
and looking at the
photoreceptors,

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.740
that he said there are
two different kinds

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:23.470
of photoreceptors--
the rods and the cones.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.550
The rods are sort of, like
the name implies, rods.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.770
And the cones are sort
of, as the name implies,

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:33.750
conish looking.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.640
So he looked at that and looked
at that, and said why on earth

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.450
would we have in most
animals rods and cones?

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.890
What is their function?

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.930
This was a totally
new discovery.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.360
When he first published
this, nobody believed him.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.380
They said, oh, they
just vary randomly,

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.807
and some are more rod-like
and some are more cone-like,

00:29:56.807 --> 00:29:58.390
but it's just the
same photoreceptors.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.220
So he, of course,
did not accept that.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.960
He saw, by being very
careful about it,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.942
that it was definitely
two different classes

00:30:08.942 --> 00:30:10.275
just like it is in this picture.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.540
And so he began to
ask the question, why

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.860
on earth do we have this?

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.710
So imagine yourself in
the 19th century coming up

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.180
with this incredible
discovery, and trying

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.810
to figure out why we have them.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.840
Now if you're a
really good scientist,

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.210
then you start to
think analytically.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.590
And so what did he do?

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.970
I'm so impressed to this day.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.800
He said, well, let me take
a closer look at the retina

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.110
and see how the
rods and the cones

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.950
are distributed on
the retinal surface.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:53.190
And he discovered, to go back to
the previous slide, that there

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.990
is a small region
here, the fovea,

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.480
where there are only cones.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.439
There are no rods.

00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:02.730
And I'll show you a better
picture of that in a minute.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.180
And he said, my god,
if that's the case,

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.690
there must be something
different about the way

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:14.720
we see in the fovea than
we can see in areas where

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.550
you have lots of rods.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.370
So what did he discover?

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:26.885
He discovered that in the fovea
we don't see too well at night.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.340
OK, on the basis of
that, he concluded

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.280
that the rods are
for night vision.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.600
Now this was
absolutely incredible.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.410
There's only one sad
part in this story, which

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:51.890
is that this discovery was
made in the early 19th century,

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:56.570
but before the Nobel
Prize was initiated,

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.260
because had the Nobel Prize
been initiated before you made

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.520
this discovery,
there's no question

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.700
that he would have received
the Nobel Prize for it.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.500
It's such an incredible
magnitude of discovery.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.620
All right, so let's
go back here then,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.060
and I pointed out the rods
and the cones and the pigment

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.560
epithelium.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.910
Now let's go through
here and I'll

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.130
tell you about the
rest of the elements.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:24.860
And then this time, and also
in several subsequent sessions,

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.830
we'll talk about some of these
elements in much more detail,

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:32.780
especially about the
retinal ganglion cells.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:37.420
So anyway, when you come
here to the next stage here,

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.300
we have the so-called horizontal
cells and bipolar cells.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.350
It's been established that
the photoreceptors connect

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.070
with both of these.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:51.790
And then the bipolar cells
connect into the inner portion

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.260
of the retina, just as
I'll show you in a minute.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.480
Now this region here
is called the OPL,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.870
and it's easy to remember--
outer plexiform layer.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.825
Now then, when you get into
the deeper parts of the retina,

00:33:04.825 --> 00:33:09.400
you have the so-called amacrine
cells and ganglion cells,

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.300
and they reside in the
inner plexiform layer.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:21.370
Now it is the ganglion cells
that project out of the eye

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:26.290
and then project,
as we had shown you,

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:32.583
to various regions in the
brain, most notably that we're

00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:35.890
going to talk about today the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:51.440
Now let me also point out at
this stage to you some numbers.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.720
Here is an enlarged, highly
simplified view of rods.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:02.490
Now, the rods are constructed
in an incredibly complex way.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:06.000
They have these individual
so-called disks.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.160
And within each of these
disks-- there are about 1,000

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.330
of them-- I only have
25, here, I think, or 24.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:17.050
There are about 1,000 of
these in each rod, OK?

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.050
And within each of
these disks, you

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.410
have about 10,000
rhodopsin molecules.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.230
There are several kinds
of opsins, so-called.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.040
Rhodopsins are the
ones you see in rods,

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.105
in there are different
kinds of opsins in cones.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:45.070
And these are the photosensitive
molecules in your receptors,

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.420
so that when a photon
comes in and hits

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:54.280
one of these molecules,
they change shape.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.469
And the simplest way
of thinking about this

00:34:56.469 --> 00:35:00.350
is to say that these molecules,
these rhodopsin molecules,

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.095
come in two different shapes.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:08.530
And these two different
shapes are what we call,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:14.930
very simply, those
that are open and those

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.070
are the sort of
closed, if you're

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.900
describing the molecular shape.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.740
And the easiest way to think
of them as that they're

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.840
bleached or unbleached.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.720
And so there are millions
of these molecules,

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:33.710
and what is that, 10
million in each rod.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.320
And you know how many rods
there are in the average eye?

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:44.840
About 120 million, and about
five or six million cones.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.850
And you're talking about
unbelievable numbers.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.060
It's just hard to comprehend.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.860
But at any rate,
the molecules here,

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:57.670
then, are two different states--
bleached and unbleached.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:01.230
What that means is
when a molecule shifts

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.050
from being unbleached
to bleached

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:06.310
as a result of a
photon hitting it,

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:13.960
that changes the overall--
I'm talking about, of course,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.970
hundreds of molecules,
typically-- the overall degree

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.100
of de- and hyper-polarization
of the cell.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.150
And that will then determine
whether the cell is going

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.220
to communicate to the
next elements below,

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.220
and I'll describe that in much
more detail in just a minute.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:35.620
But it gives you an idea of how
unbelievably complex this is.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.580
Yet another
complexity is that you

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:44.520
have this huge number of rods,
but if you think about it,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:51.820
will these rods be there
in each in these rods

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.940
with each of these disks
persist for a lifetime?

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.970
So the average lifetime
is 80 or 90 years.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:06.200
Well these same guys exist
in the eye all the time?

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.720
Well, the answer is no.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.270
What happens is there is yet
another process, amazingly,

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:21.810
that replaces in steps these
disks in the rods, usually

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.050
a few disks every few days.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.670
So it's a constant,
dynamic process

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:35.350
keeping your rods, if not your
whole body, young, so to speak.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:37.350
All right, so anyway,
this gives you

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.765
sort of a crude sense of the
complexity of this system.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.940
But now we are going
to shift over, and talk

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.605
about the retinal
ganglion cells.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.430
And then we'll come
back, and we talk

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:58.330
in a bit more detail about the
preretinal ganglionic elements.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:02.780
Here is a set of
pictures created

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.060
by a wonderful scientist
called [? Poyak ?], showing you

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.820
different classes of
types, if you will,

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.890
of retinal ganglion cells.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:16.690
The top row here
have been named,

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.990
because of their small size
and the small dendritic arbors,

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:22.500
have been named midget cells.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.660
Whereas these ones below--
some of them, at least--

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.770
are much, much bigger and have
much larger dendritic arbors,

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:36.180
as you can see here, have
been called parasol cells.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.290
And why they've been
called parasol cells

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.560
I'll explain to you
in just a minute.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:47.280
Now this set of pictures was
created by the Golgi stain

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:53.430
that I mentioned to you before,
that was invented by Golgi,

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.670
and extensively
studied by Cajal.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.350
And for this
incredible work they

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.950
had done, a lot of
it on the retina,

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:06.560
they received the
Nobel Prize in 1906.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.720
So what this disclosed,
then-- an initial view--

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.450
was that there are different
classes of retinal ganglion

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:15.160
cells.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.600
And so therefore,
the big question

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.660
came up, why do we have
different classes of cells

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.630
like that, retinal
ganglion cells?

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.320
What do they do?

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.490
Well, initially
some people again--

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:26.940
which is good-- I
think one should

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.000
be resistant to
change and new ideas

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.160
until they are
really proven well.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.560
Some people argue that
[INAUDIBLE] just continue,

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.800
but then it became evident
that these are indeed

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.370
different classes.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:48.080
And I will present some
evidence to prove that.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.790
So there are actually
quite a number

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.980
of different classes of
retinal ganglion cells

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.750
that perform different jobs.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.290
We're going to try to understand
what are the different jobs

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.550
that they perform.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.590
And we're going to
concentrate mostly

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:04.370
on these midget
and parasol cells,

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:08.440
because they are by far the
most numerous in the retina,

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.130
and make a major, major
contribution to overall vision.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:17.970
All right, so now let's
look at the physiology

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.344
of retinal ganglion cells.

00:40:19.344 --> 00:40:21.760
Now that we know we have these
different kinds of ganglion

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.010
cells, how do we find
out what they do?

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:30.820
Well what was recognized
in the early portions

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:38.450
of the 20th century was that to
find out what these cells do,

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:42.460
one needs to study
their activity.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.780
And to study their
activity, what

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:49.600
was developed after
many different trials,

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.890
is to either record
from individual axons,

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:58.210
or to use a microelectrode that
you could put into the eye,

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:02.680
and record from individual
cells, and see what they do.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.990
Well, the first person who
did this was Keffer Hartline.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.770
And for the beautiful
work he had done,

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:13.660
he received the
Nobel Prize in 1967.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.550
Now what he did-- he was
a tremendous surgeon.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.250
And so what he did-- he did
this in primitive animals

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:25.790
like frogs-- he would
take the optic nerve,

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:30.920
and he would dissect one
fiber from the optic nerve,

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.230
hook it up, and record
electrically from it.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:37.580
And then what he would
do, he would shine a light

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:44.300
into the eye, move it around
until this cell generated

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.840
action potentials.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.500
That was just a
very small region,

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.120
because as I've
mentioned, each cell

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.100
in the retina--
each ganglion cell--

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.600
only sees a teeny, teeny, little
portion of the visual field.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:59.410
So that's how he
did his experiments.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.340
And he made some really
remarkable discoveries

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.720
which further then
were elaborated

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.530
by using slightly
different methods.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.280
A slightly different
method, first of all,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.050
was to put a microelectrode
into the eye.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.930
And I've mentioned
that to you before.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:20.620
The initial microelectrode
was a very fine, tube of glass

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.680
which was heated and then
pulled until the tip was only

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.370
about a micron in
diameter, which

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:31.230
enabled you to record from
individual cells in the retina,

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.270
or for that matter,
anywhere in the brain.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.960
Now another change in
the methods that emerged

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:43.910
is that instead of shining a
light directly into the eye,

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:49.170
people use reflected
light, because in the world

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.150
most of what we see
is reflected light.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.680
Of course, nowadays this
has changed a little bit,

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.620
because we have
computers and we have

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:02.920
TV, which were set up in
such a way as to mimic

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.450
reflected light, if you will.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.410
But in the natural
world for the most part,

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:11.170
we see reflected light.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:15.240
All right, so when this was
done-- this initial work that

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.190
was done by Keffer Hartline
for which he received the Nobel

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:25.470
Prize-- that he discovered
three major classes of cells

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.730
based on that recording
of this, which he called,

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.290
first of all, on
cells, secondly off

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.240
cells, and then
thirdly on-off cells.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.300
Now the on cells
were those which,

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:41.990
when you shown light into their
so-called receptive field area,

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.000
they would discharge vigorously.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.680
You turn the light on here, and
you can see the on cell fires.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.000
An off cell, on the other
hand, fired when you turned off

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.090
the light using this
particular method.

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.610
And on-off cells
were those that fired

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.590
both at the onset and the
termination of the light.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.750
And that's why they were
called, and are still

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.940
called to this day,
on and off cells.

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.340
So that was an
incredible discovery,

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:16.140
and has created
a major evolution

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.650
in the study of
the visual system.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:27.750
All right, so now doing this
kind of work in more detail,

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.360
using especially
mostly reflected

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:36.430
light, several other major
discoveries were made.

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:42.030
A fellow at Harvard
in his later years,

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:46.040
originally at Johns Hopkins, did
experiments carefully studying

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:50.460
the receptive field
structure of these cells.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.410
He would record, in this
case with microelectrodes,

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:57.240
from a single cell--
retinal ganglion cell--

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.430
and then see how it responded
when he fiddled around

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.360
with the light in
the receptive field.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.760
So imagine, then,
that the eye is fixed.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.990
It's looking out.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.390
You're putting an electrode,
in this case, into the eye

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:12.660
or wherever you put
it, and then you

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.590
can use lights, maybe
like a projector,

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:19.210
move it around to find out
where the receptive field is.

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:22.750
And then you can present
a small spot of light,

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:25.290
make it a big spot, make
it different colors,

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.740
and so on, and so on.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.380
So when this was done,
a remarkable discovery

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:38.140
was made by Kuffler, namely that
the so-called on and off cells

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:42.360
were not just responding to the
onset and termination of light.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.600
Instead, what they did was
they responded vigorously

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.380
to a small spot in the center of
the so-called receptive field,

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.090
but if you used a
large spot like that,

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.790
there was much
less of a response.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.400
And that was true also
for the off cells,

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.130
and for the on-off cells.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.240
So the surround you
can think of as being

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.330
inhibitory with
respect to the center.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:11.000
And so the big question
arose, why on earth

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.020
did this complex
arrangement evolve

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:19.270
of having cells that have not
only an excitatory center,

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.155
but also have an
inhibitory surround?

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.070
And now I'm going to let you
think about this for a minute,

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.320
and eventually I
will tell you as

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.905
to why we have
this organization.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.690
Because we're going to
devote a whole session

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:38.790
to the on and off systems,
and also a complete session

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.690
to the midget and parasol cells.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.630
And that's when we are going
to discuss this in detail.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:49.220
Now, the important thing as
you learn about these things

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.150
is to be an active thinker.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:54.757
And if something comes up, you
say, well, why did this happen?

00:46:54.757 --> 00:46:55.590
Why did that happen?

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:56.140
Why is this?

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:56.910
Why is that?

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:58.860
When you actively
think about that,

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.650
then it becomes interesting.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.430
And also, once the
answers come, it

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:07.670
becomes insightful and
exciting to understand it.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:14.750
OK, so now a series
of investigators

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.370
did experiments in
which they-- this sounds

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.630
like a fairly simple
experiment-- in which they

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.930
did labeling of just the
cell bodies in the retina,

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:26.840
and did what is
called a whole mounts.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.980
What's a whole mount?

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.110
You take the retina.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.200
You flatten it out.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.030
Then you look at this whole
layout through a microscope.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:37.650
And if you label
these cells-- and this

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:41.080
was a so-called Nissl stain
that stains the cell bodies,

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:47.870
but doesn't stain the processes
like the dendrite of the axons.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:51.440
What they found was-- they
did this quantitatively--

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:56.600
they could distinguish three
very distinct different classes

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.675
of cells.

00:47:57.675 --> 00:48:00.020
It turned out later that
there were more than three,

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.830
but in this case, just
doing it crudely like that,

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:04.760
you can see those
big cells-- that one,

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.570
that one, that one, that one,
and so on-- maybe one out

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:12.000
of seven or eight in this
sample-- are these huge cells.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.050
And then you have
some smaller cells.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.690
And then you also
some tiny cells.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:19.570
And if you did this
quantitatively,

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:25.840
they argued that they formed
distinct separate populations.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.570
They were not a continuum.

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:29.840
All right, so then
that, of course,

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.780
is a basic requirement to
prove that indeed, these

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.810
are different
classes of cells that

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:38.590
probably perform different jobs.

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:42.480
So what can you do to
prove this further?

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.680
Well, subsequent to this
kind of work, people

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:53.100
began to look at another
interesting question about how

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.700
these retinal
ganglion cells send

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.630
a signal to the
central nervous system.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.890
And it's been discovered,
not just in the retina,

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:06.830
but in many other parts of
the human and animal body,

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:16.140
that the rapidity with which
an axon can send its action

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.830
potentials down from one
location to the next--

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:27.300
from the cell body, say,
to the axon terminals--

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.650
very much depends on
the size of the cell

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:31.910
and the size of the axon.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:38.160
So if you have a small
cell and a very thin axon,

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.900
the conduction is
slower than if you

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.240
have a big cell and a big axon.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.620
So if that's the
case, people argued

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:52.540
that if you were to
take the optic nerve

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:56.330
and stimulate it at one
side and a little bit

00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:00.240
down, maybe back
towards the retina,

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.580
record and see what kind
of overall general--

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.430
not action potentials, but
overall activation takes place.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:13.190
And when that was done, a very
amazing discovery was made.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:18.950
In this case, you can see
we have two major dips here.

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:20.680
This is time, OK.

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.740
Here is electrical stimulation.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.470
Here's the activation
of hundreds and hundreds

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.460
of fibers.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.130
And it shows that they
formed distinct groups--

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:32.840
a very rapidly conducting group,
a slower conducting group,

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.350
and a very slow,
more diffuse group.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:41.460
So then it was subsequent--
I'll talk about that later-- it

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.230
was subsequently
established that these very

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:51.720
rapidly conducting axons come
from the so-called parasol

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.660
cells.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.330
The medium conducting ones
come from the midget cells,

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.570
all right?

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:00.660
I'll tell you exactly
how that was established,

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.500
but now that has
become a solid fact.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:07.750
OK, so now we go back to the
anatomy of these cell types,

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:13.890
if you look at them at
equivalent distances,

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:19.490
over eccentricity, one,
three, and 5.7 degrees,

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:23.560
here are examples
of the midget cell

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.270
dendritic orbits
[INAUDIBLE] looking straight

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.960
down at the cell.

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:34.300
You can see these are very
constricted dendritic orbits.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.930
Now by contrast,
the parasol cells

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:41.322
have much, much larger-- three
times larger in diameter--

00:51:41.322 --> 00:51:42.030
dendritic orbits.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.670
And now I can tell
you-- which I deferred

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:48.320
before-- is that if
you look at these,

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.510
the reason they're called
parasol cells is what?

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.810
Because it looks
like an umbrella.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.000
OK.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.440
So this looks like an umbrella,
and of course that's parasol.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.310
So that's why they are
called parasol cells.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.242
And these guys, much
less interesting,

00:52:06.242 --> 00:52:08.200
are called midget cells
because they're midget.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.870
They're small.

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:13.310
All right, so that
then established--

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:15.910
this work was done
just 20 years ago--

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:19.690
it was established that you
have indeed these two very, very

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:22.380
distinct populations of cells.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.560
So now the big
question came up, why

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.360
do we have on and off cells?

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.760
Why do we have midget
and parasol cells?

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.460
And as I say, we
are going to discuss

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.180
this in considerable detail.

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.360
But let me just give you
a crude introduction.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.540
If you look at
the parasol cell--

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.380
obviously, because of the
huge dendritic orbit--

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:46.070
they have large, relatively
speaking, much larger receptive

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:49.250
fields-- three times
bigger than midget cells.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:54.370
The midget cells are so
specific that each cell

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:58.570
in central retina gets input for
the excitatory center from just

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.870
one single cone.

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:01.870
Now what does that mean?

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:06.070
What I didn't emphasize
before, but I'm sure

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:10.380
you all know, that we have
three major classes of cones,

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.570
which some people call
red, green, and blue.

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:18.050
And then when you say that, the
real aficionados say, come on,

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:19.860
you can't say that.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:23.530
You're supposed to say short,
medium, and long wavelength

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:24.810
sensitive neurons.

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:26.960
But we'll just call them
red, green, and blue.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.230
Now the reason, then,
is that the center

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:34.890
of one class of midget cells
gets input only from red cones,

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.740
another from green cones,
and some from blue cones.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.900
I'll show that in more
detail in a minute.

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.815
So we have these three subtypes.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.530
And so therefore, you can
say that the midget cells,

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:48.400
because they're so
teeny, they should

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.590
be able to see fine detail.

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:53.560
And because of this
wiring, they should

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.780
be able to tell you about color.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.720
By contrast, if you look
at the parasol cells,

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.610
they get a mix of inputs,
both in the center

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:03.960
and their surround,
so it's unlikely

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.070
that they can tell
you about color.

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.960
And we'll examine that's
in much more detail soon.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.130
All right, so now the
other interesting thing

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:14.040
about this system is
it makes you speculate

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.860
as to why we have
them-- and we'll

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.220
elaborate on that-- is that the
midget system, when you turn

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.910
on the light, when you shine
a small spot in the center

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:25.520
receptive field, gives a
fairly sustained response

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.400
for the brief time that was
maybe a second of two, OK?

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.260
But the parasol system gives
you only a burst, like that,

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.800
instead of a sustained response.

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:38.190
So think about that.

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.340
Say why would we
have two systems

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:43.120
which are not only different
in size, but also different

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.695
in the profile of
their responses?

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.810
And then, once you have
this question in your mind,

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:52.130
then you'll be eager to find
out when we talk about that time

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:53.610
after next.

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:56.240
OK, so now let's go
back to the beginning

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.760
here, and talk about the
photoreceptors in just a bit

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:04.750
more detail, so you can
get a better picture of it.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.820
Here, as I mentioned to
you before, in the fovea,

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:12.143
you have a very, very tightly
packed cone photoreceptors.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.825
They're almost hexagonally
shaped rather than round,

00:55:15.825 --> 00:55:18.100
they're so tightly packed.

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.560
But then when you
go five degrees out,

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.050
you first of all see that the
cones got to be much larger.

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:29.840
And now you have an intermixture
of rods there that you can see.

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:35.930
| in this region, you can
process both information

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:38.950
at low illumination levels
and high illumination levels,

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:46.020
whereas here as Keffer
Hartline had proven,

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:52.075
you can only see under fairly
bright, normal illumination

00:55:52.075 --> 00:55:52.575
conditions.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:01.084
OK, so now if you go even
further out in the retina--

00:56:01.084 --> 00:56:03.000
this is a beautiful,
three-dimensional looking

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.365
picture-- it shows the rods
and the cones in the periphery.

00:56:06.365 --> 00:56:09.800
There are many, many
more rods per unit area,

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.340
and the cones have
gotten even bigger.

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:18.700
And so obviously, the ability
for the cones to process fine

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:23.990
information has been
degraded as a result.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:26.530
Now again, as I've
mentioned to you before,

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:32.460
we have in humans about 120
million rods and five million

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.390
cones in each retina.

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:38.610
OK, so now if you look at
the overall distribution--

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.410
this is not too
important-- you can

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:43.990
see that as you go
away from the fovea,

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:49.080
there's a very rapid decline
in the number of cones.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.940
This is the hash line.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.510
And then there are
no rods in the fovea,

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.550
but they increase rapidly,
and then they fall off.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:00.320
So that's sort of the
overall distribution.

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.420
And therefore, you can see
fine detail in the center,

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:08.500
and you're very sensitive
for night vision

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:14.940
not in the far periphery, but
sort of in the mid section

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:21.850
here, anywhere between 20 and
40 degrees from the fovea.

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:26.210
Let me remind you, because I'm
sure you know all this already,

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:27.940
a few facts, OK?

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.960
I will just write down a
couple of these things.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:42.447
First of all, what is
degree of visual angle?

00:57:42.447 --> 00:57:43.405
That's a good question.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.050
What does it mean on
the retinal surface?

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:50.590
Just let me give you an
interesting mnemonic.

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.640
If you stick out
your arm like that,

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.150
and you look at
your thumbnail, that

00:57:56.150 --> 00:58:00.605
imprints one degree of visual
angle on the retinal surface.

00:58:01.971 --> 00:58:02.470
OK?

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:08.760
Now we are going to talk a lot
about very small measurements.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.590
And so when we talk
about small measurement,

00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:14.400
I mentioned already that
the tip of a microelectrode

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.900
is about one micron.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.615
And what is a
micron, anybody know?

00:58:19.615 --> 00:58:21.100
Yes.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.080
AUDIENCE: 10 to the
negative 6 [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:31.240
PROFESSOR: OK, one micron is
one-thousandth of a millimeter,

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:31.740
OK?

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:38.000
Now, talking about that in terms
of millimeters, which you're

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.450
going to do a lot-- that's the
greatest convention-- you need

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:46.760
to also know what is the
relationship between inches

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.190
and millimeters, centimeters?

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:58.390
OK, so if you take one inch--
you all know what an inch is,

00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:59.656
I guess.

00:58:59.656 --> 00:59:01.530
Roughly, if you look at
your thumbnail again,

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.650
it's maybe a little
bit under an inch.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:17.180
Now 1 inch equals
2.54 millimeters.

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.240
So that's a very interesting
mnemonic to remember.

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.570
So whenever you look
at various things

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:27.140
and try to understand
size, you may

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:32.170
need to make that conversion,
especially if you have always

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:34.720
thought about things
in terms of inches.

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:35.400
Yes.

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.170
AUDIENCE: I think you
meant to write centimeters.

00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:37.770
PROFESSOR: What?

00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:39.618
AUDIENCE: Did you mean
to write centimeters?

00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:49.995
PROFESSOR: You're right, 2.5
centimeters, 254 millimeters.

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.210
You're right, OK.

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:53.530
Sorry about that.

00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:54.030
Very good.

00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:55.410
Thank you for pointing that out.

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:59.850
OK, so now what
we're going to do

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:02.930
next is we're going
to move on, and I'll

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:06.190
tell you another clever
experiment that had been done.

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:10.480
These people here,
McCrane et al.,

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.790
developed a method which enabled
them to selectively label

01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:16.270
the blue cells in the retina.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.650
And this shows a
picture of that.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:23.550
All the rest of them
are red and green cells.

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:38.700
So only one out of eight
cones is in the foveal area,

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.370
near foveal area, I should
say-- this is both the fovea

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:45.580
and the perifovea is black.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:48.390
The rest of them are
red and green cones, OK?

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.030
Now let's become
specific about the facts

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:58.760
here, and tell you first of all
that one degree-- roughly one

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.820
degree, which I pointed
out is like a thumb,

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:07.400
comprises 200 microns
on the retinal surface.

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:15.005
The intercone distance in the
fovea is only 2.4 microns, OK?

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:23.470
Whereas when you-- per
square millimeter I already

01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:28.810
mentioned this-- you
have 200,000 cones.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:31.460
You go out five degrees,
it reduces tenfold.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:35.230
And then-- this I already
pointed out to you

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:36.060
several times.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.980
That's a good thing to remember.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.680
And one thing I haven't
mentioned before

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.680
is that if you look
at 12 font letter, I,

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.020
and you look at it
at 23 centimeters,

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.820
that activates about 80 cones.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.870
So that gives you
sort of a handle

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:54.480
on what is the nature
of activation there.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.220
And I already said
that several times--

01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:01.960
namely that each rod has 1,000
disks, and each disk in it

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.790
has 10,000 molecules.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:11.360
OK, and as I've just mentioned,
one out of eight cones is blue.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.540
The others are fairly
equal in number,

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.200
but varies from
person to person.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:24.170
OK, so now we are
going to tell you

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:27.480
about yet another experiment.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.470
And this is an incredibly
clever experiment

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:33.555
that was carried out
by Ursula Drager.

01:02:35.092 --> 01:02:37.300
At that time, when she did
this beautiful experiment,

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.910
she did this at Harvard, at
the Harvard Medical School.

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:47.430
And what she did was this-- she
took the words Fiat Lux, put it

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:52.730
on a screen, and
exposed it that too

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:57.720
dark to the animal-- the
animal being a mouse, OK?

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.550
And then her procedure
enabled her to label,

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:06.080
using a monoclonal antibody
label, those cells that

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.290
had been activated by Fiat Lux.

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:15.270
OK, so this is, then, the actual
retina, flat-mount retina,

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.175
showing you what
had been activated.

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:20.950
Now that's
remarkable, beautiful,

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:24.230
and she came, and
gave a talk here

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:26.810
at MIT maybe about 15 years ago.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:33.580
And when she presented this
picture, one of the students,

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:38.060
it wasn't any of you, I
guess, raised her hand

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:44.940
and was very upset-- said, but,
but, but-- and so Ursula said,

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.030
yes?

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:52.160
So what do you think
this listener asked?

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:56.450
Well, this was a
very active thinker.

01:03:56.450 --> 01:04:00.712
This person said, but, but,
but, was this image right-side

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:01.795
up on the retinal surface?

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.730
That was the question.

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:08.700
And Ursula Drager said,
no, it was upside down.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:12.980
I just rotated it 180
degrees so you can see it.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:20.990
All right, well,
interestingly enough,

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.340
there were times when
this became an issue.

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:27.160
First of all, before
people knew about lenses

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:36.210
and that lenses turn images
upside down, and secondly,

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:39.990
because many people
didn't believe

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:42.226
that the images were
upside down in the retina.

01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:44.225
I mean, if images are
upside down in the retina,

01:04:44.225 --> 01:04:47.140
they're upside
down on your brain,

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.830
and yet the world
is right-side up.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.210
What's going on?

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:59.980
So I would say about
eight or ten years ago, I

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:09.400
was asked to review a paper
for a high visibility journal--

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:15.770
I can't name the journal-- in
which the investigator very,

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:22.980
very vociferously proclaimed
that we have all been wrong,

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:25.140
and that the images are
right-side up on the retina

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.620
after all.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.040
So what was his proof?

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:35.640
His proof was that he took an
ox eye, a slaughtered ox's eye,

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.350
and cut out a little piece
in the back of the eye,

01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.780
and put a translucent
piece of paper over it,

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.870
and then presented a
stimulus out there.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:47.740
And when he looked at
the back of the eye,

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.620
at the translucent
part, the image

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.630
was right-side up-- a little
bit blurred but right-side up.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:57.421
And so he felt that he proved
that images are right-side

01:05:57.421 --> 01:05:58.545
up on the retina after all.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.140
Well, I was flabbergasted.

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:05.560
And it took me quite
a while to figure out

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.280
why this guy got what he
got, because he'd obviously

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.670
got what he got.

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:12.740
So can you guys think
of any reason for this?

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.806
How come he got what he got?

01:06:14.806 --> 01:06:16.780
AUDIENCE: Wait, what did he do?

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:21.130
PROFESSOR: He took the
eye, OK, and in the back,

01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:25.182
he cut out an opening and
put a transparency over it,

01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:26.640
so that anything
came in there, you

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.070
could see what would
have been normally

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.610
on the retinal surface.

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.010
And it was a clever experiment--
no question about that.

01:06:36.852 --> 01:06:38.435
So what was wrong
with the experiment?

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.110
Well, I'll tell you.

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:43.760
What was wrong with
the experiment was

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.040
back to what I told
you before, about

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:50.480
the way the lens works, right?

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.940
The lens works so that when
you look at something close,

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:58.550
the muscles of the lens are
such that it makes the lens fat.

01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:09.200
And when the muscles relax,
it makes the lens thin, OK?

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:15.450
So that means-- just to
be graphic about it--

01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:23.310
that if you have a thick lens,
you have a short focal length.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:27.530
And if you have a
thin lens, you have

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:31.430
a much longer focal
length, like that, OK?

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:39.985
So now if you look at
the back of the eye

01:07:39.985 --> 01:07:43.700
here, where the photoreceptors
are, in this case,

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.410
it looks like it
would be upside down.

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:47.400
But if they were in
the same distance here,

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.310
it would be blurred and it
would remain right-side up,

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:53.540
just like it is with a
magnifying glass, OK?

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.710
So what this guy
didn't know is the rule

01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:03.430
of how the muscle works in
the eye to control the lens.

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:08.760
And when the animal was
killed, it no longer

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.440
had the lens at the
proper focal depth.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.763
And therefore, the
image was right-side up.

01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:18.179
So therefore, guess
what happened?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.609
I wrote back to this
high visibility journal

01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:27.200
saying that this guy is
wrong for this reason.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:32.979
OK, so that was certainly
an interesting experience,

01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:38.819
and that's why I managed to
learn a little bit about how

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:44.580
the lens works in the eye, which
is a remarkable way it works,

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.529
since it's so totally
different from what

01:08:46.529 --> 01:08:49.840
we are familiar with
when it comes to cameras.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:58.450
OK, so now let's go to the
next step, one down from your

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:00.939
from photoreceptors.

01:09:00.939 --> 01:09:03.880
And we come to the
so-called bipolar cells.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.779
Here's a series of pictures,
the so-called [? cat ?]

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:08.290
bipolar cells.

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:11.830
And what was discovered is
that the bipolar cells here

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:13.963
in the outer
plexiform layer, they

01:09:13.963 --> 01:09:15.296
connect with the photoreceptors.

01:09:16.425 --> 01:09:17.800
And in the inner
plexiform layer,

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:23.590
their axonal projections are
such that in the upper layer

01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:33.040
here, which is actually layer A,
the cells there are OFF cells.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.939
And the ones that
project below this here

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:37.710
are the so-called ON cells.

01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:40.859
So there's a separation of
the so-called ON and OFF

01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:44.990
cells at the bipolar cell level
in the manner in which they

01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.960
connect.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.069
And so therefore, those ganglion
cells that connect with these

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:51.479
are OFF ganglion cells.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:55.860
And those that connect with
these are ON ganglion cells.

01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:00.690
All right, so that's
basically the bipolar cells.

01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:03.020
And then we come to
the horizontal cells.

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.746
Here's a beautiful
example of a Procion

01:10:06.746 --> 01:10:12.580
yellow-labeled horizontal cell.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:15.810
And if that is then
analyzed in detail,

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:17.295
it looks something like this.

01:10:17.295 --> 01:10:24.410
This particular cell
has 15 connections

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:26.403
with the photoreceptors.

01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:29.930
And these cells-- I might
as well anticipate--

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:32.460
we'll talk about that
in more detail later--

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.580
they play a central
role in providing

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.700
the surround inhibition
that I described to you

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.030
for those retinal
ganglion cells.

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:43.920
Then if we proceed to
the amacrine cells--

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.970
and again, things
are so complicated--

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:50.950
the numerous, numerous amacrine
cells, different types--

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:52.650
and they have been
studied extensively--

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:53.645
they are more than 20.

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:59.090
And here's a clever experiment
I want to point out to you.

01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:03.510
What you can do here, if you
look at the called cholinergic

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:07.890
amacrine cells-- that's one
class-- you can selectively

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:09.950
label them, because
they're cholinergic.

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.460
And here's an example.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:16.310
All those lighter blue ones
are your cholinergic cells.

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:18.060
And then what you can
do, you can put this

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.620
under a microscope.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.160
And then you can
lower a microelectrode

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.037
into one of these cells,
just like I've done here.

01:11:25.037 --> 01:11:26.620
And if you look at
this closely-- this

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.550
is not the best
of pictures-- this

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:31.130
is a Procion
yellow-labeled amacrine

01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:35.270
cell-- you can see it
has all these processes.

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:37.910
So then if you look at
this on the microscope

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:42.790
under the high quality,
you can draw these out.

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:45.490
And this is what
they look like, OK?

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:48.320
So this is a cholinergic cell.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.620
This is another type.

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:54.040
It's just called A2, which
has a lot to do with rods.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.765
And then yet another class
called open [? minergic ?].

01:11:56.765 --> 01:11:58.640
I'm not going to go
into detail about it.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.960
But you can see that each of
these now-- scientific methods

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.550
enable you to specify what
these amacrine cells are like.

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:08.500
And on the basis of
that, people have come up

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.190
with ideas what the
amacrine system does.

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:17.810
OK, now we come to the crux of
things in the last few minutes.

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:21.070
We're going to talk about
the electrical responses

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.770
in the retina.

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:27.100
Now this is going to be,
again, fairly complicated.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:32.490
This work-- again remarkable
work which, in my view,

01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:35.630
merits a Nobel Prize,
but it has not yet

01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:40.515
been awarded to John
Darling at Harvard.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.326
And let me just introduce
this by telling you

01:12:47.326 --> 01:12:48.825
how they went about
this experiment.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.360
They realized that the
cells in the retina

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.230
are very, very small.

01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:58.200
And so it's very difficult
to record from them

01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.520
intercellularly.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.930
You have to do that
if you want to be

01:13:01.930 --> 01:13:04.550
able to label them anatomically.

01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:09.080
And so they looked around
for a species of animal

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:12.700
that had large
cells in the retina.

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.750
And they discovered
after a lot of search

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:20.180
that the so-called mudpuppy--
Necturus maculosus--

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:25.810
is an animal that has unusually
large retinal ganglion cells.

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:29.200
Then they developed a
technique of removing the eye

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.230
from this animal, and
putting it into a dish,

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.560
because that makes
it real stable.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.340
And then they were able to
put an electrode in there,

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:43.920
define what the cells did
functionally by shining light

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.420
on them and looking
at the activity,

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:50.160
and then they were
able to label the cell

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.340
by injecting a
labeling substance.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.160
So that's what they did.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.980
And so here is a description
of that arrangement.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:01.520
Here you have an
inverted mudpuppy retina,

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.190
and here you have a
DC-recording electrode.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.720
And what you do then, you
look at it in an oscilloscope.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:13.690
And at this point, the cell is
entered by the DC recording.

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:16.050
And then once it's
inside, cells inside

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:20.730
are negatively charged with
respect to the surround,

01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:22.765
usually up to about
70 millivolts.

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:26.320
In this case, I have
50 millivolts labeled.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.900
And so once you're
inside the cell,

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.830
you see a sudden drop
to a minus level.

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:34.250
And then if the cell
discharges an action potential,

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:38.540
then you see that, of
course, in the oscilloscope.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:41.370
And then you can study this
cell in all kinds of detail

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:44.080
as to how it responds,
what it responds and so

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.490
on, to determine what
its characteristics are.

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:50.150
So then when they
did that, they made

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:52.100
the following
central discoveries--

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:55.350
they discovered, first
of all, that receptors

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:58.310
all hyperpolarize to light.

01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:03.520
Now this is the opposite of
what you would have thought,

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.762
because the principle
of the way cells

01:15:06.762 --> 01:15:08.470
operate-- and I'm sure
you know all this,

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.750
but I will also describe
it in a bit more detail

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:17.230
in a minute-- cells
when they hyperpolarize,

01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:24.180
they are less likely to cause
a release in neurotransmitters.

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:29.750
If they depolarize, they
will increase the likelihood

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:34.390
of neurotransmitters
being released.

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:36.390
And by the way, the
neurotransmitter

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:39.620
for these receptors
is glutamate.

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:45.850
And also, which I
should emphasize here,

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:49.490
is that the receptors never
give action potentials.

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:52.170
They only give
graded potentials.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:54.080
That's also true for
the horizontal cells

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.250
and the bipolar cells.

01:15:56.250 --> 01:16:02.090
They found that all of receptors
hyperpolarize to light, meaning

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:05.820
that they activate subsequent
elements in the retina

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.070
when it gets darker
out there, rather than

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:10.725
when it gets lighter, which
is the opposite of what we all

01:16:10.725 --> 01:16:11.475
would've expected.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.490
Same thing for the
horizontal cells.

01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:18.930
But then when you
come to bipolar cells,

01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:22.420
suddenly you find that there
are two different classes-- one

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:26.350
class which mimics
what the receptors do,

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:27.975
the other class that
does the opposite.

01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:31.850
And so the bipolar cells
of these two types--

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:36.910
this type has sign
conserving synapses,

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:40.015
and this type has sign
inverting synapses.

01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:47.360
Now amacrine cells
come in various types,

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.070
and some give action potentials.

01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:51.820
And ganglion cells all
give action potentials.

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.580
So to go through this
again, all receptors

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.000
hyperpolarize to light.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.480
Horizontal cells
hyperpolarize to light.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.210
About half of bipolar cells
hyperpolarize and half

01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:04.710
depolarize.

01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.680
Now this is
accomplished-- by the way,

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.940
I'll go into that in
more detail later--

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:16.740
by virtue of having different
kinds of neurotransmitter

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.750
receptor sites.

01:17:19.539 --> 01:17:21.330
And I'll talk about
that in a lot of detail

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:24.054
when we talk about
the ON and OFF cells.

01:17:24.054 --> 01:17:25.720
OK, and then we have
the amacrine cells.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.594
Some hyperpolarize, some
depolarize, and some

01:17:27.594 --> 01:17:28.840
give action potentials.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.600
And all ganglion cells
give action potentials.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.600
So that is a major, major
discovery, and not only major,

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.930
but totally unexpected from
what one would have thought.

01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:43.687
All right, so now
let me just explain

01:17:43.687 --> 01:17:44.770
this in a bit more detail.

01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:52.770
If you go inside a cell, then
if this cell is activated,

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:57.190
it can be either
get-- what you see

01:17:57.190 --> 01:17:59.780
is an excitatory post
synaptic potential, which

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.350
goes from minus
towards plus, or you

01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:07.080
can get an IPSP, an inhibitory
post synaptic potential.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.210
And this discovery
was made by Eccles,

01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:13.160
which is a remarkable discovery
for which he received the Nobel

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.965
Prize some years back.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:21.650
All right, so now if we look at
those cells which give action

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:24.820
potentials, what happens is
when you get an EPSP-- that's

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:28.490
why it's called excitatory
post synaptic potential-- then

01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:31.940
you increase the likelihood
that an action potential

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.010
will be generated that
will send its signal down

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:41.950
the axon to the next
location of the cells.

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.720
All right, so that's
the basic process.

01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:46.950
So again to reiterate,
photoreceptors

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:48.960
hyperpolarize the light.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.200
Therefore, glutamate
is released when

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.050
there's a decrease in
illumination-- the opposite

01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:56.720
of what anyone
would have expected.

01:18:58.330 --> 01:19:02.680
All right, so that
I think brings us

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.300
to what I want to cover today.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.320
I'll wait until
next time to talk

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.390
about the lateral geniculate
nucleus, which is very brief.

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:12.640
But let me go through the
four receptor basics again.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.460
All photoreceptors
hyperpolarize the light.

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.310
Depolarization of
the photoreceptor

01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:19.470
releases glutamate.

01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:24.640
Photon absorption by the
photo pigment results

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.870
in isomerization of the
chromophore from 11 cis

01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:29.010
to 11 trans.

01:19:29.010 --> 01:19:32.160
This is what I told you
to think about in a very

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:40.520
simple fashion-- to say that
the photoreceptor molecules--

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.940
rhodopsin in this case-- is
either bleached or unbleached,

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:45.980
OK?

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:49.020
So once it's bleached, further
light has no effect on it.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:53.060
And at any point, given whatever
the level of illumination is,

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:56.600
a certain percentage of
these rhodopsin molecules

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.250
are bleached and a certain
percentage is unbleached.

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.970
The darker it is, the
more are unbleached.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.080
All right, then we
have these two classes

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.150
that we talked about--
the ON and the OFF cells

01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:12.340
that we will discuss in some
detail-- the synaptic junction

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:15.250
of OFF bipolars is sign
conserving, as I just said,

01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:17.710
and that of ON bipolars
is sign inverting.

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:22.740
Now the ON bipolar receptor
is-- I should mention that now,

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:26.660
and I will deal with it in
detail-- is called the mGluR6.

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.623
It's activation leads
to closing of channels

01:20:31.623 --> 01:20:32.706
causing hyperpolarization.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.863
that's the basic layout,
then, of the photoreceptors.

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:42.100
And I will now
stop at this point.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.980
And next time, we'll
talk a little bit

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.720
about the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.770
And then we're going to move
on to talk about the cortex.

01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:54.500
then if you look at
you assignment sheet,

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:58.060
you can see here that
on September 16th,

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:00.400
we're going to talk about
the ON and OFF channels.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.520
And then we'll deal in more
detail with these rather

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.550
complex things which are
pretty hard to remember,

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:11.140
about hyperpolarization,
depolarization, glutamate,

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.320
glutamate receptor
sites, and so on.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.920
OK, thank you.

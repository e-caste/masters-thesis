00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.320
HUGH MCMANUS: Welcome to
the Variability Simulation.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.170
This should look
kind of familiar.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.330
This is a much simpler
simulation than before.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.960
It's not going to
take all day, but it's

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.650
going to illustrate one
point very well, which

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.500
is what's the impact
of variability

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.970
on process performance?

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.070
That's our learning
objective and we're

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.430
going to look at it through
the poker chip simulation.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.487
We're going to look at
a computer simulation

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.320
because one of the
problems with variability

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.570
is sometimes to understand
a variable system,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.110
you need a lot of
data, a lot of cases.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.500
And we're also going to explore
some simple relationships that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.290
help us, including that
cue-theory equation that Earll

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.070
showed, to help us understand
variable processes.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.170
This is a piece of a rather
old data on an engineering

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.060
process with high variability.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.970
The traditional
process shown here

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.910
a the high cycle time
and high variability

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.820
was actually the process
that was value stream mapped

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.850
in the module we
showed, I believe

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.840
it was two rays ago, that had
that very messy value stream

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.400
map with all the arrows
going everywhere.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.370
It was a very
unpredictable process.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.680
It ended up having
very high variability.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.720
Now, the problem
with that, given

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.390
that that process was embedded
in a larger process, which

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.300
was to produce an airplane, it
was just the drawing release

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.110
process.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.270
The problem wasn't
even so much the fact

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.340
that it took a long time,
although that wasn't great.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.720
The problem was that the
variability was almost as high

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.289
as the actual time, which means
it could take almost no time,

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.180
it could take double
the amount of time.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.170
And how easy is it
to do organized work

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.210
in an environment where even the
allegedly simple processes are

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.220
so unpredictable?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.298
It's very bad.

00:02:22.298 --> 00:02:24.340
Now, they managed to
actually do a lot about that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.090
by applying Lean,
but you can see

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.130
how disruptive that high
variability is going to be.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.750
The accounts payable module
also reinforced that,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.850
that the high
variability was very

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.560
destructive to that process.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.050
On top of that, you're going
to have quality problems

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.580
with a variable process.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.750
That's highly likely.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.300
They may be variable
because of mistakes,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.330
or it may be that the variable
process makes it easier

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.340
to make mistakes.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.290
And then we're
also going to talk,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.490
both in Six Sigma and today,
about the process capability

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.890
being affected by variability.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.510
So we're going to do, I said
this already, a dice game.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.260
We're going to do a
computer sim and we're

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.480
going to look at some
simple relationships.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.893
We're also going to
sort of foreshadow

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:12.310
some stuff we're going to do
in the Quality and Six Sigma.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.040
Not on these bullets--

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.730
I'm talking fast
right now because I'm

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.550
going to try to carve
out a little bit of time

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.700
at the end to discuss
some of the things

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.340
you can do about
variability because I

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.590
think that's particularly
important to our health care

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.173
audience.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:29.590
To some extent, our engineers,
but particularly our health

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.730
care people.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.460
One of the big
issues with applying

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.450
any kind of process improvement
in a very high variability

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.400
environment is just
getting your mind

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.350
wrapped around what does
an average mean, what

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.450
does even a standard
deviation mean in a process

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.910
where the variability
has weird distributions

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.820
and odd special
cases and outliers?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.860
We'll try to carve out
a little bit of time

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.140
to actually talk about some
of the practical things

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.050
you can do to get
variability under control.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.910
Here's a perfect system.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.860
What you are sitting
in front of is

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.850
a perfect, balanced,
single-piece flow

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.800
system, or near single.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.330
It's a very small-batch system.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.710
It has tasks arranged
in order in, actually,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.390
a U-shaped shaped cell.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.510
It's not a pull cell,
it's more of a push cell,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.510
but still, it's a U-shaped cell.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.140
Every task has an inventory in
front of it, a little buffer

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.870
inventory to make sure
that it has the things it

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.790
needs to do to do its work.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.230
Every task is
perfectly balanced,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.230
so there's no bottlenecks
in the system.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.700
The only thing imperfect about
the system is its variability.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.910
And this half of
the room, your mats

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.165
actually say mailroom
and PFR check and, well,

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:53.560
you get the picture.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.460
We're looking at the accounts
payable process here.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.500
You guys on the health
care side actually

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.560
have familiar-looking
mats from yesterday

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.300
because you had a
process that had

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.750
variability issues yesterday.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.930
The point here, both sides
of the room are identical.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.150
And the point we're
actually trying to make here

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.820
is an awful lot of
processes look like this.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.070
Even if you get them perfect, if
they have variability in them,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.360
they're going to behave in
ways that are actually even

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.890
worse than one might expect.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.300
So let's find out how
this system behaves.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.530
This is the game.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.890
It's a very simple game.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.590
What we're going to ask
you to do is every day--

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.590
we're going to call
the shifts day--

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.600
we are going to process chips.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.190
We are going to process one
six-sided die worth of chips,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.590
so anywhere from
one to six chips.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.270
There's our variability.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.940
The way we are going
to process them is we

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.770
are going to pick up
chips from our inbox.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.280
If you are the customer
or patient person,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.020
you have a big pile
of chips, so you have

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.670
an infinite quantity of chips.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.060
Just pick up chips from there.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.880
Everybody else has
a finite number

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.730
of chips that they can pick
up, the ones in their inbox.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.980
So you will be rolling a dice,
picking up that number of chips

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.760
from your inbox.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.225
If you don't have
enough, OK, too bad.

00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:19.600
If you roll a 6
and you only have

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.850
three, which is what
everybody has now,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.400
then you just pick up the three.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.330
And then everybody at the
same time, to avoid confusion,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.510
passes those chips,
the number of chips

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.310
that they can pass, to
the next person in line.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.020
And then at the
end of each day, we

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.870
will write down how
many chips we passed.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.450
The only tricky part about that
is that both the archive here

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.030
and the discharge
there, a certain number

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.610
of chips every day
will go into that mat,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.570
and the customers
or the patients

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.310
have to record that number.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.340
That's kind of the overall
throughput of the system.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.680
So that's a slight
trickiness at the end.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.540
That's what we're going to do.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.900
So for example, here's day one.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.550
Everybody has three chips.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.430
If this person rolls a 3,
they pick up all three chips,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.960
send them along.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.840
This person rolls a 2, they
can only pick up two chips.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.990
This person rolls a 5, they
can only pick up three chips

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.610
because that's all they have.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.530
No waiting for this person
to send the two along,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.577
so then you have five--

00:07:25.577 --> 00:07:26.410
no, that's cheating.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.340
The chips only get passed
one station per day.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.460
This person rolls
a 1, et cetera.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.430
This person rolls a 6, they only
had three, so they pass three.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.430
And then this is what it looks
like at the end of that day.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.660
Three have been
passed along, two out,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.390
so the inventory went up.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.140
Three came out, two went in,
so that went down a little bit.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.310
Three went in, only one
left, so that's got more.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.440
Let's see, one went
in and three came out,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.080
so that person only has one.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.630
The overall throughput
of the system was three.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.970
We're going to record how many
did you do, how many did you

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:07.820
pass along?

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.510
So either your die roll
or how many you had,

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.980
whatever number is smaller.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.480
How many did you pass along?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.220
And then at the
end of the round,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.510
what is your work in progress?

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.300
So everyone starts with three,
so that number is already

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.170
filled in.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.240
At the end of each day, you're
going to record your number.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.070
Yeah, so here's an example.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.420
Our person there passed one job
along and some work built up,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:35.770
so at the end of that day,
they had five, et cetera.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.780
The customer or
patient worksheet

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.150
is a little bit more
complicated because they're

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.870
sending the work out.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.370
That's basically always going
to be the die roll because you

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.930
have lots and lots of chips.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.930
You're going to record the
number of jobs that actually

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.660
came through the system,
and here, the U-shaped cell

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.930
is going to help us.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.630
So the number of
jobs that are added--

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.450
not in, but added-- to the
finished pile at each round

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.763
is recorded here.

00:09:04.763 --> 00:09:06.180
And then you're
also going to keep

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.880
track of the total WIP on the
whole table, the total work

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.460
in progress in the whole
table, which starts at 12.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.240
Now, you could just
count every time,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.050
but that would be really
slow, so instead, we're

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.630
going to use a conservation law.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.870
Earll's an old aerodynamicist,
so they love conservation laws,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.480
right?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.560
A former, a retired
aerodynamicist.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.970
A former aerodynamicist.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.200
They love conservation laws.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.180
This is the conservation
of chips laws.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.290
If you know that you sent out
six and three got finished,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.540
then three must have
gone into the system.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.510
And they didn't fall on the
floor or get eaten or anything,

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.083
so this number must
have gone up by three.

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:46.500
So there's a little
equation there

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:53.040
that will help you figure
out the new work in progress.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.037
So everybody think they
can do that much math?

00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:58.120
And I think that's actually
written on your sheet,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.360
so you should be
able to do that.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.890
OK, and there's an example.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.040
If three go in and three
come out, it stays the same.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.540
If two go in and one comes
out, then that extra chip

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.450
must be sitting on the
table, so it goes up by one.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.510
And we can keep doing
that ad infinitum.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.267
OK, what do we
think should happen?

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:20.850
AUDIENCE: Maybe we should just
ask if there are any questions.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.030
HUGH MCMANUS: Any questions
about the process?

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.950
AUDIENCE: So I [INAUDIBLE]
and I roll the die,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.040
and I get like, 5.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.610
So I pass on three because
I only have three chips.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.110
HUGH MCMANUS: Because you only
have the three, that's right.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.160
AUDIENCE: So under
patients completed,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.130
I'll have three there?

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.547
HUGH MCMANUS: You
put three, yeah.

00:10:40.547 --> 00:10:43.143
AUDIENCE: Then what will
now be the work in progress?

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.560
HUGH MCMANUS: The
work in progress

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.340
is whatever the person
next to you gives to you.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.340
Because everybody's going to
pass them at the same time.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.048
We're going to be very
formal about that.

00:10:53.048 --> 00:10:54.882
We're going to have a
standard process where

00:10:54.882 --> 00:10:57.770
we're going to ask everybody to
pass them all at the same time.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.770
So then yeah, you'll just
have to look and see--

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.820
AUDIENCE: It's
actually what you have

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.155
left by the end of the round.

00:11:02.155 --> 00:11:03.280
HUGH MCMANUS: That's right.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.330
That's correct.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.420
AUDIENCE: If you rolled a
3 and had four chips here,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.730
you would move three, and you'd
take one left plus whatever

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.230
new stuff--

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.490
HUGH MCMANUS: Plus
whatever payment.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.080
So it's whatever's
sitting on that mat

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.590
at the end of the round
is your work in progress.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:22.360
So the average of a
six-sided die is 3 and 1/2,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.210
so what do we think this system
should be able to do over--

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.790
we're going to do 20 rounds.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.123
What do we think it should
be able to do over 20 rounds?

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.640
Is it going to
process 3 and 1/2?

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.240
Are these die rolls
going to even out?

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.010
Maybe.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.688
Everyone's thinking.

00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:44.560
AUDIENCE: 60?

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.880
HUGH MCMANUS: 60, so
that would be 3ish.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.070
So it's not going to
be perfect, but it's

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.670
going to be close to evened out.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.420
AUDIENCE: So we don't
process more than 3.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.355
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:54.355 --> 00:11:55.980
HUGH MCMANUS: Yeah,
in the first round,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.680
you're only going to get 3.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.840
More will come in
as the customer

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.360
person rolls their dice.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.664
The initiating person.

00:12:04.664 --> 00:12:07.075
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:07.075 --> 00:12:07.818
You think less?

00:12:07.818 --> 00:12:08.318
Less, OK.

00:12:08.318 --> 00:12:18.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:18.800
Less than?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.805
AUDIENCE: 35.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:20.930
HUGH MCMANUS: Less than 35.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.850
OK, you're thinking
a lot less, OK.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:23.600
Yeah.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.360
OK.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.310
So yeah, people are
struggling with this.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.370
Intuitively, this is hard.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.290
It's hard to figure out
what this thing should do.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.720
I've already sort of
biased the conversation

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.410
by intimating that the
system's going to behave badly.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.080
But one's intuition,
unfortunately,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.040
about random systems is
that they should even out.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.310
The way the human
brain works is badly

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.420
biased towards just figuring
random things will even out.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.150
There's all sorts of
interesting gambling fallacies

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.955
that are almost hardwired
into people's brains.

00:12:58.955 --> 00:13:02.660
The "law of averages"-- now,
there is no law of averages.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.260
It tends that there is--

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.070
we'll see.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.400
I won't go into that any deeper
than that because what we're

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.100
going to do, given that we can't
really figure it out a priori,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.650
and if we try to do
statistics on it,

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.660
it actually gets really
complicated really fast,

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.993
we're going to do it, all right?

00:13:18.993 --> 00:13:23.432
So let's go ahead
and do our process.

00:13:23.432 --> 00:13:24.890
OK, what I'm going
to ask everybody

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.620
to do the first couple of
rounds is follow my cue.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.202
I'm going to
dictate the process.

00:13:30.202 --> 00:13:31.910
AUDIENCE: And we're
going to try to check

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.900
and make sure you're doing it.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.530
HUGH MCMANUS: Right.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.300
And our facilitators
will check and make

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.110
sure you're doing it right.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.400
The first thing we do
is pick up the dice.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.990
Everybody holding their dice?

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.970
OK, roll it.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:46.190
OK, pick up that many chips,
or three if you only got three.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:52.070
And now everybody together pass,
passing to the right, yeah.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.342
This is a properly done--

00:13:53.342 --> 00:13:54.800
actually, more or
less by accident,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.180
properly done U-shaped cell.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.010
We're passing to the
right, unless you're

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.180
left-handed, in which
case it's not so proper.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.180
OK, everybody done that?

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.590
Now write down what you
did, how many did you pass?

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.170
OK, the customer person
has a slightly harder job.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.150
Everybody figuring that out?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.670
Yeah, OK.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.690
So the only
communication necessary

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:25.240
should be the number of
chips finished, right?

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.160
All right, day two.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.710
Everybody roll the dice.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.230
Pick up that number of
dice or whatever you have,

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.430
and pass it to the right.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.480
Write down your results.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.680
The amount that was finished
needs to be communicated,

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.720
no other talking please.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.615
And finally, day 10.

00:14:51.615 --> 00:14:53.290
Not finally, but day 10.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:58.980
Roll dice, pick up chips,
pass them to the right,

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.390
and write everything down.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.190
Now we're going to pause and
ask how this process is doing.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.630
Who has only one chip?

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.820
A couple of people
have only one chip.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.730
Who has eight ships or more?

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.900
Eight or more.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.680
10 or more?

00:15:24.733 --> 00:15:25.900
Looks like we have a winner.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.078
How many?

00:15:27.078 --> 00:15:27.620
AUDIENCE: 14.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.295
HUGH MCMANUS: 14 chips.

AUDIENCE: Just yesterday.

00:15:33.325 --> 00:15:34.450
HUGH MCMANUS: That's right.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.240
Yeah, 6's are good today.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.430
So yeah, that's
the one difference.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.490
So what should we do
about this process?

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.800
We've got at least
two people who

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.110
are keeping their in-bin clear.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.880
They're sitting back, definitely
they have extra capacity.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.550
Yeah, we've got at least one
person who just cannot keep up

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:59.173
and probably has to go, right?

00:15:59.173 --> 00:16:03.010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.550
So does that mean there's
a bottleneck there?

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.170
Must be, right?

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.760
No, of course not, she has the
same dice as everybody else.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.170
This is a transparent--

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.090
this process is behaving badly
and is actually throwing out

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.850
bad clues about itself.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.380
That looks like a bottleneck.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.600
It isn't, it's just bad luck.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.760
Some people look like
they're doing really well.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.060
No, they're just lucky.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.500
And let's see if
the trends continue.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.960
Day 11, roll the dice,
pick up the chips,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.630
pass them to the right,
write things down.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.300
And 20.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:57.800
Pick them up, hand them
along, write everything down.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.600
OK, so how did that go?

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.170
Let's see, who has 14 or better?

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.050
See if we broke our old record.

HUGH MCMANUS: 13, oh not quite.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.540
So 15, we have a new winner.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.575
How is our problem employee now?

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:25.450
AUDIENCE: A little bit
better, only at eight.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.450
HUGH MCMANUS: Eight, OK.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.100
Down to eight, so
magically got better.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.290
How about our people
that had one before?

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.780
Anybody have one now?

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.350
We still got some
people with not so many.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.690
I think we have one
repeat winner, do we not?

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.770
OK.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.780
So there we go.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.330
The system is, in fact,
behaving fairly badly.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.700
We even had an unintended lesson
in failure of standard process,

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.200
right?

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.790
When we got off
standard process,

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.260
we also had some high
variability in the performance

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.605
of our process.

00:17:57.605 --> 00:17:58.980
There's some
calculations you can

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.330
do they're self-explanatory.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.970
We're going to give you
a few minutes to do that.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.500
Only a few.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.960
If you don't quite get them
finished, that's probably OK.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.080
The one thing we would
really like to see

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.290
is the customer just getting
the average throughput.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.110
That first average
for the customer

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.620
is an important
number because we

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.857
want to see what our
performance looks like.

00:18:24.857 --> 00:18:25.690
Oh that's a new one.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.540
OK, very good.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.710
So you got 2.7 average
throughput on m1.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.750
What's your average
throughput, 2.6?

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.360
OK.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.340
Looks like people are
finishing up the numbers.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:49.615
2.6, average 3.05.

00:18:49.615 --> 00:18:55.610
2.3 and got another average?

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.950
Still working on it, OK.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.410
What about utilizations?

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:05.140
What was our average utilization
at our first medical table?

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.020
AUDIENCE: 0.77

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.629
HUGH MCMANUS: 0.77, OK.

00:19:10.629 --> 00:19:11.605
AUDIENCE: 0.74.

00:19:11.605 --> 00:19:12.480
HUGH MCMANUS: Pardon?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.200
AUDIENCE: 0.74.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.380
HUGH MCMANUS: 0.74, OK.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.860
AUDIENCE: 0.87.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.090
HUGH MCMANUS: 0.87, OK.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.896
We got a good one there.

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:24.146
AUDIENCE: 0.66.

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:32.320
HUGH MCMANUS: 0.66 2.8,
and what's the utilization?

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.200
AUDIENCE: 0.8.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.030
HUGH MCMANUS: 0.8, OK.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.770
So interesting thing here.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.570
And we can look at some
of the other details.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.310
Another thing, I just asked you
to look at your personal sheet

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.270
there.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.210
Is there any strong
trend in the inventories?

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.350
Inventories were definitely
going up from 3 maybe.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.320
Some of them were going down.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.520
What's the overall
trend in inventory?

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.644
Anyone see a trend?

00:20:05.644 --> 00:20:07.630
AUDIENCE: It went
up and stabilized.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.310
HUGH MCMANUS: Went
up and stabilized?

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.270
AUDIENCE: Give or take.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.395
HUGH MCMANUS: Give or take.

00:20:11.395 --> 00:20:13.713
Went up and stabilized,
give or take.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.130
AUDIENCE: Ours
just kept going up.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.690
HUGH MCMANUS: Just
kept going up.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.190
Went up?

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.850
OK.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.310
That was even with three
people with only one?

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.120
AUDIENCE: The average
overall went up.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.770
HUGH MCMANUS: The average
overall still went up,

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:25.562
that's interesting.

00:20:25.562 --> 00:20:27.116
That's interesting.

00:20:27.116 --> 00:20:34.090
And what was the personal
productivity, the utilization

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.810
factor, of, say, you, the one
who never had any inventory?

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.460
What was your
personal productivity?

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.360
AUDIENCE: 0.74.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.500
HUGH MCMANUS: 0.74.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.437
And what about the people
that had lots of inventory?

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.210
AUDIENCE: 0.68

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.313
HUGH MCMANUS: 0.68.

00:20:51.313 --> 00:20:52.230
AUDIENCE: Utilization?

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.022
HUGH MCMANUS: Yeah.

00:20:53.022 --> 00:20:53.730
AUDIENCE: 0.88.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.710
HUGH MCMANUS: 0.88, OK.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.580
So this person's
working very efficiently

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.250
but has lots of inventory.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.390
This person is working
not very efficiently,

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.230
but has lots of inventory.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.950
This person doesn't
have very much--

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.020
this system is
behaving very oddly.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:14.740
It's behaving in ways that
are difficult to understand.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.315
So why?

00:21:17.315 --> 00:21:19.440
AUDIENCE: We're not always
passing the exact number

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.077
that we roll.

00:21:20.077 --> 00:21:21.660
HUGH MCMANUS: We're
not always passing

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.905
the exact number we roll.

00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:27.985
AUDIENCE: In a lower
average process [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:30.360
HUGH MCMANUS: OK, so there's
some unused capacity, right?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.430
You roll a 6, you only have one.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.000
But the inventory's going up.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.720
Is that problem
going to go away?

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.070
AUDIENCE: Eventually.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.650
HUGH MCMANUS: Eventually.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.340
Good answer.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.770
I mean, we got at
the root of it.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.650
It was also sort of a
system problem, right?

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.780
Which is OK, it's behaving
badly because of that,

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.830
which makes it behave worse
because your inventory is

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.760
unpredictable.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.733
So even if there's
lots of inventory,

00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:02.650
the chance that there
would be a low inventory

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.910
and you'd waste a
6 is still there.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.380
It doesn't go away even
as the inventory comes up.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.250
We don't know what's
going to happen

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.238
and things depend on each other.

00:22:15.238 --> 00:22:16.780
The amount that you
have in inventory

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.350
depends on the person next
to you who's rolling dice.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.713
Even if you're
doing great, if they

00:22:22.713 --> 00:22:24.130
roll a whole string
of 1's, you've

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.560
got nothing to work with.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.610
So even if you're rolling all
6's or precisely on 3 and 1/2,

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.490
you're still not being able
to perform because of the way

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:34.870
the system is hooked together.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.190
And this is really the key--
every time anybody rolls a 6

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.190
and doesn't have enough
chips, that capacity is wasted

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.690
and it never comes back.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:45.860
You can never get it back.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.925
And that's where the
"law of averages" fails.

00:22:50.565 --> 00:22:54.280
In mechanical engineering,
we call it a ratchet effect.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.640
It can go one way, but
it can't go the other.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.190
We can lose capacity,
we never get it back.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.760
So that's why we're seeing
these lower utilizations even

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.710
though we did 20 rounds,
which you'd think

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.200
would be enough time
for things to even out.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.170
OK, now we're going to
run a computer simulation.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.330
The first thing
that any person when

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.480
confronted with tangled data
like this should think is we

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.690
need more data.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.300
And in fact, we do.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.400
Although as we will see
in this particular case,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.842
even a very large amount
of data does not help us.

00:23:25.842 --> 00:23:27.800
We're going to run a
computer simulation, which

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.180
does this little exercise
for 20, but then also 200

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.100
and something days.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.540
Looks like this.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:40.160
What's shown here is days and
this is the inventory level

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.270
at the different stations.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.800
The notations here are of
the AP case, but again,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.500
it's the same simulation
for the medical case--

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.700
the four stations, the
inventory at the four stations,

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.168
versus time.

00:23:54.168 --> 00:23:55.710
There's a couple of
things down here.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.910
This is our
processing capability.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.760
This is the WIP that's on
the table, the total WIP.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.750
This is the cycle time.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.820
This is how long it
takes the average chip

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.680
to move through the system.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.180
And this is just a
little luck thing

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.880
to just see if maybe
some of this variation

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.890
is just due to luck.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:17.090
Maybe our average die
roll is better or worse,

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.980
but we're rolling
an awful lot of die,

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.750
so we do expect the actual
average of the die rolls

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:29.750
to kind of even out even if
the system itself doesn't.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.590
OK, so first thing we can
notice about the system is OK,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.940
we're running it 200 times.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.300
Is it settling down?

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.440
It's not.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.790
Just waiting for it to settle
down is not going to work.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:48.880
And let's see, did
that do anything?

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.190
Oh, there we go.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:51.660
Select that.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.290
Boink, I just ran it again.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.010
Came out different.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.020
If I run it again, different.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.550
Even the gross behavior of
the system is not predictable.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.430
It doesn't like, get bigger
and then kind of even off.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.770
If I ran it a billion
times and took the average,

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.145
I'd actually get sort
of a logarithmic curve

00:25:11.145 --> 00:25:12.520
where it would go
up and steadily

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.550
flatten out, although never
actually reach an equilibrium.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.760
But the behavior even
over a large number

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.800
of rounds of any given
instance of this system

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.540
is extremely unpredictable.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.510
So perfect system
except for variability.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:30.090
The variability is making
the system behave very badly.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.530
OK, what can we do about this?

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.530
The other nice thing about
a computer simulation

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.000
is we can change
it relatively easy.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.300
We could, for example, lower
the customer input variability.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.630
That's a favorite
of bad processes.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.427
People say, it's our
customer's fault.

00:25:44.427 --> 00:25:46.260
There's too much customer
input variability.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.850
Like all patients show up Friday
night, so it's not our fault.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.580
Let's lower the customer
input variability some.

00:25:56.143 --> 00:25:57.060
Didn't help very much.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.680
Let's lower it a lot.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.180
Didn't help very much.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.290
Why?

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.880
That appeared to
help a little bit.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.310
Yeah, that's a little better.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.420
That's with a lot less
customer input variability.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.210
But basically, both count.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.640
The process variability
and the customer input

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.270
variability count a lot.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.160
Let's do this, though.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.260
Let's lower the customer
demand just a little bit.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.770
Oh, it looks about the same as
lowering the variability a lot.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.300
Let's lower the
customer demand 20%.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.415
Doesn't look great,
but what's changed?

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.060
It looks like there's a lot
less variability in the process.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:00.090
And if we lower the
customer variability by 30%,

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.750
there's still variability,
but the system can handle it.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.970
Essentially we're
destressing the system,

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.200
running it at a little bit
less than 100% capacity,

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.340
and it behaves a lot better.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.550
And this was brought
up in the AP system

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.740
where they were running
at 100% capacity.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.020
It's the same in this system.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.850
Basically, if we try to stress
it, we only get about 70%.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.970
If we say, you know, it's only
going to run at 70% anyway,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.010
let's just give it
70% of the load.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.380
It actually behaves pretty well.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.540
This is a nonintuitive
effect unless you're

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.540
one of those workers.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.140
What happens if you have
to work all the time

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.220
and something goes wrong?

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.180
Chaos, right?

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.980
Crap, I have to
stay up all night,

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.040
but I can't, I'm too tired,
so things just go to hell.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.240
What happens if you
have six hours of work

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.220
in an eight-hour day and
something goes wrong?

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.900
You can fix it.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.820
From an individual
worker's point of view,

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.310
this is very easy to understand.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.383
The system effect seems
kind of mysterious,

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:08.050
but actually, if you think about
what's happening on the ground,

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.970
if the system is
not fully stressed,

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.740
it can handle variability.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.010
And you don't have to back off
on the system all that much

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:19.170
to handle quite a
lot of variability.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.420
Yeah, I understand that
we're tight on time.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.890
We're coming to a
close here fortunately.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.900
So that's kind of magic.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.720
The other thing we can
do is attack variability,

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.810
and if we attack
variability heroically--

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:40.210
let's reduce variability
30% across the board--

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.680
it helps some.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:48.760
Yeah, it's better, but it's
still behaving kind of badly.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.030
If we reduce variability
70% across the board,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.037
this is truly heroic
variability reduction.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.550
That didn't work well.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.050
Oh, there we go.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.070
Notice when it was all but
one, it was still no good.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.920
We have now reduced variability
heroically across the board,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.520
we've got about the same level
of effect as reducing the--

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.680
so apparently, according to
the simulation, what we need

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.850
is either heroic variability
reduction or a modest decrease

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.230
in the load on the system.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.900
And this is actually a very
powerful practical lesson

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.170
and it comes from
that same equation

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.180
that Earll was showing.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:44.110
If we're mathematically
inclined here,

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.490
what happens when
our utilization

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.680
is very high on this term?

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.870
Just put a 1 in there and see
what happens mathematically.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.750
It goes to infinity, right?

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.320
If the system is
completely loaded

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.630
and there's any
variability at all,

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.430
it will just continue to get
worse and worse in its behavior

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.130
if it's 100% loaded.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.960
The variability was
actually squared,

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.410
so if we can reduce
variability, that's good,

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.080
but this effect is actually
even more powerful.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.880
And if we plot the
two effects, here's

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.020
a plot of what happens
if we control variability

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.370
for various utilizations.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.330
If we have a heavily loaded
system-- that's this one--

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.670
and we reduce
variability, once we've

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.710
driven it down really low--

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.513
this is the cue
time or inventory,

00:30:33.513 --> 00:30:34.680
they're basically the same--

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.710
it will start to behave.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.260
But if there's
noticeable variation

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.040
on a heavily loaded system,
it's going to behave badly.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.585
If it's not so heavily loaded,
it almost doesn't matter.

00:30:50.585 --> 00:30:52.710
This is a lightly loaded
system and the variability

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.793
doesn't matter, this is a
moderately loaded system

00:30:54.793 --> 00:30:57.510
and reducing
variability is good.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.090
And that's not really
linear, but basically,

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.610
sort of proportionally,
if we reduce variability,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.960
we get better behavior.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.610
But in a very heavily
loaded system,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.350
we really have to drive it to 0.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.430
This is Six Sigma.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.070
If we have a system that we
want to load really heavily,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.550
we want to make
billions of ICs, then

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.010
we have to drive the
variability very close to 0

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.570
to get the system to behave.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.690
This is the converse thought.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.900
If we ease off on utilization
for various variabilities,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.490
what we see is that
blow-up effect,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.730
that divided by 0 as
we get close to 1.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.160
And it's almost independent
of the variability level.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:39.190
At any level, if we back off
some from 100% utilization,

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.890
the behavior actually
gets a lot better.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.980
Question?

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.050
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering how
organizational management deals

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.510
with this fact if
they know that they

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.728
need to operate significantly
under their capacity--

00:31:51.728 --> 00:31:53.395
HUGH MCMANUS: That's
a tough one, right?

00:31:53.395 --> 00:31:55.228
AUDIENCE: --in order
to control their system

00:31:55.228 --> 00:31:59.275
versus having a perfect
system without variation.

00:31:59.275 --> 00:32:00.400
HUGH MCMANUS: That's right.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:00.942
That's right.

00:32:00.942 --> 00:32:03.760
Managers like Six Sigma because
if your system is perfect,

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.220
you can load it at 100%.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.450
They want to hear that.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.490
That's a message
they want to hear.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.980
In systems like health
care or engineering,

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.840
getting the variability very,
very low is very, very hard.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.580
And this is a very rich field.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.470
In the interest
of time, I'm going

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:28.010
to jump to a couple
of useful tips.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:32.205
One is that one of
the purposes of Lean,

00:32:32.205 --> 00:32:33.580
and this was
actually illustrated

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.650
very nicely by
the AP case study,

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.140
is to free up those resources.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.800
Not in order to lay people off
or necessarily save money even,

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.910
but if you can take 10% or 20%
of your non-value-added time

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.640
out of your day, what
does that get you?

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.190
That gets you that
headroom that allows

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.800
you to deal with variability.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.640
And it's one of the sort of
root causes of why Lean seems

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.330
to have a magic effect
of increasing quality

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.720
and throughput time when that's
not even what you're aiming at.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.370
If you just take
waste out of a system,

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.130
suddenly everybody in the system
has a little bit of extra time

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:17.050
to deal with variation, to
deal with things going wrong.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:21.860
So that's sort of
the hint, number one.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.260
The other thing is that in
terms of variability reduction,

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.670
although that's an art,
there's no one answer.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:34.200
There are things
that help a lot.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.870
Reducing something like
health care variability to 0

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:41.370
is obviously not even
possible, but one

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:44.400
of the things about
actually both health

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.170
care and engineering-type
processes

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.960
is that the distributions
aren't really normal.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.160
It tends to be like, a
bunch of standard cases

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.150
and then some wacko ones.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.162
Well, what happens
to the variability

00:33:56.162 --> 00:33:58.620
in terms of those equations if
you just take the wacko ones

00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.300
off the table?

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:03.960
Gets a lot better, right?

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.260
It gets a lot better.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:10.080
So essentially, special case
handling for the outliers.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.162
In the simulation
game, we originally

00:34:12.162 --> 00:34:13.620
designed the health
care simulation

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.495
to be part of a three-day
seminar where you'd

00:34:15.495 --> 00:34:19.110
play that last round at the
end, like after this lesson,

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.500
and there's something in there
called a patient advocate.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.830
Anybody even look at that card?

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.680
What did it do?

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.679
AUDIENCE: It helped
those patients that

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.025
would take the most
amount of time and helped

00:34:31.025 --> 00:34:32.400
shepherd them
through the system.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.199
HUGH MCMANUS: Right, exactly.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:37.739
In terms of the simulation,
it took the 6's off, right?

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.350
And if you looked at
the distributions,

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:41.639
they were highly non-standard.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.199
The 6's were horrible.

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:48.090
And so that's actually
a real example

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:52.500
of taking the really difficult
cases out of the standard flow

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.929
of the system, and that
makes the standard flow

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:55.679
work a lot better.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.554
Of course, you have to
devote some resources,

00:34:57.554 --> 00:35:00.000
some special resources,
to the difficult people.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.420
But there's ways you can
kind of knock the top off

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.660
of high variabilities that
can help a lot on that side.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.090
On the capacity
side, the real key

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:13.020
is to use the benefits
of any kind of Lean

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.210
to essentially plow
them back into making

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:20.070
people's lives easier so they
have a little bit of extra time

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.880
to absorb the variability.

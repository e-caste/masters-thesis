00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.690
In this case study,
the challenge

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.060
was to focus on one very
important characteristic

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.270
of this very flexible
electronic sensor.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.650
And that, in fact,
is what we're going

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.730
to focus on in this
attempt to show

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.880
the flexibility of this very,
very thin film of electronics.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.590
So I first put it on
something that is strange.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.610
It's actually the inside
of a plastic Petri dish.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.810
And I'm thinking that that's
showing the flexibility.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.620
And I took another point
of view of the same set up.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.020
I kind of liked it because
I'm very, very focused

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.770
and you can see the
bending and folding.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.810
Then I tried something
a little more rigid,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.640
a piece of cardboard that was
folded into a couple of areas.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.160
I sort of like that one.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.810
The researchers took
their own images,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.040
which are these in
front of you, showing

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.400
that this sensor is placed on
the skin and that it stretches.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.190
And I'm not sure about
which images are better.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.770
These definitely showed the
stretchability and flexibility

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.670
of this very thin
membrane sensor.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.830
Whether or not you want to
look at this for a long time is

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.950
another story, but maybe take
a look at the differences

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.720
and you make the decision.

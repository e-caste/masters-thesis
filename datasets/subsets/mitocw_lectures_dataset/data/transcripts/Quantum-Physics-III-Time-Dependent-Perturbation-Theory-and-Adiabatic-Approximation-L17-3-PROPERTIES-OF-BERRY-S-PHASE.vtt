00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.460
PROFESSOR: So my comments.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:23.510
First one-- if the psi n of
t can be chosen to be real,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.385
the geometric face vanishes.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.990
So why is that?

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.260
The geometric face is,
remember, the integral

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:51.600
of this new factor, which was
i psi n of t psi n of t dot.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.610
You had to integrate that thing
to get the geometric face.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.200
We explained that this
quantity in general is--

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.090
well, in general, it's always
imaginary, this quantity.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.180
And then with an i,
this is a real quantity

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.960
which we've been using.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.710
But if this is
imaginary-- look at this.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.080
This is imaginary.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.850
How can it be imaginary
if psi is real?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.500
It can't be.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.780
If psi is real, imagine
doing that integral.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.870
You can kind of imagine.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.996
So it has to be
0 if psi is real.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:35.496
Yes?

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:37.492
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:39.490
Why did we say
that was imaginary?

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.710
PROFESSOR: We proved
this was imaginary.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.630
We did calculate the derivative
with respect to time of psi

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.980
with psi, and we proved
that this was imaginary.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.320
And now I'm saying if this was
imaginary but if psi is real,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.830
the only possibility
is that this is 0.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.880
But you can prove, in fact,
that this is 0, if this is real.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.490
I can do it in a second.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.400
It's i integral psi n of
p-- because it's real--

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.310
d dt of psi n of t.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.330
Output an x here,
and this is dx.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.760
That's what it is
if psi is real.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.620
Otherwise there
would be a star here.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.130
But if it's real,
there's no star.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.220
But this is just
the integral of 1/2

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.800
of d dt of psi of
x and t squared dx.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.420
The d dt is that.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.610
And then the d dt goes
out of the integral--

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.580
so this is i over 2
d dt of the integral

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.510
of psi squared of x and t dx.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.810
But that integral is 1,
so the derivative is 0.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.830
So there's no geometric face.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.300
So if you have real
instantaneous eigenstates,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.550
don't even think
of Berry's phase.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.445
There's another case where
you don't get a Berry's phase.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.530
So when I'm speaking of
Berry's phase at this moment,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.320
I mean the Berry's phase from
a closed pathing configuration

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.100
space.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.620
So if the configuration
space is one-dimensional,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.660
the Berry phase vanishes.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:04:00.475
Barry's phase vanishes for
1v configuration space.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.380
Why is that?

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.990
Well, what do we have to do?

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.730
The Berry's phase will be the
integral over the closed path

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.790
in the configuration
space psi of r d, d r--

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.310
because there's
just one side of r--

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.620
d r.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.540
You have to
integrate that thing.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.080
That is the Berry phase--
is the integral of the Berry

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.140
connection over--

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.110
this is capital R--

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.140
over the space.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.430
But now, if this configuration
space is one-dimensional--

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.770
this is r--

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.380
a closed path is a path that
goes like this and black.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.640
It retraces itself.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.220
So it integrates this
quantity with increasing r,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.860
and then it integrates
the same quantity

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.880
with decreasing r,
and the two cancel,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.640
and this phase is equal to 0.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.210
So you cannot get a Berry's
phase if you have one

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.260
dimension.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.150
You cannot get the Berry's phase
if you have real instantaneous

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.710
eigenstates.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.840
But you can get a Berry's
phase in two dimensions,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.680
in three dimensions, and
there are several examples.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.240
I will mention one
example, and and then

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.080
leave Barry's phase
for some exercises.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.430
So in 3D, for example--

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.660
3D's nice.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.560
A 3D configuration space
is the perfect place

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.530
to confuse yourself,
because you have

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.740
three dimensions
of configuration

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.360
and three dimensions of space.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.800
So nice interplay between them--

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.300
r1, r2, r3.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.800
And then you have an
integral-- the Berry's phase

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.810
is an integral-- over
a closed path here.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.420
So let's call gamma and
let's call this surface, s,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.590
whose boundary is gamma.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.100
So what is the Berry phase?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.140
The Berry phase is the
integral over gamma

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.355
of the Berry connection d r.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.730
But what is that?

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.180
That is, by Stokes'
theorem, the integral

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.680
over the surface of
the curl of the Berry

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.070
connection times the area.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:01.910
And so the area on that surface.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.670
Stokes' theorem--
remember in E&M?

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.800
So here was a vector potential
gives you a magnetic field--

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.980
so the integral
of a along a loop

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.680
was equal to the flux
of the magnetic field

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.900
through the surface.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.520
And now the berry
phase along the loop

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.880
is equal to the
integral of the--

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.380
we should call it
Berry magnetic field?

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.880
No.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.610
When people think berries--

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.740
curvature.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.500
As in the sense that the
magnetic field is the curvature

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.620
of that connection.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.550
So this is called the
Berry's curvature,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.340
but you think about
magnetic field--

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.750
Berry's curvature.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.310
So the Berry's
curvature-- people

00:07:51.310 --> 00:08:00.720
go with d is the curl sub r of
the Berry connection a of r.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.420
It's the magnetic field,
so it's the integral

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.000
of d over that surface.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.400
So they're nice analogies.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.160
So one example you
will do in recitation--

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.520
I hope-- you have
Max over there--

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:29.330
is the classic example of
a spin in a magnetic field.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.539
So I will just say a couple
of words as an introduction,

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.230
but it's a very
nice computation.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.280
It's a great exercise
to figure out

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.280
if you understand
all these things.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.460
It's done in [INAUDIBLE]
explicitly in some ways,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.710
and it's a great
thing to practice.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.070
So if you want the
little challenge--

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.680
I know you're busy with
papers and other things.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:06.860
but the idea is that you
have a magnetic field--

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.880
the cogs of a
magnetic field, B0n--

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.580
along some direction n, and
you have a spin 1/2 particle

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.710
pointing in that direction n.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.705
But then you start
letting it vary in time--

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.990
that unit vector.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.550
So this unit vector varies
in time and traces a path.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.890
And if it's idiomatic
process, the spin

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.150
will remain in the instantaneous
energy eigenstate, which

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.980
is spin up in this
direction, and it will track

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.730
the magnetic field, basically.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.810
There will be some small
probability it flips,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.150
but it's small.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.370
And if this is an
idiomatic process,

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.210
that error can be small.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:14.980
So as you move around here,
there will be a geometric face,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.210
and the geometric
face is quite nice.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.560
So for the spin up state--

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.170
m+ state-- if it
follows this thing,

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:34.540
the geometric phase for the spin
up state in this closed path

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.760
in configuration space--

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.150
this is the configuration
space of the magnetic field--

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.680
will just be given by minus 1/2.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:52.200
This comes from spin
1/2 times an invariant

00:10:52.200 --> 00:11:00.920
of this loop, which is the
solid angle traced by this loop.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.940
So the geometric phase that's
acquired by this motion

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.570
is proportional just to the
solid angle of this loop.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:13.380
It's a very nice result. Shows
how geometric everything is.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000
We would now like to look at
some applications of the rocket

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.690
equation, in which we have an
external force plus dmr dt,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.090
where m and r is the mass of
the rocket at time t times

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.360
the relative velocity
of the exhaust velocity

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.450
was equal to m of
r dv rocket, dt.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.420
And now we want to consider
some special cases.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.280
So our first example
will be a case when

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.480
there is no external force.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.820
Now, this might be
characteristic of a rocket that

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.660
is far away from any type
of gravitational interaction

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.910
and is either speeding
up or slowing down.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970
This is a special
case that will enable

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.680
us to understand our problem.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.860
Now, we'll draw a
picture at time t.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.020
Just to remind ourselves,
we have mass of the rocket.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.200
It's moving with a
velocity v of r of t,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.190
and we're going to call this
our plus i hat direction.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.780
And then at time
t plus delta t, we

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.150
have our fuel
delta, delta m fuel,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
which was equal to minus
delta m rocket moving

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.500
with the relative velocity u
plus v of r of t plus delta t.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:31.170
And our rocket itself is moving
with v of r of t plus delta t.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.479
So in our coordinate
system, we have

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.140
to remember that
the exhaust speed is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.932
relative to the rocket,
and we define that to be u.

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:46.680
Since the rocket
is moving forward

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.930
and we've chosen plus i
hat in that direction,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.580
it's minus u i hat, and we
can write our vectors vr

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.920
as v of r i hat.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.510
So our rocket equation
in this special case

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:17.210
becomes dmr dt, minus u i
hat, equals mr dvr dt i hat.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.850
Now, in this equation,
remember that it's

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.700
important to recall that m
of r is a function of time.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.180
Unless we have an explicit model
for how the mass is ejected,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.370
in principle we can't solve
for the time behavior,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.040
but we can look at this
differential equation

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.870
just by eliminating the time
completely by multiplying

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.970
through by dt, in which
case we have minus dmr u

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.320
equals m of r dvr.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.780
Now, this is separable
and I can integrate it,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.380
so I'll bring the terms minus
dmr over mr on this side,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.590
times u, and that's equal
to dvr on that side.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.620
Now, when we
integrate, we're going

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.860
to be integrating
mass of the rocket,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.560
say at some initial
time, t initial,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.497
to mass of the rocket
at some final time.

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.329
And over here, we're
going to be integrating

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.800
the velocity from some initial
time to some final time.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.430
When both these integrals
are straightforward,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.260
on the left-hand side
we have a natural log,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:40.750
so we have minus u, natural log
of mrt final over mrt initial.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.840
And this side, we just have
the velocity difference,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.690
v of r at t final
minus vr at t initial.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.050
Now, again, we always
check our minus signs,

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.230
but recall the mass of
the rocket is decreasing.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.390
So the log of a
fraction is negative,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.930
so we have a positive
quantity on this side.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.480
And that's indicating that
the velocity has increased

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.880
on that side, and so we conclude
that the velocity of the rocket

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.200
at its final time is equal
to the velocity of the rocket

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.630
at its initial time.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.600
Now, here, I'll
keep this minus sign

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:29.380
in here-- minus natural log
of mrt final over mrt initial.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.460
Now, in our answer,
we need to know

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.920
what the mass of the rocket
is at the final time,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.770
so in general this
equation is still not

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.810
going to give us an
explicit expression for v

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.210
of t final, unless we
have one special case

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.890
in which our final time is when
all the fuel has been burned.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.130
And our initial time is the
rocket with all the fuel there,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.840
and then this ratio
is a known ratio.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.120
And you can look at a variety
of different examples for that.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.330
So there is an
example of the solving

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.378
the motion of a rocket
with no external forces.

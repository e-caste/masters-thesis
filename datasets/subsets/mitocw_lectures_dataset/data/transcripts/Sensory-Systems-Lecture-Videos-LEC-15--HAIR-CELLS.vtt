00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:27.210
PROFESSOR: Maybe
I should go over

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.350
real quickly what
we did on Monday.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.540
We can start out with we
covered the various parts

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.060
of the auditory periphery--
the external, middle,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.935
and inner ears.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.430
And we had a paper on the
function of the external ear

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.040
and how it can help you localize
sounds when you distort it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.435
by using clay molds that you
can put in subjects' pinnae.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.930
Your sense of
localization of sounds,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.099
especially those at different
elevation, is all screwed up.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.140
And you can relearn
because you still

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.880
have some bends and quirky
geometry in your pinnae.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.300
Even with a little
clay in there,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.770
you can relearn using new
clues to localize sounds

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.880
in elevation, but it takes
a little bit of time.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.630
So the subjects in
that paper relearned

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.870
how to localize sounds.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.460
Now, there are other
cues that we'll

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.060
be dealing with for localization
of sounds in azimuth.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.945
And that's where you
use two separate ears.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.390
For example, if a
sound's off to my right,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.170
it's going to hit
my right ear first.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.500
And then because sound travels
at a finite velocity in air,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.050
it's going to hit
my left ear second.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.310
So there's a delay
between the two ears,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.370
and that's a primary cue
for localizing in azimuth,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.620
in the horizontal plane.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.420
So one comment I
had after class was

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.860
that was a good
paper on relearning

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.790
sound localization
with new ears.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.680
Someone came up
and said they had

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.360
read that in another
discussion group.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.030
And I think it is
a very good paper,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.800
because it deals with the
function of the external ear.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.050
It deals with how you
can relearn new cues.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.100
Let's say if when you grow up,
your pinnae are getting bigger

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.980
from being an
infant to an adult.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.280
So you have to relearn
those cues over time.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.590
We talked about the
function of the middle ear,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.600
securing efficient
transmission of sound energy

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.230
from air into the
fluid of the inner ear.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.160
And we talked about, of course,
the physical characteristics

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.890
of sound, what sound frequency
is, what sound level is.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.770
We talked about
simple sounds-- that

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.890
is, pure tones or
single frequencies.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.100
More complex sounds
like musical sounds that

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.890
have a bunch of
frequencies, and even speech

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.740
sounds that have a whole
bunch of different frequencies

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.180
and they're changed
a little bit.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.180
And the change is very
perceptually obvious

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.200
in the form of changing from
one vowel to another vowel.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.004
And so another comment I got
by email, someone said, well,

00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:21.420
can you tell me
where you're from?

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.445
Because you have a
Midwestern accent.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.020
OK, speaking of speech sounds.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.300
And that's a very
interesting comment,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.660
because I've been in the
Boston area since 1983.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.340
And that's 30 years.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.620
And I am from the Midwest.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.310
In fact, I brought my
Midwestern clothes today.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.610
I got my hat and my
Michigan sweatshirt

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.890
which I got out of the rag pile.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.380
Or is it my Harvard sweatshirt?

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.360
Let's see.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.096
It says, "Harvard,
Michigan of the East."

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:54.720
So I guess it's my
Michigan sweatshirt.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.075
It's got the Michigan
colors, maize and blue.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.540
And so I grew up in
Ann Arbor, Michigan.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.030
I probably-- it
depends on who you are,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.050
you have to sort
of listen for it.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.770
According to my wife I still
have it, and maybe some of you

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.940
can hear my Midwestern twang.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.329
So it's an evidence that
you have very good hearing

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.640
that you can hear these
different not only vowels

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.950
but accents.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.860
So that's kind of
interesting that I

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.980
was reading a book
just last week.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.530
And it's called Our Boston.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.840
You can get at the MIT COOP.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.220
And one of the chapters
is on regional accents.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.740
And I'll do a
little reading maybe

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.630
just at the very beginning
of this chapter which

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.480
talks about regional
accents and linguists.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.295
I'll just read you
the first sentence.

00:04:46.295 --> 00:04:50.130
It says, "As most
linguists might tell you,

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.653
regional accents are
a lot like underpants.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.590
Everybody has them, and usually
no one notices his or her own.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.950
But the world would be
a very different place

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.710
in their absence."

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.610
So that's what
regional accents are.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.770
How many of you
guys are linguists,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.990
or interested in linguistics?

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.670
Just a few, OK.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.670
Well, of course is it's
a fascinating science,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.650
and it intersects with
the auditory world.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.750
So today we're going to
launch into the next aspect

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.910
of the auditory periphery
which is the inner ear.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.820
And the inner ear, the
scientific name, of course,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.820
is the cochlea, from
the Greek snail shell.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.600
We're going to talk about
the anatomy of the cochlea.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.730
This is the cochlea here.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.990
We're going to talk
about the vibration

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.620
patterns in the cochlea.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.470
Because of course, the
cochlear structures

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.385
are vibrating in
response to sound.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.250
And the original
pioneer in that area

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.370
was of course George
von Bekesy, who

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.290
was a Hungarian physicist
who worked for the telephone

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.520
company, later came to
Harvard and won the Nobel

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.690
Prize in 1961.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.740
So we always put him
up on the pedestal

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.440
because he is the only
winner for the hearing

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.720
field for the Nobel Prize.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.470
So those in the
vision system, you

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.190
can pull out all these people
who've won the Nobel Prize.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.140
In the auditory field,
there's one winner.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.140
It's George von Bekesy.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.325
So we'll talk about his work
on cochlear vibration patterns.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.990
Then we'll talk about
the receptor cells

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.160
for hearing, which are inner
hair cells and outer hair

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.660
cells.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.120
There are two
types, a little bit

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.405
like you had the rods
and cones in the retina.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.740
But these have very different
and complementary roles,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.200
and we'll talk about the
separate functions of those two

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.930
types of hair cells.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.920
We'll talk about the outer
hair cell electromotility.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.190
We'll go into what that is.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.060
And finally if we
have time, we'll

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.870
end up with otoacoustic
emissions, which

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.870
are a very interesting research
and clinical tool for testing

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.370
here.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.280
So cochlear anatomy,
here is an early drawing

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.240
of the cochlea by DeVerny.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.360
Back in the 1600s,
they already knew

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.100
that the cochlea was
like a snail shell.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.590
And in the middle of
it, it had a membrane,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.570
and the membrane went all the
way from the base to the apex.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.570
This very basalmost
part is called the hook.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.150
And then the membrane
spirals around

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.090
and goes to the very apex.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.290
And so I have a very simple
wire model that I can hold up,

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.040
do the same thing.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.634
I can bend it any way I want to.

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:51.300
Here's the hook.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.240
You can see this in
three dimensions here.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.770
OK, so the cochlea
is a spiral shaped

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.350
structure which has
a membrane in it.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.850
The name of the
big membrane-- it

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.090
has several membranes-- the
name of the big membrane

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:12.000
is called the basilar
membrane, which

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.505
of course stands for base.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.620
And we'll see that the hair
cells and the other cells

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.970
associated with them sit right
on top of the basilar membrane.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.380
We can go to that
in just a second.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.120
Anatomists more recently
like to cut sections

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.070
through structures.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.600
And that's because the light
microscope, the electron

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.960
microscope, can resolve
very small things

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.710
like cells and parts of cells
very well in thin sections.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.160
So if you cut right down the
middle of that snail shell

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.860
and took out a thin section,
you'd get this view.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.790
So of course, all
this gray shading

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.380
on the outside and even
parts of the inside is bone.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.070
So this is a bony structure.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.040
It's very different
from the eyeball,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.990
which is all soft tissue.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.060
This is a bony structure.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.410
In the middle, there
is a nerve coming in.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.575
That's the auditory nerve.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.870
The auditory nerve
starts in the cochlea

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.260
and sends messages to the
brain, which is down here.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.100
It's been cut away.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:23.500
You can see the tube of the
snail shell, or cochlea,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.460
is subdivided by this big
membrane, this basilar

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:26.960
membrane.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.155
And that there's another
membrane in here too.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.704
The name of that membrane
is Reissner's membrane,

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:33.870
but it's not that important.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.310
But the picture you
get here sort of

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.925
looks like steps on a ladder.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:49.835
And the Latin name first steps
is "scala"-- or "scalae,"

00:09:49.835 --> 00:09:50.735
if it's plural.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.775
This means steps.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.160
For instance, a musical
scale is whole steps,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.710
and every now and
then a half step.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.880
So these, to the
early anatomists,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.940
looked like steps on a ladder.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.280
But actually what they are,
are fluid-filled compartments

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.760
separated by membranes.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.060
And there are three
fluid-filled compartments here.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.060
And this is another
cross section

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.970
of just one turn of the cochlea.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.680
This compartment is
called scala tympani.

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:31.060
This compartment is
called scala vestibuli.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.320
And this one, which is in the
middle, is called scala media.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.185
So there are three
scalae in the cochlea.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:50.800
So scala tympani, vestibuli,
and media, or middle.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:58.550
And the hair cells
sit on this membrane

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.930
that separates scala
tympani from scala media.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.110
And the hair cells here,
the inner hair cells

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.560
and the outer hair
cells, are surrounded

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.990
by a whole bunch of other cells.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.430
And that whole receptor organ
is called the organ of Corti.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.520
So it says that down
here, the organ of Corti.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.390
And Corti was one of the
first Italian anatomists

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.400
to really draw the
structure correctly,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.020
although he got it
a little bit wrong.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.120
These round circles are
the outer hair cells.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.170
If you cut this in
cross section and look

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.110
at this in a magnified
version, there's

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.600
only one inner hair cell.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.665
He put two in his drawing, so
it's a little bit incorrect.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.360
But his name is now
attached to the organ.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.670
The organ of Corti is
where the hair cells are,

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.250
and there's a whole bunch
of other supporting cells

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.250
that keep the hair
cells in their place.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.745
OK, so the receptor organ
sits on the basilar membrane.

00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:01.940
And the organ of Corti's there.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.080
There's this other membrane
that separates scala media

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.175
from scala vestibuli.

00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:09.110
It's called Reissner's membrane,
but it's not important.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.780
OK, so that's the structure
of the organ of Corti.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.020
And during the 1930s
and '40s, people

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.170
started thinking about,
well, how does this thing

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.350
move when you stimulate
the ear with sound?

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.940
And George von Bekesy,
as I've said before,

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.440
was the first to make
really good measurements

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.930
of the motion of the basilar
membrane in response to sound.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:37.120
And this is a cutaway diagram
of his experimental setup.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.030
This is the cochlea
in cross section.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.280
Of course, he had the
whole cochlea there.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.200
And he used cochleas
from cadavers.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.150
He would go to the mortuary,
get a temporal bone

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.870
and drill away all the bone
and be left with the cochlea

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.360
and put it in his Petri dish.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.020
He had a huge sound
source that he

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.610
would apply right
to the oval window.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.800
He would take out the stapes
and drive the cochlear fluids

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.810
directly.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.434
And as we said last time,
if you have sound in air

00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:09.850
and are trying to
get it in fluid,

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.370
you really to crank it up.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.960
And so it's a huge sound source.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.730
And he stimulated
way up at 140 dB,

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.440
way at the top end of the
curve we had last time.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.847
He needed to drive
it that high not only

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:28.860
to get sound into
the fluid but also

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.395
so that his measurement system
could pick up these movements.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.130
The movements tend to
be very, very small.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.790
In response to sound,
maybe the basilar membrane

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.186
is moving only a few nanometers.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.790
OK, but it's going to
move a lot more nanometers

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.290
if you blast the heck out of it.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:54.610
And his observation device was
simply a microscope, a water

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.980
immersion lens that he brought
down and focused on the basilar

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.890
membrane to see the thing move.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.530
So he didn't have
very good resolution.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.100
Maybe he could only
see micrometers

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.020
in terms of movements, so he
had to turn up the sound very

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.525
high to get the
thing to vibrate.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.320
So we can criticize
his experiments now

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.960
for several reasons.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.150
Number one, we don't
listen way up at 140 dB.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.080
In fact, those kinds
of sounds are actually

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.550
damaging to the hair cells.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.000
But we can also say there
weren't any hair cells.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.225
It's a dead preparation.

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:36.300
It's a cochlea
from a cadaver, OK?

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.090
And what we know now is that
the movements and vibration

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:45.520
patterns of the cochlea are very
different in a dead preparation

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.250
than they are in a
living preparation.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.510
We'll get to that
in just a minute.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.450
In spite of those problems--
I mean, von Bekesy

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.650
was working in the '30s.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.810
He didn't have very good
measurement devices,

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.050
he had to use what he had.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.055
He discovered some
very important things.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.670
One of the things was that the
basilar membrane-- and here's

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.780
a diagram of the
basilar membrane.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.120
It's this horizontal line
here, if there's no sound.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.960
And it's stretched out now as
if you took the snail shell

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.930
and unwound the coil and made
it a long, straight basilar

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.430
membrane.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:27.320
So the base is over here
and the apex is up here.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.500
And we think that that doesn't
change the vibration pattern

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.590
at all.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.770
The only reason that
the cochlea is coiled

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.757
is to save space in your head.

00:15:37.757 --> 00:15:39.215
Otherwise, it would
be pretty long.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.470
So unwinding this is
just a convenient way

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.060
to look at the
vibration pattern.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.790
He measured in the intact
cochlea, of course.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:56.950
This pattern of vibration
that von Bekesy observed

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.640
was called a traveling wave.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.310
OK, so this-- traveling
waves in the cochlea.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.180
And basically what that means is
these are snapshots-- one, two,

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.490
three, and four.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.620
At one instant, the wave
pattern looks like number one.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.460
At the next instant,
it moves, or travels,

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.880
and looks like number two,
and so on and so forth,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.900
three and four.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.230
So the traveling wave
starts in the base

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.685
and travels up to the apex.

00:16:27.685 --> 00:16:31.630
And remember, the
base of the cochlear

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.630
is where the input is coming.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:38.230
If we go back to our first
diagram here, remember,

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.270
the stapes is pushing in
and out at the oval window.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.560
And that's way down at
the base of the cochlear.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.480
And what we're seeing
is these vibrations

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.090
are traveling from the base
all the way up to the apex,

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.170
and it's taking a little
bit of time to do so.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.790
So that's what von
Bekesy discovered--

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.985
there's a traveling wave.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.690
The second thing
he discovered is

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.990
that the peak of the traveling
wave-- you notice these dash

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:13.390
curves draw the envelope or
the maximal point of movement

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.470
of this basilar membrane.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:20.060
There's a peak of this traveling
when the basilar membrane is

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.065
vibrating the most.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.470
That peak changes as a function
of the frequency of the sound

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.415
that you used to stimulate
your preparation.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.610
And this diagram shows that, but
I have a little better movie,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.390
or demonstration, that
shows you a traveling wave

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.590
that's a little bit
easier to understand.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.210
So I actually have two of them.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.795
These were made by Chris Shera
at Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.550
And again, this is the
basilar membrane stretched out

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.600
in a long line from the
base of the cochlea up

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.400
to the apex of the cochlear.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.400
And this is a situation
with no sound.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.170
So now we're going to turn on
a sound that is a low frequency

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:03.790
tone.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:09.251
So tone is synonymous with pure
tone or a single frequency.

00:18:09.251 --> 00:18:10.875
So it's just going
to be one frequency.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.990
And the input comes
in here at the stapes.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.170
And you'll see the pattern
of movement of the basilar

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.680
membrane in response to
the low frequency tone.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.191
Whoops, pressed
the wrong button.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.005
It takes a little bit of
time for this to develop.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.200
And then you can see the complex
pattern, or traveling wave.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.110
It seems to start here
and go up to here.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.290
It goes up to a peak and
then quickly comes down.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.370
There's almost no movement
right at the apex there.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:53.030
So one thing about that movement
that I said before is there's

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.940
a peak of vibration at a
certain place along the basilar

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.810
membrane.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.640
The other thing is that at
any point along the basilar

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.835
membrane that's moving, it's
moving as a function of time.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.750
And actually, if you knew what
the frequency of that tone

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.670
is and looked at the
frequency of movement here,

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.910
it would be the same.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.250
So the basilar membrane
is moving up and down

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.690
at the same frequency
as the sound stimulus.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.170
Maybe that'll be a
little bit more clear

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.600
when I go to the next one,
because the next movie shows

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.330
the basilar membrane vibration
to three tones-- the low one

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.630
that we just saw,
a middle frequency

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.000
one, and a high frequency one.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.540
And as you can indicate,
you can probably

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.100
get from my hand movements,
the low frequency tone

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.090
is going to maximally
vibrate here toward the apex.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.320
The middle frequency is going
to be maximally vibrating here,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.900
and the high frequency is going
to be maximally vibrating over

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.820
here.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.520
OK, so there's going
to sort of a frequency

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.275
analysis along the length
of this basilar membrane.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.930
The other thing I want you
to notice when the movie is

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:10.080
playing is how fast these
three places along the basilar

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.860
membrane are moving,
see if they're

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.910
moving at the same speed
or at a different speed.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.860
So this is the
one we had before.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.340
This is the middle frequency
and this is the high frequency.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.990
See how much faster this
is going back and forth

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.180
than the slow one,
and see that it's

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.490
peeking in a different place?

00:20:39.551 --> 00:20:40.050
OK.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.730
So this is, we think, due to
the physical characteristics

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.180
of the way this
membrane is set up.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.430
For example, down here the
membrane is fairly tense

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.280
and it's very short in width.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.010
It's like those little tiny
strings on the piano way

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.515
up at the right end of the
piano for the high notes.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.865
And it's naturally going to
vibrate at high frequencies.

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:08.840
When you get up toward
the apex, everything

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.980
gets real wide in
terms of the membranes.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.480
The cells get bigger.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.920
Everything's heavier,
and it's naturally

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.120
going to vibrate slower.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.560
And it's going to vibrate
best for low frequencies.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.250
OK, so there's this analysis
along the length of the cochlea

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.360
in terms of high
frequencies are mapped here,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.264
mid frequencies are mapped
here, and low frequencies

00:21:31.264 --> 00:21:31.930
are mapped here.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.890
There is, if you will, a place
code for sound frequency.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.560
So sound frequencies
are broken up

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:52.986
into a place code-- low
frequencies apically,

00:21:52.986 --> 00:21:54.735
and higher and higher
frequencies basally.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:03.040
Secondly, if you buy into
my frequency, or our timing

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:12.590
of the movement, there's
also a timing code

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:18.090
in that high frequencies
are vibrating much quicker

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.245
and low frequencies are
vibrating much slower.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.730
And as we'll learn
in a week or two,

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.070
the nervous system keeps
track of both of those things.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.340
There are hair cells down here
in the base of your cochlea

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.950
which are connected to the
nerve fibers that only innervate

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:40.030
them and are only active when
there's a high frequency sound

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.110
stimulus.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.350
They send that
message to the brain.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.130
The brain says, ah, here
are some high frequency

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.540
or high pitched sounds.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.680
Conversely, there are
hair cells up here

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.190
that are only responding
when the basilar membrane is

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.740
stimulated with a low frequency.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.990
And they're telling their
nerve fibers only send

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.476
action potentials to the brain
when there's a low frequency

00:23:03.476 --> 00:23:04.100
sound stimulus.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.460
So what are examples?

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.950
Everybody knows
what a low pitched

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.116
and a high pitched sound is.

00:23:10.116 --> 00:23:14.080
But for example, one of the
ways you tell a male voice

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.910
from a female voice
is that female voices

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.520
have higher pitches to
them, higher frequencies,

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.090
maybe an octave higher.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.090
So immediately usually,
even over the telephone,

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.890
you can tell I'm talking
to a female speaker

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.180
because the
frequencies are higher

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.035
and they're mapped more toward
the basal end of your cochlea.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.900
Male voices that have
lower frequencies

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.700
are mapped to more
apical positions.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.980
Any questions about that?

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.740
Now how do we, in the modern
times, well beyond von Bekesy,

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.820
how do we measure these motions?

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.390
You're sort of taking
it for granted from me

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.200
that we can make
these measurements.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.490
Well, von Bekesy used an
ordinary light microscope.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.110
And he really had to
crank things way up

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.390
to see the structures moving.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.470
And we want to measure them
down near where we usually

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:15.155
hear, 20 dB SPL, 40 dB SPL.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:22.930
So what's used is, on
to the basilar membrane,

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.385
you put some sort of source.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.010
And maybe in the
1980s and '90s, people

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.906
were using radioactive sources
and using the Mossbauer

00:24:33.906 --> 00:24:34.405
technique.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.320
They knew that the radioactive
particles being emitted

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.880
had a certain frequency, and
when the basilar membrane

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.960
was moving toward
you, the frequency

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.530
would be changed versus
moving away from you.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.440
Nowadays in the '90s
and 200s, people

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.580
are using spots
that they put down,

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.190
like little reflective
disks that are put down

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.030
onto the basilar membrane
that reflect light.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.850
And you shine down a light
onto the basilar membrane.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:09.350
And that spot reflects
the light back to you.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.300
You can compare the
light you sent down

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.770
with the light that's
reflected back.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.320
If the membrane is
moving away from you,

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.430
that light will be
shifted to a higher

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.880
wavelength versus if
it's coming toward you,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.690
it'll be a lower wavelength.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.195
And this process is
called interferometry.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:41.310
And if the source is moving like
the basilar membrane is moving

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.390
when you stimulate
it with sound,

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.210
you can use a laser
to shine the light,

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:52.570
and you can use the Doppler
interferometer-- which

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:59.270
is a device that measures the
shift in light when there's

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.570
a moving light source or
a moving light reflection.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:07.070
You can calibrate this in
terms of the displacement

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:12.850
or the velocity that the object
doing the reflecting is giving.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.330
It's shifting the
light, basically.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.417
So that's how most modern
experiment experiments measure

00:26:20.417 --> 00:26:22.500
of the movement of structures,
even though they're

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.510
very, very small movements,
like in terms of nanometers.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.000
So let's see what this-- these
are data from the 1980s using

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.665
a Mossbauer technique,
a radioactive source.

00:26:35.665 --> 00:26:38.480
So instead of
reflecting light, you're

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.460
measuring the emitted
wavelengths of particles

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.745
from a radioactive source at one
point on the basilar membrane.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.160
And you're stimulating
the basilar membrane

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.180
with sound of
different frequencies,

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.560
and you're measuring
how much it moves

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.310
in terms of the
basilar membrane.

00:26:56.222 --> 00:26:57.513
I think this says displacement.

00:26:59.266 --> 00:27:00.275
Is that what it says?

00:27:00.275 --> 00:27:02.030
It says amplitude in dB.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.060
This is a displacement
scale, how much movement

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.780
you're getting, as a
function of sound frequency

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.380
for one particular point
on the basilar membrane.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.600
So you change your
sound frequency.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.900
Start with low
frequencies at 20 dB.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.220
Pretty low level sound.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.655
You don't find
much displacement.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:30.410
Go up to 6 kilohertz, find
a little bit more movement.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.180
Go up to 10 kilohertz,
it's getting bigger.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.670
And then all of a sudden
at about 16 kilohertz,

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.810
you get a huge
amount of movement.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.960
You're right at the peak
of the traveling wave.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.780
Go up to 18 kilohertz and
it goes way back down again.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.040
And 20 kilohertz
there's no point

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.320
plotted because you can't
get the thing to move at all.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.780
It's a very
sharply-tuned function

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.600
of movement in terms of
the sound frequencies.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.720
This place is only
moving-- or mostly

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.160
moving-- for a sound
frequency of 16 kilohertz

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.890
in terms of where
the source was.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:15.970
Change the sound level to
40 or 60 or even 80 dB--

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.200
80 dB is a sound
that is certainly

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.510
within conversational speech.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.345
It's a high level sound, but
it's not painful or damaging

00:28:25.345 --> 00:28:26.080
at all.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.476
In that case, the
function is much broader.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.030
If you just looked at
that function, you'd say,

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.650
well, this point on the
basilar membrane years

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.565
is responding to many
sound frequencies.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.100
It's not responding
to 20 kilohertz,

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.380
but it's responding to
everything below that.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.850
And if you were to-- they
didn't here because they wanted

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.310
to take care of
their preparation

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.010
and not damage it-- if
they want up to the levels

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:57.825
that von Bekesy used, 140 dB,
it would be completely flat.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:03.050
And von Bekesy found that the
tuning of the basilar membrane

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.140
was very flat, or
just broadly tuned.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:13.360
But these modern measurements
show extremely sharp functions

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.340
for a single point of movement
on the basilar membrane.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:25.845
This is a plot of the same
data, but plotted a little bit

00:29:25.845 --> 00:29:26.345
differently.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.610
This axis is still
sound frequency.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.640
And now we're going to
plot it on the x-axis.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.410
It's still a dB scale,
but now on the y-axis

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.040
it's threshold dB SPL.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.390
So what's threshold?

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.290
Well in this case, it
doesn't really make sense.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:50.110
I think it would've been better
to label this some criterion

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.940
displacement, because the
criterion displacement

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:59.740
use for this lowest
curve is 0.35 nanometers.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.530
And what the experiment now,
or what the plotting now

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:10.640
is how much sound level do we
have to crank into the system

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.630
to get this point on
the basilar membrane

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:18.030
to vibrate 0.35 nanometers?

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.360
OK, in the case of 16
kilohertz right here,

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.000
at the lowest point, we
only had to put in 10 dB,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.490
not very much sound at all.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.660
At 14 kilohertz,
at 19 kilohertz,

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.970
we had to turn the
sound up a little bit.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.730
At 20 kilohertz, we turned
up the sound so much,

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.800
but we said could never get
it to vibrate 0.35 nanometers.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.370
So there's no point
plotted there.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:51.010
At 5 kilohertz, we had to crank
up the sound to about 60 dB

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:56.250
to get this point to
vibrate 0.35 nanometers.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.300
So you're asking for
the point to give you

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.690
some specified
amount of vibration

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.220
or a criterion of vibration.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.150
And you're plotting
this function here.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.950
And this is a very
important curve.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.400
We'll be seeing this many, many
times the rest of the semester.

00:31:16.352 --> 00:31:18.480
And it's called a tuning curve.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.620
So you should all
be familiar with how

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.870
this tuning curve is generated.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.585
You can make a tuning curve for
a recording from a hair cell.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.940
You could make a tuning
curve for recording

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.890
from a nerve fiber.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.330
Let's say we put on an
electrode in the auditory nerve.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.970
You guys have talked
about this term,

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.600
this technique called
single unit recording

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.750
where you put an
electrode in a nerve--

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:55.630
say, the optic nerve-- and
you measure the spikes coming

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.280
from the single axon that
you're recording from.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.920
And you might say,
well, I'm going

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:06.417
to turn the sound up until
I get 10 spikes per second.

00:32:06.417 --> 00:32:07.250
That's my criterion.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.590
And I'm going to
change the frequency.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:16.390
How much sound level do I
have to stimulate the ear with

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:21.140
to get the auditory nerve fiber
to fire 10 spikes per second?

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.860
Well, at 16 kilohertz I have to
hardly put any sound in at all.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.620
But 2 kilohertz, I have
to really blast the thing.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.960
So this auditory nerve
fiber is very tuned

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.190
to the sound frequency.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:39.330
It's sharply tuned, OK, to a
frequency near 16 kilohertz.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:44.000
You could make a tuning
curve from a receptor cell

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.640
by saying how much receptor
potential do I want?

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.310
Let's say one microvolt of
response or receptor potential

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.940
from the hair cell.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.110
What sort of sound
level do I need

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.800
to dial into the ear at
these different frequencies

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.315
to get that criterion
receptor potential?

00:33:02.315 --> 00:33:03.100
Is that clear?

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:08.242
So these tuning
curves are omnipresent

00:33:08.242 --> 00:33:09.575
throughout the auditory pathway.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.930
And they're a measure of
the sharpness of tuning.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:17.560
They're a measure of whether one
place on the basilar membrane

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:21.530
or one auditory nerve fiber
can listen to 16 kilohertz

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.240
and ignore 20 kilohertz.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.940
It's very important
if you're trying

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.160
to know in the
pattern of harmonics

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.050
that harmonic number
two is missing,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.930
you better listen to
number two with a very

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.015
sensitive and
sharply-tuned function.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.480
And you have that in
the auditory system

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.290
starting with the vibration
of the basilar membrane.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.580
What are these receptor
cells for hearing?

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.820
So the receptor cells for
hearing are called hair cells.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.239
That's kind of a
funny name, right?

00:33:58.239 --> 00:33:59.780
But they get their
name from the fact

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.520
that they have hairs coming
out the top of them-- at least,

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.520
it looked that way to the
early neuroanatomists.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:14.274
So these hairs are more
properly called stereocilia.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.775
And let me write that
down here, stereocilia.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:31.590
And even that more proper
term is kind of a misnomer,

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:42.920
because it has as
part of it "cilium."

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.969
That's really a misnomer.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:46.530
What is a cilium on a cell?

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:47.690
Does anybody know?

00:34:49.799 --> 00:34:50.715
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:55.484 --> 00:34:56.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:00.620
And they can propel single
cells through a medium, right?

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.860
And they're wavy and floppy,
and if you look at them

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.600
in cross-section of the
electron microscope,

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:15.885
they have these sort of 9
plus 2 tubular arrangements.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:20.850
The stereociliae do not
look like that at all.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:28.020
They should be called
stereomicrovilli,

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.470
because when you look
at them in cross section

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.270
you see all these
filaments but there's

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.010
no organization to them.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.390
And you can see the
filaments right here

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:44.190
in longitudinal section going
up into the stereocilia.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.880
And these keep the
stereocilia very stiff.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.070
So when sound comes and
moves a stereocilium,

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.780
it's sort of like a telephone
pole in a hurricane.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.185
It pivots around its base,
but it doesn't flop around.

00:36:03.686 --> 00:36:05.060
And the base of
these stereocilia

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:09.610
are right as they insert
part of the cell right.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.325
They're very stiff structures.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:18.710
Furthermore, they're all
attached one to another.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.980
So all the stereocilia
on a hair cell

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.240
tend to move together back and
forth in response to sound.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.830
And especially, they're
attached, of course,

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.150
at the base, but
they're also attached

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.380
at the very tips in
something called tip links.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.470
And I think I have a
picture or a diagram.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:46.820
So here are some tip links that
connects the very tallest part

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:52.225
of one stereocilium to its next
tallest neighbor stereocilium.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.420
So the whole bundle
of stereocilia

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.780
move together in a
rigid, pivoting way.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:07.000
And the whole bundle
is usually called just

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.860
in jargon terms,
the "hair bundle"

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.160
at the top of a hair cell.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.250
And I have some numbers for you.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:24.030
How many stereocilia are there
in the hair bundle of a given

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.650
cell?

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:38.030
So there are 40 stereocilia
for one inner hair cell.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.680
We haven't talked
about what these are,

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.510
but these are in your cochlea.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.580
They have inner hair cells
and outer hair cells.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:56.080
And there are about
140 stereocilia

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.600
in the hair bundle of a
given outer hair cell.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.015
OK, there are many
stereocilia per cell.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:09.050
In this cross section, you're
just seeing three rows,

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.060
but there are many per row.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.750
And here's a whole big
hair bundle all together.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.830
Now, why are these
exact numbers important?

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:21.430
Well, it isn't that
important, except we

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:27.950
think that the channel that
opens up when this hair

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.460
bundle moves in
response to sound

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.530
is located right at the
tips of the stereocilia.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.760
And most people
believe that there

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:42.630
is one channel at the tip
of each stereocilium which

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:49.280
would suggest that each outer
hair cell has 140 channels

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.520
and each inner hair
cell has 40 channels.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.990
Now, what are these channels?

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:58.260
Sometimes they're called
the transduction channels.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.200
What's transduction?

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:06.820
Anybody?

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.595
What's a transducer
in engineering terms?

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.180
Anybody?

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.026
What does it mean to
transduce something?

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.044
Well, you can have-- yeah?

00:39:20.044 --> 00:39:20.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.890
PROFESSOR: Exactly right.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:28.460
So you can have an accelerometer
which converts acceleration

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.260
to an electrical signal.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.710
In this case, the
physical energy of sound

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:35.960
is mechanical energy.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.850
It's movement, movement
of the tympanic membrane,

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.350
movement of the ossicles,
movement of the basilar

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.090
membrane up and down.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.030
These cells are sitting
on the basilar membrane.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.660
And the hair bundle is
moving back and forth.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.580
But the code of the
nervous system--

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.810
we've been talking
about spikes--

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.560
somehow you have to get
that mechanical energy

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.320
into the electrical energy
of, in the case of hair cells,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.260
the receptor potentials, and in
the case of the nerve fibers,

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.920
the action potentials
that are going

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.310
to send messages to the brain.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.230
So the transduction
channel is the channel

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.570
that responds to
mechanical energy

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:21.100
and allows ions to
flow into the hair

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.650
cell-- that is, it opens up.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.040
And in the case of these
transduction channels,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:34.140
it allows positive
ions, mostly potassium

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.240
because there is a high
concentration of potassium

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.810
in the fluid of scala media.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.460
Remember, these
cells are sitting in

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.130
between scala tympani
and scala media.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.565
So scala media is up here.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:48.520
The transduction channel opens.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.360
And it's relatively
non-selective,

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:55.840
but the big positive-- it's
non-selected for positive ions

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.750
or cations.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.040
The big concentration
here is potassium,

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.640
so potassium is probably the ion
that flows into the hair cells

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.360
when the transduction
channels open up.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.200
And the evidence for that here
is in part from Hudspeth's lab.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:18.430
He probed around the hair
cells while the hair bundle

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.000
was moved back and forth.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.370
And he found big
potentials up near the tips

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.650
of the stereocilia and
very small potentials

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.560
in the rest of the cell.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.710
So there's very good evidence
that the transduction channels

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.820
are at the tips
of the hair cells.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.040
We don't know what the
transduction channels are.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.930
People are actively
working on that.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.040
So there's a guy at
Harvard in the Department

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.750
of Neurobiology, Jeff Holt,
who thinks the transduction

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:55.690
channel, this so-called
transmembrane channel, TMC,

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.290
of which there are two
varieties, 1 and 2.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.680
It's not clear if
that's actually

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.840
the channel or something
associated with the channel.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.290
But when you knock it
out, the hair cells

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:09.550
don't respond anymore.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:10.415
The animal is deaf.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:16.460
OK, so these
transmembrane channels

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.610
may be the transduction channel,
but the jury is still out.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:30.910
OK, so let me go back to
our generic hair cell.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.890
We've talked about
the stereocilia

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:34.910
here and their movement.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:38.910
That's the input end
of the hair cell.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.725
The middle part of the
hair cell has a nucleus.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.410
It has a membrane.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.120
It has mitochondria.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.400
And down here, you
might think of this part

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.490
as the output end
of the hair cell.

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:55.370
This is where the hair cell
is giving its information

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.090
to the associated nerve fibers.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:03.580
And there are, interestingly,
two types of nerve fibers.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.720
The one you would
instantly think of

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:11.090
is the afferent nerve fiber,
the auditory nerve fiber,

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:16.060
where the hair cell is sending
messages to the nerve fiber.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.060
And how does one
cell send a message

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.050
to another in the
nervous system?

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.790
Well, there's a synapse, right?

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:32.345
So there's a hair cell
to nerve fiber synapse.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.600
And that's right here.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:47.300
And this hair cell then
releases transmitter,

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.865
because this is a
chemical synapse.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.720
And it uses a neurotransmitter.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.910
Right, everybody knows
what neurotransmitters are.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.316
The neurotransmitter here
is probably glutamate.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.075
And so that's an excitatory
neurotransmitter.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:25.865
OK, so the hair cell then
releases the glutamate.

00:44:25.865 --> 00:44:28.690
It goes through
the synaptic cleft.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.220
There's a glutamate
receptor that it binds to

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.390
on the auditory nerve fiber.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:36.025
The auditory nerve fiber
is depolarized or excited.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.010
It starts to fire
action potentials.

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.718
And then these action
potentials are then

00:44:40.718 --> 00:44:43.254
sent down the auditory
nerve and into the brain.

00:44:43.254 --> 00:44:44.795
The brain says, aha,
there's a sound.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.400
Now interestingly,
there's another kind

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.490
of nerve fiber associated
with many hair cells,

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:57.260
and it's called an
efferent nerve fiber.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:02.000
So what's the difference between
an afferent and an efferent?

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.380
anybody?

00:45:05.929 --> 00:45:07.470
AUDIENCE: Directionality
of the cell?

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:08.540
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.080
So, which one goes which way.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.430
We've said this one is going--
the afferent is going that way.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.280
The efferent nerve ending
is going the opposite way.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:22.480
And so most of this
naming nomenclature

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.810
comes from the reference
being the brain.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:29.880
The brain is where
the action is, right?

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.960
The cochlea's way out here.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.880
So anything that's
going out from the brain

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.540
is efflux or
efferent, so signals

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.150
that are going from the brain
out to peripheral structures--

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:46.670
like the hair cells-- travel by
way of efferent nerve fibers,

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.170
right?

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.190
Another efferent
type of nerve fiber

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:52.840
would be a motor neuron, a
motor neuron sending messages

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.340
from the brain out
to the periphery

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.960
to contract the muscles.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.450
That'd be another type
of efferent nerve fiber.

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:03.970
So interestingly, the hair
cells have efferent nerve fibers

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.670
attached to them, and they form
synapses on the hair cells.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:11.580
And you do not see this
in the visual system.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.020
You do not see efferent
innervation of the receptor

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:20.480
cells or of the retina at
all in vision, at least

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.220
in mammalian systems.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.830
You do see it in
lower vertebrates.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.259
But in mammalian systems,
the auditory hair cells

00:46:30.259 --> 00:46:31.425
get an efferent innervation.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:35.200
There are hair cells as
another part of the inner ear.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.650
We talked about the
vestibular system

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.015
and the semicircular canals.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:45.740
That is a hair cell organ,
and those get efferent nerve

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.950
endings from the brain.

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:54.240
And in the sides of the
body in amphibians and fish,

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.070
there's a lateral line
system of hair cells

00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:01.285
that allows the fish to detect
currents of motion of water.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.460
And those are hair
cell-based receptor organs,

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.570
and they get an efferent as
well as an afferent innervation.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:13.570
So it seems like wherever there
are hair cell-based systems,

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:16.510
the brain sends messages
out to the hair cells

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:18.820
as well as getting information
from the hair cells.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.510
So we'll have a
lecture later on what

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.300
these efferent nerves are doing.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.900
I mean, why would the
brain want to control

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.020
the auditory periphery?

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.110
It's an interesting
question, and maybe there

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:32.920
are several answers to that.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.850
Certainly, the
brain wants to know

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:36.900
what's happening
to the hair cells.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:42.120
So these afferent nerve
fibers are sending messages

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.710
when the hair cell
is stimulated.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:45.820
So that's the main pathway
going into the brain.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:48:00.295
OK, we've talked about
the transduction channels.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:05.110
We haven't talked about these
little things called tip links.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:09.980
One idea is that these
links between the tips

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:15.410
of the stereocilia are sort
of like a rope on a trap door.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:18.590
And when the stereocilium moves,
it opens up the trap door,

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.150
and that's what opens
the ion channel.

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:22.750
These little tip
links are something

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.560
you see in the
electron microscope.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.580
They're very, very fine.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.340
When you use some chemical
treatment to dissolve those tip

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.790
links, the hair cells
don't work anymore.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:35.550
They don't respond
to sound anymore.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.290
So there are some
other proteins up

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:41.011
there associated with the
transduction channels called

00:48:41.011 --> 00:48:41.510
tip links.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.772
That's a very active
area of research now--

00:48:46.772 --> 00:48:48.230
what are the
transduction channels?

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:49.900
How do the tip links work?

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.150
How are they mechanosensitive?

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:55.730
OK, now let's talk.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.450
We've been alluding to the two
types of hair cells, right?

00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:59.785
Outer and inner hair cells.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:07.160
And all mammals
have these two types

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.910
of hair cells, outer
and inner hair cells.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.060
Birds have hair cells that
are also of several classes.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.380
They have what are called
tall and short hair cells.

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.640
They're a little bit different
than outer and inner hair

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.140
cells.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:26.350
Reptiles generally have
one type of hair cell.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:31.480
So the inner and outer hair cell
distinction is true for mammals

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:31.980
mainly.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.460
So how do they get their names?

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:38.070
Well, if you look down on the
top of the organ of Corti--

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.110
so this is my wire model.

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.540
So this is like the cochlea
we've been looking at.

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.640
Now, turn it so you're looking
down from the apex down.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.730
On top of this
membrane, what you

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:52.200
would see if you looked
at one little tiny piece

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.020
is a row of inner hair cells
going from the extreme base

00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:00.810
to the apex, which would
be this row right here.

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:04.030
And three rows of outer hair
cells, going from the base

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:07.520
to the apex, and it turns
out that the inner hair

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.020
cells get their
name because they're

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.900
on the inner side of the spiral.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:16.970
And the outers are on the
outer part of the spiral.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:19.360
So the inners are
toward the center,

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.080
or toward the axis
of the cochlea.

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.000
The outers are away from it.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:29.870
And this view,
looking down on them,

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.620
would be looking down
onto their stereocilia.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.985
And these white structures are
the hair bundles-- the tips,

00:50:35.985 --> 00:50:37.430
if you will-- of
the stereocilia.

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:44.010
And there's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:47.060
and a half inner
hair cells here.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.600
And in the first row
of outer hair cells,

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.636
there's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:50:53.636 --> 00:50:55.090
ten, eleven, twelve.

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.530
There's a dozen
outer hair cells.

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:59.750
And their stereocilia
are lined up differently.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:03.570
They're sort of like inverted
V's on the outer hair cells.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.500
And there's the first
row, the second row,

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.470
and the outermost row, the
third row of outer hair cells.

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:12.870
And this is a
stereotyped pattern.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.080
Almost all mammals have this.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.540
In the human, if you go up
into the apex of the cochlea,

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.980
sometimes a fourth row of outer
hair cells starts to form,

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.000
but it's not very
well organized.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.180
It's sort of patchy.

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.002
But you can have a fourth
row of outer hair cells.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:37.820
If one of these were missing,
the supporting cells nearby

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.155
form a little scar in its place.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.080
And we'll talk about things that
kill hair cells in a few weeks.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.485
Loud sounds can kill
your hair cells.

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:53.179
Infectious agents--
meningitis, for example--

00:51:53.179 --> 00:51:54.220
can kill your hair cells.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:58.340
Certain drugs, aminoglycoside
antibiotics like kanamycin

00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.450
can kill your hair cells.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:04.850
And the supporting cells
thereby just fill in.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.850
And you can go and look at a
cochlea that has some hair cell

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:09.350
damage.

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:11.540
You can count, you
can see how regular

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.020
the array is of hair cells.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.939
And you can count how
many are present there

00:52:15.939 --> 00:52:16.980
and how many are damaged.

00:52:18.139 --> 00:52:19.680
And you can, you
know, say if there's

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.450
a 50% loss of outer
hair cells in row one,

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.460
this regularity is so beautiful.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:30.220
Unfortunately, once
they're killed in a mammal,

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.650
they never come back.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:35.820
You cannot regrow your hair
cells once they've been killed.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.560
In birds, they grow right back.

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.000
Takes about three or four weeks.

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:46.134
So you can kill all the
hair cells in a bird cochlea

00:52:46.134 --> 00:52:47.800
and come back three
or four weeks later,

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.924
and they're all grown back.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:52.780
In mammals, they
don't grow back.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.591
And so there's a
lot of interest--

00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:57.090
Because you have these agents
that kill hair cells-- there's

00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:00.600
a lot of interest in, how
can we make our hair cells

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.255
grow back after
they've been killed?

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:06.430
And people are thinking
of stem cell approached

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:11.190
or neurotropic drugs
that might be good.

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.070
So why don't they grow back?

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:15.220
We don't know that at all.

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.950
We do know that,
for example, I'm

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:21.110
in a department called
ENT-- Ear, Nose, and Throat.

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.840
Lots of the surgeons
in our department deal

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.700
with cancers of the
head and neck, right?

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.730
Because there are cancers
that can come up, and surgeons

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.950
can take care of that
by taking cancers out.

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:37.050
There are no known cancers
that grow in the inner ear.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.390
It never, ever happens.

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:44.570
So maybe these cells are
so far differentiated

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:47.420
and they've become this
classic inner and outer hair

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.110
distinction, they're so evolved
that they can't grow back.

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:52.120
They can't multiply.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.390
They can't form a cancer.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:57.750
But unfortunately, once
there destroyed by some agent

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:01.140
like a drug, they
can't grow back.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.950
So a way to put new
cells in there that

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:09.040
could become new
hair cells, or a way

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.100
to encourage these
supporting cells on the sides

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.720
to grow and become hair cells,
is a very interesting idea,

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.790
but one that's just in
the research phase now.

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:24.250
OK, so that's the difference
between inner and outer hair

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:25.000
cells.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.175
If you cut them in
the other dimension

00:54:27.175 --> 00:54:29.940
and look at them in
the longitudinal plane,

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.960
inner and outer hair cells
look completely different.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.280
An inner hair cell
is a big fat cell.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.300
It comes up to a
neck and bulges out

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.675
a little bit where the hair
bundle is, way up at the top.

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:46.420
At the bottom of
the inner hair cell,

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:49.700
there's lots of
afferent nerve endings.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.510
Maybe as many as
20 per hair cell.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.570
There's a few efferent
nerve endings,

00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:59.835
but they're usually not
on the hair cell itself.

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:03.412
They're on these
afferent terminals.

00:55:03.412 --> 00:55:05.620
The efferents come and get
on the afferent terminals.

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:10.300
The outer hair
cells, by contrast,

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.690
are completely different.

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:14.845
They're long, test
tube-like shaped cells.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.370
Down at the bottom, they
also have nerve terminals.

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.460
Most of the nerve
terminals in this case

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.990
are efferent nerve terminals.

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:26.850
How do we know that
they're efferent afferent?

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:40.630
Well, if you look at them
in the electron microscope--

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:43.560
I'll just draw a quick diagram.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.140
Here's the hair cell.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.290
Here's a nerve
terminal coming up.

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:59.310
And here is a whole bunch
of synaptic vesicles

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:05.670
in the hair cell ready to
be released when the hair

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.880
cell is stimulated with sound.

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.820
Obviously, the transmission
is going that way.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.660
Here's a nerve terminal.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.710
Here's a whole bunch
of synaptic vesicles.

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.670
None over here, they're
all on the nerve terminal.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:36.440
When the message comes
down from the brain,

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.950
a whole bunch of
these vesicles are

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:40.940
released onto the hair cell.

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:44.910
OK, so by just looking at the
nerve terminals in the electron

00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:49.360
microscope, you can get
an idea of which direction

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.500
the transmission is going.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.390
And so label them as either
afferent or efferent.

00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:56.590
On the outer hair cells, there
are many, many efferent nerve

00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:57.600
terminals on them.

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:05.790
In fact, in the
1970s, it became clear

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:09.950
that almost all afferent
nerve fibers, the ones that

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:12.330
were sending messages
to the brain,

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:16.200
were associated with the inner
hair cells, and only about 5%

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.610
of them were associated
with the outer hair cells.

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:22.750
This is was a big
mystery for a while,

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:24.560
and people didn't
believe it at first.

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.250
It said, well, all
the information going

00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:28.120
into the brain, or
95% percent of it,

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.980
is coming from the
inner hair cell.

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.660
Huh, that's kind of funny.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.180
There's actually more outer hair
cells than inner hair cells.

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:36.100
So what's going on?

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.870
Somebody screwed up
the counts, right?

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:40.172
So it was done over
and over again,

00:57:40.172 --> 00:57:41.630
and the counts came
back correctly.

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.130
So how do we interpret that now?

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:50.230
Well, about the same time in the
early 1980s, a very interesting

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:52.455
property of outer hair
cells was noticed.

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:58.990
It was noticed that outer hair
cells are actually motile.

00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.725
They can move.

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:08.040
And this was first discovered
by Joe Santos Saatchi and others

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.240
in the early 1980s.

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:20.660
And this discovery was made
when they put a hair cell

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:24.320
in a fluid of high potassium,
lots of potassium here.

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.830
There are some
potassium channels

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:29.060
in the sides of the cell.

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:29.950
Potassium went in.

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:34.430
When you have positive
ions coming into a cell,

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:35.810
the cell depolarizes.

00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:38.850
It might have started out
at minus 80 millivolts.

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:42.740
In the high potassium solution,
it may have gone to minus 50

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.285
millivolts or maybe
even 0 millivolts.

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.050
Bill Brownell and Joe Santos,
when they saw this happen,

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:53.075
they saw the cell shrink.

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:57.910
It was, let's say, five
micrometers in length before.

00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:00.475
They put it in the potassium
solution, it became four.

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:04.420
Take it out of the high
potassium solution,

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.870
put it in a regular solution,
it lengthened again.

00:59:08.322 --> 00:59:12.940
OK, here is a graph
of those data.

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.920
In this case it's a more elegant
experiment where they actually

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.460
measured the potential
inside the cell

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.260
by putting an electrode into it.

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:34.510
So you can run this
out to your amplifier

00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:37.370
and measure the
electrical potential

00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:40.350
in terms of the millivolts
of the inside of the cell.

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:46.260
And by putting current down
or coming out of the cell,

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:50.390
you can move the inside of this
potential whatever you want,

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:51.470
whichever way you want.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:57.920
And in this case, this
x-axis in millivolts

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.510
is the potential
inside the hair cell.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.020
The ordinary potential is
about minus 80 millivolts,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.870
about right here.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:13.900
Minus 180 is a huge
hyperpolarization of the cell.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:17.440
And plus 0 up to
plus 40 millivolts

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.041
is a depolarization of a cell.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:21.040
Does everybody understand
what we're doing here?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.160
We're changing the
intracellular potential

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.905
of the cell in terms
of its millivolts.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.470
And then we're looking
at the change in length.

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:33.850
As you depolarize
the cell, the cell

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:37.020
goes from 0 to negative values.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.620
That's a shortening in
terms of micrometers

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.580
of the length of
the outer hair cell.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.870
This is the basal end
where the hair cells are,

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.560
this is the apical end where
the stereocilia would be.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.310
OK, so these hair cells
can actually move.

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:54.410
You can do this experiment
with a muscle fiber

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:55.565
and get the same result.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.190
It's a very different
process, but when

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:04.806
you depolarize a muscle cell,
it contracts by actin and myosin

01:01:04.806 --> 01:01:05.305
means.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.050
This was very surprising though
to see this in a sensory cell.

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:13.610
Sensory cells aren't
supposed to contract, right?

01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:15.030
They figured out that they are.

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.860
They can contract.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:23.310
Now, that means this
outer hair cell--

01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:25.050
and I should say
outer hair cell,

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:27.350
these are outer hair
cells because when

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:30.990
you do the same experiment
with an inner hair cell

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:34.100
or any other cell in the body,
you don't get a contraction.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.260
So it's peculiar to
outer hair cells.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.360
Make sure you know that.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.470
Outer hair cells are the
ones that are motile.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.010
This process became
known as electromotility.

01:01:54.830 --> 01:02:02.710
OK, so when the inside
voltage is changed,

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:05.070
the length of the outer
hair cells has changed.

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.270
So let me give you a
demonstration of this.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:11.720
I have a nice demonstration
from Joe Santos Saatchi, who

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.900
is now at Yale
School of Medicine.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.210
And he made this demonstration.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.290
And it's kind of a
clever demonstration

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:21.880
because you can
see the hair cell,

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:27.080
and it will be moving because
Joe has patched onto the hair

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.530
cell with his electrode.

01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:32.990
And the electrode is-- usually,
in these kinds of experiments--

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:36.240
is put on a micromanipulator
and it's bolted to the table.

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:40.960
And because that patch
pipette has impaled the cell,

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.070
that part of the
cell is just pegged

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:45.400
so it's not going
to move at all.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.940
That's the very
bottom of the cell.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:49.540
And you'll see a little bit
of a ghost-like image of that.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:53.610
The rest of the cell is the long
part of the hair cell, and then

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.510
the stereocilia, or hair
bundle, right up at the top.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:00.200
And that part is free to move.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.640
Now, what Joe has done is he's
depolarized and hyperpolarized

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.885
the cell using his amplifier.

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:13.620
But he has made that signal
sync'd to a musical signal, OK?

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.800
So you'll hear music
on the soundtrack

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.660
and you'll see the
hair cell moving.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.890
The music is not directly
stimulating the hair cell

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:24.320
by moving its stereocilia
as normally it would be,

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.870
as when we listen to it.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:31.480
Instead, that music is just in
sync with the electrical signal

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.830
manipulating the inside
of the hair cell.

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:34.910
So I'll play that now.

01:03:38.403 --> 01:03:39.401
Once again.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.625
OK, so here's the hair cell.

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:49.803
This is the shadow of the
electrode holding this stiff.

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:53.070
This is the main
part of the cell.

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.974
These are the stereocilia
right up there.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:25.530
OK.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.330
So apparently Joe, lectures
to medical students,

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:35.110
says there's a reflex that goes
directly from your hair cells

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:36.830
to your dancing feet.

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.960
And apparently, the medical
students believe him.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:44.500
Anyway, that is
clearly a demonstration

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:51.020
that this electromotility is
much faster than, for example,

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.690
the contraction of muscle cells.

01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:55.190
Muscle cell contraction, put
it in a dish, or even hair cell

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:58.990
in a dish-- it can be very slow.

01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:02.680
This electromotility is
happening at audio frequencies,

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.700
right?

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.500
Some of those sounds were
thousands of times per second.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:12.340
So in the early debate
of electromotility,

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.920
there were some questions
of how fast this is

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.620
and whether it really
manipulates movement

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.340
of the hair cells
at audio frequency.

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.710
And I think that
kind of demonstration

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:25.000
clearly shows that it does.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.810
So what good is this?

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.330
How does this help us
in the sense of hearing?

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.940
And what good would it be to
have a motile sensory cell?

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:41.110
Well, the idea is that these
hair cells-- here again

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:43.880
are the inner hair cells and the
three rows of outer hair cells.

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.180
Sound comes into the ear.

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.570
It moves these membranes.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:50.790
It moves the hair bundles.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.640
Motion of the hair bundles opens
up these transducer channels

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.620
which allow ions to come in
and depolarize the outer hair

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.450
cells, let's say.

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:04.845
When the outer hair cells are
depolarized, they shorten.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:09.330
OK, when the sound
phase reverses,

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:12.820
the hair bundle moves the
other way, the channels close.

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.486
The hair cells go back
to their normal length.

01:06:15.486 --> 01:06:17.610
And this goes back and
forth, and in the outer hair

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:19.151
cells are getting
longer and shorter.

01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:24.940
Somehow, that motion,
that mechanical energy,

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.930
adds to the vibration
that was initiated

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:32.135
by the sound in a sort of
an amplification mechanism.

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:35.870
So you then have more vibration.

01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:38.820
You then have more bending
of the stereocilia.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.430
You have more depolarizing
of the hair cells.

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:44.140
You have even more
electromotility and sort

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.250
of a positive
feedback loop here.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.830
The outer hair cells
then are sometimes

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:52.180
called the cochlear amplifier.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:57.710
They amplify the vibration
patterns set up by sound

01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:59.100
in the cochlea.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.880
So the outer hair
cells are sometimes

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.332
nicknamed the
cochlear amplifier.

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.250
So what good is a
cochlear amplifier?

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.700
Well, you have this ordinary
receptor cell over here.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.840
It doesn't change
its length at all,

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.560
but it has all the auditory
nerve fibers linked to it.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:28.190
Now instead of its stereocilia
moving just a little bit,

01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:31.325
it has an amplifier sitting
right next to it and amplifies

01:07:31.325 --> 01:07:32.850
to all these membranes.

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:34.470
And the inner hair
cell stereocilia

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:36.380
are really now waving
and back and forth.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.980
They then send their messages
to the auditory nerve fibers,

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.620
which send their axons and
messages into the brain.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:48.400
Your brain says, I hear sound.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.530
Even when it's a
very soft sound,

01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:54.650
like a pin dropping-- which,
without the cochlear amplifier,

01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:57.290
would be inaudible--
that pin dropping,

01:07:57.290 --> 01:07:59.893
that very small mechanical
motion is amplified.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.270
And the inner hair
cells then say,

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:04.670
oh, yes I do hear the sound.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:10.120
So the function then
of these receptor cells

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.420
is very different
than what you have

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.510
in vision, where you had
rods and cones, right?

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:18.725
Rods and cones mediate
different types of vision.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:24.279
In the cochlea, the hair
cells work together.

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:26.540
The outer hair cells ore
the cochlear amplifier

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:30.800
making this thing amplified
more, and more sensitive.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.189
The inner hair cells then
are the major receptor cells

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:38.050
that are sending their
messages to the brain, OK?

01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:44.270
So it's really a different
kind of two receptor sense,

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:46.040
if you will, compared to vision.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:57.290
And that's what this
diagram is supposed to be.

01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.069
This is very fanciful diagram.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:03.660
And there's a lot of hand
waving here associated

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.949
with how the cochlear
amplifier really works.

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:13.359
This is an unraveled cochlea
from the base to the apex,

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:15.290
and this is how
much displacement

01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.370
you have-- von Bekesy's
traveling wave envelope,

01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:19.609
if you will.

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:22.990
This dashed line is what would
happen if you just put sound in

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:24.219
and there was no amplifier.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:30.840
And this enhanced solid line
is when you have the outer hair

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.865
cells working their
cochlear amplifier magic.

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.560
And apparently,
the active region

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.830
where the outer hair
cells are most active

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:44.930
is just basal to the peak
of this traveling wave.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.290
And how do we know that?

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:49.229
How do we know that the
outer hair cell cochlear

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:51.750
amplifier is very important?

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:55.140
Well, there are
actually situations

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:59.070
when you can lose
your outer hair cells

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:04.380
and you have pretty intact
inner hair cell population.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:13.720
So in an animal treated with
the aminoglycocide kanamycin,

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.370
it turns out that
the outer hair cells

01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:18.640
are a little bit more
sensitive to the kanamycin

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.990
then the inner hair cells are.

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:23.460
So if you treat with
just the right dose,

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.890
you can find a
place of the cochlea

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.446
where there are intact
inner hair cells

01:10:28.446 --> 01:10:30.695
and where the outer hair
cells have all been lesioned.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.920
Basal to that, for example,
all the hair cells are gone.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.869
And apical to that, none
of the hair cells are gone.

01:10:38.869 --> 01:10:40.410
So in a certain
region of the cochlea

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:42.240
with just the right
dose of kanamycin.

01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:47.040
And in those areas, where you
just have inner hair cells

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.960
without the outer hair cells,
you have a huge hearing loss.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.915
You're not deaf.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.570
The inner hair cells
are still there

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:57.560
and they're sending their
messages to the brain

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.310
by their auditory nerve fibers.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:01.620
But there's a big
hearing loss because you

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:04.105
have lost the function of
the cohclear amplifier.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:11.120
And those experiments were
done in the 1970s and '80s.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.220
And they were
criticized by saying,

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.410
well, anytime you do
some lesion treatment,

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:19.970
you say you have normal
inner hair cells and outers.

01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:23.090
Well, you don't really know the
inner hair cells are normal.

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:24.620
Maybe the drug affected them.

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:26.670
They're still there,
but they're screwed up.

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:34.770
So recently, a much
more elegant way

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.450
of doing that same sort
of experiment has come up.

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:41.680
And this is the paper,
the research paper,

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.455
that is assigned reading
for today's lecture.

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:52.330
It turns out you can knock
out the cochlear amplifier

01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:56.740
by knocking out a particular
protein in the outer hair cells

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.030
and have the outer
hair cells still there.

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:06.050
And this work started
out with the discovery

01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:12.875
of a protein that's in the
membrane of the outer hair

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:13.375
cells.

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.860
So if you look at
the outer hair cells,

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:19.665
there's a lot of
protein in the membrane.

01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:36.340
And the protein is found pretty
much nowhere else in the body

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.695
and was given the name prestin.

01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:45.170
Now, you amateur musicians out
there, when you play a piece--

01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:46.830
right?-- at the
beginning of the piece,

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:50.240
at least for classical
music, the composer gives you

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.130
an Italian word that says how
fast you should play it, right?

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:57.730
And if it says largo, you're
supposed to play it really

01:12:57.730 --> 01:13:01.190
slowly, Right or
adagio, slow, right?

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:03.985
What's the marking or
Italian word for "fast"?

01:13:03.985 --> 01:13:04.980
AUDIENCE: Presto.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.320
PROFESSOR: Presto, right.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:11.770
And this protein
was named prestin

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:14.690
because, at least at the
time it was discovered,

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:16.350
they had the idea that, oh, OK.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.360
Maybe it's the cochlear
amplifier protein

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.360
and it makes these outer hair
cells shorten and contract

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.304
really quickly, very fast.

01:13:24.304 --> 01:13:25.345
So we'll call it prestin.

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:30.290
It turned out that
that was true,

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:33.710
and here's some of the
evidence in support of that.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:37.490
You can knock out
the gene for prestin.

01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:44.260
So a knock-out is an animal
in which a particular gene

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:49.040
is either removed or made so
it doesn't make the protein.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.040
Part of it's deleted, and
so the protein is not made.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.150
You can make a
knock-out mouse where

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:57.120
the prestin is knocked out.

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.374
And that's what was
done in this paper.

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:11.710
OK, and in that knock-out
mouse, you can look--

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:14.700
and they looked at a
whole bunch of things.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.720
That looked at the
electromotility the outer hair

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.220
cells.

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.395
So they took outer hair
cells and put them in a dish

01:14:21.395 --> 01:14:24.350
and looked at the kind of
movements we saw in that video.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.270
And in this trace,
this is minus minus,

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.940
which is the geneticist
lingo for a knock-out.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.035
Both genes for prestin are gone.

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:41.160
This trace is the plus plus,
the wild type, or normal.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.980
And there's big changes
in outer hair cells

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.455
when you depolarize
and hyperpolarize them.

01:14:48.455 --> 01:14:52.350
And these big changes are on
the order of half a micrometer.

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:53.650
So this is a length axis.

01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:57.960
In the knock-out,
the outer hair cells

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.739
don't change length
at all when they're

01:14:59.739 --> 01:15:01.030
depolarized and hyperpolarized.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:06.710
In the heterozygote,
which is the case when

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:08.815
you have one gene
intact for prestin

01:15:08.815 --> 01:15:10.370
and the other gene
is knocked out,

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:11.536
it's an intermediate result.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.150
OK, so the outer
hair cell motility

01:15:17.150 --> 01:15:20.740
is knocked out by knocking
out this one protein.

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.610
So that's pretty good
evidence that it's

01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:24.130
involved in the
cochlear amplifier.

01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:27.600
What else was measured?

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:33.630
Well, they wanted to
measure hearing sensitivity.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.960
And so in humans,
what you might do

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.894
for that is put a subject in
a soundproof chamber and say,

01:15:39.894 --> 01:15:41.560
raise your hand when
you hear the sound.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.000
But you could do that in
mice, but it takes a long time

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.690
to train mice or other
experimental animals

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:50.180
to do those behavioral tests.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:52.820
So they did an electro
physiological test.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.440
They measured what's called
the auditory brain stem

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.670
response, so the ABR.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:15.998
This stands for auditory
brain stem response.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:20.890
OK.

01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:29.330
And that top right graph gives
you the ABR threshold in dB.

01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:31.510
So something that has
a really low threshold

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:33.315
is a really good hearing animal.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.510
This is the wild type
and the heterozygote.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.560
And something that has
a very high threshold

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.580
means you really had
to crank up the sound

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.580
to get any kind
of response at all

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.000
as you see in the open
symbols for the knock-out.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.870
So how do they measure that ABR?

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:55.030
You could do it in animals
or humans as a clinical test.

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:57.210
Put electrodes on the
surface of the skin.

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:02.930
You turn on a click
or a tone burst.

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:04.439
In this case, they
used tone bursts

01:17:04.439 --> 01:17:05.480
of different frequencies.

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:11.130
And you can imagine that the
auditory brain stem is way down

01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:13.640
in the head, and you're
measuring on the surface.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.490
So you've got a
click, click, click.

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:18.040
And you measure
thousands of responses.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.850
So there's a lot of noise.

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:21.010
There's noise in the room.

01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:23.730
There's noise from other
neurons in the brain.

01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:26.560
But eventually, after
thousands of averages,

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.950
that little tiny signal
comes out of the noise,

01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:33.350
and you get a response if the
brain stem is responding--

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:35.320
that is, if the hair
cells are responding,

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.380
the nerve fibers send
messages into the brain stem,

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.220
and the brain stem
finally responds.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.340
It's a very good test
of auditory sensitivity.

01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:44.950
And what does it show?

01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:47.960
It shows that without prestin
in the knock-out animal,

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.530
you have a huge hearing loss.

01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:51.840
How big is the hearing loss?

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.850
Well, looks like it's
about 40 to 60 dB.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.440
So when you have
prestin knocked out,

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:09.870
you have a hearing
loss of 40 to 60 dB.

01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:17.130
How much amplification does the
cochlear amplifier give you?

01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:18.705
40 to 60 dB.

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.980
You're not completely
deaf without it,

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.725
but you have a
severe hearing loss.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.290
Most of you would not
be able to understand

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:30.710
what I'm saying with
a 60 dB hearing loss,

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:33.750
unless you were sitting
right up here in the front.

01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:40.960
What else do I want to
say about this paper?

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.480
Not too much.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.900
There are some problems with it.

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.050
Any paper has problems.

01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:47.660
They found that,
for some reason,

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:52.440
all the hair cells were lost
for the high frequency basal

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.275
part of the cochlea.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.790
It's just a problem in
some strains of mice

01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:01.830
that they lose hair cells in
a certain part of the cochlea.

01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:05.360
So within these gray bars,
you can't conclude anything.

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.720
Now, they looked
at the hair cells.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.640
They just took them
out and looked at them

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.170
in the microscope.

01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:15.000
And they said, wow,
in the knock-out,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.730
the hair cells are
actually smaller.

01:19:17.730 --> 01:19:22.850
Well, you cut out all this
protein from the membrane

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:24.847
in the knock-out, right?

01:19:24.847 --> 01:19:27.055
So if there's a lot less
membrane there, they shrink.

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:32.350
The outer hair cell membrane
is packed with prestin.

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:35.630
So you could argue, oh, all
the hair cells are shorter,

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:37.780
and so they're not
working the same way.

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.250
Every paper has its problems.

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:41.700
but that's what
these graphs mean.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.390
The hair cells at
rest are actually

01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:45.400
shorter in the knock-out.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.360
So just some caveats.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.190
I think the main
message is prestin

01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:53.655
is essential for the
cochlear amplifier.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.630
And without it, you have a
big hearing loss, 40 to 60 dB.

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:03.610
Now, one of the other
things they measured in here

01:20:03.610 --> 01:20:06.570
is something called
the distortion product

01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:07.450
otoacoustic emission.

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:13.040
And let me just, as the last
thing in today's lecture,

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.990
tell you about what an
otoacoustic emission is.

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:19.630
These were discovered about the
same time as outer hair cell

01:20:19.630 --> 01:20:23.310
electromotility by
David Kemp, who's

01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:24.600
at University College London.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:29.930
And he was doing some kind
of hearing tests in people,

01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:34.410
and he developed a very,
very sensitive microphone

01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:37.095
that had a very low
electrical noise.

01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:40.355
He stuck that microphone
in an ear canal.

01:20:41.710 --> 01:20:43.060
And what did he find?

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:47.070
The microphone actually picked
up sound in the ear canal.

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.544
Oh my gosh, this is crazy.

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:51.835
There's not supposed to be
sound coming out of the ear,

01:20:51.835 --> 01:20:54.870
you're supposed to be putting
sound into the ear, right?

01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:59.630
So he named it
otoacoustic emission.

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:01.680
OK, "oto" means ear.

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:07.880
"Acoustic" means sound, and
"emissions" means coming out,

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.410
sound coming out of the ear.

01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:12.990
This was an amazing
discovery, and it

01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:16.440
fits very nicely with
the idea that there's

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.850
something in the ear
that's actually moving,

01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:21.330
that being the outer hair cells.

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:26.510
The outer hair cells are
moving either spontaneously--

01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:29.250
and there are some otoacoustic
emissions that are spontaneous.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.640
About half of us have
spontaneous otoacoustic

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.260
emissions in our ears.

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:38.730
Now, before you get too excited
and go home and listen to them,

01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:41.340
they are very, very
low levels of sound.

01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:45.590
Most of them are below
the audio metric hearing

01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:46.990
curve for human hearing.

01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:49.460
So you really, in
most cases, are not

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:52.010
aware of your
otoacoustic emissions.

01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:56.220
This is very different from
the sensation that some of us

01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:01.050
have of ringing in
the ears, tinnitus.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.340
Does anybody have tinnitus?

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.380
I have tinnitus,
especially my left ear.

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:19.960
If I close my left ear, often
I can hear kind of a noise.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.510
Put my head on the
pillow at night,

01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:23.390
I can hear a little
noise in there.

01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:26.830
So that's a sensation
that I have even

01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:28.590
though there's no
sound going in my ear,

01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:30.400
and it's not an
otoacoustic emission.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.025
You could put a
microphone in that ear,

01:22:32.025 --> 01:22:33.800
and there is no sound there.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:38.035
Something in my brain is telling
me that I am hearing a sound.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:42.000
Some people are very
disturbed by tinnitus.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.250
There's no good
treatment for it.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.150
Historically, the
famous treatment

01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:50.030
was by an ear surgeon who said,
OK, I'll cure your tinnitus.

01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:54.260
And he took out the person's
ear, the cochlea was taken out.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.700
Tinnitus didn't change one bit.

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:59.190
Maybe it's like phantom
limb pain, something

01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:00.930
to do with your
central nervous system.

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:04.110
Tinnitus and
otoacoustic emissions

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:05.240
are completely different.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.250
Otoacoustic emissions are
associated with normal hearing,

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.650
normal outer hair cell function.

01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:14.360
They're sometimes used
as a clinical test

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:17.900
for hearing in patients
who can't raise their arm.

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.770
For example, most states,
like Massachusetts,

01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:25.330
you have to, by law, test
newborns for good hearing.

01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:28.240
An otoacoustic
emission test is one.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.760
So how does that work if only
50% of the people have them?

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.770
Well, there are other types
of otoacoustic emissions

01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:38.990
that are evoked-- that
is, you put sound in,

01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:42.490
and you listen for the
sound coming back out.

01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:44.460
Some of these are
transiently evoked.

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:48.320
You put a click in, and a
few milliseconds later you

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.890
get a sound coming back out.

01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:54.060
And that's the
usual clinical test.

01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:57.000
And 100% of normal
hearing humans

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.930
have these so-called
otoacoustic emissions.

01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:03.230
Now, what would be
an indication if you

01:24:03.230 --> 01:24:06.480
had a patient with no
otoacoustic emissions?

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:11.380
Well, it is a good test
of whether your middle ear

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.025
and inner ear is working
as far along the pathway

01:24:15.025 --> 01:24:16.190
as the outer hair cells.

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.790
Beyond that, it doesn't test.

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:24.865
It just tests up to
the electromotile part

01:24:24.865 --> 01:24:25.740
of the hearing organ.

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.490
So it doesn't test
the inner hair cells.

01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:29.239
It doesn't test the
auditory nerve fibers.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:34.830
But much of hearing problem
arises in the outer hair cells,

01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:36.510
so it's a pretty
good first step.

01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:38.980
It's a very easy test to do.

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:42.685
And I think when we have the
lab tour over at the Mass Eye

01:24:42.685 --> 01:24:44.560
and Ear Infirmary at
the end of the semester,

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.190
we'll be seeing some
otoacoustic emissions recorded

01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:48.860
from a human.

01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:51.130
There's a project
going on there now.

01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:53.156
So we'll have a demo of that.

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:59.910
OK, so if there
aren't any questions,

01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:03.540
we'll meet up again on Monday.

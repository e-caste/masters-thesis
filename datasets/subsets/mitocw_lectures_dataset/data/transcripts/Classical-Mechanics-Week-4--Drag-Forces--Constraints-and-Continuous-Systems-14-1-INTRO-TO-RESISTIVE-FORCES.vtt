00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.360
We would now like to discuss
drag forces in a fluid.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.660
Now remember that fluids
can be both a liquid or air.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.010
And drag forces are
actually quite complicated

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.290
depending on a lot of factors.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.210
If we had an object
falling in a fluid,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.400
the drag forces can depend
on both the properties

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.780
of the object--
and in that case,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.190
it might be the
speed or the size

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.860
or the shape of the
object-- and it also

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.980
can depend on the
properties of the fluid.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.210
It can depend on the
density of the fluid.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.690
It can depend on a
property that measures

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.410
the resistance of
a fluid, something

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.060
which we'll refer
to as viscosity,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.290
and also a property about the
compressibility of a fluid.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.120
So in general, this
is quite complicated.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.950
And this is done empirically.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.140
There's a few very special
cases that we'll discuss

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.739
that can be solved exactly.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.070
Now let's begin our
modeling by considering

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.430
what we call air drag.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.750
Now in air drag, objects
that are moving--

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.914
and we'll consider objects
that are moving rapidly.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.680
So our objects are
moving very fast.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.680
Now in that case, we can
model-- make a rough model

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.480
of the air drag as follows.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.140
The magnitude of
this force is going

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.140
to be proportional
to the speed squared.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.180
There'll be a factor where
it's the cross-sectional area

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.090
that the object presents in
the motion, perpendicular

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.070
to the plane of motion.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.021
It can depend on the
density of the air.

00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:55.520
And traditionally there are a
couple of coefficients in here

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.450
that are dimensionless that
are empirically determined

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.130
by the shape of the object.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.870
And that's called
the drag coefficient.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.090
And in fact, there's also
a factor 1/2 in the way

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.110
this law is
traditionally written.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.590
So what we have here is
a resistive force which

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.050
is proportional to the
speed squared and depends

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.800
on the properties of the
air, the density of the air,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.160
and some physical parameters--
properties of the object

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.410
itself.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.570
Now this drag coefficient--
we can have a table that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.829
can represent that.

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.710
And you can see here that for
a variety of different shapes,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.110
the drag coefficient is
somewhere on the order of 1.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.200
So this is an example of
what we refer to as air drag.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.800
When we drop objects in a
fluid at very slow speeds,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.530
we have a different effect than
what we talked about air drag.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.030
For example, if we drop
a marble in molasses

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.840
and drop the same
marble in water,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.130
we see a very different motion.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.200
And that depends on a
property of the fluid which

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.690
we'll refer to as viscosity.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.260
Now we'll denote a
coefficient of viscosity

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.430
by the symbol n, eta.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.500
Now when we drop an
object in a fluid,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.150
that the drag force in
magnitude will be proportional

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.660
to both viscosity-- will be
proportional to the speed

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.400
and it will be proportional
to the viscosity.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.220
And now, for various
special cases,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.500
so for the special case which
is a sphere of radius r,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.200
if you study fluid dynamics,
we can get an exact solution

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.070
for this drag force.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.350
And we'll describe
that as-- it's

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.420
going to be opposite the
direction of the velocity,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.420
so there's a minus sign.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.330
There turns out to be
some coefficients-- 6 pi

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.030
times the viscosity of the fluid
times the radius of the sphere.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.940
And this particular law, which
we'll known as Stokes' law,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.040
is exactly applicable to
the motion of a sphere.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.280
Now in fact, by
experimental measurement,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.420
this is a method for
determining eta experimentally

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.646
by dropping objects-- spheres--
in various different media

00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:36.770
with different viscosities.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.790
So we can use this to
experimentally determine

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.570
the viscosity of the medium.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.040
And what's important
to realize, too,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.060
is that this is applicable
to many different examples.

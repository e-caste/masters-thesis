00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.620
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.220
In this last example of
relativistic kinematics,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.800
we want to investigate
scattering--

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.420
in this specific
case, a scattering

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.600
of a photon on an
electron at rest.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.070
So we have as an initial state
a photon, an electron at rest,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.830
and then the photon is
scattered and we also

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.530
observe a scattered electron.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.240
There's one important
piece of physics

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.720
here, which we add without
further explanation, which

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.910
is the Planck-Einstein
relation, which

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.870
relates the energy of the photon
to the frequency of the photon

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.060
or the wavelength.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.360
This is fundamentally
important in quantum physics,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.730
and can be explained or tested
with the photoelectric effect

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.170
for which Einstein
received the Nobel Prize.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.230
So what we want to do here
is find the wavelength shift,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.290
so delta lambda, which
is the wavelength

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.540
of the incoming photon
minus the wavelength

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.560
of the outgoing photon, as
a function of the scattering

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.670
angle zeta, as shown
in this picture here.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.710
OK, so again, this
is an activity

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.520
I want you to work on
and try to find out this.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.730
The algebra here is not
trivial, but knowing

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.420
how to set up a problem
like this is important.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.070
So let's try.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.720
So the way to set this up
is to write this four vector

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.840
relation, or you could
just simply write down

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.030
energy conservation and
momentum conservation.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.420
So you have an initial
state, the before,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.460
and the final state,
the after, where

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.120
you simply add the four
vectors of the initial electron

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.860
and photon and set this equal
to the scattered electron

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.150
and scattered photon.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.410
Now, we are interested
in a quantity delta

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.660
lambda, which is related to the
change in energy of the photon.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.240
So therefore, it brings
the four vector of the four

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.030
scattered photon over
here to this side,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.980
and builds a square,
which allows us then

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.210
to use our invariant information
in the scattering process.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.420
When we explore
the squared here,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.060
we find the photon
four vectors squared

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.980
for the scattered and
the unscattered photon,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.370
minus 2 times the product
of the two four vectors.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.290
Now, the mass of
the photon is 0,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.660
and then hence
the invariant mass

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.950
is 0, too, so this
invariant four vector is 0.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.443
So this cancels
and this cancels.

00:02:53.443 --> 00:02:55.360
And then we know that
the mass of the electron

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.150
is the mass of the electron,
the initial momentum

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.270
of the electron is 0, and
we just for the further,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.740
not to get confused,
we said C equal to 1.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.130
So then we just go through
a sequence of algebra

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:17.490
here, making use of information
that those guys here are simply

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.125
the mass of the electron.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:20.880
And we move things
around a little bit

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.870
and then find this
equation here,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.510
which relates the energies
of the two photons

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.160
[INAUDIBLE] the
scattering angle, which

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.060
we get from the scattered
product of the [? three ?]

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.860
momentum of the photon
to the change in electron

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.730
energy, which is the energy of
the electron minus the mass.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.230
OK.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.490
And then we start using
the Einstein relation here.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.080
And again, a little
bit of algebra

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.790
then brings us to delta
lambda equal h over me

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.500
times 1 minus cosine theta.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.080
So this relates the
shift in wavelengths

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.300
to the scattering
angle of the photon.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.800
Important.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.710
If you want to recall this,
the most important part

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.280
through this problem is setting
up this first equation here,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.340
which relates the
energy and the momentum,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.620
or the four vector
of those particles,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.480
before and after the collision.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.780
And again, then it takes
a little bit of practice.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.110
But the way to approach
most of this problem

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.390
is to make use of the
invariant four vector squared,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.060
or the invariant mass
of the objects involved,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.870
if we know the masses
of the object involved.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.420
OK.

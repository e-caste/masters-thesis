00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.010
There were a couple of areas that have been
discussed a little bit, which I wanted to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.480
elaborate on because I think it is significant.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.119
One of them relates to intact aborts.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.320
The question of a crew escape system and whether
that should be automated, whether the crew

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.460
should have control and what is required if
you actually have the crew take control.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.460
I think Chris Kraft gave an interesting perspective
with the idea that because of the difficulties,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.690
or given the requirements, really, the impossibility
of incorporating a capsule escape system for

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.959
the Shuttle, the project basically took the
point of view that the Shuttle itself was

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.400
the escape pod, which means that you have
to recover the Shuttle intact regardless of

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.840
any engine failures.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.370
Now that, of course, requires 100% reliability
of the solid rocket boosters which we never

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.980
did achieve with Challenger.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.020
Although, of course, had we operated it within
its spec limits it might be another story.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.520
But, in any case, I want to go through some
of the details of a return to launch site

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.520
abort and then I will describe an incident
which occurred on our last flight to give

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.289
you an idea of what is involved in the actual
operation of abort modes.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:59.180
The idea is you have the two solid rocket
boosters which have to light.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.690
And they are going to perform no matter what.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.460
If one of those boosters doesn't light and
the other does it is a bad day.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.290
What can you say?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.030
And, obviously, if one of them fails during
flight it is a bad day.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.030
And, which was more of a design problem, if
they don't tail off at just the identical

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.530
rate so that you get asymmetric thrust greater
than a certain capability of the Shuttle to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.810
control, you have had a bad day.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.810
And because of the requirement to have symmetric
thrust, I don't think if this was discussed

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.760
before, when the solid rocket boosters are
poured, they mix a batch of propellant sort

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.720
of like you mix bread dough.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.720
And then they pour the propellant into both
the left and the right booster segments at

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:01.510
the same time so each booster segment has
the identical batch of propellant in it.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.990
It may not be the same from the bottom to
the top, but it is the same from the left

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.810
to the right.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.850
And that is critical.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.950
And then they always reserve a certain proportion
of the propellant.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.950
And they do tests on that to make sure that
there are no process control problems.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.220
OK.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.410
You still need the three main engines to have
enough thrust.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.180
The boosters each give you about 2.5 million
pounds thrust, so that is about five million

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.310
pounds to get off the ground.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.680
These give you about a half a million pound
thrust at vacuum, four hundred and some odd

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.230
thousand pounds thrust, so still over a million
pounds thrust.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.880
And, of course, the problem you have during
first stage is you have big gravity losses.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.880
The Shuttle on the pad weighs about 5.5 million
pounds with all the propellant.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.709
If you don't fire your main engines you are
barely going to lift off the ground.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.620
Actually, I guess it is a little bit less
than five million pounds.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.620
But, in any case, without the three main engines
firing you don't have enough thrust to get

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.728
into orbit.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:28.729
Now, remember we talked about for deorbit
burn, normally we fire both OMS engines.

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.900
If one of the OMS engines is out you can fire
one engine for twice as long.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.710
Or, if they are both out, you can fire the
four RCS thrusters for twice as long again.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.110
Because you are in orbit, you are weightless,
you don't have gravity losses, so firing half

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.169
as many engines for twice as long is completely
equivalent.

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.499
When you are taking off against gravity that
is not true.

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:59.949
I mean if you only have five million pounds
of thrust for a five million pound payload

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.979
you are just going to sit on the pad and burn
all your fuel.

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:03.449
OK.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.139
You need your three engines.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:14.139
And, in fact, another interesting point, the
attachment between the external tank and the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.610
Shuttle, that is stressed to assume that you
have at least one engine burning.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.990
They tell me that if the Shuttle took off
with just the solid boosters and you didn't

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.710
have any thrust, sort of keeping the Shuttle
up with the external tank, that the structural

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.979
attachment points would fail.

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.249
Anyway, you need your engines.

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:47.569
What happens if you lose an engine early on?

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:54.569
If you are far enough into the launch, you
are over the main gravity loss segment usually

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.659
starting at about 3.5 to 4 minutes into launch.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:05.339
If you lose one engine you can make it over
the ocean, And that is called a Trans-Atlantic

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.830
Abort.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.779
And, when you do that, you are basically flying
upside down.

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:16.639
You will do a roll maneuver, drop your external
tank and come in and land.

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:23.639
And you are basically going in the same direction
which is nice when you are flying a rocket.

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:26.119
These things are hard to turn around.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:30.259
But if you are going to do a return to launch
site abort that is exactly what you have to

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:31.219
do.

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:38.219
So, this is a procedure that has been analyzed
to death in many, many computer simulations.

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.099
The basic procedure is you take off and you
lose an engine.

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:52.099
Now, it doesn't matter when you lose an engine
in the first 2.5 minutes.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.909
You don't do anything while the solid rocket
boosters are firing.

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:00.779
They basically have open loop guidance.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:07.149
There is a certain projector programmed in
and you cannot readjust that trajectory with

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:12.389
a closed loop guidance solution to accommodate
for any sort of a malfunction.

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:14.969
So, you don't even declare an RTLS abort.

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:21.969
And that, by the way, is done by the crew
punching a button which essentially is a protected

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.389
button.

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:25.490
You punch that.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.069
And you can also do it via a computer input
if something goes wrong with the button.

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:34.569
You declare an RTLS abort after SRB separation.

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:41.249
Immediately what happens is your trajectory
increases because you want to gain altitude,

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:42.899
and you will see why in a minute.

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:49.899
But what happens now is you've got a pretty
hefty downrange velocity already and you have

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.879
got to turn around and come back.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:08:01.879
You have also got to worry about the disposal
of your external tank.

00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:07.300
If you turn around and you come back, you
are still burning your engines, you are still

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.399
riding your tank, and you don't want the tank
coming down on Melbourne or Disney World or

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.860
anything like that.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.679
The basic procedure is as follows.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:22.679
You are going out, you loft your trajectory
a bit, once you get far enough out now what

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.969
you do is you do a powered pitch around.

00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:32.029
A very sporty maneuver.

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:34.210
The external tank is here.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:41.210
Now you are flying backwards into your plume
and everybody has speculated on what that

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.049
would actually look like.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.930
Now you are flying backwards decelerating.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.440
And, as you decelerate, of course, gravity
is starting to push you down so you've got

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:58.440
to increase your pitch velocity until finally
you basically have no more horizontal velocity

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:05.730
and are just sitting statically on top of
your exhaust.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:12.459
And now you gradually pitch forward and you
start to fly back.

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:18.810
Again, you have got to plan your trajectory
so that when you drop the tank it is going

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.649
to come down in the ocean.

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:26.220
And then, if all that goes well, now you enter
the heading alignment circle.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:33.180
And, of course, you are a heavy weight vehicle
because you also, in the process of the RTLS,

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:39.130
dump your OMS tanks and your RCS propellant
so that you want to make sure you are as light

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.829
as possible.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:46.829
Plus, in case you have any problem with landing
you don't want your hypergolic propellant

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:49.190
tanks to rupture.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:54.769
If all that goes well, now you enter the heading
alignment circle and you have hopefully a

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:56.209
nominal landing.

00:09:56.209 --> 00:10:03.209
As I say, this has been analyzed in high-fidelity
dynamic simulations.

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:07.180
The crew practices it over and over again.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.690
Everybody knows the procedures.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:16.370
Nobody wants to be the first crew to try this
out.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:22.750
Before STS-1, you remember we talked about
how there were lots of problems with the tiles

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.459
falling off.

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:30.209
I remember one of the people very high up
in NASA, I don't remember if it was the administrator

00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:36.879
or one of the deputies, suggested that maybe
the safest thing to do would be to do a planned

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:43.250
RTLS because an RTLS, of course, you don't
get up to those high velocities.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.870
And so you don't have any thermal problems.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:50.360
And so if a whole bunch of tiles had fallen
off on the launch pad you could safely do

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.579
an RTLS.

00:10:51.579 --> 00:10:58.000
Well, obviously, they did not appreciate the
difficulties of doing an RTLS and that suggestion

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.100
was not taken up.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:06.100
We basically decided we were not going to
fly until we had confidence that the tiles

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:10.069
were going to stay on.

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:17.069
Cut forward to February of 1996, which was
my fifth and final Shuttle flight.

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:22.779
I was the second flight engineer so I was
sitting right behind the pilot who is responsible

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:24.170
for the main engine performance.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:31.170
Now, I should tell you, we have had, in the
course of the 114 Shuttle flights we have

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:35.899
had four pad shutdowns, pad aborts.

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:38.430
And I think we talked about that briefly.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:45.430
The main engines turn on six seconds before
the solids.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.420
Just reviewing that does two things.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:53.860
It gives the engines time to come up to full
thrust and then you can perform checks on

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:59.430
them to make sure that they are operating
properly before you commit yourself to flight.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:05.689
And, of course, it gives time, because of
the asymmetric thrust, for what we call the

00:12:05.689 --> 00:12:10.040
"twang" that the whole Shuttle stack goes
forward and then back.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.589
And then, when you get to the vertical, you
light the boosters.

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:17.980
In fact, when they had the first test firing
on the pad before STS-1, one of the reasons

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:24.009
that they wanted to do that, in addition to
just confirming that everything was working

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:27.399
right, is they really wanted precise timing
on the twang.

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:31.089
People had calculated it, but that is not
something you want to get wrong.

00:12:31.089 --> 00:12:37.709
So, they wanted an experimental verification.

00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:44.709
Of the four pad shutdowns, two of them were
caused by instrumentation and two of them

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.899
were real engine problems.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:52.230
I remember the first one was the last flight
before what would have been my first flight

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.720
back in 1984.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.050
And the main engine cutoff is called MECO.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:07.170
So, 8.5 minutes into the flight.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:14.170
After they had a pad abort the flight engineer
called to Mission Control we have MECO, somehow

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.529
I thought we would be a little bit higher.

00:13:18.529 --> 00:13:25.319
And, of course, when that happens now you've
got to pull all the engines out, take them

00:13:25.319 --> 00:13:30.779
back to the shop, bring in new engines and
it is about a two or three week stand down.

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:32.149
And the crew has to go back to Houston.

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:36.160
And, of course, all of your friends and family
are there and they have to go home.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.670
It is no fun.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.939
I mean nobody complains if it is safe.

00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:47.939
We're sitting on the pad, we're counting down
and everything was on schedule.

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:54.139
In fact, the first of my five flights it had
zero problems, zero delays.

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:58.240
We were going on the day that was predicted
on the time.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.949
Countdown to six seconds.

00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:04.220
You can feel the engines.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.339
Everything starts to rumble.

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:07.800
The engines start up.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:14.800
There is what we call a steam gage, a vertical
bar which shows the engine power.

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:19.319
Center and right engines come up to 100%.

00:14:19.319 --> 00:14:22.850
The left engine comes up to 40%.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.699
The pilot calls out left engine at 40%.

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:30.220
In times like this, your mind is working pretty
fast.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:37.220
I remember thinking to myself oh, damn, we
are going to have a pad shutdown, we have

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:43.800
got to go back to Houston and back to the
simulators.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.800
I mean stupid things to be thinking about
at that time, but that is sort of the way

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.310
it works.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.689
And all of a sudden kaboom.

00:14:51.689 --> 00:14:54.730
I feel this big kick in my back.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.269
The solids have lit.

00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:57.699
What in the hell is going on?

00:14:57.699 --> 00:14:59.589
We were supposed to have a pad abort.

00:14:59.589 --> 00:15:04.490
Now we are going with an engine.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:11.490
And, actually, when you are going through
maximum dynamic pressure, max q, the engines

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.310
throttle down to about 65%.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.480
And there is a malfunction if one of your
engines gets stuck it is called getting stuck

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.019
in the thrust bucket.

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:25.199
If it doesn't come back to full power you
are RTLS abort.

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:29.180
Well, we were taking off with one engine at
40%.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:36.180
It sort of dawned on me that we were going
to be the first crew to do an RTLS, so at

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:42.249
that point I start going through my checklists.

00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:49.249
And the pilot calls to the ground we have
ignition, left engine at 40%.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:57.550
And so, for about the first 15 seconds or
so, I just had barely time to get out the

00:15:57.829 --> 00:16:01.029
RTLS checklist and start getting ready to
read the procedures.

00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:06.459
And then it turns out that the ground has
more insight than the crew does.

00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:12.670
And it turns out that there are several sensors,
one of which feeds that gauge.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.670
But, in fact, that sensor had gone bad.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.899
And, in fact, the left engine was performing
nominally and the ground was able to confirm

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:26.209
that both by the other sensors and by looking
at the acceleration.

00:16:26.209 --> 00:16:29.470
And so, everything was OK, I put away the
checklist and enjoyed the ride.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.300
But, first of all, it was kind of a scary
situation.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.029
But it also shows the difficulty.

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:43.029
Now, suppose we, as the crew, had been responsible
for declaring an abort.

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:50.990
If you are going to build in a system where
this is the crew's responsibility then you

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:57.850
better design your instrumentation so that
the crew has all the instrumentation required

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.059
to make that decision correctly.

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:08.059
Similarly, if this were to be an automatic
abort, you've got to have failure detection,

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:17.109
identification, reconfiguration.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:24.050
The last thing you want is to go into an abort
situation when you don't have to because there

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:31.050
is no way that an abort is going to be anywhere
near as safe as a nominal mission.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.740
Obviously, it's just a good story now.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:47.740
But I think it does have something to inform
about how you are going to have to design

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.840
abort systems.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:56.840
And, as both Aaron Cohen and Chris Kraft said,
although the astronauts always felt comfortable

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.340
with their abort system but I am not sure
that all the people in Mission Control were

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.510
quite so comfortable knowing the things that
might go wrong with it.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:15.510
And, in fact, as he said, they always breathe
a sigh of relief after first stage when the

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.290
abort rocket would detach and fire itself
away.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:20.750
Yeah.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:27.750
If one of the engines is not working or not
working properly, I guess the other two engines

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.240
try to do the work [NOISE OBSCURES].

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.060
Well, they certainly will throttle up to 109%
if they need to, but they cannot make up for

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.540
the first engine when you're in the first
stage and you have lots of gravity losses.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:49.540
In fact, when you get, like I said, to about
3.5, 4 minutes then you have enough altitude

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.670
and downrange velocity to make it across.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:19:01.670
And then at some point you get to the situation
where you basically gained your altitude.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.630
And, although you are not at orbital velocity
yet so you still have some gravity losses,

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:14.630
the gravity losses are small enough that if
you have a loss of an engine you can still

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.280
make it to a lower orbit.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.250
That is called abort to orbit, ATO.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:28.250
And you will hear the call press to ATO means
that you can now make it to a lower orbit

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.520
which is the safest thing to do with two engines.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:39.120
And then a little bit later on you will hear
like single engine TAL which means if you

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.120
lose two engines with only one engine you
can make it across the Atlantic.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.140
And then later on you will hear single engine
ATO and then finally single engine.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.300
Then you will also hear press to MECO which
means at this point if you lose an engine

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.230
you can make it through your nominal orbit.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:59.560
And usually about the last call a single engine
press to MECO which means even if you lose

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.880
two engines you can still make it to MECO.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:09.880
What happens then if there

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.520
is an instrumentation problem [NOISE OBSCURES]?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:30.520
The crew will never declare an abort on their
own because it is just realized that the ground

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.140
has so much more information.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.330
The only exception is if you lose comm.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:41.210
If we had lost comm.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:48.210
and we saw our engine at 40%, I mean there
were a few other displays which the pilot

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.180
was starting to call up.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:56.110
And it could be that he would have figured
it out perhaps, perhaps not, but that is the

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.840
only circumstance under which the crew would
make that call.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.230
There was abort at some stage.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.120
What happened to that?

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.180
Did they manage to make it [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.490
I was trying to remember.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.840
Did I talk about that in class?

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:19.840
Well, all right, I will run through that because
it was, again, a very interesting story.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:25.790
The things that you are afraid about is that
if things go back in a hurry in an engine

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.580
that an engine can actually blow up.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.930
And it is one thing if an engine gets shutdown.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.690
Now you are just flying on two engines.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:38.950
But if an engine blows up and takes out your
whole rear section you have had a bad day.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:45.950
The instrumentation is biased towards an early
shutdown.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.070
If you sense that something has gone wrong
shut it down.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.660
We have got intact aborts.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:59.700
Better to err on the side of safety, even
if that might potentially put you into an

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.710
abort situation.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.710
And I am trying to exactly reconstruct it.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:15.860
The thing is that if you lose one engine now
you are abort ATO.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:26.650
Now, if you lose a second engine you might
be in a situation where certainly you cannot

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.410
make it to orbit.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.950
And, because you have changed your trajectory,
you might not be able to make it to a good

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.220
Trans-Atlantic landing site.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:44.220
So, at that point, if you have lost one engine
there is a switch on the center console where

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.040
you can override the engine shutdown command.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:59.040
What you are now saying is we are in an unsurvivable
situation if we only have one engine.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:07.230
And, therefore, we will take the extra chance
of getting an instrumentation caused engine

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.300
shutdown.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:14.110
We are not going to take that chance so we
are going to disable the ability of instrumentation

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:18.530
to shut down the engine and we will just take
our chances.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.240
The ground will continue the calculation.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.570
And, as soon as you get to the point where
you have the capability of doing a single

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:31.840
engine TAL or a single engine abort to orbit,
you re-enable the instrumentation.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:38.840
What happened is the Shuttle launched.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:47.860
It must have been about 4 or 5 minutes into
launch because they lost an engine, it shut

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:54.860
down automatically, they are now abort to
orbit lower orbit, but they were abort to

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.240
orbit.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.970
Take the switch, put it to inhibit.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:05.420
Now, the main propulsion flight controller
was very good.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:12.420
She realized right away that it was an instrumentation
problem because sometimes you can see certain

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:17.090
trends or you see things change in a way that
tells you that this is not the way a real

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.720
engine behaves, that this is more typical
of instrumentation.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.910
She suspected she had an instrumentation problem.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:30.910
Now they get a little further along in the
launch where they could have potentially done

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:37.850
-- They were too far to land in the normal
TAL sites which were in the daytime on the

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:44.550
West Coast of Africa, but they could have
made a nighttime landing at some emergency

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:49.380
airport in the Congo, I think it was, if they
had lost another engine.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:56.380
But, by the flight rules, they take the switch
back to enable so that now, because you can

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:05.410
"safely" lose a second engine you want to
protect yourself against an explosive situation.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.640
So, now they are enabled.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:13.400
Now the flight controller sees that the instrumentation
on one of the other two engines is starting

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.910
to go back the way the first one was.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:23.440
And she realized that in about 15 seconds
that engine was going to shut down so she

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:29.820
immediately called the flight director and
said flight, take the switch back to inhibit.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:35.790
And this is where the discipline becomes very
important, luckily flight didn't get into

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.940
a long involved discussion about why do you
want to do that, what is going on, but just

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:46.160
said CAPCOM engine switch to inhibit.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.270
They took it.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.570
And sure enough the instrumentation went bad
but the engine was OK.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.400
They got to orbit.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.640
Then they used some of their OMS propellant
to raise their orbit a little bit.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.490
That was a Spacelab mission.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.100
And they had a good mission.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:06.360
But the flight controller actually won a big
award for that because she really saved the

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.380
day.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:13.430
So, yeah, that is the closest we ever came
to a real intact abort.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.070
Yeah.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.340
Two questions.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:20.340
The first one is going back to the return
to launch site.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.880
Do all of the main engine propellant get used
up before the tank gets dropped or do you

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.820
not burn some of the propellant?

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.270
You know, I don't know the answer to that.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:28.970
I don't.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:34.740
And the other one is on the pad, with your
flight, wouldn't the sequencing computer shut

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.400
down the other engines if it detected that
one of them had failed?

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.600
And so it must have used the good sensor.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.250
Yeah, that is right.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:47.210
And, luckily, our little gauge was just fed
by one.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:51.440
And, in retrospect, you can say probably that's
not a good way to design it but that is the

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.100
way it was designed.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:52.850
You're right.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:59.450
If the engine controller senses with a majority
or however they program it, I don't know the

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.390
details of the guts of the software there.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.530
But if it is convinced that one of the engines
is not working right it shuts down all three

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:10.620
engines, which is what happened on four occasions.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.020
Yeah.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:18.020
When you talked about the forced pitch over
in the return to launch site, was that just

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.280
the gambling of the main engines that gives
you that?

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.770
Yeah, because you are off the solids at that
point.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.700
And that is the thing.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:31.310
I mean with the solids there is such an enormous
thrust and the aerodynamic loads are huge.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:35.500
You don't want to deviate from your planned
trajectory because one of the things that

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.980
they do is program in load relief for the
aerodynamic surfaces.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.590
They take the day of winds launch.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:51.090
And, if you have wind shears or other atmospheric
high jet streams that you are going to fly

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:58.090
through, they actually program the elevons
and the body flap to move in such a way as

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.860
to relieve the aerodynamic loading on the
wings.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.880
And that is preprogrammed in.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.950
It is not a closed loop.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:11.100
It is totally open loop so you don't want
to change the trajectory once you've put all

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.920
that load relief in.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.330
How long does that take?

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.640
It's pretty quick.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.620
It's about ten seconds, if I remember from
the simulator.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:25.270
It is a sporty maneuver, I will tell you.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.510
No RCS that goes into that?

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:31.560
Oh, the RCS is trivial compared to what you're
getting out.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.810
You've got 500,000 pounds coming out of each
engine.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:42.810
The primary RCS is 750 pounds.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.630
But, like I said, they do then open up the
RCS as you are flying back.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:56.510
And what they do is they open up all the engines
so that you have symmetrical thrusts so that

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:01.010
you are firing out of both sides.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:07.740
The idea is just to deplete the tanks as much
as possible.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:14.740
The second technical area that I had been
hoping that Al Louviere would get into and

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:21.470
didn't have a chance to was the payload bay
doors which are a fascinating mechanism.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:28.470
And it is also going to be a segue into EVA
because it was a strange situation.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.700
It is kind of relate back to that now when
you look at how many successful EVAs have

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.650
been done and the Hubble repair and the building
of Space Station and all the other things,

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:46.650
but management at Johnson Space Center was
not particularly friendly to EVA back in the

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.830
`70s.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:55.480
I asked Chris Kraft about that.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.100
At first he denied it.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.320
He said well, I always liked EVA.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.510
He said well, maybe it was the management
of the Astronaut Office that didn't like EVA.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:08.750
He did admit that Bob Gilruth who was the
Director of Johnson Space Center at the time,

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:14.620
this was when Chris Kraft was head of flight
operations, definitely did not like EVA.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.350
He was afraid of it.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:22.350
He didn't think it was safe, despite the fact
that back in 1973 EVA had saved the entire

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.060
Skylab project.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.540
Hopefully most of you know that story.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.730
I know it is ancient history.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:37.530
And clearly we had done a lot of safe EVAs
on the surface of the Moon, but basically

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:44.530
EVA was looked at it was expensive, it was
potentially hazardous.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:51.120
Given the things that the Shuttle was supposed
to do in the original planning, mainly launch

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:57.140
satellites, launch pieces of the Space Station,
that went away, Launch Defense Department

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:04.140
satellites, commercial satellites, EVA was
not really part of the big picture in planning.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:11.160
And, although they did design an airlock for
the Shuttle, there were real questions of

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.170
how much preparation do we have to do for
EVA?

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.380
Do we really even need it?

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:25.380
Maybe we could save some weight by not having
space suits aboard.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:46.990
That is

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.100
where we finally ended up.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.310
That is the Hubble Telescope.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.600
This is the side of the payload bay.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.930
I mean, obviously, EVA became a very successful
activity.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.340
These are the payload bay doors.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.430
This is in the orbiter processing facility.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:27.430
And one of the things, well, I have a picture
of closing the door.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:33.220
But the mechanism of these doors is extraordinary.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.480
There are two motors, one at the front and
one at the back of each.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:44.810
Each of the motors has two drive units and
they work through a differential so that if

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:51.810
one of the motors fails the other one can
still drive although at half the speed, just

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.610
similar to the way a car works.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:33:00.740
There is a long torsion rod which runs the
length of the Shuttle.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.130
And then that torsion rod is attached to these
bars over here.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:11.510
And I am sorry the picture was scanned in
and is not terribly sharp.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:18.510
As the torsion bar twists then these rods
lift up the payload bay door and bring it

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.250
to a close.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:26.090
The mechanism, this is the best picture I
could find, you notice there is a strong back

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:32.390
because, as was mentioned, the doors cannot
support their own weight in 1G.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:39.390
But the system of latches here, you have to
remember that the payload bay can expand and

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:45.440
contract by several inches due to thermal
environment.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:52.440
And so you have to design a latch system that
can accommodate this thermal behavior.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.950
It was an incredible mechanical challenge.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:02.400
And the complexity of this system, I mean
I am always amazed when I look at how the

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:02.930
thing works.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:09.399
I have a schematic of them later, which you
can look at, but basically you close the doors.

00:34:09.399 --> 00:34:14.280
And then the first thing you do is you want
to close the latches on either end.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.349
And then there is also center line latches.

00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:22.239
And I think Al Louviere did discuss the fact
that these payload bay doors are part of the

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:26.399
structural element of the Shuttle during reentry.

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:32.000
You cannot reenter if the doors are not just
closed by latched.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.820
You need them latched for structural strength.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:42.820
There is a series of bollards here, little
protrusions which these latches grab on.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:51.330
And they have designed the rigging of the
rods such that the latches that are close

00:34:56.149 --> 00:35:02.420
to the hinge line actually close before the
latches that are further away.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:09.100
It is a sequential closing of the latches
all with a single mechanism so that basically

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:16.100
you pull the part of the door that is closest
to the torque rod, you latch that down first,

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:21.510
and then it is kind of a zipper effect where
then you pull it down so that even if the

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:26.660
door is a little bit warped thermally you
will get the door to close properly.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:33.660
You wouldn't want to close this latch first
and then have the door in a situation where

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.010
it was buckled out.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:41.180
And then, of course, the center line latch,
because of the thermal expansion, you can

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.480
have the doors coming together like that or
like that.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.580
And you have got to have centerline latches
that can accommodate for that.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.260
It is really quite an incredible design.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.520
And Al Louviere had said that he was going
to talk about it, but he didn't have time

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.270
to.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:04.380
There is plenty of redundancy in here because
there are these double motors, but because

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:11.380
this is so critical people started to look
at suppose you have some degree stuck in the

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:18.230
mechanism, it doesn't matter how many motors,
you cannot get it closed.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:22.570
Suppose the motors jam on one side.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.600
Now the other motor is not going to be able
to drive it.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.500
So, various things were done to allow for
EVA intervention.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.600
And, in the early Shuttle flights, this was
the only thing that the crew trained for with

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.370
EVA, it was just payload bay door contingencies.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:46.370
For instance, the PDU, the drive unit, this
is the payload bay door drive unit or PLBDU.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.230
That is what we call a nested acronym.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.730
That is part of the game there.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.760
You have to go out and actually peel away
the liners of the payload bay.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:07.760
And inside here there is a little mechanism
where you can insert a special tool and twist

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.680
it.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:16.680
And that actually disconnects that motor drive
unit from the torque so that it can turn freely.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.790
And I hope, when you look at these things,
you will get some sense of the complexity

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.680
of these mechanisms.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:33.680
And so what we do for training -- Of course
they build mockups of this in the water and

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.490
we also look at the real Shuttle down in Florida
to actually see these units.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.890
And, for the people who are on the EVA crew,
you spend a lot of time crawling around the

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:47.810
payload bay getting intimately familiar with
a lot of the actual mechanisms just in case

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:54.810
you actually have to go out and do something
with it.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:01.880
Then suppose the problem is not with the drive
unit but that one of these latches get jammed

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.860
up.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.350
This is actually a tube cutter.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.100
It is a little hard to see.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.690
I don't know if you are familiar with the
things.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:12.480
They are on a ratchet.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:18.790
And, as it gradually cuts, you push the blade
in bit by bit.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.500
And then eventually you cut away.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:27.280
And this gives you an idea that they just
gave us a lot of tools, a pin extractor, a

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.220
crowbar, vice grips, you name it.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.000
How much did that crowbar cost?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.660
Well, the crowbar probably cost about $10
at Sears.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:45.660
And then they had to put on all of the Velcro
and the tethers to go in the tool thing, and

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.860
that probably cost a few hundred dollars.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.890
And then they had to make a drawing of it,
and you know how it goes.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:56.250
EVA is very expensive because everything has
to be custom made.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:03.180
I mean that is one of the things that, because
of the constraints of the suits and the gloves,

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.750
you cannot, in most case, just use regular
tools.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.300
And, as I say, everything is tethered.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.650
And I will show you pictures later.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.070
We have a little mini workstation.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:18.500
They built little receptacles on the side
of the suit because it is a hard upper torso

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.270
which can take a certain amount of load.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:25.310
And so you plug basically a tool caddy into
your suit.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:28.800
And then you hang all of these tools on the
tool caddy.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:35.070
And you will see some pictures later of how
that works.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:42.070
If the motors don't work and you have now
freed the doors so that the door can move

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:49.630
but you have no motor to drive it, now we
have a mechanical winch and a rope on it.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.750
And I'm not making this up.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:56.990
You actually run the rope up.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:00.820
These are the little bollards that the latches
catch onto.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.030
You run the rope up over that and then you
have to crawl out on the payload bay door,

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.760
which would be a lot of fun, and attach it
here.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.570
And then you actually wind it closed.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.750
And we do this in the water.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.840
I mean this is all fully mocked up.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.820
Yeah.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.090
What do you do if you have trouble opening
the doors just after launch?

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:28.630
Well, if you cannot open the doors then you
come home.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.470
You wouldn't want to.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:33.400
I mean if there was something seriously wrong
with the doors you better come home.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.180
Yeah, we can do this to get them closed.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.050
But you don't want to purposely put yourself
in that situation if you know you have a problem

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.530
beforehand.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.010
Yeah.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.980
[NOISE OBSCURES]

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.180
We think it could be done with one person.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.730
Normally, we only go out with two.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:56.920
But in the orbital flight test, the first
four flights only had two crew members.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:02.440
Was of them was EVA trained.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.750
And then what happens if you get the doors
closed by the latches don't latch?

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:13.570
They actually made latches that we could put
on by hand.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:14.990
These are the latches for the side.

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:21.560
And this is the schematic that sort of show
the latches going on the orders in that order

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.820
one, two, three and four.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.920
And, again, the way they designed this so
that they actually close in sequence but you

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:34.890
only have one drive unit is really just a
beautiful mechanical system.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:41.320
But if they don't close then you take this,
and I won't go into the details, but you have

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.460
to spring it around at least two of those.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.460
And that will give you the structural strength
to come home.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:54.510
And then if the center line latches don't
close, again, you can look at the mechanism

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.760
here.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.490
And they have yet a different tool.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:01.580
Now, this is actually shown on its side, but
this is actually on the top.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:06.860
And this is a bitch in the water because,
yeah, your suit is weightless but the tool

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.740
is not.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.920
And so you are holding this tool.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.060
When you're holding the tool you want to sink
to the bottom, and so you are trying to hold

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.770
on with one hand.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:22.740
And you have a tether so you try to tie yourself
to the top there so that you're kind of hanging

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.300
on the tether.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:30.050
But then, depending on how your weigh out
is, if you move this big tool back and forth

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.680
your body is sort of rocking back and forth.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.390
And you are working above your head.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.510
I mean everybody has to do it.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:45.430
If you are going to be an EVA crew member
and you cannot do this job you are disqualified.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.670
But nobody likes it.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:51.650
It is a real pain.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:56.010
That is basically how EVA got sold to the
Shuttle System.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:02.140
I will show you a few pictures of general
EVA activities to give you an idea of how

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.150
the system works.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:10.150
And then I want to go into the question of
the interaction between EVA and the pressurization

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:18.560
and the environmental control system of the
rest of the Shuttle because, again, this is

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.050
a systems engineering problem.

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:26.440
And you cannot, in most cases, do one thing
without it having an impact on something else.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:31.369
I talked about doing all this training.

00:43:31.369 --> 00:43:37.780
Now we are stepping ten years into the future
so that is training for the Hubble Telescope.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:43.540
And, actually, the telescope is so tall that
we couldn't get the whole thing in.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:48.970
The pool wasn't deep enough so we had to actually
cut it in half, and we would work on one half

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:54.530
and then work on the other half.

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:55.180
Here is an example.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.650
This is me installing the Wide Field/Planetary
Camera.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:06.650
Now, the training, people normally see the
water tank.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.130
You're not weightless.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.150
You all understand that.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.990
If you go upside down the blood rushes to
your head.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:20.710
If you're holding onto tools, the tools will
fall down.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.460
And of course you don't have these guys when
you're out in space.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:32.460
Angels if you saw them out in space.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:39.890
If you're moving around large objects, they
have resistance from the water, so you need

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:45.940
to get a sense of how easy it is to push things
around so you don't get things moving too

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.630
fast.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:50.770
We also train on air bearing floors.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:55.930
This is a mass model of the Wiff-Pick.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:00.400
The same mass, moments of inertia.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.430
And I am up here on a weight relief system.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:08.220
And you can really get a sense of what it
feels like.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:13.310
And so you are trying to build a kind of muscle
memory so that when you get in space you are

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:19.480
not trying to push things as hard as you push
them in the water.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.980
And you also remember that if you want to
stop something you also have to be able to

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.040
exert a force on it.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:31.000
Whereas, in the water, all you have to do
is stop pushing.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.970
Now we go into space and we are ready for
the EVA.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:40.750
I will sort of take you through what is involved
to give you a sense of the complexity of this

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.470
system.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.450
First of all are tools.

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:49.970
That is what I looked like before all the
cosmic rays made my hair fall out.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:54.520
It is just one of the hazards of spaceflight.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.770
Here you see the kind of tool caddies.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:00.940
This is for a ratchet wrench.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.230
And we had about 250 different tools.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:08.280
About a hundred planned to use and the rest
were for contingencies.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.440
And we had to take them all out.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.980
We call this our fish stringer.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.540
Sort of like a Portuguese fishermen.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.780
The fisher wives hang all the fish on the
string and then hang them out.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:25.740
And then we take this out on the fish stringer.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.110
This is the airlock at launch.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.290
And it is totally packed.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:35.560
And, in fact, we had four spacesuits rather
than the normal two so there wasn't a whole

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.240
lot of room.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:41.619
And the first thing is you go and you start
checking the various systems.

00:46:41.619 --> 00:46:48.619
And then you have to unpack everything and
move it into the flight deck.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.650
That is Story.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.230
We went out together.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.450
This is the hard upper torso.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:47:01.750
This is looking down into the inside of the
spacesuit.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:08.410
The back of the spacesuit there is battery
and lithium hydroxide CO2 scrubber.

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:12.850
The CO2 scrubber has to be replaced after
every EVA.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:16.980
It is good for about 12 hours.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:22.350
And normally if you're only going out once
you don't worry about recharging the batteries,

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:28.660
but since we were doing successive every day
EVAs we would have to take the batteries out

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.800
every night and charge them.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.990
Take the ones that had been charged and put
them into the suits that are going to go out

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.200
the next day.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:39.470
And just keeping track of which cartridges
have been used and which batteries have been

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:46.470
charged and how much, I mean there is a tremendous
amount of overhead effort just in managing

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.890
all of this equipment.

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:55.890
And we had practiced doing this a lot on the
ground, as you can imagine, before we went

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.350
up.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:00.150
The morning of the EVA.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:06.140
You get up early and eat as big a breakfast
as you can because you are not going to get

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.330
much to eat for the next eight hours.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.710
These are radiation monitors.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:17.100
For Hubble we were actually up at about 600
kilometers, which is as high as the Shuttle

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:24.100
ever goes, so we got really the highest radiation
dose that you can get on the Shuttle on a

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:25.920
normal mission.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.930
It was about between one and two REMs which
is no big health problem.

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:37.930
But typically the dose on a Shuttle flight
at a more typical 300 kilometers is more like

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:43.590
tens or maybe a little over 100 milliREMs.

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.930
They did want us to take the radiation monitor.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.460
Now we are in the mid-deck.

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:52.690
And when you see these pictures you get a
sense of when you're doing an EVA the entire

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:55.190
middeck is just full of stuff.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.580
I mean there is so much equipment.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:05.580
You've got the pants units floating over there,
plus the two extra suits and all of the auxiliary

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.530
equipment.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:09.730
You try to keep things organized.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:16.730
Then for thermal control, the original Apollo
spacesuits were designed for daytime use on

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.980
the Moon when it is very hot.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.880
And, in addition, people are walking so they
are putting a lot of metabolic heat into the

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.550
suit.

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:33.080
And so they were very concerned about being
able to have sufficient cooling.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:38.080
They developed a very, very efficient sublimator
cooling unit.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:45.080
You have a little layer of ice that is continually
fed from the bottom and it is sublimates.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.820
That basically is how you get rid of your
heat.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:51.900
And then you run your cooling water underneath
that ice and it cools off.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:58.050
And then it is run through what they call
LCVG, liquid cooling and ventilation garment

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:05.050
which has lots of Tygon tubing that goes through
it so that it carries the cold water next

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:06.550
to your skin.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:13.550
And also the oxygen that comes into the suit
comes through the helmet over the back of

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.920
your head so it flows over your face so you
breathe the fresh oxygen.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:25.920
But you would like to get ventilation through
the entire suit so you don't build up lots

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.950
of humidity in your arms and legs.

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:34.600
What you do is the return valve actually comes
through these air ducts.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:40.420
And so the return is picked up at the bottom
of your arms and at the bottom of your legs.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:45.580
That insures that the air does get circulated
through your arms and legs.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:52.580
But when we started doing Shuttle EVAs metabolically
you are not nearly as stressed.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:51:01.340
Plus, you spend almost half your time in the
dark and it gets really, really cold.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:08.340
And this has been a constant problem.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:14.630
And here is an interesting systems problem
to show how everything relates to one another.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:20.420
We were very concerned about when you open
up the doors of the Hubble Telescope, if direct

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:27.420
sunlight comes in, it will cause an out-gassing
of the internal material which could pollute

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.170
the ultraviolet mirrors.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:37.170
The ultraviolet optics are very, very sensitive
to organic contamination, so under no circumstances

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:42.500
could we have sunlight penetrating the interior
of the telescope.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:47.300
But we were going to be spending a lot of
time with the doors open, so how do you insure

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.340
that you will never get the sun coming in?

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:56.619
Well, the Hubble Telescope is sitting up here
like this.

00:51:56.619 --> 00:52:01.900
If that is the sun, just make sure that the
belly of the orbiter is always pointed towards

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.290
the sun.

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:06.800
Then you never have to worry about sun coming
into the telescope.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:13.170
But what you do have to worry about is that,
well, during the dayside of your orbit, if

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:18.030
the sun is over here and the earth is over
here, during the day your payload bay is going

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:19.580
to be pointed towards the earth.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:25.960
And so, you basically have a radiative heat
exchange with something that is at about 20

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.750
degrees C.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.350
No big deal.

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:33.220
If you go around the other side now, you at
nighttime, you're pointed at deep space.

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:37.450
And so you're radiating towards absolute zero
or three degrees Kelvin.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:40.290
And that is a concern.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.260
And you get very cold.

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:48.260
They were predicting temperatures of as much
as 150 below zero Celsius.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:55.480
We were very concerned not only were our hands
going to get cold but some of our tools might

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.980
not work.

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:04.980
We pushed very hard for a test in a thermal
vacuum chamber.

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:10.020
Our tools are stored in a toolbox outside
in the cargo bay.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:15.210
And we wanted to go through going out and
taking the tools out.

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:22.210
And, of course, they are held in there because
they have launch locks so there are little

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:27.940
pit pins and latching mechanisms that you
have to remove so that you can get the tools

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:28.850
out.

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:30.619
I went in to do the first test.

00:53:30.619 --> 00:53:32.320
And it is a vacuum chamber.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.520
And the walls are painted black.

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:38.450
And they can run liquid nitrogen through the
vacuum chamber.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:42.790
And they could cool it down to the lowest
temperatures that we were expecting to experience.

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:49.790
I opened up the toolbox and about 75% of the
tools the launch release mechanisms were just

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.570
frozen shut.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:52.980
I couldn't get them out.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.510
So, that started to get people's attention.

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:59.820
They sent the engineers in to redo some of
the tolerance.

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.220
They played around with the lubrication a
little bit.

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:11.220
Then Story went in a week later to do his
run and he was able to get most of the tools

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:12.990
out.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:19.030
I think he got all the tools out, actually,
because I was only in for a few hours.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:21.830
Because once we realized that it wasn't working
I came out.

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.790
He was in there.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:29.660
I remember he said at one point just holding
onto these tools my hands are really, really

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:30.160
cold.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.470
I don't know.

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.920
About an hour or so later someone asked him
how his hands were.

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.369
He said oh, they are fine, they've warmed
up.

00:54:36.369 --> 00:54:39.750
Well, Story is from the South.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:44.920
Those of you with experience in winter know
that if your hands are really cold and after

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.920
a while you don't feel them anymore, it doesn't
necessarily mean that they have warmed up.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:53.510
When they took him out of the chamber his
hands were deep purplish black and he had

00:54:53.510 --> 00:55:00.510
severe frostbite to the point where they sent
him up to Alaska to some frostbite specialists.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:03.160
In the end, he was very fortunate.

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:07.190
He got off with no major permanent damage
and was able to fly.

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:10.700
But, as you can imagine, that got serious
management attention.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.270
So, gloves now have electrical heating units
in them.

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:17.080
But we didn't have that available.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:24.080
What we had to do was to change the attitude
profile so that we were basically pointing

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:26.750
towards the earth.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:29.730
Now, that is generally OK.

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:35.470
If you are pointing towards the earth and
the sun is coming from your belly you are

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:42.470
not going to hurt the Shuttle, but a quarter
way around the earth you do have the possibility

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:49.540
now that the sun is going to hit the telescope.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:56.540
What they had to do was to do two attitude
maneuvers every orbit in order to basically

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.580
keep us in a more benign thermal attitude
for the EVA.

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:12.349
But to prevent the sun from shinning on the
telescope.

00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:17.040
And we didn't the reaction control system
propellant budget to support that.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.910
Remember we were going into a high orbit which
meant we needed to use a lot of OMS fuel to

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.990
get up there?

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:26.599
And we needed a lot of propellant for the
deorbit because the higher you are the more

00:56:26.599 --> 00:56:29.520
you have to burn to get down.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:36.520
And so the flight control community, together
with the pilots got together and developed

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:45.460
a special way that we could do maneuvers using
only half the number of jets that you normally

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:46.940
use.

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:53.940
And so this is an interconnection between
the thermal environment of EVA and the reaction

00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:00.109
control propellant budget which nobody in
the early days of flight planning would ever

00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:02.650
have believed that there is this sort of connection.

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:07.710
But it is just another good example of how
these systems all play with one another and

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:11.880
you cannot make changes in one without another.

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.130
I am going to finish this unit and then we
will take a little break and then I will do

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.960
the last part.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.470
The process of getting in the suit.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:24.640
First you get in LTA, lower torso assembly,
basically the pants.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:29.320
And, of course, this is one time when you
can put your pants on both legs at a time.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.910
You cannot do that too often.

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:35.670
But, again, look at the middeck here.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:36.740
It is full.

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:39.760
This, by the way, is the escape pole.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.970
We talked about this earlier.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:48.970
During launch and entry it is actually bolted
into position so that it will take you out

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:55.760
the door, but once you are in orbit you just
sort of float it up and out of the way and

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.800
it just kind of Velcroed to the ceiling.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.980
And, of course, it has no weight up there
so it is perfectly happy.

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.230
You get in the pants.

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:11.109
Now, the upper torso of the suit is attached
to the wall inside the airlock.

00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:14.300
Now you have to float into the airlock.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.390
And that is what you're looking at when you're
getting into the suit.

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:17.950
There are a lot of connections you have to
make.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.619
This is the water bag.

00:58:20.619 --> 00:58:22.830
This is the comm.

00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:26.030
connection for your Snoopy cap.

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:32.530
This is the water and air connection which
you have to hook into your LCBG.

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:34.690
And these are the arms that you have to get
into.

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:41.690
And the problem in the design here is your
shoulders are wider than your chest.

00:58:46.859 --> 00:58:52.900
When you are actually inside the suit you
want the distance between these two arms to

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.170
be conformal with your armpits.

00:58:55.170 --> 00:59:00.060
Because, if it is out here that cuts way down
on your mobility.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:04.650
But if it is too narrow you cannot get into
it.

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:08.359
That is the basic design problem in this sort
of a suit.

00:59:08.359 --> 00:59:15.359
Now, the Russians have a rear entry suit that
doesn't have that problem.

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:19.910
It is always a challenge and you really have
to push and struggle to get in.

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:26.910
Eventually they wanted to design this suit
so that one person could get in by themselves,

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.770
but it cannot be done.

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.770
I mean you can get in like this but you just
cannot pull up the waist ring and attach it

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:38.670
by yourself.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.510
Nobody has been able to do that.

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:46.450
It is a great feeling of accomplishment when
you finally get inside.

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:50.220
Then you put your helmet on.

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.790
Now you're starting to see what we are dealing
with because we have to take all this stuff

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:58.010
outside in addition to the tools that are
already outside.

00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:00.910
These are the plugs which we put the mini
work station.

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:07.910
We haven't put it on quite yet but it is just
a whole bunch of equipment which you have

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:10.230
to manage.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:16.980
At this point we purge the suit with an oxygen
flow.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:23.980
Now, remember, we are at an atmospheric pressure,
or almost an atmospheric pressure, I will

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:31.070
get into that later, of pure oxygen, so that
also puts very serious flammability constraints.

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:35.670
Although, when you go outside, you are only
at 4 psi.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:38.619
When you are inside here you are at the full
cabin pressure.

01:00:38.619 --> 01:00:44.180
Actually, in order to do your leap check you
have to go to 4 psi above cabin pressure.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:50.030
You are actually working at above one atmosphere
of pressure of pure oxygen, so that is a very

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:54.040
serious flammability design constraint.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:01.040
And we have to sit and breathe pure oxygen
then for about 40 minutes to get the nitrogen

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.670
out of our blood.

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:06.810
And, again, I will be discussing this whole
atmospheric and bends problem.

01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:13.560
But, if you don't, when you drop down to 4
psi, the nitrogen in your blood bubbles out

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:20.560
and you get the bends, just like a diver who
comes up too fast from a dive.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:25.540
Just one or two pictures of what went on outside.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.560
There is Hubble.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.099
I was changing some fuels there.

01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:31.609
It was kind of neat working underneath the
solar panel.

01:01:31.609 --> 01:01:34.940
Those were the old ones which we took off
and replaced the next day.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.460
But you have to be really careful because
you don't want to bang against it.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:44.470
And, of course, you cannot see above your
head, so we always have other people looking

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.760
at us.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.640
This is the kind of situation where if you
had a little heads up display where you could

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.960
get this sort of a view to show what you're
really doing it would really improve your

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.140
situational awareness.

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.869
But, at the moment, we don't have that.

01:01:58.869 --> 01:02:04.140
It takes not just the people outside but the
people inside paying full attention, reading

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:04.910
procedures.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:11.910
Historically, we carried all of our procedures
on a cuff checklist, like so.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.970
But the procedures for Hubble and some of
the other flights are so complex that you

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:19.630
just cannot do it.

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:24.250
So, nowadays, these are just emergency procedures.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:25.820
I will pass this around.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:31.490
I would like it back.

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:32.210
Let's see.

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:39.210
After putting in the new Wiff-Pick, ground
had to do some tests on it, so I got Claude

01:02:40.119 --> 01:02:41.950
to fly me out over the arm.

01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:46.099
And we had one of the old Lunar Hasselblad
cameras which they let us carry.

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:53.099
Normally, we just use Nikons on the Shuttle,
but they let us take a Hasselblad.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.930
That gives a view of what the payload bay
looks like EVA.

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:02.140
Here is Story over here working on one of
the other things.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.050
The Earth is not flat, don't worry about the
picture.

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:12.050
I went around it many times.

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:19.270
And, I mean, some parts of EVA, I really should
share it because it just gets really spectacular.

01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:25.140
This is about 50 feet, I don't know whether
to say above or below or whatever of the Shuttle,

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.400
but you're just out there in the middle of
nowhere.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.400
And, at this point, I was the free-floater.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.119
One of the people is always attached to the
end of the arm, which is good when you have

01:03:35.119 --> 01:03:39.760
to move around big pieces of equipment because
now you can react the forces with your feet.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:46.119
When you are a free-floater either you're
in a foot restraint, which limits your mobility,

01:03:46.119 --> 01:03:51.960
or one hand has to actually be holding you
so that you can react forces.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:58.960
Of course, we are attached by a waste tether,
which is then attached to a long real of stainless

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.940
steel.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:09.180
But you can set it so that the springiness
is taken out.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:14.650
And so I could basically, and I did from time
to time, must sort of let go.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:21.650
And it is a really neat feeling because once
you convince yourself that you're not going

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:28.619
to fall down, which I'm enough of a physicist
to understand the orbital mechanics, but,

01:04:28.619 --> 01:04:33.869
nevertheless, the first time I let go it was
an interesting feeling.

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:38.380
The thing is when you're holding onto something,
whether by your feet or your hands, of course

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:44.910
the Shuttle is so much more massive that you
feel yourself physically related.

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:46.450
You are controlled by the Shuttle.

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:49.589
And so the Shuttle is your point of reference.

01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:53.410
Maybe the Shuttle is in orbit but you are
attached to the Shuttle.

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:57.529
As soon as I let go, the physics totally changes.

01:04:57.529 --> 01:05:01.930
And it was really this transformation into
being a human satellite.

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:04.220
I mean I really felt like I was a satellite
now.

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.609
I wasn't attached to the Shuttle.

01:05:05.609 --> 01:05:11.520
And sometimes, if I could turn around before
I let go so I didn't see the Shuttle, it was

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.500
really kind of neat, especially at night,
just sort of floating there and all the stars

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:15.940
and everything.

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:16.260
Yeah.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:22.060
Do they build in time for you to be able to
kind of do that kind of thing?

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.240
No, they don't build in the time.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:31.240
But, like in this case, two days before on
Story's and my last EVA we had replaced -- Not

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.109
replaced.

01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:34.720
These are the magnetometers up at the top.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:41.720
The gross maneuvering of Hubble is done by
reaction wheels, but the reaction wheels,

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:46.500
when they get spinning too fast, you have
to be able to desaturate them so they have

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:52.300
magnetic torquers, these long torque rods
which create a magnetic field.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:58.670
There are no jets on Hubble because it would
cause pollution of the optics, so you need

01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:04.849
magnetometers up at the top to sense the magnetic
field in order to operate the torquers.

01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:08.349
The magnetometers were never designed to be
replaced.

01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:09.609
They weren't supposed to fail.

01:06:09.609 --> 01:06:13.660
Well, both of them failed in the first couple
of years.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:18.950
We couldn't take them off so they designed
two new magnetometers that we could actually

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:21.779
insert and bolt on, on top of the old ones.

01:06:21.779 --> 01:06:27.520
And then we took the electrical and data connections
and hooked them up.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:33.940
But I noticed on that day -- We were very
concerned with quality control.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.270
First of all, that we didn't break anything
that wasn't already broken but also to look

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:45.029
for any signs of damage because, you know,
this was a telescope that was supposed to

01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:47.839
be maintained.

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:51.910
We saw a little bit of paint chipping off
the outside of the old magnetometers.

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:58.029
They were concerned that they might float
around and get into the optics.

01:06:58.029 --> 01:07:04.630
We went into the payload bay the next day,
the other EVA team, and they cut off some

01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:09.490
of this gold insulation material from one
of the thermal enclosures that some of the

01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:11.000
equipment was in.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.330
And I'm not supposed to stand in front.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:18.580
I keep forgetting that.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:24.500
We made those covers, and then we had to go
up and install them.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:31.500
But, actually, after we installed them then
the ground wanted photographic documentation.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.089
We took pictures.

01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:40.180
And then the crew inside got their telephoto
lenses and they took a lot of pictures.

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.500
And then they got the television camera on
the end of the arm to take pictures.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:49.930
And so, during all that time, you do have
a little bit of free time just to sort of

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.050
enjoy the environment.

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:53.960
It would be a shame not to because it is such
a spectacular place.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:54.359
Yeah.

01:07:54.359 --> 01:08:00.490
How do you work when there is not light when
you're on the dark side.

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:03.660
Let me turn the laser pointer on here.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.910
Oh, no, what did I do?

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:12.910
That is a good time for a break, right?

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:18.179
Take a two-minute break.

01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:24.439
And then, of course, when the sun rises you
know it so you can turn your lights off.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:26.670
OK.

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:33.670
I talked about the necessity of doing a nitrogen
purge and pre-breathing oxygen to get the

01:08:34.339 --> 01:08:35.429
nitrogen out of your blood.

01:08:35.429 --> 01:08:42.158
This turns out to be an interesting systems
problem because it doesn't just affect the

01:08:42.158 --> 01:08:47.238
suit, it affects the spacecraft.

01:08:47.238 --> 01:08:51.279
Those of you who were here at the beginning
saw I was blowing up a balloon which unfortunately

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.670
popped.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:59.670
It was only to make the point that you can
look at a spacesuit, the arms and legs, cylindrical.

01:08:59.959 --> 01:09:02.219
It is like one of those balloons.

01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:08.118
And when you try to bend the balloon it doesn't
like to stay bent because you are compressing

01:09:08.118 --> 01:09:14.389
the gas and you're doing elastic work on the
material of the balloon and it wants to snap

01:09:14.389 --> 01:09:14.729
back.

01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:17.190
And spacesuits basically work the same way.

01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:23.618
The old-fashioned pressure suits that test
pilots used to wear, which were the genesis

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:27.399
of the original Mercury suits, they basically
stiffen you.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:31.448
And, in fact, the launch entry suits that
we use on the Shuttle are not designed for

01:09:31.448 --> 01:09:32.259
joint mobility.

01:09:32.259 --> 01:09:35.109
They are just pressurized.

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:41.599
And we do a pressure check before the mission
when we're getting suited up.

01:09:41.599 --> 01:09:47.029
And they blow it up and you just go like that.

01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:50.499
You can move a little bit, you know, enough
so that if you're sitting in your seat with

01:09:50.499 --> 01:09:56.820
a seatbelt holding you in form so that your
waist is bent, you can move your arms enough

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:57.789
to get to the controls.

01:09:57.789 --> 01:10:01.420
But I certainly wouldn't want to try and go
out and do any useful work in that.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:08.420
It has really been an extraordinary design
process that people have been able to develop

01:10:10.019 --> 01:10:13.949
spacesuits with articulating joints.

01:10:13.949 --> 01:10:19.570
I mean it is certainly not like walking around
and doing things just with your body, but

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:24.239
it is amazing how flexible spacesuits are.

01:10:24.239 --> 01:10:30.159
And it is a continual challenge to develop,
particularly for the gloves.

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:34.440
And, when we get back to the moon, to have
legs that can actually walk in so that you

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.179
don't have to hop around all the time.

01:10:36.179 --> 01:10:38.269
Although, there are times when that is good,
too.

01:10:38.269 --> 01:10:45.269
But, in any case, the stiffness of the suit,
because it turns out that most of the stiffness

01:10:47.139 --> 01:10:54.139
comes from compressing the gas, you want to
try, first of all, to build articulated joints

01:10:54.309 --> 01:10:57.190
that don't change their volume.

01:10:57.190 --> 01:11:02.449
And, actually, people have designed metallic
suits that look like Robby the Robot.

01:11:02.449 --> 01:11:07.010
So, they truly are zero delta volume suits.

01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:10.699
The problem is they are very heavy and there
are other problems with metallic suits.

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:15.760
And I don't have time to go into that.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.260
Given that you're going to have some volume
change, the amount of work that you do is

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.699
thermodynamically pressure times volume.

01:11:24.699 --> 01:11:27.309
You are going to have a delta V.

01:11:27.309 --> 01:11:29.389
You want to reduce the pressure.

01:11:29.389 --> 01:11:35.800
The lower your suit pressure, the easier it
is to bend.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:42.679
Basically, you don't want to fill your suit
with any gas that you don't really need.

01:11:42.679 --> 01:11:48.630
We certainly don't need nitrogen to stay alive,
not on a short-term basis, so we fill the

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:52.099
suit with oxygen.

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:57.820
And we run it at about 4.3 psi for the Shuttle.

01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:04.820
This is just historically Mercury, Gemini
and Apollo, the suit pressure was a little

01:12:05.699 --> 01:12:06.079
bit lower.

01:12:06.079 --> 01:12:13.079
Doctors felt, after doing calculations, what
you're really interested in is the partial

01:12:14.469 --> 01:12:16.699
pressure of oxygen in your blood.

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:19.329
And they wanted a little bit more margin.

01:12:19.329 --> 01:12:23.159
Since the Shuttle was supposed to be operational
this and operational that, they wanted a little

01:12:23.159 --> 01:12:25.869
bit more margin.

01:12:25.869 --> 01:12:30.429
And so we bumped up the suit pressure a little
bit.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:37.199
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo cabin was 100%
oxygen at the same pressure so that you didn't

01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:40.340
have to worry about pre-breathing.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:46.329
In Skylab, it was not pure oxygen but it was
a high enough oxygen that, again, they didn't

01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:47.599
have to worry about pre-breathe.

01:12:47.599 --> 01:12:54.599
It wasn't until we went to the Shuttle, which
typically the Shuttle is at 14.7 or 100 kilopascals

01:12:58.869 --> 01:13:02.280
normal atmospheric pressure.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:07.840
If we know we are going to be doing a lot
of EVAs, and I will talk about this later,

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:13.849
what we do is we drop the overall cabin pressure,
but we keep the partial pressure of oxygen

01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:18.699
the same so you end up bumping up the oxygen
concentration.

01:13:18.699 --> 01:13:21.099
We don't do that with the ISS.

01:13:21.099 --> 01:13:28.099
The decision was made by the life scientists
that since they wanted to study biology on

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:35.639
the Space Station and all of our database
is at one atmosphere, that if they took the

01:13:35.639 --> 01:13:42.479
Space Station down to 10.2 psi basically it
would invalidate all of their life science

01:13:42.479 --> 01:13:44.369
research.

01:13:44.369 --> 01:13:47.559
So, the Station was only designed for one
atmosphere.

01:13:47.559 --> 01:13:51.820
The operational people, when they started
to talk about how much EVA was going to be

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:58.300
involved in building and maintaining the Space
Station, the astronauts said this is crazy.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:05.300
And you will see the impact of this later.

01:14:06.889 --> 01:14:08.699
This is just looking in the future.

01:14:08.699 --> 01:14:14.570
These are decisions that are going have to
be made for future space systems, and they

01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:17.860
are looking at a lower working pressure.

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:23.559
And you will see why as I go through this
presentation.

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:28.119
I think I'm not going to go through those
charts.

01:14:28.119 --> 01:14:29.699
Again, this is a system.

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:33.570
So, you are affecting a great many different
things.

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:37.659
Let's see.

01:14:37.659 --> 01:14:44.659
Which is the laser here?

01:14:44.769 --> 01:14:49.300
There we go.

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:56.300
One of the interesting things here with EVA,
just like in any ECLS system, is that the

01:14:57.539 --> 01:15:03.150
human body becomes one of your subsystems
that you have to take care of.

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:07.650
And, in many cases, we don't have a whole
lot of design flexibility with our bodies

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:11.229
because they come predesigned.

01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:15.079
So, we have to deal with that.

01:15:15.079 --> 01:15:22.079
We have all of the physiology, the bends.

01:15:22.639 --> 01:15:22.889
Materials.
I talked about flammability in a pure oxygen
environment.

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:32.820
I talked about the constraints of microgravity
and partial gravity physiology studies in

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:33.829
the ISS.

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:40.829
Of course, NASA has decided that we don't
need to do that anymore.

01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:44.440
And, I guess, our international partners are
still going to want to do this.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.449
In any case, the Station is designed.

01:15:47.449 --> 01:15:53.809
The cooling we talked about, I think, in the
ECLA section lecture, the fact that if you

01:15:53.809 --> 01:15:58.340
drop your cabin pressure now you've got to
pump more air for all the air cooled things.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:05.340
And if you really want a design for a variable
cabin pressure then that flows over into the

01:16:07.959 --> 01:16:14.959
cooling requirements, more water cooling,
different fan requirements and so on.

01:16:15.849 --> 01:16:17.079
And it goes on.

01:16:17.079 --> 01:16:24.079
If you are going to do multiple EVAs, what
you're really interested in, when you're looking

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:33.300
at efficiency, is what we call EVA Work Efficiency
Index.

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:40.300
It is the total amount of time involved in
preparing for and carrying out an EVA, the

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:43.979
ratio of that to the actual useful working
time you get outside.

01:16:43.979 --> 01:16:49.619
And the more time you have to spend breathing
pure oxygen to denitrogenate your blood, that

01:16:49.619 --> 01:16:52.619
is taking away from your overall work efficiency.

01:16:52.619 --> 01:16:58.159
When we do tests on the ground and we start
out at normal sea level pressure and we want

01:16:58.159 --> 01:17:05.159
to go down to 4.3 psi pure oxygen, we actually
have to do a four hour nitrogen purge.

01:17:09.199 --> 01:17:14.760
We have to just sit in the suit or stand in
the suit for four hours, this is in the EVA

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:18.409
test chambers, before we actually can go down
to pressure.

01:17:18.409 --> 01:17:22.749
If you want to get an eight hour work day
of EVA, that is just unacceptable.

01:17:22.749 --> 01:17:28.110
And that is why they made the decision to
lower the Shuttle's cabin pressure.

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.679
Then you only have to do about a 40 minute
EVA.

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:36.459
And I have some of the specific numbers on
that later.

01:17:36.459 --> 01:17:41.289
As I say, just the review here is that we
do have this capability on the Shuttle.

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:44.949
We don't have it on the Station.

01:17:44.949 --> 01:17:49.219
They have figured out a few ways to make the
denitrogenation process a little bit more

01:17:49.219 --> 01:17:54.880
efficient on the Station, but it is still
a big overhead hit.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:01.840
And we are very concerned for the future because
EVA is not just an afterthought when you're

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.380
going to be exploring on the Moon or Mars.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.829
You are going there basically to do EVA.

01:18:07.829 --> 01:18:10.690
Otherwise, why bother?

01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:13.209
We have got to deal with this.

01:18:13.209 --> 01:18:18.699
Here is the basic physiology that we are dealing
with.

01:18:18.699 --> 01:18:25.699
Oxygen percentage on the abscissa, total pressure
on the ordinate and all different units.

01:18:26.479 --> 01:18:33.479
Millimeters of mercury, psi, and I think now
people use kilopascals, which I don't really

01:18:34.639 --> 01:18:35.329
relate to.

01:18:35.329 --> 01:18:39.820
But I know about 100 kilopascals is about
one atmosphere, so luckily that makes it easy.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:46.820
Normally, we are at one atmosphere 20% or
21% oxygen, we are up here, and this is the

01:18:49.829 --> 01:18:53.940
normal sea level equivalent.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:19:00.940
You start dropping the pressure and you have
to increase the percentage of oxygen.

01:19:02.010 --> 01:19:09.010
There is a maximum level of breathing oxygen
at pressure oxygen toxicity because oxygen

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.320
is almost totally absorbed through your alveoli.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:23.320
And normally our alveoli stay inflated because
we have 80% nitrogen which is only very reluctantly

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:25.070
absorbed.

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:28.969
I mean it does get through, that is how it
gets into our blood and so on, but it is a

01:19:28.969 --> 01:19:30.409
much slower transport.

01:19:30.409 --> 01:19:31.909
But oxygen gets right through.

01:19:31.909 --> 01:19:38.909
And if you breathe pure oxygen for a long
time you can really hurt your lungs and it

01:19:40.959 --> 01:19:44.010
can be lethal at a certain point.

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:49.119
We actually don't have any good physiological
data.

01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:51.789
I was down in Houston last week at a big EVA
conference.

01:19:51.789 --> 01:19:53.760
That is why we didn't have class on Tuesday.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:20:00.719
They were talking about what about long-term
planetary EVAs, even at 4 psi pure oxygen,

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:03.329
is that going to be harmful to health?

01:20:03.329 --> 01:20:04.079
We honestly don't know.

01:20:04.079 --> 01:20:10.219
I mean that is an active area which needs
research.

01:20:10.219 --> 01:20:15.689
On the other side, of course you get into
hypoxia which you have all heard of.

01:20:15.689 --> 01:20:19.579
You get it when you go up on Mount Everest
and so on.

01:20:19.579 --> 01:20:26.579
So, you've got a boundary that you have to
work in.

01:20:27.159 --> 01:20:31.939
Now, this is sort of where things have fallen.

01:20:31.939 --> 01:20:34.939
The blue line is the hypoxic boundary.

01:20:34.939 --> 01:20:39.659
The green line is normal oxygen.

01:20:39.659 --> 01:20:45.820
When we were using pure oxygen spacecraft
environments, we were well above that.

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:48.090
You would like to stay as close as possible.

01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:55.090
With Shuttle EVA, we moved a little bit closer
to hypoxic, but we're still in a physiologically

01:20:55.300 --> 01:21:02.300
perfectly reasonable environment.

01:21:02.639 --> 01:21:04.889
Decompression sickness, just a quick review.

01:21:04.889 --> 01:21:06.030
Any scuba divers here?

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:09.489
You are all familiar with this.

01:21:09.489 --> 01:21:16.489
There are various levels of decompression
sickness anywhere from just a mild tingling

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:24.139
of the skin to joint pain to phase three DCS
where you get central nervous system impairment

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:32.489
which can actually cause death, so you don't
want to mess around with it.

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:39.059
People refer to this famous R value.

01:21:39.059 --> 01:21:40.590
You run into this all the time.

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:47.249
What you are really interested in is what
is the ratio between the actual partial pressure

01:21:47.249 --> 01:21:52.900
of nitrogen in your blood compared to your
suit pressure?

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:57.090
And this over here shows this R value.

01:21:57.090 --> 01:22:03.550
If you are down at one the nitrogen isn't
going to bubble out at all so you have no

01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:05.709
incidence of bends.

01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:12.579
VGE, venous gas emboli.

01:22:12.579 --> 01:22:19.579
And then, as the R value increases, the dotted
line gas emboli, that just means you have

01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.909
bubbles forming.

01:22:20.909 --> 01:22:26.099
DCS means actual symptoms of bends.

01:22:26.099 --> 01:22:30.300
And then grade three DCS which is very serious
indeed.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:37.300
The way they make these measurements, they
have these large physiological studies where

01:22:37.389 --> 01:22:42.329
they actually get people to volunteer to go
through these pumped down protocols.

01:22:42.329 --> 01:22:48.659
And then they actually put sensitive microphones
and ultrasound things that can actually hear

01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:51.249
the bubbles as they move around your veins.

01:22:51.249 --> 01:22:56.070
I have never been able to figure out why anybody
would volunteer for these experiments.

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:59.739
I take my hat off to them.

01:22:59.739 --> 01:23:06.300
Because the only way you build up this data
is that some people actually do get the bends

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.170
from these experiments.

01:23:07.170 --> 01:23:12.849
And, of course, they have hyperbaric chambers
which, as soon as there are any symptoms,

01:23:12.849 --> 01:23:17.079
they put them right into the chamber and pump
them to pressure and it goes away.

01:23:17.079 --> 01:23:20.439
And I don't think that they have lost any
volunteers.

01:23:20.439 --> 01:23:26.400
Like I say, that is not something I am going
to volunteer for.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.360
Other factors, this is something that becomes
important.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:36.630
It turns out that the amount of time you spend
at reduced pressure is important.

01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:37.860
Also exercise.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:42.739
It turns out that the more you exercise, maybe
it makes sense, you're moving your joints

01:23:42.739 --> 01:23:45.469
around, but the bubbles come out.

01:23:45.469 --> 01:23:48.579
Actually, what they have started to do on
the Space Station, since we cannot go to a

01:23:48.579 --> 01:23:55.579
reduced cabin, that while they are breathing
oxygen for the first hour or so they do very

01:23:55.590 --> 01:24:01.849
exhaustive exercise, both upper and lower
body on an exercise bike with arm exercise

01:24:01.849 --> 01:24:02.280
as well.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:09.280
To try to drive away as much of the oxygen
early on in the decompression preparation

01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:11.429
as you can.

01:24:11.429 --> 01:24:14.219
OK.

01:24:14.219 --> 01:24:16.900
Where does that put us?

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:22.079
As I said, the more nitrogen you have in your
blood to start out with, the longer a pre-breathe

01:24:22.079 --> 01:24:28.829
you are going to have to do before you can
go out.

01:24:28.829 --> 01:24:32.949
These are the normoxic and hypoxic lines,
which I showed you before.

01:24:32.949 --> 01:24:39.139
And then these are the contours of the amount
of time you have to pre-breathe.

01:24:39.139 --> 01:24:46.139
Remember, I told you if you are at one atmosphere,
20% oxygen, your pre-breathe time is 240 minutes,

01:24:48.139 --> 01:24:49.409
four hours.

01:24:49.409 --> 01:24:53.499
This is to get yourself down to an R value
of 1.65.

01:24:53.499 --> 01:25:00.499
This is not 100% safe because, remember, at
1.65, there still is a 25% incidence of DCS.

01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:15.650
Now, the interesting thing, these are the
statistics that come from the laboratory trials,

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.760
we have never had a reported case of bends
during EVAs.

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.949
And people are not quite sure why.

01:25:25.949 --> 01:25:30.820
Some people suspect that maybe even if an
astronaut is getting joint pain they are not

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:37.539
going to report it because maybe that would
prevent you from doing another EVA.

01:25:37.539 --> 01:25:42.769
I mean there are enough other pains that you
undergo in just using a spacesuit that maybe

01:25:42.769 --> 01:25:44.170
you don't even notice it.

01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:48.579
You feel a problem in your joints or your
fingers and you say oh, damn, my gloves don't

01:25:48.579 --> 01:25:53.789
fit right or something like that.

01:25:53.789 --> 01:25:55.550
I have another slide mentioning this later.

01:25:55.550 --> 01:26:02.550
There is some suspicion that weightlessness
may have an impact, which means that the bends

01:26:04.179 --> 01:26:10.999
susceptibility on the Moon or on Mars may
actually be greater than it is in weightlessness.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:15.579
We just don't know.

01:26:15.579 --> 01:26:18.860
Here is where we have gotten to on the Shuttle
EVA.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:25.389
Again, this is no pre-breathe, this is one
hour pre-breathe, so we are at about 40 minutes

01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:26.329
on the Shuttle.

01:26:26.329 --> 01:26:30.189
That is where we are.

01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:33.630
Now, this is a design problem.

01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:35.260
How are we going to design the CEV?

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:40.039
How are we going to design the equipment,
the habitats that we are going to use on the

01:26:40.039 --> 01:26:43.519
Moon and Mars?

01:26:43.519 --> 01:26:45.539
Now we're talking about surface exploration.

01:26:45.539 --> 01:26:52.539
And, as I said, there is a lot of uncertainty
about the affect of gravity.

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:58.670
But we suspect that it may be more bends inducing
than weightlessness.

01:26:58.670 --> 01:27:05.670
And so what they are doing for safety and
conservatism is instead of using the R value

01:27:07.019 --> 01:27:14.019
of 1.65, which we use on the Shuttle, they
are taking it down to about 1.3, 1.4.

01:27:18.239 --> 01:27:19.499
Now, what does that do?

01:27:19.499 --> 01:27:22.349
Here is 1.4, 1.3.

01:27:22.349 --> 01:27:27.249
Where does that put the Shuttle EVA we now
would have to get down to that R value?

01:27:27.249 --> 01:27:31.530
We have got a two hour pre-breathe.

01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:37.769
To get down to 1.3, we have got a 2.5 hour
pre-breathe.

01:27:37.769 --> 01:27:42.499
And this is with the normal spacesuit at 4.3
psi.

01:27:42.499 --> 01:27:46.369
We are heading an operational problem.

01:27:46.369 --> 01:27:51.949
If you want to go out on your geology traverse
on the Moon, you have got to depressurize,

01:27:51.949 --> 01:27:53.539
denitrogenate for 2, 2.5 hours.

01:27:53.539 --> 01:27:55.110
I don't think so.

01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:56.959
But what are we going to do?

01:27:56.959 --> 01:28:03.959
Well, if you increase the suit pressure now
the R value, at a given level of nitrogen,

01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:07.739
goes down.

01:28:07.739 --> 01:28:14.739
And so at 6 psi, even for an R of 1.3, you
are in the zero pre-breathe range, which would

01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:19.269
be great.

01:28:19.269 --> 01:28:24.599
People have suggested, well, maybe we should
build a variable pressure suit so that you

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:29.360
could go out at 6 psi, sort of get things
set up.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:35.360
And then all that time counts towards your
denitrogenation so maybe then after two hours

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360
into your EVA now you can drop your pressure.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.809
And now, if you have any things where you
need more dexterity, you will be OK.

01:28:41.809 --> 01:28:48.809
But the pressure control system in a spacesuit
is a very complex undertaking.

01:28:49.959 --> 01:28:52.769
The Russians do have a dual pressure suit.

01:28:52.769 --> 01:28:57.380
They never used the lower pressure, to my
knowledge.

01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:00.789
And it is a big hit to try to design this
into the suit.

01:29:00.789 --> 01:29:03.959
And, of course, to design a suit to operate
at a higher pressure.

01:29:03.959 --> 01:29:10.289
The Russians work at about 5 psi, but it means
your suit is less flexible, heavier and is

01:29:10.289 --> 01:29:16.209
just going the opposite direction from the
desire to accomplish useful work, which is

01:29:16.209 --> 01:29:19.439
why you are putting on the spacesuit in the
first place.

01:29:19.439 --> 01:29:23.689
This is what we are working against.

01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:25.030
Again, we have got a systems problem.

01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:26.800
It is not just the pressure.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:30.999
It is the oxygen.

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:37.999
In Skylab, in Apollo, because you were working
in a pure oxygen environment, now, of course,

01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:42.780
we're talking about what is the pressure going
to be in the cabin.

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:48.119
You want to keep the cabin at a higher oxygen
environment.

01:29:48.119 --> 01:29:50.889
Your material selection is highly limited.

01:29:50.889 --> 01:29:54.510
As it says, they tended to use a lot of metallic
materials.

01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:56.599
Well, what do we know about metals?

01:29:56.599 --> 01:29:58.729
Particularly aluminum.

01:29:58.729 --> 01:30:03.229
First of all, aluminum will burn at 100% oxygen.

01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:08.749
But your cabin, even if it is not 100% oxygen,
you are going to have a lot of metallic material.

01:30:08.749 --> 01:30:15.749
Well, metal, when you're dealing with radiation,
you hit metal, aluminum or even higher atomic

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:24.039
number metals with primary cosmic rays and
you get spallation.

01:30:24.039 --> 01:30:26.409
You produce a lot of secondary particles.

01:30:26.409 --> 01:30:30.639
And you end up with actually more radiation
than you would have gotten if you had just

01:30:30.639 --> 01:30:32.869
gotten hit by the incident cosmic ray.

01:30:32.869 --> 01:30:37.699
What you really prefer is to have low atomic
number.

01:30:37.699 --> 01:30:39.579
Hydrogen is best.

01:30:39.579 --> 01:30:42.400
Water, hydrogen, oxygen and so forth.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:48.999
If you are forced to increase the metallic
content of your spacecraft because of the

01:30:48.999 --> 01:30:55.999
oxygen flammability problems now you are going
in the wrong direction for radiation protection

01:30:58.429 --> 01:31:04.309
which becomes an issue when you're dealing
with long duration stays on the Moon, interplanetary

01:31:04.309 --> 01:31:06.380
transport and so on.

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:08.139
So, it is all interrelated.

01:31:08.139 --> 01:31:13.769
You cannot change one thing without changing
the other.

01:31:13.769 --> 01:31:14.030
Flammability.

01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:15.300
Well, we have been talking about that.

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.079
I won't stay on that.

01:31:18.079 --> 01:31:24.249
But, again, it is very dependent on oxygen.

01:31:24.249 --> 01:31:27.010
Oxygen restricts the use of non-metallic materials.

01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:32.170
But nonmetallic materials are what we would
like to use from a radiation point of view.

01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:38.189
You would like to have a lot of hydrocarbons,
you know, polyethylene plastic in your spacecraft

01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:43.070
because they absorb cosmic rays.

01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:49.820
But, in any case, it is pretty well agreed
that we never want to go above 30% oxygen.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:55.189
It just becomes too restrictive on the types
of materials we can use.

01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:56.840
That is going to be a design constraint.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:03.840
And, remember, we are aiming towards a systems
level design of our long duration space habitats

01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:07.039
which are EVA compatible.

01:32:07.039 --> 01:32:09.539
30% oxygen.

01:32:09.539 --> 01:32:11.260
Now we are back to this.

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:13.170
Now we can draw a red line.

01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:15.599
And we have got to stay on the left of that
line.

01:32:15.599 --> 01:32:19.949
We have got to stay above the blue hypoxic
line.

01:32:19.949 --> 01:32:26.949
Now, also remember that we have got these
pre-breathe lines.

01:32:27.429 --> 01:32:31.849
Let's say we are going to limit pre-breathe
to no more than one hour.

01:32:31.849 --> 01:32:35.869
Well, we are cutting down on our design space
here.

01:32:35.869 --> 01:32:40.110
We have got the oxygen flammability which
is cutting off to the right.

01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:44.239
We have got the hypoxic limit which is cutting
off in this direction.

01:32:44.239 --> 01:32:47.869
And we have got the pre-breathe limit which
is cutting off there.

01:32:47.869 --> 01:32:54.869
We are kind of in a, I won't call it a box,
a rather small triangle.

01:32:57.349 --> 01:33:03.869
Now, if we go to a 6 psi spacesuit, as I said,
we open up the design space a lot.

01:33:03.869 --> 01:33:10.019
But at a price of flexibility, maneuverability
and the ability to do the things that we want

01:33:10.019 --> 01:33:14.530
to do in the first place.

01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:16.699
Where are we going to go with this?

01:33:16.699 --> 01:33:19.340
As I say, it is an active area of research.

01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:26.340
I cannot tell you what the answer is going
to be but it looks like they are going to

01:33:30.719 --> 01:33:37.719
probably be going for 8 to 9 psi with an oxygen
concentration approaching 30%.

01:33:39.249 --> 01:33:44.689
And that the CEV, from what I have been told,
is most likely going to be designed with a

01:33:44.689 --> 01:33:48.939
variable pressure capability because it also
has to be able to dock with the Space Station

01:33:48.939 --> 01:33:51.309
which means it has to be able to take one
atmosphere.

01:33:51.309 --> 01:33:58.309
And also, because the CEV by itself is not
going to have an airlock, if you would have

01:33:58.369 --> 01:34:03.689
to do an emergency EVA out of the CEV, for
whatever reason, you are going to have to

01:34:03.689 --> 01:34:10.689
depressurize like we did back in the Gemini
days, or Apollo.

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:17.449
And, of course, that is going to affect the
design of all the other systems on the CEV

01:34:17.449 --> 01:34:24.449
because they will have to be able to operate
from a vacuum all the way up to one atmosphere.

01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:34.010
Just in the end, I hope what you have gotten
out of this is, again, we are trying to look

01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:37.039
at things from a systems engineering point
of view.

01:34:37.039 --> 01:34:43.619
And this is one big system where EVA cannot
be considered just on its own.

01:34:43.619 --> 01:34:50.400
I gave an example of how it affects the RCS
system with Hubble.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.409
Here it affects the environmental control
life support.

01:34:54.409 --> 01:35:01.409
Flammability, radiation protection, it is
all linked together.

01:35:02.639 --> 01:35:09.639
This was the recommendation that we came out
with, slightly below 9 psi pushing 30%.

01:35:10.409 --> 01:35:17.409
But, as I said, there is a lot of research
that has to be done to understand the way

01:35:17.610 --> 01:35:22.478
bends behave at partial gravity.

01:35:22.478 --> 01:35:23.419
How we are going to do that?

01:35:23.419 --> 01:35:30.070
I have no idea.

01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:37.070
As I said, for the International Space Station,
we have to be able to go up to regular atmosphere.

01:35:43.439 --> 01:35:48.429
We were making this presentation as part of
the study we were doing last year on CEV,

01:35:48.429 --> 01:35:53.769
but it was so relevant to what we did here
that I didn't see any point in modifying it

01:35:53.769 --> 01:35:54.419
for this class.

01:35:54.419 --> 01:36:01.419
But we had to make these decisions on the
Shuttle based on similar calculations looking

01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:03.959
at the design space.

01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:10.079
The difference was with the Shuttle we were
using an R value of 1.6, 1.7.

01:36:10.079 --> 01:36:14.860
And so we were able to get down to a 40 minute
pre-breathe.

01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:21.189
What we do with the Shuttle is about the day
before you are going to do your first EVA

01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:25.739
you actually drop the cabin pressure.

01:36:25.739 --> 01:36:31.380
And when we had the lecture on environmental
control, remember there is a cabin pressure

01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:35.309
controller at 14.7 and a pressure controller
at 8 psi.

01:36:35.309 --> 01:36:41.519
But when they designed the Shuttle, nobody
was thinking about EVA or about this pre-breathe

01:36:41.519 --> 01:36:41.800
time.

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.019
And so, there is no 10.2 controller.

01:36:45.019 --> 01:36:46.459
We have to do that manually.

01:36:46.459 --> 01:36:51.099
You drop it and then you add a little bit
of nitrogen or a little bit of oxygen, depending

01:36:51.099 --> 01:36:54.669
on what the instrumentation tells you you
need.

01:36:54.669 --> 01:37:01.559
And then there is a periodic maintenance which
you have to perform in order to keep the proper

01:37:01.559 --> 01:37:07.320
gas concentrations.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:11.209
And then we leave it down there for the duration
of all the EVAs.

01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:18.209
And then, when the last EVA is finished, then
you turn the 14.7 controller back on.

01:37:18.219 --> 01:37:25.219
Now, of course, since you have the proper
oxygen partial pressure, most of the gas that

01:37:27.699 --> 01:37:29.949
comes into the cabin is nitrogen.

01:37:29.949 --> 01:37:34.820
And, actually, I think we may have mentioned
this before, it comes in the bathroom.

01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:41.820
And so, for the time when you are re-pressurizing
the cabin, the bathroom is off limits.

01:37:44.349 --> 01:37:46.030
And I think that is basically it.

01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:51.320
The timing has been pretty good.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:51.929
Questions?

01:37:51.929 --> 01:37:52.369
Comments?

01:37:52.369 --> 01:37:53.249
Yeah.

01:37:53.249 --> 01:38:00.249
Is anybody looking at using a fully one atmospheric
spacesuit?

01:38:06.019 --> 01:38:09.159
Actually, it turns out there is a principle
called holdings principle.

01:38:09.159 --> 01:38:16.159
Let me get this up because I have some pictures
of what we were doing.

01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:38.419
If you change by less than a factor of two
you don't get the bends.

01:38:38.419 --> 01:38:40.939
This is an empirical finding.

01:38:40.939 --> 01:38:47.939
And so, the idea was if you could have a suit
that worked at about 8 psi you would have

01:38:48.010 --> 01:38:49.820
a zero pre-breathe suit.

01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:52.079
And I participated in a bunch of tests.

01:38:52.079 --> 01:38:59.079
These are some other robotic things.

01:39:00.929 --> 01:39:06.439
This was the hard suit designed by Ames.

01:39:06.439 --> 01:39:12.539
Because it is a constant volume suit it is
not sensitive to the pressure the way that

01:39:12.539 --> 01:39:16.269
a soft suit is.

01:39:16.269 --> 01:39:19.739
And we did a lot of tests, actually.

01:39:19.739 --> 01:39:23.550
We always came unstuck on the gloves.

01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:30.550
Nobody has been able to design an 8 psi glove
that really gives you sufficient mobility.

01:39:31.869 --> 01:39:32.939
I mean it is a dream.

01:39:32.939 --> 01:39:34.280
People would love to be able to do it.

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.909
If we could figure it out that would solve
all these problems.

01:39:36.909 --> 01:39:43.909
Although, if you are going to Mars maybe you
don't want full pressure because if you have

01:39:47.159 --> 01:39:54.159
one atmosphere compared to 8 or 9 psi your
structure has to be that much thicker and

01:39:55.469 --> 01:39:55.919
heavier.

01:39:55.919 --> 01:39:58.999
They went through some of those calculations.

01:39:58.999 --> 01:40:01.409
This is now on the hand with the Space Station.

01:40:01.409 --> 01:40:05.789
And they figured that for all the meteorite
shielding and everything they had to put on

01:40:05.789 --> 01:40:11.400
the outside of the Space Station that actually
the change in thickness that would be involved

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.978
in changing the pressure from one atmosphere
to another really wouldn't make that much

01:40:16.978 --> 01:40:18.889
of a difference.

01:40:18.889 --> 01:40:22.789
All of these things, again, they are interrelated.

01:40:22.789 --> 01:40:24.749
But it is a good point.

01:40:24.749 --> 01:40:30.209
That is why I showed those designs for 6 psi
because people are still thinking suppose

01:40:30.209 --> 01:40:33.780
we could design a spacesuit to work at a higher
pressure.

01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:40.780
But right now we don't know how to do that.

01:40:43.019 --> 01:40:45.679
I hope everybody has a very happy Thanksgiving.

01:40:45.679 --> 01:40:48.719
We will see you a week from today.

01:40:48.719 --> 01:40:55.719
And if there are any questions, again, about
either your oral presentations or the written

01:40:57.510 --> 01:41:01.329
presentations, I will be here today.

01:41:01.329 --> 01:41:06.070
And then I am gone for the rest of the week,
but I will be looking at emails so you can

01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:08.599
send me emails and we can discuss things.

01:41:08.599 --> 01:41:08.909
OK.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.560
WILL MA: OK, so today
I'm going to take a more

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.790
empirical approach.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.210
I feel like I've done a lot
of theory in this class,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.730
so today I'm going to
play through the hands

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.190
of an online tourney,
so that I played,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.890
and sort of show you the
most interesting hands

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.314
and show you exactly what I did.

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:40.730
I don't think I'm going to
finish the whole tourney today.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.040
But I'm going to go
through the first part,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.070
and I'm only going to talk about
a few [INAUDIBLE] concepts,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.710
but mostly just go
through the hands.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.510
OK.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.910
So it's a $55 buy-in
tournament on Party Poker.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.330
And it's a fairly small field.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.100
So this is a tournament
I played recently.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.720
OK, so let's just
get into the hands.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.780
I'm only going to show you the
hands where I did something

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.620
at the start.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.430
And we will start with
a bit of theory, OK.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700
So this is the situation.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.450
It's folded to this player and--

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.040
so we have king and queen here.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.290
And it's at hand where
we're in position,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.430
and he raised from
late enough position

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.410
where I think our hand
is too good to fold.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.640
So if Dreams crushed,
if the guy who raised

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.860
was from under the gun, let's
say, then I might have--

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.306
I probably would have folded.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.930
Because against an
under-the-gun range,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.930
king-queen off suit
kind of gets crushed.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.490
But against a range from high
jack minus one or low jack,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.750
I think king-queen is
good enough to play.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.270
But the question is
sort of what do we do.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.260
Do we raise?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.464
Do we call?

00:01:52.464 --> 00:01:54.380
I don't think folding
is the end of the world.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.257
I think it's slightly
profitable to play,

00:01:56.257 --> 00:01:58.340
but it's not like you're
giving up a ton of equity

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.480
by folding this.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.420
So what do we do?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.470
OK, so I'm going to start
out with a bit of theory.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.415
So I haven't really
talked about this.

00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:11.360
I want to talk a bit about
preflop re-raising theory.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.424
So in this situation,
I don't want

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.590
to just talk about what to
do with this hand, right.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.965
This is how
throughout this class

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:18.965
I've been saying we
shouldn't think about poker.

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:21.170
We should always think
about the general situation.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.240
What's the range of
hands we could have?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.010
What's the range of
hands they could have?

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.100
And how should both players
play their overall strategy

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.430
with their entire
range of hands?

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.150
OK, so there's a few interesting
things to think about here.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.550
So there's sort of a dilemma.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.960
So if we think about
our overall strategy--

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.580
so first thing you notice is how
many bets deep is it effective.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.210
What's the stack
size effectively?

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.910
It's about, it's about
28, right, I think.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910
So yeah, we have about
the same amount of chips.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.740
We have like 28
and 1/2 big blinds.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.176
That's clear to everyone?

00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:55.050
So it's important that
it's fairly deep here.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.450
So the stack size, the
effective stack size

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.350
is 28 and 1/2 big blinds.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.780
So what's the issue?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.910
It's sometimes in
this spot, we have

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.100
a hand that's good
enough implied odds

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.510
to play in position.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.377
But it's not really
like a good hand

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:12.710
that we're trying to raise
and make the pot bigger with.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.970
Like an example of this
is like king-jack suited

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.440
or like king-queen off, I
think, is a good example, too.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.860
It's a hand that's
good enough to play,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.235
but not a hand
that's good enough

00:03:20.235 --> 00:03:24.500
that we'd necessarily want to
raise and make the pot bigger.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.960
On the other hand,
sometimes we have a hand

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.720
that you want to raise and hope
you get all-in with, like aces,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.219
right.

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.720
So we have these sort
of two types of hands

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.790
that we want to play
in this situation.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.100
But if we play
according to our hand,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.530
it can become too
predictable, right.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.409
So this is like a somewhat
intuitive strategy.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.450
So you know, let's suppose
this was our strategy.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.774
Let's suppose our strategy
was with the best hands

00:03:46.774 --> 00:03:48.440
that we're hoping to
get an all-in with,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.950
let's say in this spot,
pocket 10s plus and ace-king.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.610
I think that's reasonable
as the set of hands

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.160
we're willing to and
happy to go all-in with.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.620
So pocket 10s plus,
ace-king, and then

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.550
we call with pocket
fives plus, ace-jack off,

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.760
ace-10 suited, king-queen off.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.240
I'd say this is a
reasonable strategy to play.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.260
But what are some
problems with this sort

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.209
of intuitive,
exploitative strategy?

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.600
Yeah?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.860
AUDIENCE: People are just
going to fold to your aces

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.475
and pick up money from you when
you don't have the top hands.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.310
WILL MA: OK, great, yeah, good.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.050
So that's a good point.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.619
So basically, if we only
raise with pocket 10s plus,

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:37.160
people could just
fold pretty easily,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.770
because they know that we have
a great hand whenever we raise.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.640
Good.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.870
OK, what's another issue?

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.570
This one's a bit more subtle.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.289
What's sort of another issue?

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.080
So one issue is when
we raise, it's obvious

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.620
that we have a great hand.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.830
And so on a similar
line, another-- yeah.

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:54.250
I'm sorry, did you--

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.621
AUDIENCE: Yeah, if we call
them, they know we're weaker.

00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:57.620
WILL MA: Right, exactly.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.340
OK, good.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.790
So an almost bigger
issue here is

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.710
if we play like
this, when we call,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.540
people know we can't have aces.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.090
So you know one of the
guys behind, like this guy,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.220
[? Aight ?] might
just be able to raise.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.660
And they're going to know
we're going to be fairly weak.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.500
And we're going to have
to fold most of the time.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.930
So basically, this is not
a really balanced strategy.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.450
So what can we do?

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.080
Well, we could raise
some assortment of hands

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.120
from the call category
to balance it out.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.390
We could call some hands
from the raise category

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.240
a small percent of the time,
like play randomized strategy

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.580
where you raise
aces 80% of the time

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.730
and call aces 20% of the
time to balance it out.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.317
There's some other
more extreme things

00:05:40.317 --> 00:05:42.650
you can do that I don't think
are good in this situation

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.560
but are reasonable when the
stack size is different.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.680
So I think if it's shallow or,
let's say, only 20 big blinds

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.900
deep, then just
raising all hands,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.470
just raising the top X percent
of hands is a decent strategy,

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.160
because 20 big blinds is
sort of shallow enough

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.710
where if you raise,
you're kind of committing

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.210
your whole stack anyway.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.230
And if it's deeper, like if
it's 100 big blinds deep,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.810
some players will like to
call 100% of the hands.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.805
They'll just never raise.

00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:12.680
I don't think it's like
the optimal strategy,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.470
but it's not an
unreasonable strategy.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.230
If you're 100 big blinds
deep, and you have position,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.320
it's not terrible.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.399
And then your range is
completely disguised,

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:23.690
because you're playing all
your hands the same preflop.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.140
So these are some
reasonable solution ideas.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.070
So here's sort of
a better solution.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.430
So this will sound really cool
compared to the previous slide,

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.810
which is instead of raising some
of the call hands as a bluff

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.930
essentially to balance
out the times we raise

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.520
with a good hand, what
if we actually-- we

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.510
bluff-raise the best hands that
aren't good enough to call.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.790
So let me just, so we can
look at this again, right.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.810
So our strategy was
we're raising for value,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.710
aka we're raising,
hoping to get called

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.320
with 10s plus and ace-king.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.820
We're calling with sort of the
pretty good hands like pocket

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.750
fives plus, ace-jack, ace-10
suited, king-queen off.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.280
And then we're going to
bluff-raise hands that

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.760
aren't positive expectancy to
call, so like pocket fours,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.620
ace-10 off, ace-nine
suited, hands

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.040
that are even weaker than the
call hands, but in some sense,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.350
if we bluff-raise
with these hands,

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.860
the benefit is we're sort
of not wasting them, right.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.380
Like let's say with
these better hands,

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.120
like let's say
with ace-jack off,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.850
I raise, and my
opponent goes all in.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.990
Well, I'm probably
going to have to fold

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.140
in this situation for
28 and 1/2 big blinds.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.720
So I sort of like
wasted my ace-jack,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.110
whereas if I did it
with ace-10 instead,

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.860
then I get to call with
my ace-jack, which I know

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.910
is plus EV to call and not waste
such a good hand bluff-raising.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.100
So this is a very
important concept in poker.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.950
It's called polarizing.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.620
And in general, you know,
it's a sound strategy, right.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.900
By this wasting
argument, I'm saying,

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.700
I'm talking about--
polarizing sounds

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.110
like a pretty reasonable
strategy, right.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.526
Because it ensures
that you're not

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:10.130
wasting your medium-strength
hands to bluff-raise.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.700
So what's an issue with it?

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:20.200
It can be exploited if your
opponent calls your three-bet.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.290
So does anyone
actually see, does

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.290
anyone actually see, so
let's say, in this case,

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.720
suppose this was my strategy.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.860
So I'm raising pocket
10s plus and ace-king.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.520
And I'm bluff-raising the
hands that I listed here.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.080
OK, I'll give a $20
gift certificate to you.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.640
So like what's a specific
board, let's say,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.680
where someone can explain
my strategy if this

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.805
was my specific strategy?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.830
This is just for illustration.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.810
So look at my exact
range, and can someone

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.025
say sort of what's a very
bad flop for my range?

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.330
Yeah.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.756
AUDIENCE: If flop's high
cards, because they'll

00:09:06.756 --> 00:09:09.350
be thinking your range
is generally high cards,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.830
but those are a bit lower.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.040
WILL MA: Right, so if
there's high cards,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.670
but we do have lots
of aces and kings.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.090
Like if the flop comes,
like if there's an ace,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.740
then it's pretty
good for our range,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.170
right, even though they
might be able to fold easily,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.260
but we're still
going to win the pot.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.375
But what is like a specific,
what's a specific issue-- yeah.

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:32.500
AUDIENCE: Well, if five,
six, seven, or in between.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.070
WILL MA: OK, good, so five, six,
seven is kind of bad for us,

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:35.570
right.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.590
Because our range
basically contains

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.460
no fives, no sixes, no sevens.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.700
But even five, six, seven, we
still have like a bigger pair

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.600
quite often.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.110
So what's like an
even worse case?

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.980
Yeah.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.297
AUDIENCE: High flush draw
or a high straight draw.

00:09:50.297 --> 00:09:52.130
WILL MA: Yeah, but we
can have those, right.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.640
We have ace-nine
suit in our range.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.240
We got king-10
suited in our range.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.550
AUDIENCE: So then like a low
pair, like four-four or eight.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.670
WILL MA: Yeah, we don't
have fours or eights,

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.520
but you know on those
boards, like pocket jacks,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.110
even like ace-king high is a
pretty good hand and pocket

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.634
jacks.

00:10:08.634 --> 00:10:10.550
There's something very
specific we're missing.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.140
I mean this is just for
this example, but yeah.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.009
AUDIENCE: Maybe
a pair of queens.

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:17.050
WILL MA: Right, OK, good.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.758
So that's sort of what
I was looking for.

00:10:18.758 --> 00:10:20.740
You can come get
this now if you want.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.660
Essentially, suppose this
was our exact strategy.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.640
If the board comes queen
high, then essentially they

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.400
know that our range is pretty
bad, because we don't ever

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.080
have a queen.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.120
I mean we could
have kings or aces,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.350
but all of our other pairs are
going to be smaller than queen.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.610
So I mean this is just
a specific example,

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.962
but I'm saying polarizing
is, in general,

00:10:43.962 --> 00:10:45.920
a good concept by this
argument that you're not

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.870
wasting your good hands.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.810
But it can be exploited
if your opponent knows

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.300
the specific way in
which you're polarizing,

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.029
and they just call your
reraise and see the flop.

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:58.070
And they'll be able to
play very well on the flop

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.510
still, even if you have some
good hands and some bluffs.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.290
It can also be bad against
unpredictable opponents,

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.860
because by the ace-jack,
ace-10 argument again,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.060
let's say you
three-bet with ace-10

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.429
instead of ace-jack as
an attempt to polarize.

00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:16.220
But let's say your
opponent is kind of bad,

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.990
and they might make a loose call
in this situation with ace-10.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.680
Then you would have
really hoped to have

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.550
ace-jack instead of
ace-10 if they're going

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.190
to call your raise with ace-10.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.140
So if you're
polarizing, you're sort

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.000
of assuming your opponent
is going to play reasonably.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.330
So the point is the
reason why I don't

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.460
want to sort of waste
ace-jack by raising

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.920
is because my opponent's
probably going to fold ace-10.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.600
But what if they
might call ace-10?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.669
Then I really would have wished
I reraised with ace-jack.

00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:48.210
OK, the short answer
is I'm not going

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.620
to give a conclusive formula
on how to play this situation,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.750
because the short answer
is it's complicated.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.150
And I don't think anyone
essentially knows what

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.520
the optimal strategy is yet.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.620
But in practice, I think
just raising a mix of hands

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.880
from the call category,
mostly the off-suit hands

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.180
which have worse
implied odds, is

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.180
pretty good as part of
your bluff-raising range.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.830
And calling the best hands
from the raise category,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.640
like aces, like trapping a
small percent of the time,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.210
just calling aces maybe
a fifth of the time,

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.750
so that sometimes you
have it when you call,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.670
so that people can't just
reraise when you call.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.584
And also raise some
of the best hands

00:12:27.584 --> 00:12:28.750
that aren't plus EV to call.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.200
So polarize a bit.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.034
Essentially, the short
answer is it's complicated.

00:12:34.034 --> 00:12:35.450
You need to do a
bit of everything

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.280
with all sorts of hands.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.700
But I just wanted to sort of
talk about how complicated

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.560
this situation can be.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.290
All right, so OK, so let's
get back to the hand.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.360
So what I decided to
do here was following

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.910
the thing I said about
reraising with off-suit hands,

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:57.050
I decided to, so I decided
to raise here to 555.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.910
And so I think this is
about the right sizing,

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.110
because we're making it
about 2.5 times his raise.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.000
And essentially
we're bluffing here.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.380
And our hand is
good enough where

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.270
it's not the end of
the world if they call,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.540
because we have a lot of
chances to hit top pair.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.250
And if we do, we're
probably good,

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.440
because they're
probably going all in

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.330
with ace-king or
ace-queen preflop.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.990
But essentially we're bluffing.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.700
I'm definitely hoping
he folds, and he does.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.020
So OK, we take down the pot.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.370
OK so the very next
hand, I actually

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.164
just noticed this
during, when I was

00:13:32.164 --> 00:13:33.330
replaying through the hands.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.070
So I didn't notice this.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.610
I didn't notice this during
the tournament actually.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.260
So what do you notice?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.484
We're actually in the exact
same situation again, right.

00:13:43.484 --> 00:13:44.650
But we have different cards.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.941
So it's good that we thought
about our overall strategy

00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:48.540
when we played that
hand, because you

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.130
will end up in
the same situation

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.380
again with different cards.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.900
OK, so along the same lines--

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.270
but at the time I was probably
playing like 15 tables or more.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.245
So I wasn't really
paying attention.

00:14:01.245 --> 00:14:03.495
I probably didn't remember
that I reraised my opponent

00:14:03.495 --> 00:14:04.710
the hand before.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.650
But playing through
this, it actually yielded

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.440
a really good result.
Because what happened was

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.560
they didn't believe my three-bet
the second time around,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.740
and they went all in
with pocket sevens.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.960
It's not a terrible hand,
but it's definitely,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.551
I think, a weaker hand than they
would usually go all in there

00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:22.050
with.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.630
But I guess they didn't
believe my reraise

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.070
after the previous hand.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.010
So this also sort of
illustrates the importance

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.650
of like you said, of sometimes
having a bad hand when

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.830
you reraise, so that
people will give you

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.330
action when you do have a
good hand like pocket jacks.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.290
OK, so let's go on.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.880
I'm only playing
through the hands

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.410
that I essentially played at
the start of the tournament.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.130
So we doubled up.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.540
The starting stack was 3,000.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.340
We've got 6,000 now.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:58.530
We get ace-queen, we raise,
and we get called here.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.260
And here, this guy makes it--
so this is a different player,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.600
because we eliminated the
guy who used to sit here.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.870
And they make it 755.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.990
I decide to fold here.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.700
I think ace-queen offsuit
is just a bit too weak.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.080
I think going all in is--

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.580
it wouldn't be
terrible, but I think

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.910
when we raised from
fairly early position,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.260
under-the-gun plus one.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.660
And this high jack called.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.550
They're not going to be doing
this as a bluff very often.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.380
And their reraise to 755 I
think usually commits them.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.560
It's not guaranteed that they're
going to go all in if we--

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.420
they're going to call
us if we go all in.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.000
But I think most
likely they will,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.500
and they're going to
be ahead of our range.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.160
So I decide to fold.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.470
It's a fairly tight fold.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.195
So it is a stack.

00:15:44.195 --> 00:15:46.320
I'm just going to continue
playing through my hands

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.153
from the tournament.

00:15:47.153 --> 00:15:51.822
If you have any questions,
just stop me and ask.

00:15:51.822 --> 00:15:53.780
So this is sort of a
weird hand, and I actually

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.640
think I played this
hand quite terribly.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.270
So this guy calls, which
I said we should never do,

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.150
but I guess he
doesn't take my class.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.270
We get queen-10 here.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.460
We check, we see a flop.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.490
So we flop two over cards,
a backdoor flush draw

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.640
and a gutter straight draw.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.570
So I decide to lead into it,
sort of lead my draws out,

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.920
hope he folds.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.490
He calls, and the
turn is a three.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.980
And then here, so this
is where I sort of,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.390
he decided he suffered at me.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.570
So I talked about how he
should only be doing this

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.690
if he doesn't respect me.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.390
Because I mean in
this case, it's

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.050
not a completely insignificant
fraction of the pot.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.290
It's like one sixth.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.350
So he is actually getting
some substantial payment

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.460
into the pot, but it's
still fairly small.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.490
And the main thing it
does is it gives me

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.400
an opportunity to check-raise.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.820
But I'm not going to.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.020
I don't think they're
going to fold often enough.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.580
There's a lot of draws
they're going to call me with,

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.663
and I'm going to have to
bluff again on the river.

00:16:52.663 --> 00:16:55.807
So I decide to just call,
which is reasonable.

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.890
So this is where I think
I played the hand poorly.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.470
So the river completes
a lot of draws,

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.130
but it doesn't complete my hand.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.730
And I just check it down.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.430
I just check it,
which at the time

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.329
I didn't lead out, because
I thought the fact that I

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.220
only called the turn
and suddenly decided

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.680
to bet big on the river
would probably get called.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.319
But I think it's just not a
balanced way to play the hand,

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:21.170
because plenty of times
I will have clubs,

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.300
or I'll have jack-10
or something.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.819
I'll have a jack, and I
will want to bet for value.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.040
And here when I have a
hand that essentially

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.010
has no chance of winning
the hand at showdown.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.320
Like essentially, I'm
giving up the pot for sure

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.930
if I check, because my queen
high will never be good.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.700
I should definitely be bluffing.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.580
So I didn't, which I regret,
because I let him take down

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.220
the pot with a pair of threes.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.220
Yeah, I guess he kind of
played that hand well.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.440
He called eight-three suited.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.810
I guess he made money from
me, because I didn't play

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.760
very well from the big blind.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.610
OK so the next hand, we
get king-jack offsuit here.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.710
We open, probably one
of the weakest hands

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.180
I'm opening from this position.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.944
I think probably in
my recommendations,

00:18:03.944 --> 00:18:05.360
this is not in the
list you should

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.930
open from, high jack minus one.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.390
But I decide to open,
because I'm bored I guess.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.250
And we get three callers.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.190
OK, so the flop is four,
six, four with two hearts.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.200
So I decide to
continuation bet here.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.000
I think it's a
fairly marginal spot.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.400
I think just giving up is OK.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.390
I definitely wouldn't
have stabbed at the pot

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.520
if I didn't have
the King of Hearts.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.820
But the fact that I have a
backdoor pretty good flush

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.840
draw, I decided to bet and
just hope that everyone folds.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.960
And we do get that
which is pretty nice.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.167
OK, so you know our stack is
hovering around the same size.

00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:49.750
We won some hands
and lost some hands.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.310
It's still early
in the tournament.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.830
The blinds have gone up a
bit, but it's still far away

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.560
from the payouts.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.240
OK, so we get we
queen-jack on the button.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.705
And this guy just goes
all in for a lot of bets.

00:19:04.705 --> 00:19:05.830
I guess it's not that many.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.350
It's like 35.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.770
No, sorry, it's-- yeah, it's
it's about 30, 35 right.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.540
So I fold here obviously.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.940
But I thought a bit
about his range,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.310
and you know it's possible
his range is like entirely--

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.390
so I talked about this
in a previous class.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:28.900
When do you want to be going
all in for a huge size?

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.260
It's essentially what hands
that are pretty good to get all

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.550
in with preflop but have
terrible post-flop implied odds

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.730
in this situation.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.200
And what were the
hands I listed there?

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.510
It's essentially small
pairs, like pocket twos,

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.020
you really don't
want to see a flop.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.427
It's quite a good hand
preflop but you really

00:19:47.427 --> 00:19:49.510
don't want to see a flop,
because it's pretty much

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.340
always three higher
cards are going to come,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.631
and you're just going to be
playing this guessing game,

00:19:53.631 --> 00:19:55.690
trying to guess whether
your opponent has a pair.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.230
And the other type of hand
is like ace-two offsuit

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:03.135
where once again, you have an
ace preflop which is decent.

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:05.260
But you're just going to
be playing a guessing game

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.280
on most flops.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.180
So you know probably if I had
a very strong read on him,

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.300
and if I had
jack-10 suited here,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.030
calling is maybe not that bad,
because you're like a coin

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.650
flip against ace-two offsuit.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.560
And you're like 54% favored
against pocket threes.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.462
So I folded here, because
my hand isn't suited,

00:20:23.462 --> 00:20:25.420
and just because there's
a small chance they're

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.420
going to have ace-queen.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.640
And my read was nowhere
near strong enough

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.500
to conclude that for sure.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.645
There range was only
small pairs and a six.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.770
OK, so we lose a bit of chips.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.630
We're blinding down a bit.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.450
Here we get 10-2 suited, so I
call from the big blind with 4

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.372
and 1/2 to 1 odds.

00:20:45.372 --> 00:20:47.830
I think this is probably one
of the weakest hands I'd call.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.572
I might not call eight-two
suited although it's close.

00:20:50.572 --> 00:20:53.030
I mean, you could make a case
for calling eight-two suited.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.700
So once again, my
odds were really good,

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.800
but the reverse implied odds
do sort of work against me

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.080
quite a bit since I'm going
to be out of position,

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.240
and I have small cards
which will usually

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.480
make a smaller pair than them.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.520
But I decide to call, and
we flopped a flush draw,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.820
which is pretty good.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.030
But I'm still going
to check, because this

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.820
is a board where I'm just going
to check to the pre-flop raiser

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.710
and let them continuation bet.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.320
So I talked about leading
in an earlier class,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.440
and I don't think
this is a board where

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.780
we should be leading.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.340
I think never leading
is OK as well, so.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.830
I decide to check,
and they check back.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.700
So we turn the flush,
which is great.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.760
We bet 600 into 1080.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.210
So unfortunately, we
don't get any action.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.080
So we take it down.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.730
So for the next--

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.220
I think this is one
more a bit later.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.400
So under-the-gun raises,
small blind queue

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.640
is very, very short.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.430
He only has 7 and
1/2 big blind calls.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.530
And we decide to
call with our 7--

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:07.400
with our 6 and 1/2 to one
odds here, or six to one odds.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.010
So we flop queen, jack, five.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.650
So we have second pair with
a backdoor straight draw

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.900
and a backdoor flush draw.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:20.360
And the small blind goes
all in for 1054 into 1380.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.030
So this is sort of I
think a pretty close spot.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.850
I think if I knew for
sure that Arden1977

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.360
didn't have a hand here, I think
calling is definitely fine.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.220
We're given about
2.3 to one odds.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.680
And I think second pair
with these backdoor

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.114
draws is more than good
enough against his range.

00:22:40.114 --> 00:22:41.780
Because I think his
range will mostly be

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.050
draws and top pairs and second
pairs, probably not bottom pair

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.920
that often, because
they did call preflop

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.680
from the small blind,
which I don't expect

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.010
most players would do with a
hand like seven-five suited.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.310
So we're not even that happy
to call him to be honest,

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.500
but I probably would call.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.320
But the fact that this
guy here is behind,

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.490
and they could raise,
or they could call,

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.880
and we'd have to make more
decisions on future streets,

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.170
I think really hurts us.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.330
And I think we
should have folded.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.137
At the time I decided to call.

00:23:15.137 --> 00:23:17.470
I don't know why, but I don't
think this is a good play.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.090
I think it's just too
risky essentially.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.700
It'll work most of the time.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.200
Because most of the
time [? Arton ?]

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.570
will fold, because
they're going to see

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.960
two players putting money in.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.180
But the times where
they do have something,

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.300
I'm going to have to fold,
and it's going to suck.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.630
So we do call.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.140
They actually had
the same hand as us.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.532
It worked out well.

00:23:37.532 --> 00:23:38.990
I guess we sort of
took a bad beat,

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.570
because we could've made a
flush, and they couldn't have.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.640
We were technically ahead,
but we get half the pot.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.620
So I'm not going through
my tournament history

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.820
from one month ago and saying
I played every hand perfectly.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.710
When I look through
here, I definitely--

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.496
there's a lot of mistakes.

00:24:01.496 --> 00:24:03.370
There's a lot of hands
I wish I could replay.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.540
So this hand, I guess,
is fairly simple.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.360
So we have ace-king, and I think
it's definitely good enough

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.980
to get it all in here with.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.107
So as far as what my
range is I think--

00:24:18.107 --> 00:24:22.112
[INAUDIBLE] I think-- sorry.

00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:23.320
Did you have a suggestion or?

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.780
AUDIENCE: Oh, no, no, I
just saw this guy's handle,

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.615
and I thought it was funny.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.132
OK, so you thought it was who?

00:24:36.132 --> 00:24:38.340
AUDIENCE: Funny.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.590
WILL MA: Sorry, sorry.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.560
OK.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.440
No, yeah, don't ask
me what my hand means.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.370
My handle is--

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.550
AUDIENCE: What does it mean?

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.631
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:48.880
WILL MA: I can't even read it.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.050
I think it stood for something.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.790
I probably made it
when I was like 17,

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.170
and I think it
stood for something.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.550
I probably don't remember
what it stands for, OK.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.909
So we go all in here.

00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:07.450
So this is sort of
a no-brainer hand,

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.620
but let's stop and think a bit
about what our range should be.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.100
So I think with ace-king,
ace-king and pocket tens,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.050
I think it's fairly
easy get it all in.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.660
I think with ace-queen
suited, I would get it in.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.460
I think if I had ace-queen
offsuit, I would probably fold.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.120
Although with ace-queen suited
actually if this Jet Ski Fun

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.810
guy had as many chips as us,
then maybe I would have folded.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.060
But the fact that we're
actually not risking

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.650
our entire 6250 against the
two players who are in the pot

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:41.700
is very relevant.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.310
Because [? Armond ?] covers
us, and they could in theory

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.330
pick up pocket aces.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.490
But it's much less
likely for them

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.280
to pick up pocket aces
than this Jet Ski Fun

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.602
guy who's already in the pot.

00:25:51.602 --> 00:25:53.310
So the fact that they
may have [? SEAM ?]

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.550
less than 20 big blinds as
well helps our case a lot.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.450
So I would probably get it
in with ace-queen suited plus

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.300
and then pocket
nines plus, probably,

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.510
is what I would get
it in with here.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:14.340
So we go all in, and we beat
ace-jack, which is good.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.445
So I think ace-jack is
slightly on the loose side.

00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:19.820
I mean, I think it's a fine
play definitely to get it all

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.457
in with ace-jack, but
maybe they could have--

00:26:23.457 --> 00:26:25.540
because they do have more
than 20 big blinds here.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.220
So I think maybe they could have
considered calling or raising

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.340
small and folding if someone
like us entered the pot.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.860
But nonetheless, I think
they played their hand fine.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.680
OK, so the next hand
we have a pocket nines.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.664
So [? Manny, ?]
this guy, raises.

00:26:41.664 --> 00:26:44.080
So we're getting deeper now,
because we won the last hand.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.560
So now we've got, we've got
40 big blinds, and we call.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.530
This guy also calls
and [? Liamkid ?]

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.580
goes all in for 30 big blinds.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.290
So they get out of the way.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.540
I think this is actually
a very close spot.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.640
I do think one big
incentive to get

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.990
it all in is I
think it's not that

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.039
likely that [? Liamkid ?] has
pocket kings or pocket aces.

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:10.580
Because I think
there's a good chance

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.220
they would just raised smaller,
maybe, to try to sucker people

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:14.720
in.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.850
So I actually think I'm not
losing to too much here.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.150
And same with [? Armond. ?]
I think it's also very hard

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.691
for [? Armond ?] to
have a good hand.

00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:23.510
So even though in
the first example,

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:28.040
we talked about how sometimes
calling with pocket aces

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.349
here is a good play, but you
know, I said if one guy raised,

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:33.140
and you're the second
guy, you should maybe

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.840
call with pocket aces
like 20% of the time.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.880
When it's two guys who have--

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.330
like when it's one guy who
has raise, me who has called,

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.570
and now you're deciding
what to do with pocket aces.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.870
Instead of 20% you should be
calling, it's literally like,

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.350
maybe like 2% or 1% we should
be calling with pocket aces.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.770
So if you multiply
1% by the probability

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.130
of getting dealt pocket aces,
which is around one in 200,

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.590
it's literally like
one out of 20,000

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.320
that he has pocket aces here.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.000
So I'm not too afraid of him.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.380
So I really think
getting it in is fine.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.910
But at the same time, I don't
think I'm ever a favorite here.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.640
I think their range is
essentially ace-king,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.570
ace-queen, maybe ace-jack
suited, and then, essentially,

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.720
pocket 10s, pocket nines,
pocket jacks, pocket queens,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.370
maybe occasionally
pocket eights.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.070
So I could have done an
exact equity calculation

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.229
on PokerStove.

00:28:26.229 --> 00:28:28.520
If I did, it probably would
have been very, very close.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.080
But I decided to fold, and
they take down the pot.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.770
OK, so the next hand
we get a ace-jack.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.320
We raise from under-the-gun.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.150
This guy goes all in
for six big blinds.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.650
We're basically
committed here, even

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.870
if we think he's crushing us.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.350
So I call, and we
lose to ace-king.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.960
Not really too much
we can do here.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.930
Although this does
illustrate one concept, which

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.280
is when there are stacks
behind like [? Zarbizan ?] who

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.410
are short enough that they can
commit you by going all in,

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.930
you should be slightly
less incentivized to open

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.040
speculative hands here.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.520
Like say I had 10-nine suited,
I think while normally I

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.450
would consider opening 10-nine
suited here as a steal.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.540
It's a huge disincentive to
steal here with 10-nine suited

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.520
when someone like
[? Zarbizan ?] can just

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.640
pick up even a hand as
weak as ace-jack suited

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.430
or ace-jack offsuit and go all
and beat our 10-nine suited.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.800
But ace-jack is more than good
enough to still raise here.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.910
We unfortunately
run into ace-king.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.210
Next hand we get ace-jack again.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.800
The same guy who just doubled
up through us goes all in,

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.900
and here I call him.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.810
Because even though
there's more chips,

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.760
the positions are a lot
later, and specifically,

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.676
they went all in for
14 big blinds when

00:29:57.676 --> 00:29:58.800
no one else was in the pot.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.580
So their range is, their
range isn't super duper wide,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.120
but it's definitely wide
enough that ace-jack I'm

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.160
happy to call here.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.150
As far as what my
range is, I think

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.650
I wouldn't call
with ace-10 offsuit,

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.270
but I would call
with ace-10 suited.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.650
So probably ace-10
suited, and I think

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.360
I'd call with king-queen suited
but not king-queen offsuit.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.820
And the smallest
pair I get it in with

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:31.092
is probably pocket sixes, I
think, maybe pocket five is OK.

00:30:31.092 --> 00:30:32.800
Yeah, probably pocket
fives is too loose,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.716
probably pocket sixes.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.300
So we call.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.160
So unfortunately, we
lose to king-10 suited.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.110
So he doubles up
through us again,

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.845
and we're kind of short now.

00:30:44.845 --> 00:30:46.210
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.120
On that last hand, why
go all in yourself?

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.641
Why not just call his all in?

00:30:50.641 --> 00:30:51.890
WILL MA: Oh OK, good question.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.020
So yeah, this is
a good question.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.020
So in this case, the
two plays I'd say

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.300
are fairly close to equivalent.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.130
Because OK, so what's
the defense, right?

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.170
They're going to be
the same almost always,

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.384
because Check Raise
is just going to fold.

00:31:05.384 --> 00:31:07.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:09.050
So what's the difference?

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.930
The difference is if
we don't go all in,

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.810
then Check Raise let's say,
he picks up aces, right.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.570
Then he can just go all in, and
we're basically forced to call

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.620
him, because we can't--

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:22.480
if we put in 4,118,
and they go all in,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.240
we can't really fold
for only 3,000 more.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.060
We can't really fold preflop
with four to one odds.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.350
AUDIENCE: Would that change
if you're the big stack?

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.720
If like, you had the Check Raise
stack, and he had your stack?

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.500
WILL MA: Oh yeah, for sure.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.791
Yeah, that's a very good point.

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:34.490
Yeah, for sure.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.450
So if we had the same
stack as Check Raise here,

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.650
I would just call.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.436
And then if Check Raise goes
all in, I would probably fold.

00:31:41.436 --> 00:31:43.810
But I mean, I'm also going to
call here with pocket aces,

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.050
so they can't just look down
at pocket twos and go all in

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.440
and bully me around.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.440
So my strategy if
we had their stack

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.630
would be to call my entire
range that I plan on playing.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.940
But in this case, the
only thing calling does

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.330
is it gives him more options.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:02.200
Like let's say they had a
very marginal situation,

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.090
like let's say they
had king-queen suited.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.970
I think if I only
called, they could maybe

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.580
argue for calling themselves
with king-queen suited

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.630
and seeing a flop.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.550
Whereas if I go all in,
I think they're forced

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.200
to fold king-queen suited.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:13.990
AUDIENCE: Basically,
you have a better chance

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.242
at making him fold.

00:32:15.242 --> 00:32:15.950
WILL MA: Exactly.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:17.370
I'm just giving
him fewer options.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.700
But it's very, very marginal.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.810
It affects it basically
specifically for me

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.090
the king-queen suited, like it
effects basically for one hand

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.040
or maybe like two
or three hands.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.110
But you might as well
minimize the options

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.410
you give your opponent.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.940
Yeah, like I'd say the
minimum stack size I would

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:44.910
need before I call instead
of go all in with is maybe,

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.100
I think maybe like 13,000.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.530
I think at 13,000,
it's sort of more

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.835
than I want to risk
against the pot.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.760
So now we're kind of short.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.030
So we blind out for a bit.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.986
We don't get cards.

00:32:59.986 --> 00:33:01.860
And when you don't get
cards in a tournament,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.260
there's not really much you
can do other than blind down,

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.390
not just go all in with
crap and just lose.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.100
So we blind down
for a bit, but we're

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.467
fortunate to pick up kings.

00:33:11.467 --> 00:33:12.800
So this is sort of a no-brainer.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.380
We go all in.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.130
There's no point
trapping, because they're

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.780
guaranteed to call us.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.910
And we get called by ace-five,
and we win, which is good.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.230
The next hand we get
eight-seven offsuit,

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.160
and against a button raise,
I think calling is fine.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.340
I think their range is just
going to be wide enough, where

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.620
even though the reverse
implied odds, once again,

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.390
really don't work in
our favor, we just

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.630
have to sort of realize
the equity from 4 and 1/2

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.450
to 1 odds, so I'm going to call.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.630
So we flop nothing.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.810
I'm planning to just check-fold.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:49.440
So I check.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.970
They check back.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:51.840
The turn's a four.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.430
Once again, we have nothing.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.250
I could bluff here, but
I figure I'm not really

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.050
looking to make a big
bluff with this hand,

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.720
because I have no draw, no pair.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.500
There's no point.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.000
But I will probably look to
make a bluff on the river

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.090
if they also check,
just because whenever

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:10.830
you have no chance of winning
the pot and it's the river,

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.071
then making a bluff
is not unreasonable.

00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:14.820
But in this case,
bluffing is kind of bad,

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.659
because with any club,
they might just call me.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:21.400
Because any club is going
to have some equity.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.150
So I check.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:23.114
They check back.

00:34:23.114 --> 00:34:25.030
The river is a fourth
club, which is, I think,

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.590
a pretty good card for me.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.800
Because I can easily represent
a small club, and if I did

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.179
have a small club, I am
definitely value betting.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.389
So it's a pretty good
card for me to bluff,

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:38.130
and they're probably going
to have to fold king high.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.480
So I bet, and I don't
think I bet fairly big.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.650
I'm just looking
for a size where

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.420
they have to fold
sometimes, and they'll

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:49.659
have to pay me off sometimes
when I have a small club.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:54.010
So they raised me here,
which is pretty weird.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.540
I still don't really have a good
idea of what I think he has.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.110
I mean I'm certain
they have me beat.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.679
You know so I just fold.

00:35:02.679 --> 00:35:04.720
We could think a bit about
doing something crazy,

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.210
like go all in, but it
would just be weird.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.640
I think it's unnecessary.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.840
We've got nothing.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.697
So I just fold.

00:35:10.697 --> 00:35:11.530
I don't really know.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.750
Maybe they just had like
a slow played flush.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.090
It's possible they had like
a king high flush here.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.460
And they slow-played the flop.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.830
They decided to
slow-play the turn again,

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:24.370
because the turn sort
of didn't hit anybody.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:25.990
Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.460
So I fold here.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.800
I mean, it's possible
they just had a high club.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.510
But I feel like
with a high club,

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.820
they should have
bet at some point,

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.840
just because a good flush
draw is just as enough equity.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.170
But nonetheless, I
guess we'll never know.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.420
That's one benefit of calling.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.030
You get to find out
what your opponent had.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.980
So the next hand,
we have queen-jack.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.070
We've got 12 bets.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:49.870
I just go all in.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.420
12 is around the cut
off, like I said,

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.270
12 is sort of the cutoff where
if you have 12 bets or less,

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.620
instead of raising,
just go all in.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.680
And that's what we do.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.390
So we get called, but--

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.180
so this is actually
a pretty sick board.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.710
Yeah, so they
flopped a full house,

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.704
but we rivered a
higher full house.

00:36:06.704 --> 00:36:07.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.360
Yeah, it's sort of a
waste, because normally

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.570
if this happens, you can win
like 100 big blinds from them

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:14.500
probably.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.700
But instead we only won
how many, eight big blinds.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.280
So it's sort of a
waste but whatever.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:28.250
OK so the next hand,
I got pocket fives,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:33.330
and we raise to a thousand.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.440
And [? Liamkid ?]
goes all in again.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:40.000
And you know, it's irritating,
but once again, I have to fold.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.890
I think I just--

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.290
I don't have enough equity
to call, given his range.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.980
Once again it's a situation
where it's a fairly big all in.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.190
So I could maybe not
put them on aces,

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.360
although given that
they've done this once,

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.870
they're more likely to just do
this with their entire range

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.820
and play a strategy
where they're just

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.110
going on preflop a lot.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.240
So maybe they could have
aces in their range,

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.260
but nonetheless, regardless, I
think it's not even that close.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.950
I just fold.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.440
Yeah, we don't really want
to call in frustration,

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.960
because you saw what happened
to the guy with pocket sevens

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.739
when he ran into our pocket
jacks in the earlier hand.

00:37:14.739 --> 00:37:16.280
OK, so I'll take a
short break there.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.740
And then I'll finish up
the rest of the hands

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.970
in like two minutes.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.210
OK, so I'm going to get started.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.965
The next hand we get
we king-eight offsuit.

00:37:33.965 --> 00:37:36.110
And once again, it's one
of these situations where

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.240
we're not thrilled
to be calling,

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.850
especially now that our
odds are even a bit worse,

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.640
because they actually made it
2.25x, actually a bit more,

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.360
like 2.35x instead of 2x.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.660
So against Degenerated,
but king-eight offsuit, two

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.370
big cards, I think, with when
we're sort of not that deep,

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:58.610
the reverse implied odds don't
work against us that much,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.590
so we call.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.710
And we get a good preflop.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:03.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.130
So we check, because once again,
I'm checking my entire range.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.440
That's how I choose
to play my strategy.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.570
And they bet.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.690
And so this sort
of, I think this

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:20.750
is a somewhat close situation,
because there are some draws.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.250
There is a flush
draw, and there are

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.750
a bunch of straight
draws if someone

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.330
has jack-10 or
queen-jack or queen-10.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.490
So I do think there is a
decent amount of incentive

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:29.870
to just check-raise all in.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.550
So on the second
lecture, I showed you

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.560
a bunch of examples where
on boards like this,

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.920
you can check-raise all
in with your good hands

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.870
and check-raise all
in with your draws,

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.210
and it's a pretty
balanced strategy.

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:44.010
Because when you have a good
hand, you have a good hand.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.635
And when you have a
draw, you have lots

00:38:45.635 --> 00:38:47.960
of outs when you get called.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.610
And another advantage
of going all in is--

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.680
let's say I had like
10-nine, I would probably

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.510
want to be raising.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.260
Because with 10-nine,
even though we

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.500
have a pretty good hand, we sort
of want to protect our hand.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.190
We don't really want a
jack or queen or an ace

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.590
to come that much.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.210
So it's close, but in the
end, I decided to call.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.490
And I think I decided
I'm just going

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:14.420
to play pretty close, pretty
much my entire strategy,

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.890
I'm just going to call here.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:21.320
As tempting as it is, like let's
say I had ace, Two of Diamonds,

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.530
or let's say like queen, Six of
Diamonds to check-raise all in,

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.140
I think it's a board
where it's already paired.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.180
And if I have a
flush draw, I still

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.150
have lots of opportunities
to bluff on the river.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.950
And if I have a
good hand, there's

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.470
not that many outs,
especially when I have a king.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.970
So I'm just going to call and
hope that the board comes out

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.460
well, which I guess it does.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.770
So I check again, because this
is how I'm playing jack-10.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.830
This is how I'm playing
all my hands essentially.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.150
So they check back.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.720
The river is kind of bad for us.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.590
But I think it's hard for them
to have a king at this point,

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:59.090
so I just bet out about
a bit more than half

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:03.980
the pot, maybe 60% of
the pot, yeah, 60%.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.332
Oh, so they actually call
me with ace-seven, which

00:40:06.332 --> 00:40:07.540
I think is pretty reasonable.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:12.560
I think ace-seven is a fine
call against my strategy,

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.480
because I could have
easily had jack-10

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.797
or queen-10 or queen-jack here.

00:40:17.797 --> 00:40:19.880
Although I probably also
play a nine the same way,

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.080
so they are also
paying off my nines.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.280
So one good thing, actually.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.950
So this is one
interesting thing to think

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:30.050
about that's sort of
advanced, but I think

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:33.590
it's cool is the fact that
they have ace-seven, I think,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.230
makes their call a lot
better than if they had,

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:38.420
say, ace-10 or ace-jack.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.920
And the reason for-- so even
the ace-seven is in some sense

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.270
a worse hand than
ace-10 and ace-jack,

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.080
they're the same on this board.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.735
And the problem with
ace-10 and ace-jack

00:40:47.735 --> 00:40:50.180
is if they have a
10 or a jack, it's

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.760
less likely I have
a 10 or a jack.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.572
So when they're
calling with ace-seven,

00:40:54.572 --> 00:40:56.030
essentially what
they're hoping for

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:59.720
is hoping for me to have jack-10
or queen-10 or queen-jack.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.664
So if they have a 10 or a jack,
it just decreases that chance.

00:41:02.664 --> 00:41:04.580
So it's almost like
ace-seven is a better hand

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.206
to call with then ace-jack.

00:41:06.206 --> 00:41:08.330
But nonetheless, with any
ace, I think calling here

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:10.840
is reasonable, because I
do have plenty of bluffs.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.850
Any missed straight draw,
any missed flush draw,

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.880
I will bluff in the
same way on this river.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.710
OK, so the next hand.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.430
We won a bunch of
pots, which is nice.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.220
So we built our stack up.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:30.560
So we get pocket fours here,
and this guy raises it to 1,200.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.180
Pocket fours is
definitely a hand

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.070
where I want to be
bluff-reraising with.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:38.390
So I'm not I'm not hoping to
get called when I reraise here,

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:42.290
but it's a hand that does quite
well against the range of hands

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:44.510
I get called by, because
a lot of times it'll just

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.010
be ace-king, ace-queen.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:51.000
And they will fold quite a
large percent of the time.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.250
So I definitely want to raise.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.410
The only question is
how do I raise, right.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.130
I could just go all in, which
has the benefit that they can't

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.360
call and try to hit a pair.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.818
Because that would
actually be bad.

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:03.939
Let's say I only
reraised to 3,000 here.

00:42:03.939 --> 00:42:05.480
It's actually kind
of bad if this guy

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.790
calls with this queen-jack
trying to hit a pair.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:09.590
Because that's actually
the best strategy.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.240
Basically, their
obvious strategy

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.710
is good against my hand.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:17.190
So I want to either go all
in, which sort of denies them

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:21.570
that opportunity, but the
problem with going all in

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:24.110
is let's suppose Check
Raise picks up a hand.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:26.340
Then I'm going to be losing
with my pocket fours.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.024
So there is this
delicate balance here.

00:42:30.024 --> 00:42:32.190
And this is why I think
tournaments are interesting,

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.800
because there's plays that
are good against big stacks

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.720
and plays that are good
against small stacks.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.345
But in reality in a
tournament, there's

00:42:38.345 --> 00:42:41.040
going to be big stacks and
small stacks at the table,

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.770
and often you do have to
compromise between the lesser

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:44.850
of two evils.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:46.380
And that's sort
of what I do here.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.019
So I decide to raise to
3,600, which is bigger

00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:51.060
than I'd usually make it.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.400
Usually, I'd make
it maybe like 3,000.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:43:00.570
But when this guy is this
short, [? RoflLolBoom, ?] I

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.700
don't really want to
let them just call,

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.440
but on the other hand, I want to
be able to fold if one of these

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.090
two guys, Check Raise or
[? Vampson ?] picks up a hand.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:12.290
So I sort of compromise
between making it 3,600.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.570
They both folded.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:21.390
This guy also folds, which
is, I guess, an ideal result.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.510
The next hand we have
eight-queen offsuit,

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.540
and we make it 1,600.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:31.650
So I know I said make it
2.25x, and I stand by that.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.190
I think that's a good strategy.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.719
I think at the time I'm
just, so once again, I'm

00:43:35.719 --> 00:43:38.260
probably still playing a lot of
tables, and I'm kind of lazy.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.520
So I'm too lazy to
type in 1,800 manually,

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.100
whereas the software
defaults to just 2x.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.740
So I tend to just
2x, but I think

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.350
it's probably not the
theoretical optimal strategy.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:54.660
I would guess that the optimal
thing to do is closer to 2.25x.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.410
So [? Vampson ?]
calls us in position.

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:01.620
So immediately I could think of
it like, what is their range?

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.400
Because it's a
spot where I expect

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.940
him to go all in with
most of their good hands.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.920
So the question is
are they trapping me,

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.750
or do they literally
just always have

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:13.500
a hand like jack-10 suited,
king-queen, or something

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.570
like that.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.370
So immediately, it's sort
of an interesting spot,

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:20.220
because I expect them to
mostly be raising when

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.960
they want to play their hand.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.250
So we flop four, 10, nine.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.760
And it's definitely a pretty
bad board for us, overall.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.040
Like I think if, like
regardless of their strategy,

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.450
like if their strategy
is to trap us sometimes,

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.940
then this board
is just terrible.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.100
And even if their
strategy isn't to trap us,

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.200
they've always got a
straight draw on this board,

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.720
because they're going to
have king-queen or queen-jack

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.680
or something.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.080
So I think objectively,
it's a pretty bad board.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.694
Maybe they could have ace-jack
or ace-queen themselves.

00:44:51.694 --> 00:44:53.610
Although ace-queen, I
think they're definitely

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.540
raising preflop, so
probably just ace-jack.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.940
I do think we're not
in great shape here,

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.720
but I decide to bet anyway,
essentially just banking

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.800
on my Ace of Clubs.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.800
I definitely wouldn't be betting
this without Ace of Clubs.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.310
But my strategy is to
bet, and if I get called,

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.990
I'm going to go all in on any
club turn, any jack, queen,

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.080
or ace turn.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.940
So essentially, any club turn
I'll have the nut flush draw.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.740
Any jack turn, I have
a good straight draw

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.890
with two overcards,
and any queen or ace

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.480
turn pairs with my hand.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.310
So I just think
there's enough turns

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.460
where I can basically
continue bluffing, continue

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.460
barreling on.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.264
That one barrel has to be OK.

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:35.930
But I'm only making
this play, because I

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.230
have the Ace of Clubs.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.420
Even with the Queen
of Clubs, I probably

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.760
would've just
given up this hand.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.787
But we do get a fold.

00:45:42.787 --> 00:45:44.370
So I guess they
probably had ace-jack.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:45.995
That's probably their
most likely hand,

00:45:45.995 --> 00:45:49.740
maybe something like
pocket sevens they folded.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.260
Yeah, so that sort of shows
you the importance sometimes

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.820
of backdoor draws.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.422
Because let's say they
had pocket sevens here.

00:45:56.422 --> 00:45:58.380
Let's say they called
with pocket sevens, which

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.774
I don't think is unreasonable.

00:46:00.774 --> 00:46:02.190
If I didn't have
the Ace of Clubs,

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.504
I'm going to just have to end up
giving up on a bunch of turns,

00:46:05.504 --> 00:46:07.920
and they would take down the
pot with their pocket sevens.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.700
But because I have
the Ace of Clubs,

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.700
it's just very, very
unlikely they end up

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.408
winning the hand with
the pair of sevens.

00:46:13.408 --> 00:46:15.000
Because I'm going
to shove a lot of

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.230
turns, and they're just
going to have to fold.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.970
OK, so the next hand we
get queen-jack again.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.490
And we raise here.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:31.550
And so this same guy,
[? Vampson, ?] they call.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:35.150
And we get a good flop.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:37.330
So I bet-- OK, so I'm
going to talk about this.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:40.770
So I bet 1,600 here,
which is quite small.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:41.670
It's like 40%.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.730
It's like less than
40% of the pot.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.220
I might have done
it out of laziness,

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.350
or I might have just done
it because of my cards,

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.975
because I have two
pair, and I'm trying

00:46:49.975 --> 00:46:53.330
to sucker him in and get him to
put in all this money slowly.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.580
But looking back,
I definitely don't

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.460
think this is how I want to
be playing my entire strategy

00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.660
on this flop.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.960
I think I want to be betting at
least half the pot when there's

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.920
a flush draw, a straight draw,
like a bunch of straight draws.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.500
I definitely think this
bet is way too small.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.930
On average, even if I
have a pretty good hand,

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:14.270
let's say like
queen-nine, there's

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.070
just a lot of bad
cards for me that I

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.380
don't want to be betting
this small on this board.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.560
I don't know if at the time I
just misclicked and messed up,

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.380
or I was lazy and I just
wanted to make it 2x,

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.522
or I specifically had a
read that I could exploit

00:47:27.522 --> 00:47:28.730
this player by betting small.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:32.850
But this is not how I would
like to balance my strategy.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.690
And If you ever see me
doing this, most likely

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:39.320
I had a really good hand,
as I do in this case.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.229
So unfortunately
it doesn't work.

00:47:41.229 --> 00:47:43.020
So I'm going to talk
about this a bit more.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:47.757
So I'm going to jump back
to theory just for a bit.

00:47:47.757 --> 00:47:49.590
I don't think I've
talked about this before,

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.370
but I want to say that
bet sizing depends

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.690
on board texture.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.650
So let me explain
what I mean here.

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:58.180
So essentially, there's
two types of boards.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.880
There's dry boards
and drawy boards.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.660
So I hate this
terminology, because these

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.690
are two words that
mean opposite things,

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:07.572
and they sound very
similar, especially

00:48:07.572 --> 00:48:08.530
if you don't enunciate.

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:11.590
But it's dry and drawy.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:14.130
Maybe I can't
pronounce them well.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:17.420
Dry boards is basically boards
where the winner is mostly

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.460
decided before the
river, and you're either

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.010
way ahead or way behind.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.685
Drawy boards is basically
boards with a lot of flush

00:48:23.685 --> 00:48:26.720
draws, straight draws,
where every subsequent card

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.370
can change the board a lot.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:30.650
And it's hard to fold,
because all hands have equity.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:33.320
So in reality, most boards,
they're somewhere in between.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.480
It's a spectrum.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.479
So what are some
characteristics of dry boards?

00:48:37.479 --> 00:48:39.020
Well, a board tends
to be dry if it's

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.120
paired, like four, four, eight.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.080
That tends to be pretty dry,
because not much is going in.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.210
Most will have
missed that board.

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:48.200
A board is dry if the
highest card is big.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.230
Like if the highest card is
an ace, then against someone

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:53.840
with an ace, if you don't have
a face flush or straight draw,

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.970
you're already kind of
drawing close to dead.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:00.140
Whereas if the highest card is
a 10, then if you have a queen,

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:04.760
you always have an opportunity
to turn a queen and beat them.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.070
It's dry if there's no middle
cards for straight draws,

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.980
if there's no
flush draws, or I'd

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.740
say, if there's already four
to a flush or already four

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.632
to a straight, then it's
also sort of dry, because--

00:49:15.632 --> 00:49:17.340
like if there's already
Four of Diamonds,

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.890
then it's also sort of
decided who wins already.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.070
Like if you have a
big diamond, you're

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:26.002
pretty much guaranteed to
win, barring some full house.

00:49:26.002 --> 00:49:27.210
Same with four to a straight.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.400
If it's like nine,
10, jack, queen.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.480
If you have a king, you're just
pretty much guaranteed to win.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.680
And so on the other hand,
what are drawy boards?

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.054
It's sort of the
opposite, right.

00:49:37.054 --> 00:49:38.500
Small cards, why small cards?

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.450
Because everyone's going to have
overcards, which is six outs.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:44.160
Flush draws or three to a
flush is also very drawy,

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.060
because if there's
three to a flush,

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:50.420
then someone with just any card
of that suit has a flush draw.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.070
Boards with straight draws.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:55.610
So how should your play change
on these two types of boards?

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:59.735
Well, on dry boards, you can
bet pretty small fractions

00:49:59.735 --> 00:50:02.000
of the pot on the flop and turn.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.100
And your opponent might
not have the odds to call.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:08.210
So like if the flop is
ace, ace, two or maybe ace,

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.070
ace, seven with no
flush draws, you

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.274
can bet like a fifth of
the pot, and your opponent

00:50:13.274 --> 00:50:15.440
is still going to have to
fold a lot of their hands.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.650
Because if you've got an
ace, they're just way behind.

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.290
What's another characteristic?

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:24.200
Is any draw might be good
enough to make a bluff.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.070
So like if the board is ace,
ace, seven with no flush draw,

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.280
and you've got like eight, nine
with a backdoor flush draw,

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.050
that's a pretty good
hand to make a bluff.

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:35.840
Because you've got three
to a straight and three

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.970
to a flush, which
is sort of the most

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.810
you could possibly ask for
on that flop with respect

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.170
to draws.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.890
And another aspect of playing
dry boards is slow playing.

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:47.460
Tricky plays are good.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.300
Because the thing that matters
isn't preventing your opponent

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.940
from seeing the turn and river
and not letting them see outs.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.180
The thing that matters is sort
of convincing your opponent

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.670
that you have a good hand when
you don't or convincing them

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.380
that you don't have a
good hand when you do.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.088
So it's all about
tricking your opponent,

00:51:02.088 --> 00:51:03.710
disguising these tricky--

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:05.520
I mean, I shouldn't say that.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.820
Simple play can still
be good on dry boards,

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.949
but in general, slow
playing is reasonable

00:51:10.949 --> 00:51:12.740
And tricking, trying
to trick your opponent

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.390
is more important.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:16.320
Whereas on drawy
boards, you just

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.100
want to bet large fractions
of the pot before the river,

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.024
because every hand
has so many outs.

00:51:21.024 --> 00:51:23.440
You really don't want to be
giving them good odds to call.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.180
And on the flop and turn,
if you don't have anything,

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.620
then just don't
put any money in.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.470
Because bluffing is pretty
moot, because so many hands

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.216
aren't folding,
because they have outs.

00:51:32.216 --> 00:51:33.590
And yeah, don't
really slow play.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.162
If you have a good
hand, similarly,

00:51:35.162 --> 00:51:37.370
just put all the money in
right away, because they're

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.960
going to call very often,
because they're always

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.220
going to have some outs.

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.521
So that's roughly
how the play changes.

00:51:44.521 --> 00:51:45.770
OK, so I'll come back to this.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.150
We'll see these hands in a bit.

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.520
So coming back to
this queen-jack hand,

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.890
the reason why I think
my bet is too small

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.470
is because I would
consider this queen, jack,

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:57.950
three with a flush draw to be
a fairly drawy board, fairly

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:01.130
close to the drawy
end of the spectrum.

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:04.250
And I said you have to bet
big fractions of the pot

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.250
and here I am betting close to
a third of the pot on the flop.

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.510
So I think it is
not a good strategy,

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:12.189
but I take the pot down.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:23.420
OK, so the next hand, we
have ace-queen offsuit.

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.910
So this guy calls.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:31.520
My rule was roughly
raising it to 3x plus one.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.711
So you could count how many
limpers there are before you,

00:52:34.711 --> 00:52:36.710
and you add three to that,
and you multiply that

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.751
by the big blind is roughly
what you raise it to.

00:52:38.751 --> 00:52:40.550
So in this case, 4,000.

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.430
I make it 4,250.

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:45.670
If they decide to do some
weird plays, by the way,

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.320
like if they go all in here,
I'm definitely calling.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.820
I am just not going
to believe them,

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.694
and ace-queen offsuit is
definitely good enough.

00:52:52.694 --> 00:52:54.110
So they decide to
just call, which

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:57.210
is a bit weird considering
their odds aren't that good,

00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:00.800
and they're out of position.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.260
We flop three hearts, and
we have the Queen of Hearts.

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.590
And in this situation,
I'm just betting

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:08.000
pretty big into the pot.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.820
So I consider this to
be a fairly drawy flop,

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.780
so I bet big.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.860
Even though I'm in
position-- so position

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.840
is sort of an incentive
to maybe bet smaller,

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.300
because you have position
on later streets.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.150
And you can control the betting
better on later streets.

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:26.180
So this is a fairly big bet
considering I'm in position.

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.450
But I'm just happy
to get it in here.

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:31.400
So contrast this
with an earlier hand.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.540
I think I also had
ace-queen, except I only

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.770
had three to a flush.

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:39.440
And I said it was very important
that I had the ace of the suit.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.890
But here it's just very hard
for me to be in terrible shape.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:45.680
Like in theory they
could have, I suppose,

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.630
ace-nine with an Ace of Hearts.

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:49.130
Like that hand would
be crushing me,

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.520
because I would be drawing
to literally three outs

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.760
to carry my queen.

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.010
But it's just there's not
that many combinations,

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.860
because it would involve an
offsuit hand, which they're

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.740
way less likely to have when
they call me out of position.

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.780
Or it would involve a
hand like pocket kings

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:06.080
with the King of Hearts,
which is also pretty unlikely,

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.810
because they probably would
have done some raising preflop.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:11.270
So I just think no
matter what they have,

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:13.030
I'm going to be in
great shape here.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.060
I just have more than
enough outs to just gamble.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.390
And so they fold.

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.530
OK, the next hand
we had queen-10 off.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.510
So I opened from under the gun.

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:29.440
I think it's fine.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.750
It looks a bit loose,
and it is, but I

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:36.380
think in terms of raising some
smaller cards to balance it,

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.824
so that I will sometimes have
smaller cards in my hand.

00:54:38.824 --> 00:54:40.990
You know you can't really
ask for more than a suited

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:42.070
connector.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.380
So queen-10 suited, I
raise from under the gun.

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:47.276
And the big blind calls
when they only start

00:54:47.276 --> 00:54:50.920
the hand being 18 bets deep.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.050
So we flop two, two, 10.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.400
So this is a good example of a
very dry board, where there's

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.220
really not much going on.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:02.350
And it is possible
they have a deuce,

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:05.770
but just in general, there is no
straight draws, no flush draws.

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.610
I guess there are
some overcards,

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:12.280
but still, it's pretty close
to as dry as you can get.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.440
And they checked
to me, and I bet

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.039
2,000, which I think is
actually too big here.

00:55:17.039 --> 00:55:19.330
To be honest, I don't think
I needed to risk this much.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:23.230
I mean, I have a good hand
but if I didn't have a pair,

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:26.110
I only want to be
betting like 1,500.

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:27.390
I think that's a fine size.

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:29.920
I think betting 1,500 is more
than enough on this board,

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.750
just because there's
really nothing going on.

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:34.930
But I guess I was lazy.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:40.860
I bet 2,000, and they call.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.000
So as you can see,
there's a huge difference

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.010
between my flop bet
sizing depending

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:46.420
on the texture of the board.

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.490
And that's sort of--

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:50.410
that's the point I
wanted to drive across

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:52.640
through some of these examples.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.710
So they call me.

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:57.432
So we turn a six,
and they check.

00:55:57.432 --> 00:55:59.140
I'm just going to keep
it simple and bet.

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.880
I'm not going to
try anything tricky.

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.640
And obviously I'm not folding
with top pair and a flush draw.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.780
So they go all in.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.290
I call.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.440
So we river a flush,
and it turned out

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.470
to actually be necessary,
because they had a deuce.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:17.670
So it is possible here, I
think, for them to have a deuce.

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:22.050
I think their play preflop is a
bit loose with two-nine suited

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.860
but not completely terrible.

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.550
Because with 4.5
to 1 odds, nothing

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:27.870
is really that terrible.

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:29.550
But I guess we get lucky.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:31.560
But I do think their
call is a bit marginal.

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:35.040
Because we are under the gun,
so our range is fairly strong.

00:56:38.749 --> 00:56:39.790
That's a nice pot to win.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:43.210
So we're a fairly big stack now.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.370
I guess we're chip
leader at the table.

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:49.650
And Check Raise
mid-raises from there.

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:51.400
And we have pocket deuces.

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.590
I think definitely
our hand is too weak

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.680
to go all in with as a bluff
against an under-the-gun

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.670
opening range.

00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:01.210
So the only options
really are call or fold.

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:04.042
Basically our hand does have
terrible reverse implied odds

00:57:04.042 --> 00:57:04.750
post-flop though.

00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:08.710
So I think if you wanted to fold
here, it wouldn't be terrible.

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:12.100
But I guess I think calling
is fine, too, with 4.5 to 1.

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:16.060
And also in some sense, you
do have odds to set mine here

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.316
I think.

00:57:18.316 --> 00:57:20.857
The chances of hitting a third
deuce on the flop is about one

00:57:20.857 --> 00:57:21.970
in eight.

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:26.830
My odds are only 4.5 to 1,
but there are implied odds

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:28.000
in the case I do hit a set.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.200
So literally if my
strategy is call and fold

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.980
unless the flop
has a two on it, I

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.960
don't think I'm losing
a ton of money there.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.530
And if there ever is a
case where they check down,

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:41.560
and I get to take down the
pot with just a pair of twos,

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.700
then I'm just printing
money by calling.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.560
So I decided to call.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.870
The flop doesn't have
a two, so it's bad.

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:53.140
But out of the flops that don't
have a two, it's probably not

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.810
that bad, considering
the three and seven

00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:58.660
is not that likely to pair
him when he's under the gun.

00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:00.630
But nonetheless I fold.

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:03.100
You know like if I could do
the cheat I talked about where

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.350
I could disconnect and
call and see the river,

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:06.400
I definitely would.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.727
But if I call, I have to
decide again on the turn

00:58:09.727 --> 00:58:12.310
whether to call and decide again
on the river whether to call,

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:15.490
and it's just not going to
be a good situation, even

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:18.580
though for this immediate
bet, I think I definitely

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.520
have odds to call with
a backdoor flush draw,

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.070
and often they're just
going to have ace-king.

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:26.350
It's just impossible
to play the hand good.

00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:29.110
This sort of just
demonstrates why

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.560
it's very risky when you decide
to play a hand like pocket

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.268
deuces out of position,
because it's just

00:58:33.268 --> 00:58:34.500
very easy to get roped in.

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:37.560
Like let's say I call here, and
then I call the flop thinking

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.670
they might have ace-king.

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:40.630
They bet small, so
I have good odds,

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:42.100
and I have a
backdoor flush draw.

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.590
So let's say I call,
and then the turn

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:46.790
is like the Five of
Clubs or something,

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.690
and they bet like
40% of the pot.

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:52.440
Well, am I going to talk
myself into a call again?

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.520
Maybe, because now
I hit a third club.

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.880
But if I do then, if the
river's something random--

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.690
it's just all these
decisions that I'm not

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:00.940
going to be able to make well.

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:03.587
Whereas for my opponent,
it's going to be fairly easy.

00:59:03.587 --> 00:59:05.420
They're going to just
bluff their bad hands,

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:08.020
value bet their good hands,
and check down the hands

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:09.330
in the middle which beat me.

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:17.000
OK, so the next hand we
get ace-king offsuit,

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.210
and we raise, and
the big blind calls.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:22.430
The flop is nine, two, seven.

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:24.800
So note that the big blind
just got moved to the table,

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.940
and they actually cover us.

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.330
So they're probably
one of the biggest

00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:31.080
stacks in the tournament.

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.640
So they check to us.

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.472
I decide to check
back here, which

00:59:34.472 --> 00:59:36.180
I don't think is
terrible, but I think is

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:39.790
a bit of a scared play that I--

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:42.680
I think I would have
rather saw myself bet.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:47.420
If I was shallower, like let's
say we only had 20,000 chips,

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.750
then I think just
checking is good.

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:51.204
Because if I bet,
they're probably

00:59:51.204 --> 00:59:53.620
going to be check-raising with
a lot of their flush draws,

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.130
straight draws,
and then like pairs

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:56.780
of nines or pairs of sevens.

00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.300
And I'm going to have to
fold with a pretty good hand

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.720
where I have two good overcards
and a backdoor flush draw,

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.686
but when it's this deep, they
really can't just check-raise

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:08.810
a nine, because they're
going to have to be worried

01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:10.910
about pocket aces on our part.

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:12.400
So I think it's--

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.540
we're not going to get
check-raised that often,

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.940
and by betting, we just
make the pot bigger

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.850
when we do hit a king
or an ace and also

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.950
make it more likely
that we can bluff them

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:24.380
off a nine or a
seven by the river.

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.510
So I would have liked
to see myself bet,

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:28.250
but I don't think
checking is terrible,

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:31.280
by the argument that I
will most of the time,

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.207
you know by betting
I am folding out

01:00:33.207 --> 01:00:34.790
basically all the
hands that I've beat

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:37.820
and keeping in all the
hands that beat me.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.280
It's close but I would have
liked to see myself bet.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.949
But as played, you know, if
I'm going to check the flop,

01:00:42.949 --> 01:00:44.240
I'm not going to bet this turn.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.070
Because the whole point
of betting the flop

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.100
is so that I could potentially
bet the turn and bet the river

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.070
and get him to fold a pair
of nines or a pair of sevens,

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.137
but by now I'm not
going to really

01:00:54.137 --> 01:00:55.970
have any hope of getting
him to fold a nine.

01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:00.290
And I'm just trying to win
the pot with my ace-king high.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.130
And so yeah, I
just check it down.

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.130
The river check, I think,
is very, very obvious,

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:06.505
because I'm literally only
getting called by better hands

01:01:06.505 --> 01:01:08.970
if I bet the river.

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.430
They have queen-10.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:12.680
I think they probably should
have bluffed the river.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.730
I think queen-10 is
weak enough where

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:17.780
they're just very rarely winning
the pot with queen-10 high.

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:21.470
They basically need to bluff
and then put me to a decision.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.120
But nice to win that.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.090
The next hand we have
jack-10, not too exciting.

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:33.090
So this same guy who's now the
button, raises from the button.

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.644
And we call, and
we flop nothing.

01:01:35.644 --> 01:01:37.810
So the best thing to do is
bluff off all your chips,

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.738
but no, I just fold.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.184
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.404
OK, so the next hand, it's also
against this [? GarlaEDU. ?]

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:48.820
So the two big
stacks at the table

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.610
are actually playing a lot
of hands against each other.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:53.870
I just call here with jacks.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:56.606
I don't think it would be
terrible to just raise and bet

01:01:56.606 --> 01:02:02.620
it all in, but I think it is
sort of unnecessarily risky.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.730
I think it wouldn't
be a terrible play

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:07.150
to just raise and get it all
in, but it's definitely thin.

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:10.270
Like you're not printing value
by raising and getting it

01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:12.542
all in, because if
they reraise all in,

01:02:12.542 --> 01:02:14.250
their range is going
to be pretty strong.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:18.040
And pocket jacks is not
really crushing them.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.950
I think you need to
have queens or better

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:25.270
to really be hoping to get it
all in against this guy here.

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:26.800
So with jacks I just call.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.420
And also, you know, this
protects my calling range

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:30.130
of it.

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:34.070
Let's say, like Check Raise
thinks I'm weak and decides

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.230
to make a play here.

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:40.450
And they reraise to like 10,000,
then if [? GarlaEDU ?] folds,

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:43.110
I can come back around and go
all in and sort of surprise

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:44.050
them.

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:47.041
So it does protect my
calling range a bit as well.

01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:47.540
I call.

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:51.160
We get a nine, six, five flop.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.970
They check, and I bet.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.270
I think betting is a
fairly natural play.

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:56.820
I don't want to
give ace-king outs.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.780
And I just want to
win the pot right now,

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.360
but I was thinking
to myself after

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.590
that if they check-raised here,
that's really a gross spot.

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:08.841
Actually, I would hate my
life if they check-raised me.

01:03:08.841 --> 01:03:10.840
Because I literally don't
know what I should do.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.990
On one hand, I would
be inclined to fold,

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:18.640
because it's kind
of weird for them

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.980
to want to check-raise
me here without having

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:26.710
like a bigger pair or a
flush draw with lots of outs.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:28.780
But at the same
time, it's just why

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:31.470
would they check pocket
aces to me here, maybe

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:32.810
to try to trap me.

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.810
It would have been a
really gross spot, I think,

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.100
if I got check-raised.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.730
And by that argument, I think
against a very tricky player,

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:42.110
if you could be
check-raising here as a trap

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:45.520
and as a bluff with a balance
strategy, maybe checking

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.660
is better just to
protect myself from that.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:51.190
But I think against him, I was
reasonably confident nothing

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:52.835
crazy was going to happen.

01:03:52.835 --> 01:03:53.960
And yes, so they just fold.

01:03:59.432 --> 01:04:00.890
OK, so it's against
this guy again.

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:03.550
I guess we're playing a lot of
pots against the same player.

01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:05.440
I think it's getting fairly
late into the tournament

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.090
at this point.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:08.610
It's not a huge tournament,
maybe like 80, 90 players,

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:12.027
and it's probably down to
like 20, 25 at this point.

01:04:12.027 --> 01:04:12.610
So they raise.

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:14.260
We call with queen-eight off.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.810
We're a bit deep here, so
our reverse implied odds

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:17.890
are actually sort of bad.

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:23.290
But we decide to call, and
we flop two, three, five.

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:25.190
So I'm just going to fold here.

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:27.110
But they decide to check.

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:29.800
And then we turn a flush
draw, but I'm still just going

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.810
to check and basically bet
pretty much every river, maybe

01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:36.640
not an eight river.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.520
So we river a six, and I
essentially bet as a bluff,

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.382
because our hand has no hope of
winning if it gets a showdown.

01:04:44.382 --> 01:04:45.340
And it works this time.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.870
So yeah, we played a
lot of pots against him.

01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:51.050
And it seems like they
are fairly willing to just

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:53.510
check and fold their hands,
so not too aggressive.

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:55.540
So I guess one thing
to keep in mind

01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:01.720
is maybe we can get out of the
way if we do see them raising.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.302
OK, so this situation is
similar to the situation

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:06.760
in the very first
hand we discussed

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.690
where we had king-queen, and
we had roughly 30 big blinds.

01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:12.460
And I talked sort of
about the benefits

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.170
of raising versus calling.

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.580
It's pretty much the
exact same situation.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.870
And I decided to sort of
raise, essentially as a bluff,

01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:23.710
but also king-queen plays
pretty well when they do call.

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:26.950
Because I'm always good
when I hit top pair.

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:29.590
So make it 8,000.

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.890
But unfortunately, this
time this [? GerarDocks ?]

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:32.860
goes all in.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.160
So we basically
just have to fold.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.200
Yeah, unfortunately,
8,000 is small enough

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.700
where we can just
happily get away here.

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.880
And it actually turns
out this guy also

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.980
goes on, which makes the
decision even easier.

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:49.230
So it looks like we ran into
pocket aces and pocket kings

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:50.645
that time.

01:05:50.645 --> 01:05:53.878
It doesn't always work when
you reraise with king-queen.

01:05:56.972 --> 01:05:58.555
All right, so still
at the same table,

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:01.500
we get ace-jack
offsuit, under the gun.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:06.260
We reraise, and this
[? GerarDocks ?] guy calls.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.690
We flop king, nine,
deuce with two hearts,

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:13.280
and I think this is sort of
pretty much the worst flop, one

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.250
of the worst flops I could get.

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:19.340
If there was like two higher
cards like a king and a queen,

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.320
I would have a
gutshot straight draw.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.080
And if it was all low cards,
I'd have two overcards,

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.260
but here there's a flush
draw that I have no part of.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:30.050
And also, they are somewhat
likely to have a king,

01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:32.810
and if they do, I only have
three outs and my aces,

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:34.850
so I'm just going give this up.

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:37.220
So I talk about the power
of continuation betting

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.500
before where continuation
betting is good,

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.780
because my range is
stronger than theirs.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.710
I could have aces.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:44.129
I can bluff, et cetera.

01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:45.920
And yeah, in general,
continuation betting,

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.870
being aggressive,
especially when

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.830
you're the pre-flop
aggressor, is very good.

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:52.070
But I think this is just
one of the worst flops,

01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:54.740
and I'm just going to give up.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:55.730
So I check.

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:57.980
They bet, and I fold.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.830
I mean, I think sometimes I will
check a reasonably good hand

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:03.180
here to protect the times--

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:06.320
so that they can't just
bet here with any two cards

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.580
and know for sure I'll fold.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.330
But most of the time
if I'm checking here,

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:12.350
I'm going to be fairly weak,
which is maybe exploitable.

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:14.210
But I give up the hand.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.800
So eight-five suited.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.860
I decide to call
on the small blind.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:22.610
I know this goes against
my recommendation

01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:23.930
from the first class.

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:26.540
I think calling from the
small blind is actually,

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.340
both theoretically
and practically,

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.846
a pretty good strategy
for a lot of cases,

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:31.970
but it's a bit complicated.

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:36.210
Because you have to sometimes
limp raise as a bluff.

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:38.567
You have to sometimes limp
raise and trap with aces.

01:07:38.567 --> 01:07:39.650
So it's a bit complicated.

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:43.170
So I just said for simplicity,
you should just raise or fold,

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:44.720
which is still a
reasonable I think.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.560
But I decide to call
here, and it's checked.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.310
We get a pretty good
flop for our hands

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:52.710
but probably a better
flop for his range,

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:56.330
because when we call, we're
less likely to have really

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:57.860
small cards than he does.

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.020
But I mean, we have a
good flop for our hand,

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:02.780
so I am still going
to bet my hand.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.386
So I bet half pot,
which is maybe not big

01:08:06.386 --> 01:08:07.760
enough, to be
honest, considering

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.740
how dry the board is.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.210
And we get a call.

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:16.422
We turn a nine, which is a
great card, because it gives--

01:08:16.422 --> 01:08:17.880
not only does it
complete our hand,

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.689
there's lot of draws out there,
and I bet quite big here.

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:23.359
So this is where I was talking
about if the board is drawy,

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.270
you need to bet big and not
give your opponent odds.

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:30.622
So I bet 688 into 10,800.

01:08:30.622 --> 01:08:32.330
The reason for the
eights is because it's

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:35.760
easier to type
like 688 then 6800,

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.370
so you'll see that quite a lot.

01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:43.059
And we get called.

01:08:43.059 --> 01:08:45.350
Yeah, and another, sometimes
you can get more creative,

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:47.470
you can do like 1234567.

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:50.090
That's a popular bet, because
you can just slide your finger

01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:52.130
across the keyboard.

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.890
Yeah, there's a lot of
weird idiosyncrasies, OK,

01:08:54.890 --> 01:09:01.410
so I bet 15,555
here, and he folds.

01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:03.720
I'm playing like this with
my missed spade draws,

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.620
and I missed heart draws.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.564
Unfortunately, we
don't get paid off.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.210
OK, so jack-eight suited here.

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:15.890
The small blind raises.

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:21.025
Definitely I'm going to
call, and we flop top pair.

01:09:21.025 --> 01:09:25.420
They bet, and-- so I think this
is a spot where I think my hand

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.149
is--

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:29.020
there's benefits of raising
and benefits of calling.

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:31.750
And overall, I decided
the benefits of raising

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:32.398
were higher.

01:09:32.398 --> 01:09:33.939
So I decided to
raise and just get it

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:37.240
all in, although I think
calling is not unreasonable,

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.790
because your hand sort
of isn't good enough

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:42.760
where you are just really,
really happy to get it all in.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.176
I mean, it's good enough where
I'm going to get it all in,

01:09:45.176 --> 01:09:47.740
but I'm not like thrilled
if they go all in,

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.729
and I have to call.

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:51.460
So that's one disadvantage
of getting it all in,

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:55.630
but I just think compared to
the advantage of not giving them

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:58.436
a chance to suck out
on me and beat me

01:09:58.436 --> 01:10:00.580
in the hand is a
pretty big advantage,

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:04.387
not letting a queen,
king, or ace roll off.

01:10:04.387 --> 01:10:06.970
Another advantage of calling is
being able to pick off bluffs.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:09.250
But I just think in
this spot, I want

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:12.430
to play a strategy where I'm
going to raise to a small size

01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:15.370
and put him to the decision,
both with my top pairs

01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:19.360
like jacks and also my hands
like seven-nine or whatever.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.210
So I decided to
raise, but I think

01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:24.395
calling would have been
fine and [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:27.879 --> 01:10:29.170
The next hand we have ace-king.

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:31.547
All right, so we got like
seven more hands to get to.

01:10:31.547 --> 01:10:33.130
I'll go a bit quickly
here at the end,

01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:35.340
but I think we'll get
through all the hands.

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.430
This hand is fairly easy.

01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:39.250
They make it 5,000,
and we have ace-king,

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:40.750
and we just go all in.

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:43.690
There's no point slow
playing essentially,

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:45.520
especially when if
they have jack-10,

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.880
they have lots of outs.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.599
So we go all in, and they fold.

01:10:48.599 --> 01:10:50.890
So it is a bit curious here,
because they actually only

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:52.112
had 12 big blinds here.

01:10:52.112 --> 01:10:54.070
So they could have just
went all in themselves,

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:56.890
but they decided
to raise small, so

01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:59.470
that they could fold if someone
behind picks up a monster.

01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:01.632
And I guess they were
paid off this time.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.110
But yeah, like for this
hand, like one disadvantage

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:11.882
of their play, suppose
we had king-two suited.

01:11:11.882 --> 01:11:13.590
We would have folded
if they went all in,

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:16.300
but now we can call
and see a flop.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.710
But because we had
ace-king, I guess

01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:23.190
they profited from not
committing their whole stack.

01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:25.200
OK, we have king-jack offsuit.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.630
We make it 6,000, and
this guy goes all in.

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:31.330
I fold here.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:32.660
I think it's not that close.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.410
I think with king-jack
suited, it's close.

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:36.390
But I'd still fold
with king-jack suited.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:39.480
I'd probably call with
ace-jack offsuit plus.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.940
I would probably call
with ace-10 suited,

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.430
and I'd call with king-queen
suited and probably

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.680
king-queen offsuit as well.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.520
In this case-- so in the last
class, I said being suited

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.950
is very important
when you're behind.

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:54.570
But when you're
potentially ahead,

01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:57.170
just having a slightly better
hand is very important.

01:11:57.170 --> 01:12:00.390
So I think in this situation,
I would fold king-jack suited

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:02.490
but call with
king-queen offsuit,

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:04.650
because a decent
part of his range

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.908
is hands like king-jack
and king-queen.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.206
Here I have king-queen
and Degenerated-- so

01:12:14.206 --> 01:12:16.580
for some reason, I love making
this play with king-queen.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.340
It's actually not
that unfounded.

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:21.900
It's just a good hand to bluff
with that at the same time

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.020
sort of protects your range
in the case that he calls,

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.290
and also your hand doesn't play
that well if you just call.

01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:31.620
Because you're not suited,
so it really is king-queen--

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.870
I mean in this
tournament, we've happened

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:36.600
to have been dealt
king-queen a lot

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.170
and gotten into situations where
we can reraise-bluff people.

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:44.100
But it really is my favorite
hand to do this with.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.780
It might even be
too predictable,

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.464
because I just always have
king-queen whenever I do this.

01:12:49.464 --> 01:12:50.630
But we do take it down here.

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:55.410
Ace-jack offsuit.

01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:57.872
This guy, so this
Degenerated guy who we just--

01:12:57.872 --> 01:13:00.330
at this point, it's probably
late enough in the tournament.

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:03.360
I am paying attention, and I
am aware that I just reraised

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.410
this guy three hands earlier.

01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:07.760
So they make a big
raise here, do 9,000.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:13.070
And I call with ace-jack,
which I regret quite a bit.

01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:14.820
I think it's just too
weak a hand to play.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.940
And if I'm going to play it, I
think I should just go all in

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.470
and try to win the hand preflop.

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:21.750
Even though I'm in
position, I think it's just

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:23.940
going to be hard to play.

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.340
Even when I hit
an ace or a jack,

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:28.150
I'm still going to
quite often be behind.

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:30.740
And if I don't hit
an ace or a jack,

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.030
I'm pretty much always
just going to have to fold.

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:34.920
And that's basically
what happens.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:41.070
So I don't know why I just
gave away 9,000 chips there.

01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:44.320
OK, so queen-jack suited.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.930
I just go all in from the
small blind, because it's--

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:49.780
so even though we have 15 big
blinds, which is more than 12,

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.510
I said last class that
from the small blind,

01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:54.580
you're really, really
incentivized to go

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:57.040
all in, because
if you don't then

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.540
the other guy has position.

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.060
Whereas like from the
button, if you just raise,

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:02.740
the big blind calls,
you have position.

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.410
So I go all in.

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:06.610
Queen-jack suited is
more than good enough.

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:11.000
And we get a fold.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.750
And the next hand, OK,
so this is actually

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:13.625
a great illustration.

01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:15.740
The very next hand we
get queen-jack off,

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.540
and we just raise
from the button.

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:20.160
And it's exactly the reason I
said, because we have position.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.230
So we don't mind if the
pot gets played post-flop.

01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:25.850
So the small blind goes all in.

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:28.970
And note that they're
actually fairly short here.

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:31.640
They only have 14 big
blinds to start the hand.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.420
So I would have easily
with queen-jack suited.

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:38.510
Even with queen-jack
off, I'm not certain

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:41.246
that folding is a better
play than calling.

01:14:41.246 --> 01:14:43.370
It's just your odds are
basically good enough here,

01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:45.860
and their range
will be fairly loose

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.522
when I raise from the button.

01:14:47.522 --> 01:14:49.730
Because they're going to
think I don't have much when

01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:50.729
I raise from the button.

01:14:50.729 --> 01:14:52.759
So it's quite
possible calling here

01:14:52.759 --> 01:14:54.050
would have been the right play.

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.960
It's very close.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.980
I think I would definitely
called with ace-nine offsuit.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.690
I would have definitely
called with king-10 offsuit.

01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:02.690
Yeah, it's pretty close.

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:03.560
I decided to fold.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.380
Maybe I also knew that
they were kind of tight.

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.270
Normally when I play
but I'm not showing here

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.870
is I have like statistics
on every player,

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:13.550
of like overall the hands,
what percent of the time

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.200
they raised, what
percent they folded.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.300
So I have a rough
idea while I'm playing

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.320
of how tight everyone is, and
maybe I just knew he was tight.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.202
Actually let me see if I
can turn it back on here.

01:15:25.202 --> 01:15:25.910
Yeah, let me see.

01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:26.760
That might be why.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.060
So OK, so these numbers--

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.410
Actually, he's fairly loose.

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:34.910
Actually, I'm not
sure why I folded.

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:38.140
So this 10.7 is his
reraise percentage,

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:41.580
and what this says is
10.7% of the time he could

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:44.190
have reraised, he reraised.

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:48.010
It's only over a sample
of 187 hands, but it's--

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:51.502
Yeah, I think it's definitely
looser than average.

01:15:51.502 --> 01:15:53.210
Although it's a bit
biased, because we're

01:15:53.210 --> 01:15:55.220
playing at a five-handed table.

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:56.390
Nonetheless, it's close.

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:59.420
I think calling probably
would've been OK, but I folded.

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.300
Let me turn this off.

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.133
It's quite annoying.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.470
So this is near the
final table now.

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:08.178
This is, I think, the
second final table.

01:16:08.178 --> 01:16:09.970
There's maybe like
11 or 12 left,

01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:11.886
and I'm just going to
show you the final hands

01:16:11.886 --> 01:16:13.460
before the final table.

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:14.630
This hand is a no-brainer.

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:21.190
We go all in, and fortunately,
we hold against pocket twos.

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:25.610
OK, so the very last hand,
also fairly no-brainer.

01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:26.810
This guy goes on.

01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:30.080
So yeah, poker is easy if you
just get dealt pocket jacks,

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.809
pocket aces all the time.

01:16:31.809 --> 01:16:32.600
So we win this one.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.050
OK so, this is the last
hand before the final table.

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:38.090
So in a future class, not
the Friday class, because

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:39.770
Jennifer Shahade is speaking.

01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:42.890
But in a future class I'll
go through the final table,

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:45.650
and I'll maybe also go through
all the hands, not just

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:48.090
the hands where I
got in a big pot.

01:16:48.090 --> 01:16:51.005
So let me just quickly
go back to the slides.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.987
Right, so I really only
talked about two concepts

01:16:57.987 --> 01:16:58.570
in this class.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:02.130
It was this drawy
versus dry boards.

01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:05.060
So try to remember that
while you guys are playing,

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.590
changing your bet
sizing depending

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:08.060
on the board pressure.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:11.152
And also this pre-flop
reraising strategy,

01:17:11.152 --> 01:17:13.110
even though I didn't give
you a conclusion here

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:15.380
on what you reraise with.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.960
I should give you some rough
guidelines and the advantages

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.570
and disadvantages of each play.

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:22.870
Yeah, OK, cool, so that's it.

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:24.020
Come on Friday's class.

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:25.640
It should be really exciting.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.520
Jennifer Shahade, she'll
probably talk a bit about chess

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.710
as well, but I'll
convince her not

01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:33.000
to talk too much about chess
when it's a poker class.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.190
But thanks, guys.

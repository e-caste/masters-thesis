00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.330
MICHAEL SHORT: So,
today we're going

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.420
to get into the most politically
and emotionally fraught

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.410
topic of this course
for stuff on chemical

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.340
and biological
effects of radiation.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.090
Now that you know the units
of dose, background dose,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.420
we're going to talk about
what ionizing radiation does

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.840
in the body, to cells,
to other things,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.340
and we're going to get into a
lot of the feelings associated

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.060
with it.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.460
And by the end of this
lecture, or Thursday,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.800
I'm going to teach you
guys how to smell bullshit.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.980
Because we're going to go
through one of millions

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.890
of internet articles about
things that cause cancer,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.570
that don't cause cancer.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.570
In this case, it's going to
be radiation from cell phones.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.180
So I'm going to try to
reserve at least 10 minutes

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.690
at the end of this class for us
to go through a bunch of quote,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.050
unquote, studies and
misinterpretations

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.100
of those conclusions.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.263
And I was going to pick my
favorite of the 44 studies,

00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:15.680
and looking through them all,
my favorite are all of them.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.513
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:19.020
MICHAEL SHORT: So we'll see
how many we can get through.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.723
But let's get into
the science first,

00:01:20.723 --> 00:01:22.640
so you can understand a
bit about what goes on

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.680
with ionizing radiation.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.650
Like radiation
damage in materials,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.660
radiation damage and
biological systems

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.960
is an extremely
multi-time-scale process.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.200
Everything from the physical
stage, or the ballistic stage,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.020
of radiation damage
to biological tissues

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.840
acting on femtoseconds,
where this

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.290
is just the physical knocking
about atoms and creation

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.220
of free radicals, these ionized
species, which in metals you

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.950
wouldn't care about, in
biological organisms you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.260
do because then they
undergo chemical

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.690
reactions from the
initial movement

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.470
and creation of other
strange radiolytic species

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.080
and the diffusion and
reaction of those things,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.120
which starts and
finishes in about a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.810
microsecond, before most of
these things are neutralized.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.260
And then, later on, the buildup
of those oxidative byproducts

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.710
of these chemical reactions
undergo the biological stages

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.480
of radiation damage.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.180
All of the free radicals
with biological molecules

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.310
have reacted within
a millisecond.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.800
So radiation goes in, a
millisecond later the damage

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.880
is done.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.700
Then you start to affect,
let's say, cell division.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
It takes, on average, minutes
for a rapidly dividing cell

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.267
to undergo a division.

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:34.850
That's when the
effects would first be

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.100
manifest from a DNA mutation.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.730
But then it'd take
things like weeks,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.760
or years for these
sorts of things

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.890
to manifest in a
health-related aspect.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.880
So, the division of one
cancerous cell into two

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.860
won't change the way
your body functions,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.100
but the doubling in size of a
tumor that blocks other tissue

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.500
absolutely would.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.530
And so, it all starts in
this sub-femtosecond regime,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.470
when most of you-- well,
for this entire year,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.750
we've been approximating
humans as water.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.180
We're going to continue
to do so for the purposes

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.540
of these biological effects.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.470
So, let's say you, a
giant sack of water,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.870
gets irradiated by a gamma ray.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.020
And that gamma ray undergoes
Compton scattering.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.710
Which, now you know how to tell
what the energy of the Compton

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.683
electron would be.

00:03:19.683 --> 00:03:22.100
We never talked about what
happens with the molecule where

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.090
it came from.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.710
That molecule remains ionized.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.070
And since you're not especially
electrically conductive,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.020
they're not neutralized
immediately.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.320
And you can be left over
with either a free radical

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.080
or an electron in
an excited state.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.150
And then what happens
next is the whole basis

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.540
of radiation damage to
biological organisms.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.440
These free radicals can
then encounter other ones,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.080
and let's say an H2O+, can
very quickly find a neighboring

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.190
water molecule, which they're
almost touching and form OH

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.880
and H3O.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.650
This is better known as H+, and
that OH is a kind of unstable

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.760
molecule.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.920
And these excited electrons
here can also become these

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.460
H2O+'s, leading to this cascade
of what we call radiolysis

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.850
reactions.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.310
There's a few of
them listed here,

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.860
things like an OH plus
an aqueous electron,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.760
which could come from anywhere,
like Compton scattering,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.060
like any other biological
process that frees an electron,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.010
can make another OH-.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.010
So you can locally change
the pH inside the cell

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.930
that you happen
to be irradiating.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.830
Or, let's say any of
these oxidative byproducts

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.420
could encounter DNA.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.700
Rip off or add an electron to
one of the guanine, thymine,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.380
or other two or three
bases in DNA or RNA,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.840
then you've changed the
genetic code of the cell.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.210
In the progression of these
radiologists byproducts,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.020
like I mentioned, whether you
go by excitation or ionization,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.860
then you start to build up
these six species-- these five

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.230
species tend to be--
or these six ones

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.290
tend to be the ending
byproducts of a whole host

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.502
of radiolysis reactions.

00:04:59.502 --> 00:05:00.960
And don't worry,
you're never going

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.730
to have to memorize
all the radiolysis

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.690
reactions because the mechanism
map is fairly complicated

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.037
and there are multiple
routes to creating each one.

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:10.620
But the ones that
are highlighted here

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.390
in these squares,
are the ones that

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.200
end up building up in your
body, things like peroxide.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.110
Has anyone ever put
peroxide on a wound before?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.020
What happens?

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.520
Yell it out.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.390
AUDIENCE: It bubbles up.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.380
MICHAEL SHORT: Bubbles up.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.390
What happens when you
form peroxide in your body

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.552
from radiation?

00:05:25.552 --> 00:05:26.790
AUDIENCE: It bubbles up.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.665
MICHAEL SHORT: Well,
luckily it doesn't quite

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:30.270
bubble up on the
macro scale level,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.390
but it is a vigorous oxidizer.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.920
90% H2O2 is used as rocket
fuel, as the oxidizing species

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.000
in rocket fuel.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.160
You don't make 90% H2O2
from getting irradiated,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.980
but every molecule counts.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.290
Things like O2, you're
shifting the amount

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.120
of oxygen in the cells.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.430
And then there's things like
these superoxide radicals,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.130
or H2O-, H2O+, or all these
other things that are available

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.920
to rip off or add an electron
to something else that normally

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.210
wouldn't have it.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.880
And the list of these
potential reactions,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.250
as well as their equilibrium
constants and activation

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.060
energy, is huge.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.350
Here's half of it.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.030
Notice a lot of
these equilibrium

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.610
constants shift really
strongly one way or the other.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.430
So, just because these
molecules are made,

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.930
doesn't mean that
all of them end up

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.940
staying and doing damage.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.910
But unless these rate constants
are either 0 or infinity,

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.610
there's going to be some dynamic
equilibrium of these reactions.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.090
So, once in a while, some
of these free radicals

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.320
will escape the cloud of
chemical change and charge

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.180
and get to something else.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.340
Here's the other half
of the equation set.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.010
And it's under debate just
how many of these reactions

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.860
there actually are.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.630
Like, how often would O2-
radicals combine with water,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.290
which you can see is not
quite set in the reaction,

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:57.740
to form [? HO2 - NO2 NH+ ?] Kind
of a strange little reaction

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.460
right there.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.810
Actually, a lot of
them are quite strange.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.518
You don't usually
think of them happening

00:07:01.518 --> 00:07:05.240
because these are very transient
reactions, whose byproducts

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.710
do build up.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.530
And that's the chemical
basis for radiation damage

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.360
to biological tissues.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.720
Now, once those
chemical products form,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.150
they have to move or diffuse.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.570
So you can actually calculate
or get diffusion coefficients

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.330
for some of these
oxidizing species,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.490
as well as compute
an average radius

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.620
that they'll remove before
undergoing a reaction.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.830
So this is part of
the basis for why

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.490
alpha radiation is a lot more
damaging than gamma radiation.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.820
Chances are, if you incorporate
an alpha emitter into the cell,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.680
it does a whole bunch of damage.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.490
That damage consists of these
oxidative chemical species,

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.420
that, if they're that far away
from neighboring atoms that

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.360
happen to be in DNA, they
might do some damage.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.450
Whereas, isolated Compton
scatters and photoelectric

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.810
exhortations from gamma
radiation, not so much.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.140
Chances are you hit random
water in the cell that

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.350
isn't quite close to anything,
fragile, and not much happens.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.820
But you can also see this by
looking at charged particle

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.320
tracks.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.110
These things can actually
be experimentally measured.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.080
By firing electrons into gel
or film or something like that,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.860
you can actually see
tracks of ionization

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.580
and watch them as
a function of time.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.300
In this case, it's a simulation
of a charged particle

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.820
track at different timescales.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.620
So, right here, this
10 to the minus 12

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.080
for the time in
seconds, tells you

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.110
where these radiolysis
products are.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.549
And the N number, here, tells
you how many of those remain.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.640
So after a picosecond,
you can pretty much just

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.420
trace out the path that the
electron took, starts off right

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.390
here.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.550
What do you guys notice
about the density

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.700
of the charged particle track
as it moves from the source

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.560
to the end?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.310
AUDIENCE: It's much
more dense at the end.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.268
MICHAEL SHORT: It's much
more dense at the end.

00:08:59.268 --> 00:09:00.982
And why do you think that is?

00:09:00.982 --> 00:09:02.400
AUDIENCE: Stopping power.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.150
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.020
More than just-- yeah.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.937
Stopping power, yes, but
fill in the beginning

00:09:05.937 --> 00:09:07.170
and end of that sentence.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:07.980
Chris, do you have your hand up?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.920
AUDIENCE: [? It's all good. ?]
So, it's a charged particle,

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.345
so it drops off most of it's
energy where it has the least

00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:14.903
amount of energy, so it does
the most damage [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:14.903 --> 00:09:16.070
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.870
So, you're actually
visualizing the change

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.050
in stopping power as a function
of charged particle energy.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.750
It comes in, has a
very high energy.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.728
And it might knock a little
radiation damage cascade

00:09:26.728 --> 00:09:28.520
by hitting another
electron, which can have

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.490
its own shower of ionization.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.470
And then it moves while doing
nothing, in this straight line,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.850
until it hits another one.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.650
And notice right
at the end, that's

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.130
where the densest amount of
damage is done because that's

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.020
where the stopping
power is the highest.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.060
It's also where the
energy is the lowest.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.700
So, this is where the worlds
of and physics collide.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.000
You can actually visualize
stopping power, like actually

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.120
visually in gel or on
film or on a computer

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.490
by watching these
charged particle tracks.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.110
And after 10 to the
minus 12 seconds,

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.760
all the ballistics are over.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.680
Then you end up with
diffusion and reaction.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.640
So, it's going to be a balance
between these charged particles

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.640
moving away from each other
and finding something else,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.550
or finding each other
and re-combining.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.190
And that's why, as you
go up in timescale,

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.280
the particle tracks get
more and more diffuse

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.040
and the number of these
remaining free radicals

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.402
goes down until you level
out at about a microsecond,

00:10:23.402 --> 00:10:24.860
when all of the
different particles

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.402
are so spread out
that there are none

00:10:26.402 --> 00:10:28.850
touching each other anymore.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.615
To refresh your memory a
bit from a few seconds ago,

00:10:31.615 --> 00:10:32.990
take a look at
some of the charge

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.110
states of these
oxidative byproducts.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:41.190
Some of them plus, some of them
minus, sum of them excited,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.120
all over the place.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.220
So they can react
with each other, which

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.710
is something you'd want
to encourage so that they

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.750
don't go and find
something else, causing

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.370
biological damage.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.090
There's a question on last
year's OCW problem set,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.310
that I'm not giving
you for this one, which

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.230
is, calculate the
radiation resistance you

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.365
would get by getting
cryogenically frozen.

00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:03.740
So here's a question
that I don't

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.260
think a lot of cryogenicists
ask themselves,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.750
if you want to preserve
a human for 10,000 years

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.150
and wake them up later,
how much radiation damage

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.025
are you going to get?

00:11:14.267 --> 00:11:15.850
Ever think there's
a cryogenicist that

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.370
ask themselves that question?

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.110
I don't actually know.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.068
But it's not a question
I've ever heard before,

00:11:21.068 --> 00:11:22.985
which is why I made it
a problem set question.

00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:24.855
Because I know the
answer is not out there.

00:11:24.855 --> 00:11:25.730
I looked for a while.

00:11:29.637 --> 00:11:31.470
Let's switch particles
for a second and look

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.080
at the charged particle
tracks from a proton.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.733
What differences do you
see between the proton

00:11:36.733 --> 00:11:38.400
and the electron
charged particle track?

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.920
So, proton, electron.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.930
Proton, electron.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.630
AUDIENCE: There's no curve.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.220
MICHAEL SHORT: There's what?

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:49.560
AUDIENCE: There's curve.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:49.900
It's straight.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.067
MICHAEL SHORT: Its straight.

00:11:51.067 --> 00:11:54.320
Why do you think it's straight?

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.416
Why does anyone
think it's straight?

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:57.458
AUDIENCE: They're bigger.

00:11:57.458 --> 00:11:59.870
MICHAEL SHORT: They are
bigger, more massive.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.410
So the same deflection, the
same transfer of momentum,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:08.570
to an electron using our beloved
hollow cylinder approximation

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:13.490
thing, causes less of a change
in direction for a proton

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.930
as it does an electron.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.620
The forces are the same.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.670
They're both just a plus
or minus 1 hitting a plus

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.200
or minus 1 charge.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.250
But the mass is quite
different on the proton,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.750
so it doesn't get
deflected as much,

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.125
which is why the
charged particle

00:12:27.125 --> 00:12:29.600
tracks are so straight.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.210
Now, what are these things here?

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.340
What are those offshoots?

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.745
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:35.745 --> 00:12:38.120
MICHAEL SHORT: They're secondary
charged particle tracks.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.410
So, let's say a proton
hits an electron,

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.030
that electron can have any
amount of energy, probably

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.915
going to be lower
than the proton did.

00:12:45.915 --> 00:12:47.790
And it's going to cause
its own little damage

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.380
cascade right there.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.670
And, just like before, you
can track the number of these

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.320
charged particle trucks moving
from 5000 to about 1000,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.960
between, let's
say, 10 picoseconds

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.120
and a little less
than a microsecond.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.000
And once these charged particles
have spread out or diffused

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.940
away, chances are recombination
has gone down quite a bit

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.970
and they're going to go
react with other things.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.690
And this is a perfect analogy
to radiation damage in metal.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.690
So, radiation damage in biology
is like radiation damage

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.170
in material science.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.990
You have this initial
cluster of damage,

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.260
in materials it's usually
vacancies or intestinals,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.880
in biology it's
charged particles.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.730
But when they're
in a dense cascade

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.355
they can recombine
with each other.

00:13:31.355 --> 00:13:32.730
And the ones that
miss each other

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.940
go off to find either other
defects in the material

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.630
or other atoms in your cells.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.740
It's a very fitting analogy.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.240
Yeah?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.270
AUDIENCE: How come we don't
see like a denser [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.630
to the proton
[INAUDIBLE] electrons?

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's see.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.190
I don't know if we see the whole
charged particle track here.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.440
You're right, it doesn't
look like the density changes

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:55.940
very much.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.110
You can't even really
tell where the source is.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.490
We may not be looking
at the whole thing.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.490
Here's another question.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.060
So, it's a 2 MeV proton.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.730
That scale bar is 0.1 microns.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.600
Let's do a quick simulation
to verify this idea.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.030
Luckily we have the
tools to do this,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.150
soon as I clone my screen.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.670
Let's use SRIM and find out what
is the range of 2 MeV protons

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.450
in water.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.270
And if it's more than about a
micron, which is what's shown--

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.920
well, let's say,
that's 2 microns.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.253
If it's more than 2 microns,
what's shown on the screen,

00:14:26.253 --> 00:14:29.530
it means we're not
seeing the whole track.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.690
SRIM.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.450
Good, you can see it.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:38.580
So let's say, hydrogen at 2 MeV,
going into something consisting

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:44.700
of H and O in a
ratio of 2:1, make

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.140
sure its density is correct
for room temperature water,

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.700
and let's look at a
range of 25 microns,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.450
because I kind of
already know the answer.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.770
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.690
MICHAEL SHORT: Much
more than 25 microns.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.340
So, our initial
assertion was correct.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.331
Let's actually find
out what the range is.

00:15:03.331 --> 00:15:06.220
Let's put 40 microns.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.620
Whew, it's a little
more than I thought.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.818
Protons in water, at just 2 MeV.

00:15:14.818 --> 00:15:18.910
Let's fly tons of them.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.140
Wait til we get about 1,000.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.640
Look at the range.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.470
Make it bigger so
you can read it.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.030
75 microns.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.708
75.5 micron range.

00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:31.250
There you go.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.302
Let's go back to the big one.

00:15:37.302 --> 00:15:38.010
So, there you go.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.160
If this scale bar is 0.1
microns, you're looking about 2

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.650
of the 75 microns of
charged particle track.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.900
Interesting, no one picked
up that question last year,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.100
but I'm glad you did.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.495
I'm glad we were able to
show you where it comes from.

00:15:50.495 --> 00:15:51.870
So this will look
quite different

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.970
if you're looking at the end
of the charged particle track.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:55.470
Cool.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.260
Good question.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.880
To look really,
really close up, you

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.980
see a lot more of
this branching again.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.740
So whenever a proton strikes,
let's say another atom

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.950
or an electron, you get your
own little dense damage cascade.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.000
And look at that, not
much until the very end

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.620
when you get this cloud of
damage popping off at the end.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.320
So, yet more examples of the
physics that you've learned

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.295
popping up in
biological systems.

00:16:19.295 --> 00:16:20.920
The difference is
it's water not metal,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.600
but otherwise
everything's the same.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.743
And then we get to
what's called G-values.

00:16:27.743 --> 00:16:29.410
I don't know why it's
called G, but I'll

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.210
tell you what they mean.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:36.640
It's the number of each species,
per 100 MeV, found later,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.430
at let's say, 0.28 microseconds,
or typically 1 microsecond,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.820
for different particles
of various energies.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.240
These are relative
effectiveness' of these

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.600
particles at different energies
to leave oxidative byproducts

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.410
by.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.818
So there's a few things that are
wrapped up into these G-values.

00:16:53.818 --> 00:16:55.360
So, notice that, in
this case, here's

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.680
a G-value for electron energy.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.590
At different
energies, you'll have

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:05.710
different amounts of OH, H3O
in such, per 100 eV of energy.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.900
So the unit of
G-values here, it's

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.109
like number of chemical
species per 100 eV of energy.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:16.010
So it's an energy normalized
measure of the effectiveness

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.140
of radiation making chemicals.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.190
Does make sense to folks?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.536
If not, raise your hand
and I'll try to re-explain.

00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:24.036
OK.

00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:24.920
AUDIENCE: Please repeat it.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.712
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:31.720
So a G-value, it's got units in
concentration per unit energy.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.200
And it's a measure
of how many chemicals

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.920
a given particle will make
as a function of its energy.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.440
And these particles are the ones
that survive the recombination

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.940
and end up diffusing
to other species.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.480
So, these G-values, it's
kind of like how many

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.210
oxidative species are made that
go off and damage other things?

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.320
Let's look at some
trends right here.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.540
For things like
OH, for electrons,

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.960
what sort of patterns do
you notice in the data?

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.480
And take a sec to parse
some of these numbers.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.460
Just look at the top three rows.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.460
What pattern do you see?

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.740
AUDIENCE: Starts
high and then goes--

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.170
MICHAEL SHORT: Starts high,
goes low, goes high again.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.007
Why do you think that is?

00:18:23.007 --> 00:18:24.090
Straight from the physics.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.780
At super low energies,
100 eV electron,

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.360
you'll make, on
average, 1 OH radical

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.880
for every 100 eV of energy.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.760
As you increase in
energy, you start

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.282
making fewer and
fewer per unit--

00:18:42.282 --> 00:18:44.240
actually, that's not the
one I want to look at.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.560
That's a different species.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.742
Let's see.

00:18:47.742 --> 00:18:48.490
No, that is.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:48.990
OK.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.735
That follows the pattern
that we're looking for.

00:18:51.735 --> 00:18:53.360
AUDIENCE: Does the
high energy includes

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.120
stuff that's created from
causing secondary cascades?

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yeah.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.800
This is just total
number from everything.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.150
Right?

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.610
It's just the number of each
chemical species left over

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.350
after a microsecond.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.070
So what do you think could
cause this initial increase

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.570
and then decrease
and then increase?

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.620
AUDIENCE: Is it because
of the cross-sections

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.650
of different particles?

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.733
MICHAEL SHORT: Part of it.

00:19:17.733 --> 00:19:20.070
The cross-sections that also
go into the stopping power.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.153
That's part of the answer.

00:19:21.153 --> 00:19:23.070
So at really low
energies, you're already

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.170
at your stopping power peak.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.720
And that way, for the little
bit of energy you have,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.950
chances are it's going to
ionize different things.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.240
Then as you increase
your energy,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.070
you have more and
more of that range

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.470
of the particle in the
lower stopping power region.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.860
So, you'll have more
of the-- let's see.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.950
You'll have more and
more of that particle--

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.052
let me try and phrase
this quite well.

00:19:48.052 --> 00:19:50.510
Let's go back to the charged
particle tracks for electrons,

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.520
and I'll get this--
yeah, here we go.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.950
So, when you're electron comes
in a really, really low energy,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.397
you're in that
region right there.

00:19:58.397 --> 00:19:59.980
Chances are you're
going to make a lot

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.720
of those oxidative byproducts.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.610
And then as you go a
little higher in energy,

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.170
you make fewer per
unit distance--

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.270
or you make fewer
per unit energy.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.960
You can think of that as
the spread, right there.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.540
But then also, as you
go way higher in energy,

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.133
your ability to
ionize increases.

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:19.800
So you've got that
sort of 1 over E term

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.620
in stopping power
making things worse.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.120
And you've got
that log of E term

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.130
in stopping power
making things better.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.920
And if we go back to
the data right here,

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.720
for those top three
or four, it tends

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.330
to follow that
trend pretty well.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.020
Now what about things like H202?

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.094
What sort of trend
do you see there?

00:20:42.094 --> 00:20:43.480
AUDIENCE: The opposite.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.320
MICHAEL SHORT: The opposite.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.410
So, I'll give you a hint.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.930
H2O2 isn't directly
made by radiolysis,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.860
it tends to occur by reaction
of other radiolysis products.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.420
So it's like a
secondary chemical,

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.580
not a primary produced chemical.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.490
So, why do you think H2O2
follows the opposite trend?

00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:15.900
AUDIENCE: It comes from
the-- not the decay,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.990
but like a reaction from one of
the previous ones, that there's

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.970
more of that first
species there, that it

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.320
hasn't reacted to form it yet.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.520
But once it is
lowered, that means

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.847
it's made more of the H2O2.

00:21:25.847 --> 00:21:26.680
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.840
AUDIENCE: And then vice versa.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.673
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:21:28.673 --> 00:21:30.980
So, to rephrase what Sarah
said, in this energy range

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.810
right here, you're producing
this fairly dense cascade

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.108
of oxidative byproducts.

00:21:38.108 --> 00:21:39.650
When those reactions
occur, they tend

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.410
to make things like
H2O2, something that's

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.170
not made directly from
radiolysis, but indirectly

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.480
from recombination
of those chemicals.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.200
And then as you raise the energy
more and more, to like 20 keV,

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.100
you start making those primary
products more spread out.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.780
They're not as
close to each other.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.170
They don't recombine as much.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.870
They don't make as much H2O2.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.060
They'll tend, instead, to
spread out a little more.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.350
So more will survive.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.770
More of these primary
ones will survive, and not

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.800
react to make as many
of the secondary ones.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.370
So, how is that explanation
fitting with you guys?

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:14.870
Cool.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.500
So, it's a balance between
intermediate energies.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.330
You make a whole lot
of primary ones, which

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.480
are so close that they react to
make the secondary species much

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.710
more easily.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.590
As you raise the energy
of the particles going in,

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.950
you make more isolated primaries
that can't find each other,

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:36.120
and they don't make as many
secondaries per unit energy.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:36.700
Yeah?

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.510
AUDIENCE: How come for like
the 100 eV H2O2 it's less?

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.460
Because since it's making
a lot of the initial,

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.080
or the primary,
byproducts, wouldn't you

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.510
expect it to also make
a lot of the secondary

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.190
because they're
also close together?

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.650
MICHAEL SHORT: You might,
except at very low energies,

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.690
our idea of stopping power
isn't quite as complete.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.597
So, by what other processes
can electrons lose energy

00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:02.555
at really low energies?

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.730
You could have a deflection
without an ionization, right?

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.260
Just a simple-- let's say,
you could have an excitation,

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.483
you could have just
coulomb deflection,

00:23:16.483 --> 00:23:17.650
you can have neutralization.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.942
You can have all those really,
really low energy things

00:23:19.942 --> 00:23:23.170
that go on, that don't end up
producing as many ionizations.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.230
Because you need to produce
an ionization or an excitation

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.237
to kick off radiolysis.

00:23:28.237 --> 00:23:30.070
So then, when you get
high enough in energy,

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.500
and chances are you'll
ionize rather than undergo

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.160
one of these really low
energy inner loss mechanisms,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.800
then you start making
more of the primaries,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.800
but densely, which make
more of the secondaries.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.930
Then as you go even
higher in energy,

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.753
you still make
tons of primaries,

00:23:45.753 --> 00:23:47.170
but since they're
spread out more,

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.880
since the stopping
power is lower,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.650
they don't find
each other and they

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.310
don't make as many secondaries.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.850
So, let's look at some
other numbers and trends,

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.140
different particles.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.530
First of all, for protons
and for alpha particles,

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.720
note here that the
scales are in MeV.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.040
Whereas, the G-Value is for
electrons in the keV range,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.290
and for protons in the MeV
range are pretty much the same,

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.450
on the same order of magnitude.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.650
Anyone have any idea why?

00:24:21.997 --> 00:24:23.450
AUDIENCE: They're heavier.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:24.742
MICHAEL SHORT: They're heavier.

00:24:24.742 --> 00:24:27.620
And then what does that lead to
in terms of a stopping power?

00:24:34.578 --> 00:24:35.953
AUDIENCE: They're
easier to stop.

00:24:35.953 --> 00:24:37.911
MICHAEL SHORT: They're
actually harder to stop.

00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:40.440
If they're heavier, than the
deflection of an electron

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.840
doesn't stop them as much.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.990
And so that way, more of these
proton and alpha radiolysis

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.760
products are going to
be more spread out.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.760
So you get the same
number per 100 MeV,

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.880
in the MeV range, as
you do for electrons

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.900
at a much lower energy.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.900
But then alphas also have
this interesting thing

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.420
that they're doubly charged,
so that those coulomb

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.550
forces, remember
it's by Z squared,

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.870
so it's four times as strong.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.940
So, let's see, how
do they compare?

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.440
Yeah.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.900
There aren't really enough
data to draw those nice trends

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.830
that you could see
from electrons.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.380
But we do have some
other interesting trends

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.090
in the G-values as a
function of temperature.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:27.580
So these right here are
G-values for H and OH

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.330
by gamma rays, which
are two primary species.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.450
And here we've graphed them
as a function of temperature.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.120
Why do you think the
G-values, or the amount

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.960
of radiolysis products that
survive a microsecond, increase

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.122
with temperature?

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.330
What's this a competing
force or a balance between?

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.932
So once these products are
made, what are the two things

00:25:56.932 --> 00:25:57.640
that they can do?

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.160
Anyone?

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.660
AUDIENCE: Recombine or diffuse.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.630
MICHAEL SHORT:
Recombine or diffuse.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.920
Good.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.470
Which of these will
increase much more strongly

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.170
with temperature?

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.150
AUDIENCE: Diffusion.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.770
MICHAEL SHORT: Diffusion.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.590
If they spread out more at
higher temperature, then

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.160
they'll separate from each
other and not recombine as much.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.770
So a whole bunch will
be made, no matter what,

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.510
in a matter of femtoseconds.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.790
But at a higher
temperature, more of them

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:36.150
diffuse away from each other
and survive the cascade,

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.930
rather than recombining.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:42.270
And so that's why, when you look
at any primary species, H2 or H

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.840
or anything like
that, you're going

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.822
to see an increase in
G-values with temperature.

00:26:46.822 --> 00:26:48.530
What do you guys think
is going to happen

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.110
to these secondary
byproducts with temperature?

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.610
AUDIENCE: Decrease
with temperature.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.610
MICHAEL SHORT: Decrease.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.635
And why do you say so?

00:26:54.635 --> 00:26:57.010
AUDIENCE: Well, if they're
made from the primary products

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.750
and the primary products are
surviving more because they're

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.380
separating, then the secondary
ones are just going to be less.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.250
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.680
If the primary ones
are surviving more,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.110
you're not going to make
as many secondary ones.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.400
And that's just what we see.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.740
Number of free electrons
left, or especially things

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.340
like the amount of H2O2, it's
all going to be in balance.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.470
And if more primaries
survive, you

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.890
don't make as many secondaries
as a function of temperature.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.410
One, these heavy ones
are slower to diffuse.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.350
But two, they're
not made as much

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:32.040
because the primaries escape
each others pull and go off

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.570
to damage something else.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.840
In a reactor, this would be
metals causing oxidation.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.270
In a body this would be you.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.470
And so let's get into the
materials aspect of this

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.910
to give you a more--

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.920
a less biologically
damaging view

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.960
of what can
radiolysis really do.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.010
It's quite relevant to
all reactors, including

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.660
the Fukushima reactor.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.460
The idea there is
that the reactor

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.370
was flooded with seawater,
which introduces chlorine,

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.680
which greatly
changes the balance

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.830
of radiolytic byproducts.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.700
And this can actually
be directly studied.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.030
There's an experiment
just a few years ago--

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.400
two years ago, where
they wanted to figure out

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.310
what is the influence of
radiolysis on corrosion?

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.150
If you're making all of
these Hs and OH-s and H2O+s,

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.220
does it change the
corrosion rate of materials

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.420
in the reactor?

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.315
So they built a
high-pressure cell,

00:28:22.315 --> 00:28:24.440
that they fill with
high-pressure, high-temperature

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.460
water.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.000
And they've got this little disk
of metal with a thin membrane

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.720
right there.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.660
It's thin enough that
protons can pass through it

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.600
and cause radiolysis to occur
right in this little pocket

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.490
where the water is.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.370
And so where the protons
are, you get radiolysis.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.950
Where the protons aren't,
you get regular old water

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.530
corrosion.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.840
And the results are
pretty astounding.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.490
You can see the irradiated
zone in extra oxide thickness.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.160
So you can see where
the protons were

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.950
because radiolysis
sped up the corrosion

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.900
rate as a single effect.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.710
Right nearby, not
100 microns away,

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.100
was the same water, at the same
temperature and pressure, just

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.610
no protons and no radiolysis.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.220
To look at a cross-section,
you can very clearly

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.890
see the difference
in oxide thickness

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:19.230
way out in the unirradiated
zone or in the irradiated zone.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.500
And you can tell
right here how many

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.870
protons there were,
until right over here

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.340
where there were none.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.530
So it's a very striking
example of, well,

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.080
this is what radiolysis
does in reactors.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.700
And we actually do
things in reactors

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.890
to suppress radiolysis.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.990
We inject hydrogen gas.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.500
So there's a hydrogen gas
overpressure injected.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.995
One of the main reasons
is to suppress radiolysis.

00:29:42.995 --> 00:29:47.960
Because if I jump back to any of
these reactions, a lot of them

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.220
involve H2.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.750
And if you dump a whole
bunch of H2 into the reactor,

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.950
you push the reaction backwards
in the other direction.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.920
From straight up chemistry,
if you add a reactant

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.930
and add a product, you
push the equilibrium

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.380
in the other direction.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.010
That's why we do this in
terms of injecting hydrogen

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.677
into light water reactors.

00:30:09.677 --> 00:30:11.760
And if you look at the
amount of hydrogen injected

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.930
in a PWR, a pressurized water
reactor, which comprises 2/3

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.580
of the reactors in
the country, it's

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.940
like 20 to 30 cubic centimeters
per kilogram of dissolved

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.310
hydrogen. That's quite a bit.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.400
And the whole idea there
is to suppress radiolysis

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.638
and suppress corrosion.

00:30:29.638 --> 00:30:30.930
So I find it to be pretty cool.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.940
So a knowledge of G-values
can keep your reactor

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.470
from corroding.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.750
Then let's get into
the biological effects.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.000
In the end, for the
long-term effect

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.210
it's all about what
happens to DNA.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.180
Because if a cell
mutates, it can either

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.120
kill the cell so that
it can't replicate,

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.770
or you can cause a
mutation that might

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.250
make some sort of a change and
change the cell's function.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.200
And so you may imagine,
a lot of this stuff

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.990
is done in LET, linear
energy transfer.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.310
Again, another word
for stopping power.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.390
If you look at the density
of these damaged cascades

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.900
as a function of
stopping power, LET.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.700
You can see that for high-energy
electrons, or beta particles,

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.890
they just bounce around
with a lot of distance

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.300
between interactions, causing
very relatively little damage

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.530
on the way.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.170
For Auger electrons,
again electrons,

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.720
but at a much lower energy.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.458
They're at the end of
their stopping power curve

00:31:27.458 --> 00:31:29.500
and they cause a lot more
damage wherever they're

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.000
emitted because already, they're
going to make a much denser

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.430
damage cascade.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.910
Alpha particles just
go slamming through.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.202
It's like rolling a tank
through your cell pretty much.

00:31:39.202 --> 00:31:41.243
Because there's going to
be a ton of interactions

00:31:41.243 --> 00:31:42.940
from charged particle
interactions,

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.610
you won't really change
the path of that alpha

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.920
because an electron imparts
very little momentum

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.420
to an alpha particle.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.120
And if DNA happens to be in the
way, it's going to get damaged.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.700
This is a lot of
the reason why there

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.780
is relative effectiveness of
different types of radiation.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.420
We talked last week about
these quality factors,

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.080
gamma rays are 1 electrons
tend to be pretty close to 1

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.280
alphas tend to be 20.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.340
Because the same
energy alpha particle

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.300
will impart a ton more damage
locally than the same energy

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.207
beta particle.

00:32:15.207 --> 00:32:17.540
So can you guys see visually
where these quality factors

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.760
come from?

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.620
Cool.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:25.250
And there's two types of DNA
damage, direct and indirect.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.340
Direct damage is
what you might think

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.120
radiation comes in and
ionizes something in the DNA,

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.790
either causing, let's say,
2 thymine-based bridge,

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.460
like a kink in the
DNA, or destroying it

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.930
or doing anything.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.660
But most of the damage
is done indirectly

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.150
because the amount of
volume of DNA in your cells

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:44.870
is extremely low.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.590
Has anyone ever done the old
high school bio experiment,

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.225
where you extract
DNA from onions?

00:32:49.225 --> 00:32:49.907
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:49.907 --> 00:32:51.100
AUDIENCE: Strawberries.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.267
MICHAEL SHORT: Strawberries.

00:32:52.267 --> 00:32:52.810
Anything?

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.240
So how did you do it?

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.246
Anyone remember
how this was done?

00:32:57.246 --> 00:32:58.980
AUDIENCE: Some
chemicals and stuff.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.730
AUDIENCE: You have to
mix in good solution

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.450
with a bunch of good
stuff and [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.450
MICHAEL SHORT: So you
take, let's say, an onion,

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.158
mix it in solution
with a bunch of stuff,

00:33:07.158 --> 00:33:09.290
and you end up with
this gigantic booger,

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.620
which happens to be DNA.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.048
It's like a
three-foot snot thing.

00:33:13.048 --> 00:33:14.840
But what was the volume
of the DNA compared

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.400
to the volume of the onion?

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.435
AUDIENCE: Quite small.

00:33:17.435 --> 00:33:18.560
MICHAEL SHORT: Quite small.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.670
There's not a lot
of DNA in cells.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.330
So the direct damage
route, while still there,

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.180
comprises very little of
the damage done to tissue.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.430
Mostly it's indirect
because surrounding

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.060
all DNA is the rest of
your cellular fluid, which

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.950
consists mostly of water.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.520
And as we've seen all today,
water undergoes radiolysis.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.210
Those radiolytic byproducts can
diffuse, find their way to DNA,

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.490
and cause the same
sort of ionization

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.560
that direct radiation would do.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.420
And since that volume
is much larger,

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:51.230
let's say the hollow cylinder
of water surrounding your DNA,

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.800
this is the most likely
route to cellular damage.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.180
And--

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.430
Actually I want to skip ahead
to something real quick,

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.640
you can actually use
that to your advantage

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.830
because it can kill tumor cells.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:10.429
So tumors are rapidly dividing
masses of cancer cells.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:11.949
If those cells are
rapidly dividing,

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:15.199
then DNA is being replicated
much more readily.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.550
So you can inject
something that will

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.159
bind to DNA, like this
little chemical right

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:25.510
here, this Iodine-125,
whatever, whatever, which

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:29.380
mimics thymidine, something
that would be found in your DNA,

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.780
but absorbs radiation
much better.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.300
So you can inject this
iodine-containing organic

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.670
molecule, which
binds somehow to DNA.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:39.550
I'm not going to even
guess how it works.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.850
But, if you want
this to get damaged,

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.820
then you want-- let's say, your
DNA to get preferably damaged,

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.488
the tumors are
replicating faster,

00:34:47.488 --> 00:34:49.780
they're going to incur more
damage from the same amount

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.830
of radiation.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:53.080
So the same process
that causes cancer

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.980
can be used to cure cancer,
interestingly enough.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.950
And so, good, we do have
about 10 or 12 minutes

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.960
to talk pseudoscience.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.030
So now that you know
a little bit about how

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.640
radiation can cause
cancer and mutations

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.460
and you know a lot of the
physics behind how much energy

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.380
do you need to
cause an ionization,

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.210
let's start knocking off
these questions one by one.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.630
So, this field,
more than any, is

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.037
fraught with garbage,
absolute garbage science.

00:35:21.037 --> 00:35:23.120
I won't even say pseudoscience
because that almost

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.800
makes it sound half legit.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.240
Garbage, misinterpretations,
lies, poorly done studies,

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.840
misinterpretations of
abstracts and conclusions.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.470
And today I'd like to
focus on cell phones

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.570
and do they cause cancer?

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.650
Very hot topic.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:43.310
There's lots of people with
predetermined agendas that

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.770
want to say all electromagnetic
radiation is bad

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.052
and we should go back
to an agrarian society

00:35:48.052 --> 00:35:49.010
where nothing happened.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.020
Well, I'll give you a
hint, Cambodia tried that

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.750
and it didn't turn out too well.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:59.050
People have interesting notions
of what's real and what's not.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.860
So let's start looking
at some of these.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.740
There's an article written by
this fellow, Lloyd Burrell,

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.260
around November, 2014.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.800
It looks like it was
republished somewhere in 2016.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.260
Let's just start
looking at the facts.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.300
So, what I want to
start doing here

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.790
is cultivating your nose to
be able to smell bullshit

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.530
because this is a lot of what
you're going to be doing,

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.820
in terms of public outreach.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.860
As nuclear scientists
you will be called on

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.430
to provide expert advice and say
whether things are real or not,

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.740
explain why, and do it
in an empathetic way

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.010
so as not to make
people feel stupid.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.070
Because it's very easy for
someone to read this and think,

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.690
yeah, I should be afraid.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.770
Cell phones cause cancer.

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.592
It's a natural reaction to feel.

00:36:46.592 --> 00:36:48.300
Let's take a look at
some of these facts.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.170
Cell phones emit microwave
radio-frequency radiation.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.615
True or false?

00:36:54.615 --> 00:36:55.240
AUDIENCE: True.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.150
MICHAEL SHORT: True.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.840
Yeah.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.600
These are microwave
emitters, or RF emitters.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.690
What sort of energy is
microwave radiation emitted at?

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:09.184
Just give me an order of
magnitude, MeV, eV, keV.

00:37:09.184 --> 00:37:10.570
AUDIENCE: MeV?

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.400
MICHAEL SHORT: Little MeV.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.170
Fractions of an eV.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.120
It's far beyond
the visible range

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.010
in the lower energy spectrum.

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:22.270
Can a milli-electron-volt photon
cause an ionization directly?

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.260
AUDIENCE: No.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.280
MICHAEL SHORT: No.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.030
Microwaves and RF
non-ionizing radiation.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.060
They can cook things
by heating up water,

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.370
but they do not cause
ionizations the way

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.500
that ionizing radiation does.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.740
This radiation has an ability
to penetrate our bodies.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.460
True or false?

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.312
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:40.312 --> 00:37:40.812
True.

00:37:40.812 --> 00:37:42.180
MICHAEL SHORT: True.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.620
It gets through us, right?

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.037
Radio waves are going
through us all the time.

00:37:46.037 --> 00:37:48.120
Our governments do virtually
nothing to protect us

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.416
from these dangerous.

00:37:49.416 --> 00:37:51.083
AUDIENCE: Technically,
but what dangers?

00:37:51.083 --> 00:37:52.458
MICHAEL SHORT:
Technically, true.

00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:53.010
Yeah.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.610
So this is a classic example
of fear mongering, taking

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.500
a bunch of facts,
putting them together

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.688
to elicit an emotional
response that is incorrect.

00:38:01.688 --> 00:38:03.480
And because the emotional
part of the brain

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.900
kicks in far faster than logical
part of the brain, that's

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.460
how we're wired, it elicits a
reaction with a predetermined

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.640
conclusion.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.770
And yet, there is strong
evidence, multiple peer

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:14.520
reviewed studies--

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.645
I'm not even going to read
the rest of the sentence

00:38:16.645 --> 00:38:18.690
because I don't want to
go on record saying it

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.890
as if it were true.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.680
Let's, instead,
look at the studies,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.840
because that is the stuff
that we should trust.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
44 studies.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.700
MICHAEL SHORT: 44 studies cited.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.260
And let's look at
some of the reasons.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.140
Let's see, there's
a little bit--

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.690
I have to make it
a little smaller.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.253
Can you guys still
read that at the back?

00:38:38.253 --> 00:38:39.920
Or actually, no, make
it a little bigger

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.380
and forget the sidebar.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.420
That's better.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.580
OK.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.932
I was going to pick a
couple of these to show you

00:38:47.932 --> 00:38:50.140
and I started going through
them and my favorite ones

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.520
are all of them.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.920
Most of the studies are
perfectly legitimate,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.540
some of them are not.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.970
Most of the interpretations
by this Lloyd fellow

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.580
are absolutely wrong,
and either done

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.520
ignorantly, which
somewhat forgivable,

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.980
it can be hard to parse these
studies, or intentionally.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.900
We don't know which one.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.220
Let's look here.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.170
"Telecoms giant," et
cetera, "commissioned

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:15.328
an independent study--"
404, not found.

00:39:15.328 --> 00:39:16.370
Let's go to the next one.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:18.680
We can't conclude
anything from that.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:24.500
The Interphone Study found
that: "regular cell phone use

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.540
significantly increased
the risk of gliomas,"

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:32.610
some type of tumor, "by 40% with
1,640 hours or more of use."

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.745
Let's look at the key figure,
taken from this paper,

00:39:35.745 --> 00:39:37.120
and blow it up so
you can see it.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.600
What do you guys notice
about this figure?

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.475
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:43.475 --> 00:39:45.102
AUDIENCE: It's so [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:45.102 --> 00:39:46.810
MICHAEL SHORT: Forget
the low resolution.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:48.820
We can't knock that
because it might be a copy.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.890
No error bars.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.810
And what does most
of this cell phone

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:55.090
use-- and the unit
not shown here is,

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.718
I think it's like hours of use?

00:39:56.718 --> 00:39:58.135
AUDIENCE: It's all
about the same.

00:39:58.135 --> 00:39:59.960
It's basically all the same.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.832
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:02.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] by
any chance [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.220
AUDIENCE: The never is
actually closest to the 1.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.920
MICHAEL SHORT:
Except for this one.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.390
Blue line is odds ratio.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.430
A lot of these things are
given in OR, or odds ratio.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.710
Let's say the
fractional-- or let's

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.670
say the multiplying factor
for increased risk of finding

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:20.040
cancer in the variable group
compared to the control group.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.150
And control and variable
are interesting topics

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.370
I want to make sure people have.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:29.640
So we have the Interphone Study
cited in many of these papers.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.140
Let's see.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:30.640
OK.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.460
Garbage, garbage,
opinions, opinions.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.560
Let's go find the study.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.260
This is something I wish people
did more, is go to the study

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:38.760
itself.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.550
Yeah, the Interphone Study.

00:40:46.514 --> 00:40:48.490
AUDIENCE: Overall,
no increase in risk.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:49.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:53.260
MICHAEL SHORT: We'll make this
bigger to make it more obvious.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.305
So many people-- this article's
been cited almost 500 times.

00:40:56.305 --> 00:40:58.680
I don't know in what capacity
because I haven't looked up

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.730
every citation.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:02.190
But a lot of what this
site and other sites do

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:05.760
is cite the Interphone Study to
say cell phones cause cancer.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.425
Read the conclusion.

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:10.922
AUDIENCE: Rise of an era.

00:41:10.922 --> 00:41:13.668
Prevent [INAUDIBLE]
interpretation.

00:41:13.668 --> 00:41:14.460
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.410
So this study is
not a bogus study.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.200
The study was done
correctly, reporting

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.960
ORs, these odds ratios, with
95% confidence intervals.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.630
If you just look at
the numbers itself,

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:32.970
oh man, 1.15 odds ratio, 15%
higher incidence of cancer,

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:36.300
with a confidence interval
that includes less and more.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:41.190
So you cannot conclude with 95%
confidence that this data is

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.000
correct.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.820
And the authors
very honestly say,

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:49.660
no conclusion can be drawn,
require further investigation.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.851
What does this Lloyd fellow say?

00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:54.800
AUDIENCE: Cancer.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.740
MICHAEL SHORT: Cancer.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.220
Yeah.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.490
An either accidental or
deliberate misinterpretation

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.930
of the data.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:05.270
OK, let's go to numbers 2 and 3.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:09.060
I don't need those anymore.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.290
Let's see, number 2.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:11.280
Oh, we did number 2.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.957
Number 3, again from
the Interphone Study.

00:42:13.957 --> 00:42:15.540
We can discount that
because we've now

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.332
read the conclusion of
the study and looked

00:42:17.332 --> 00:42:18.525
at a bit of the difference.

00:42:18.525 --> 00:42:21.312
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:21.312 --> 00:42:23.520
MICHAEL SHORT: Number 4,
"Harmful Association Between

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.132
Cell Phone Risk and Tumors."

00:42:26.132 --> 00:42:30.326
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:30.326 --> 00:42:31.571
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's see.

00:42:31.571 --> 00:42:32.988
AUDIENCE: It says
there's possible

00:42:32.988 --> 00:42:33.780
AUDIENCE: Possible.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.724
Studies providing a
higher level of evidence

00:42:35.724 --> 00:42:37.140
are needed [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.130
MICHAEL SHORT: Again,
honest authors.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.370
I applaud the authors for
taking a controversial topic,

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.910
doing a fair bit of data,
with at least enough metadata

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.160
analysis, I think the sample
size is OK, and then saying,

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.750
higher level of
evidence is needed.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.240
What does the internet say?

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:59.530
It takes the one
sentence that they

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.390
want to support their
predetermined conclusion.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.820
Very dishonest, if you ask me.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.630
Number 5.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:07.812
Oh, this is fun.

00:43:07.812 --> 00:43:09.290
OK.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.430
What does number 5 say?

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.122
AUDIENCE: Does this not
just make you angry?

00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:11.470
MICHAEL SHORT: Huh?

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:12.700
AUDIENCE: Does this not
just make you angry?

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.408
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes it
does make me angry.

00:43:14.408 --> 00:43:16.000
This is why I'm
showing it to you.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.500
- infuriating, right?

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:22.000
But some of the
comparisons between what

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.460
the folks on the internet
will say with the sentence

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.640
that they want to
say- and then you

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.260
go to the actual
study, which they do

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.410
give you the link for,
"a consistent pattern

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.840
of increased risk associated
with wireless phones."

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.250
What does the study say?

00:43:46.538 --> 00:43:47.580
Take a sec to parse this.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.788
I'll make it a little bigger.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:03.760
When you see an odds ratio
of, let's say, greater than 1.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.186
And see a confidence interval--

00:44:05.186 --> 00:44:06.186
AUDIENCE: Oh, holy crap.

00:44:06.186 --> 00:44:06.682
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:44:06.682 --> 00:44:07.182
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:07.182 --> 00:44:08.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.440
Again, another odds ratio and
another confidence interval.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.740
Another odds ratio, another
confidence interval.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:19.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting.

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:21.530
The one interesting
part is for what

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.660
they call ipsilateral
cumulative use, which

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.300
means a tumor found on
the same side of the head

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.690
as the cell phone, there is
actually a confidence interval

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:31.590
that seems to be significant.

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:34.040
So, I'm not going
to trash this study.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.110
I'm going to say it's
not quite conclusive.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.410
It doesn't go out and say
cell phones cause cancer,

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.640
despite this fellow
coming out and saying

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.650
cell phones cause cancer.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:47.043
OK, moving on to
number 6, was a 404.

00:44:47.043 --> 00:44:47.835
Let's just confirm.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.740
Wasn't able to get
it an hour ago.

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.075
Oh, it's back.

00:44:55.075 --> 00:44:56.200
OK, let's see what it does.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.077
I don't even know what
this one's going to do.

00:44:59.077 --> 00:45:00.075
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:00.075 --> 00:45:02.071
AUDIENCE: Potential [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:05.065
AUDIENCE: Possible
association with [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:05.065 --> 00:45:07.070
AUDIENCE: What's heavy
mobile phone use?

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.903
MICHAEL SHORT: Heavy
mobile phone use, yeah.

00:45:08.903 --> 00:45:11.190
Well, they'll define that
somewhere in the article.

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.190
So, some of these studies,
it's like OK, there's

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.607
interesting
viewpoints to be seen.

00:45:14.607 --> 00:45:16.457
They shouldn't be
ignored just because we

00:45:16.457 --> 00:45:18.290
have this predetermined
conclusion that cell

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:19.760
phones don't cause cancer.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.190
It's important to go and
actually look at the studies

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:24.910
and decide for yourself.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.500
Let's get into the fun ones.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.080
Number 7.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.010
"A recent study on 790,000
middle aged women found that,

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.700
"women who used cell phones
for ten or more years were

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.033
two-and-a-half times more
likely," et cetera, et cetera.

00:45:39.033 --> 00:45:40.950
"Their risk increased
with the number of years

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.160
they used cell phones."

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.545
Let's look at the study.

00:45:46.462 --> 00:45:47.080
OK, That's.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:53.600
Not the study, so we need
to go find the study.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.640
And that's another news
article about the study,

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.045
we need to go find this study.

00:45:58.045 --> 00:45:59.320
Ah, finally.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.200
AUDIENCE: The study.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.242
MICHAEL SHORT: The study.

00:46:01.242 --> 00:46:02.660
AUDIENCE: The study.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.898
MICHAEL SHORT: Read
the conclusion.

00:46:04.898 --> 00:46:05.830
AUDIENCE: What the--

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.228
I'm so bad.

00:46:07.228 --> 00:46:08.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.630
AUDIENCE: I don't think
the people writing

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:12.770
these articles are actually
like reading these--

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.190
MICHAEL SHORT: No, I
don't think so either.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.920
AUDIENCE: They just
look at the title

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.128
and they're like, [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:16.128 --> 00:46:17.503
MICHAEL SHORT:
So, the best thing

00:46:17.503 --> 00:46:19.610
that you can conclude
about these sorts of people

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.193
is that they're not reading the
studies and reporting on them.

00:46:22.193 --> 00:46:24.980
If they are reading them
and not getting it right,

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.860
no, not everyone can
parse the science.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.260
If they're reading them,
understanding them, and cherry

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.870
picking the facts in order
to support their conclusion,

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.797
that to me should be criminal.

00:46:34.797 --> 00:46:37.130
We do live in a country where
there's freedom of speech.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.140
You're free to say
whatever you want,

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.630
as long as it's not hate
speech of various kinds.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:43.880
It doesn't have to be right.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.412
You also don't have to listen.

00:46:45.412 --> 00:46:47.120
So just because you
have freedom to talk,

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.438
doesn't mean people have
an obligation to listen.

00:46:49.438 --> 00:46:51.230
And this is the problem
with a lot of this.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.113
So I think my--

00:46:52.113 --> 00:46:54.530
yeah, my notes for this study
was just kind of the F word.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.440
It was, how do you
get the conclusion

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.810
from this internet
article, which

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.340
wrote an article
about an article

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:05.150
about an article about a study,
when the conclusion says,

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:10.490
with an excellent sample
size not associated.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:12.420
OK.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.490
We have like five or
seven minutes left,

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:15.510
so let's skip ahead.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:19.675
I had a fun one for number 12,
cancer of the pituitary gland.

00:47:19.675 --> 00:47:23.124
Let me get rid of
the other stuff.

00:47:23.124 --> 00:47:24.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.930
MICHAEL SHORT:
Oh, does that look

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:28.370
like a surprisingly
familiar figure?

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:29.230
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.230
MICHAEL SHORT: It's another
article about the same study.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:33.310
Let's just confirm.

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:35.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
articles about--

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:36.923
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, look at that.

00:47:36.923 --> 00:47:38.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] papers.

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.390
MICHAEL SHORT: That right
there was the article written

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.920
about the study, where
the other link was

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.837
an article, written about
the article, written

00:47:43.837 --> 00:47:45.080
about the study.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:45.580
OK.

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.080
What else?

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:46.600
Next one.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.950
Let's just keep going
in number order.

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:51.310
Israeli study about
thyroid cancer.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:53.670
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.835
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:54.835 --> 00:47:57.210
MICHAEL SHORT: This appears
to be a blog, so let's search

00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:59.160
for the word "Israel."

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.223
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:04.223 --> 00:48:06.140
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, but
first the news article.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.210
So take a sec to
parse some of this.

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:12.180
"The incidence of thyroid cancer
has been increasing rapidly

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.655
in many countries, including
the US, Canada, and Israel."

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:26.310
I mean, one thing
to say-- let's say,

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.500
case control research on
this topic is warranted.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.570
Sure.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:33.240
No one's going to refute a
claim that, hey, maybe we should

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.820
study something properly, right?

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:38.200
Let's go a little further down.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.860
Let's try to find
the actual study.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.300
Where is this study?

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.580
Interesting.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:50.510
The main point of the study is
that thyroid cancer and cell

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:54.344
phone usage are going
up at the same time.

00:48:54.344 --> 00:48:55.340
AUDIENCE: Wow!

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.923
MICHAEL SHORT: This
is the point where

00:48:56.923 --> 00:49:00.080
I like to say correlation does
not imply causation, and hammer

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.190
that point home by going to one
of my favorite blogs, Spurious

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.780
Correlations.

look at some examples.

US spending on science,
space, and technology

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:20.280
correlates with a 99.79%
correlation of suicides

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Correlated, yes.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.140
Causal, I don't think so.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:32.317 --> 00:49:33.150
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:36.930
Divorce rate in Maine correlates
with per capita consumption

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:37.500
of margarine.

a link between anything

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:44.160
and anything else if you just
search the data long enough

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.199
without searching for a
mechanism or a reason.

00:49:46.199 --> 00:49:47.116
AUDIENCE: That's cool.

00:49:47.116 --> 00:49:49.783
Can we look at the age of
Miss America below this?

00:49:49.783 --> 00:49:50.700
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, OK.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.680
Age of Miss America
correlates with murders

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.655
by steam, hot vapors.

00:49:53.655 --> 00:49:54.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:54.155 --> 00:49:56.370
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:58.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Clearly, we
should ban the Miss America

00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.745
pageant or make them older.

00:49:59.745 --> 00:50:01.433
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:01.433 --> 00:50:03.850
MICHAEL SHORT: Or the other
way around, make them younger.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.845
Maybe this is why we
have toddlers in tiaras,

00:50:05.845 --> 00:50:08.460
it's to stop murders by steam.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.660
Oh, my God.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.160
OK.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:12.110
MICHAEL SHORT: So
this is, again,

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:13.818
the point where you
have to ask yourself,

00:50:13.818 --> 00:50:16.250
what are the other confounding
variables in this study?

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:20.490
Why else could thyroid
cancer be going up?

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:21.706
Anyone?

00:50:21.706 --> 00:50:23.500
I can probably come
up with like a hundred

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.276
different possible reasons.

00:50:25.276 --> 00:50:27.478
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:27.478 --> 00:50:29.270
MICHAEL SHORT: Any sort
of other chemicals?

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.840
Let's say, more industrial
runoff, more urbanization,

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.960
smog, inhalation, some amount,
let's say, I don't know,

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.328
iodine released from Chernobyl
making its way through.

00:50:38.328 --> 00:50:40.370
Now, that would have had
like a 30-day half-life.

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.285
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, that's
also got to pretty much decay

00:50:44.285 --> 00:50:46.330
by now.

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:48.130
Yeah, there could be
any number of reasons.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:51.400
And just to say cell phones and
thyroid cancer are correlated,

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.100
is like saying this.

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:54.600
What else?

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:58.200
MICHAEL SHORT: This I
think might actually

00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.197
have something to--

00:50:59.197 --> 00:51:00.030
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:01.920
MICHAEL SHORT: There
might be a link here.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.330
Revenue generated
by arcades kids

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.500
with computer
science doctorates.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.745
Again, just a correlation.

00:51:08.745 --> 00:51:09.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.920
AUDIENCE: Sociology
doctorates-- [LAUGHTER]

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.900
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah,
look at the amazing--

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:13.900
it's got all the same humps.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:14.320
And everything.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.895
All right, I think
I've made the point.

00:51:15.895 --> 00:51:16.765
AUDIENCE: Actually,
I like the margarine

00:51:16.765 --> 00:51:18.070
and the divorce rate one

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.403
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's go on
to some of the other studies,

00:51:20.403 --> 00:51:21.926
let's say, number 15.

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:28.870
11 of 29 cases of
neuroepithelial tumors, cell

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:32.110
phone users accounted
for 11 of them."

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:35.560
11 of the 29 people in the study
that got this type of tumor

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.520
used cell phones.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.300
What's wrong here?

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:37.750
AUDIENCE: Who doesn't
use cell phones?

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:38.708
People use cell phones.

00:51:38.708 --> 00:51:40.000
Everybody uses cell phones.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.032
They don't think about anything
else that could have happened?

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:42.949
MICHAEL SHORT: No, no.

00:51:42.949 --> 00:51:44.890
Here, I think the
study is flawed.

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:47.895
What is the worst
part about this study?

00:51:47.895 --> 00:51:48.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:49.084
AUDIENCE: It's only 29 cases.

00:51:49.084 --> 00:51:50.500
AUDIENCE: It's 29 cases.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.960
MICHAEL SHORT: 29
cases, sample size.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.018
If you get 11 out of 29
and say half of the tumors

00:51:57.018 --> 00:51:58.810
we saw were attributed
to cell phones, that

00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:00.714
is not a proper conclusion.

00:52:00.714 --> 00:52:02.589
AUDIENCE: How are you
going to [INAUDIBLE] it

00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:03.910
to a cell phone [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
see, number 17.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.550
Ah, OK.

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:08.980
Another Israeli
study that talked

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:13.420
about parotid gland cancers
and salivary gland cancers.

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.845
My note to this is
read the last sentence.

00:52:15.845 --> 00:52:20.522
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:20.522 --> 00:52:22.939
AUDIENCE: Like, I'm sure there's
other factors [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:25.404
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:25.404 --> 00:52:26.688
AUDIENCE: They cause cancer.

00:52:26.688 --> 00:52:28.480
MICHAEL SHORT: The blog
says, cause cancer.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:33.540
The data says, no
causal association.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.240
So again, almost
criminally ignorant.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.770
How many times did
you have to miss

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.068
the last sentence, the
conclusion of the article,

00:52:40.068 --> 00:52:41.360
to pick the part that you want?

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.777
AUDIENCE: But everything you
read on the internet is true.

00:52:43.777 --> 00:52:44.985
You know, it's [? illegal. ?]

00:52:44.985 --> 00:52:46.735
MICHAEL SHORT: All I
can say is everything

00:52:46.735 --> 00:52:48.660
that you read on the
internet was written.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.860
That's the best I can say.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.710
Number 20, we don't even
have to go to the study here.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:53.952
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:53.952 --> 00:52:54.910
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, boy.

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:57.148
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
machine learning [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:57.148 --> 00:52:59.190
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's check
the study to make sure

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.825
that the quote is actually
correct, but before--

00:53:00.825 --> 00:53:02.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Oh, my God.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.213
MICHAEL SHORT: Four women.

00:53:04.213 --> 00:53:05.380
AUDIENCE: It's just the one.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.300
AUDIENCE: Study four women.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.810
Looks like it might [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.790
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, by the
prestigious publication,

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:14.370
Hindawi, which
sends me more emails

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.400
than I read their articles.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.460
So let's look at the abstract.

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.190
Of all four cases, they
are a case studies,

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.290
so striking
similarity, how hard do

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:30.380
you think it would be to find
four women with a certain type

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:32.095
of breast tumor?

00:53:32.095 --> 00:53:33.887
There's a lot of women
in the world, right?

00:53:33.887 --> 00:53:35.230
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:37.480
MICHAEL SHORT: And breast
cancer is one of the leading

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.560
causes of cancer in women.

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.890
It wouldn't be hard to cherry
pick four people to get

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:43.300
the same conclusion you want.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.800
Oh, and there's
another correlation,

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.920
out of 108 billion humans
that have ever lived and have

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.500
been exposed to ionizing
radiation, all of them

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.162
died at some point.

00:53:53.162 --> 00:53:54.620
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
At some point.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.078
MICHAEL SHORT: At
some point, yeah.

00:53:56.078 --> 00:53:58.535
every human that's
ever lived has died.

00:53:58.535 --> 00:53:59.910
And every human
that's ever lived

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:01.535
had been exposed to
ionizing radiation.

00:54:01.535 --> 00:54:02.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.028
AUDIENCE: It must be true.

00:54:04.028 --> 00:54:05.940
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:09.837
MICHAEL SHORT: Perfect
correlation, no causation.

00:54:09.837 --> 00:54:10.670
Let's see, two more.

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:11.770
I think we have
time for two more.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:12.880
This is kind of fun.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.270
An eye cancer study.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:15.560
All right, let's just go--

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.270
"found elevated
risk for exposure

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:19.080
to radio frequency
transmitting devices."

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.650
AUDIENCE: Are
these real studies?

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:22.470
Don't the authors
get mad that people

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:25.092
are using their studies wrong?

00:54:25.092 --> 00:54:27.050
MICHAEL SHORT: I'm sure
the authors do get mad,

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:28.550
but what are you going
to do about some person

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.695
on the internet, right?

00:54:29.695 --> 00:54:32.390
You can send a nasty letter
to the magazine, which

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:34.400
might reject it as hate mail.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.432
OK, on the blog.

00:54:35.432 --> 00:54:36.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
very strong--

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.223
MICHAEL SHORT: What does it say?

00:54:38.223 --> 00:54:40.472
Elevated risk for
exposure in the study.

00:54:40.472 --> 00:54:43.525
AUDIENCE: People only get
excited by some crazy person.

00:54:43.525 --> 00:54:44.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it's about.

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.518
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:46.518 --> 00:54:49.060
MICHAEL SHORT: I don't think I
have to make my point anymore.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.643
We've gone through
about half of them.

00:54:50.643 --> 00:54:54.090
I encourage the rest of you guys
to go through the other half.

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:58.950
And to the people, like
this Lloyd Burrell,

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.390
I say check your facts.

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.570
What you're doing is
criminally incompetent.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:05.850
With the way that people
are misleading the public

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.100
to get whatever pre-gone
conclusions that they have

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.380
from their emotions or
their funding sources

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:15.630
or whatever the reason to
be, by misquoting facts

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:17.130
you're absolutely
misleading people

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:18.870
and spreading false science.

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.330
Because, to me, the most
exciting moments in science

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.700
don't end with the
words, "I told you so,"

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:26.550
but start with the words,
"that's interesting."

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:28.650
So just because the
studies that you find

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.840
don't support your
predetermined conclusions,

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.340
doesn't mean you
should reject them.

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:35.330
It means that you might
have to change your idea.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.455
So, on that note, I'd
like to stop here.

00:55:37.455 --> 00:55:39.080
We'll come back on
Thursday and go over

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.080
the short and long-term
biological effects of radiation

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.640
and look at some
more garbage science.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.140
Yeah?

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.050
AUDIENCE: How do you feel
about those wireless chargers

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:49.020
they have now?

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.072
It's like a conductive
charger so it

00:55:51.072 --> 00:55:55.063
uses like a low-branch,
strongish magnetic field.

00:55:55.063 --> 00:55:55.980
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.848
AUDIENCE: And people
are like, oh, my God.

00:55:56.848 --> 00:55:57.515
That's so scary.

00:55:57.515 --> 00:55:59.598
MICHAEL SHORT: I would
just say go to the studies.

00:55:59.598 --> 00:56:02.490
It's very easy to say put a
bunch of rats on a cell phone

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:05.130
charger, turn it on,
and see what happens.

00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:07.020
I mean, the data doesn't lie.

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.100
The reason might be a
little hard to figure out.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:10.600
Yeah.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.100
Yeah.

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.910
So, I mean, another
thing is, when

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:14.245
people have a predetermined--

00:56:14.245 --> 00:56:16.120
I know it's a little
past 10:00, but no one's

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.010
gotten up so I'll keep ranting.

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:20.800
So a lot of this
neo-environmentalism going on

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.860
has the predetermined
conclusion that only sources

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.410
of power light on the Earth,
like solar and wind, that

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.440
are renewable and such,
are the ways to go.

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.750
And immediately dismiss
nuclear as not part

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:34.090
of the environmental
solution, despite being part

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.680
of the environmental solution.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.080
A large source of power
that's very efficient

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.090
and doesn't admit any CO2.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:43.240
It might surprise them to
know that manufacturing wind

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.160
turbines is a major
source of radioactivity.

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.080
MICHAEL SHORT: Anyone
want to guess where?

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.620
AUDIENCE: Rare-earth magnets.

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, thank
you, rare-earth magnets.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.620
The major cause of wind turbine
failure in the last decade

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.930
has been the gearboxes
breaking down.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.370
Because in order
to extract power,

00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:01.010
you have to gear down those
giant turbines by quite a bit.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:04.060
And those gears, 300-feet up
in the air, tend to break down,

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.350
they're hard to maintain.

00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:06.530
How do you fix it?

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:08.110
Make stronger magnets.

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.960
Put in rare-earth magnets that
electromagnetically harvest

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.930
the energy, instead of gearing
it down and doing the same

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.390
and you don't have
mechanical things grinding.

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.593
What are rare-earth
magnets made out of?

00:57:18.593 --> 00:57:19.510
AUDIENCE: Rare-earths.

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:20.635
MICHAEL SHORT: Rare-earths.

00:57:20.635 --> 00:57:23.350
Lanthanides, which happen
to be found with actinides,

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:27.160
thorium,r whatever actinium
exists, radium, uranium,

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.877
things with similar chemistry.

00:57:28.877 --> 00:57:31.210
What do you do when you extract
the rare-earths that you

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:33.560
need from the rare-earth ore?

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.530
You ditch the remains, which
are concentrated sources

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:38.420
of these radioactive byproducts.

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.040
Where do most radioactive--

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.680
I'm sorry, where do most
rare-earth magnets come from?

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:43.580
AUDIENCE: China.

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:44.990
MICHAEL SHORT: China.

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:47.885
How is China's record on
environmental practices?

00:57:47.885 --> 00:57:49.739
AUDIENCE: Not [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:49.739 --> 00:57:50.665
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:50.665 --> 00:57:53.960
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.820
MICHAEL SHORT: Spotty, at best.

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.310
AUDIENCE: Questionable.

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:58.190
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:00.560
So, again, one of those
things where people say,

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.632
oh, wind power has absolutely
no effect on the environment.

00:58:03.632 --> 00:58:05.465
Check the radioactivity
of making windmills.

00:58:05.465 --> 00:58:07.420
AUDIENCE: I want you
to tell the Sierra.

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:09.920
MICHAEL SHORT: I don't know if
the Sierra Club would listen.

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.795
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:10.795 --> 00:58:12.670
MICHAEL SHORT: I have
heard murmurs or rumors

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:14.870
of them coming around to
the idea of nuclear power.

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:17.210
There's an article that said
they switched positions,

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.502
then there was a counter
article, followed a day later,

00:58:19.502 --> 00:58:21.170
that says, no, that
was a rogue actor.

00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:23.720
They don't reflect the
views of the Sierra Club.

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:26.300
The problem is with all
these neo-envrionmentalists

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.490
and cell-phones-cause-cancer
people

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:30.140
and food-irradiation-is-evil
people,

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:33.140
you'll find them cherry picking
data to support the conclusion

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.650
that they already
felt they wanted.

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.610
And when confronted with
overwhelming evidence

00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:38.870
to the contrary.

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:40.400
They don't change their view.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.470
And that to me is the
best thing about science.

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:44.012
If you prove to me
that you're wrong,

00:58:44.012 --> 00:58:48.340
I will say, thank
you, not [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:50.280
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.490
MICHAEL SHORT: So, there you go.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:55.270
All right, I'll see
you guys on Tuesday.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.140
PROFESSOR STRANG:
OK, so I thought

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.770
I'd quickly list the four
central topics for the Fourier

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.510
part of the course,
and I would guess

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.920
that there'll be a question
on each of those four

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.390
in the final quiz.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.340
Final exam.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.520
And we covered 4.1,
Fourier series.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.590
I don't plan to do discussion
in 4.2 of other series

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.980
like Bessel and
Legendre and so on.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.170
If I can, I'll
come back to those

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.340
in the very last lectures.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.190
But I want to pick up now on
the second key example, which

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.355
is the discrete Fourier series
that has only N terms, instead

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:13.615
of this series, as
you're looking at it,

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.080
has infinitely many terms.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.340
But I'm going to
cut back to N terms.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.240
So this k, well I
can go one to N,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.590
but the best way is zero to N-1.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.630
So that's the discrete series.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.240
We're going to be dealing with
a vector, c_0 up to c_(N-1).

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.110
And a vector of function values.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.350
Vector to vector.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.990
So a matrix is going to be
the key to everything here.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.540
An N by N matrix.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.950
So that's what's coming.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.370
Then, after that
probably by Friday

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.770
will be the integral transform.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.470
And early next week, and a
little after Thanksgiving,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.130
would be this key
idea of convolution,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.640
which is really important
in so many applications

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.720
and needs to be separated out.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.460
Convolution will
apply to all of these.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.470
And you'll see the point there.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.370
OK, ready for the idea
of the discrete one.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.990
OK, so the key idea is we only
have N terms, so I can't expect

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.970
to reproduce a whole function.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.580
I can get N function
values, so I'll

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.060
get this at N different points.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.790
And if I'm thinking
of my F(x), on,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.270
let me take zero to 2pi
now, and I'm thinking again

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.710
of an F(x) that's periodic.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.800
So it goes, does whatever.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.830
If it was like that,
if that was my F(x),

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.530
just remember about
Fourier series,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.240
what could you tell me about the
Fourier series for that F(x)?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.410
Well, when I continue
periodically,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.590
am I going to see a jump?

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.600
Yes.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.730
There'll be a jump at every
2pi, so the underlying function

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:28.690
is not continuous, has a jump,
so that our special examples

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.360
with jumps and slow decay,
1/k decay rate for the Fourier

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.450
coefficients would apply here.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.060
OK, that's remembering
Fourier series.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.070
Now, Fourier integrals,
I'm just going to take,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.070
let me just take N=4.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.607
So I'll take this point, you
know, what four points am I

00:03:49.607 --> 00:03:50.190
going to take?

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.900
I'm not going to repeat-- Ah.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.130
Just for the heck of it,
let's make it look periodic.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.740
Yeah, let's make
it look periodic.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.860
I never should have
done it otherwise.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.280
OK, so there's one point.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.890
I'm just going to take four
equally spaced, equally spaced

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.370
being key, zero,
one, two, three.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.550
So N-1 is three.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:28.340
And these four values
I can get right.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.490
So those are my four x's.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.970
The four x's that
I'm going to take.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.620
So this is x=0, of course.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.070
And this one is,
what's the x there?

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.050
x is 2pi, the whole deal,
the whole interval, but it's

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.080
divided into N pieces,
so 2pi/N. So we

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.940
are going to see a lot of
fractions involving pi/N.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.710
Or 2pi/N. They're just
going to come up everywhere.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.690
Because that's the
delta x, the h,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.050
the step in the discrete form.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.550
OK.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.550
So those are the x's.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:22.000
So I'm only going to get
this at x=0, 2pi/N, 4pi/N,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.430
up to whatever it comes
out to, (N-1)*2pi/N.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.420
That doesn't look elegant so
we probably will try to avoid

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.830
writing that again.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.220
But this was the three times
2pi/4 that got us to there.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.230
So this is 2pi/8, pi/4.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.240
Sorry, 2pi/4,
4pi/4, 6pi-- Oh, OK.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.500
So we're only going to
get equality at those x's.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.800
So it's those x's that
I should plug in here.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.640
OK, so let me do that.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.500
Let me plug in, what
does this series look

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.250
like at these four points?

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.260
Let me see.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.440
So writing out all
four equations,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.190
F(0) is going to match the
right side at zero, because zero

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.960
is one of my points.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:30.890
So I get c_0 + c_1 + c_2 + c_3.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.290
At x=0, right, all the e
to the whatevers were one.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:42.150
Now at the next
x, 2pi/N, now I'm

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.760
matching the series with a
function at that value, there.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.050
2pi/N. So now I have k=0,
so what does k=0 give me?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.600
When k is zero, what's
my term look like?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.710
It's just c_0 times one.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.800
Because if k is zero, e to
the whatever is again one.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.510
So this is just c_0.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.900
Now, here's the key.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:19.470
What is that business
there at x=2pi/N?

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.840
Here comes the important
number in this whole business.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.320
The important number this whole
business is, I'll call it w,

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.700
is e^(2pi*i/N).

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.590
That's a complex
number, and we'll

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.270
place it in the complex plane.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.050
So you must get to
know that number, w.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.220
Because when I
plug in x equal-- k

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.740
is now one here, so I have c_1.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:01.820
Times this e to the i one
2pi/N, what is that? w.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.880
So it's w*c_1.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.280
And what do I get from the
next term in this series?

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.060
I have c_2*e^(i2x).

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.790
x is 2pi/N, do you
see what's happening?

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.630
w squared is e^(4pi*i/N).

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.590
We're using the beauty
of exponentials,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.590
that's making everything go.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.550
It's w squared.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.250
And this guy would
be w cubed, c_3.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.110
That's the series.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.590
At our points.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.640
So this, like, we'll just see
this once, what are we doing?

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.900
But this is what we're
going to live with here.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.520
So I'll rewrite it
all in terms of w,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.710
so you just, you've got the
idea of what are we doing?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:04.610
We're matching at N points and
now we get the good notation w.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:12.040
OK, and at the next point,
4pi/N. Well, again, k=0 term,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.000
it's c_0.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.910
The k=1 term, can you tell
me what I get when k is one,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:30.280
I have something times c_1,
it's e^(i*1*4pi/N), what's that?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.700
w squared. e^(i*4pi/N)
is w squared.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.620
Look, this matrix is
coming out symmetric.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.950
And this will be w^4, and
that'll turn out to be w^6,

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.530
and then the last row of the
matrix is going to come from

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:55.610
matching at 6pi/N, and it
will turn out to be c_0,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:02.130
and it'll be w^3, w^6, and w^9.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.630
So I did the last row
or two a bit fast.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.920
Just because the pattern's
there, and you'll spot it.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:22.540
Now I want to pull out
of that the matrix.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.580
The Fourier matrix, the four
by four Fourier matrix that

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.840
multiplies the c's
and gives me the f's.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.100
Let me call these numbers are
y_0, y_1, y_2, and y_3, just

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.240
to have a, so it's a vector
of values of the function.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.430
And this is a vector
of coefficients.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.800
So it's wise to-- The Fourier
transform goes between

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:56.900
y's and c's, and y's.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.680
Connects a vector--
And this is N values,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.160
N function values
in physical space.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.070
These are N coefficients
in frequency space,

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.560
and one way is the
discrete Fourier transform

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.380
and the other way is the inverse
discrete Fourier transform.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.510
So, and it's a little bit
confused, which is which,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.750
actually.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.960
There was no question
with Fourier series,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.130
it was easy to tell the
function from the coefficients

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.600
because the function was
f(x) and the coefficients

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.880
were a bunch of numbers.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.020
Here we only have N numbers.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:40.370
N y's and N c's and we're
transforming back and forth.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.990
So I'm finding right
now the matrix,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.680
this Fourier matrix is going
to take the c's and give me

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.270
the y's.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.210
So I'm talking here
about the matrix F.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.080
And let's see what F is.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:02.890
Can you just see what--
That was y_0 to y_3,

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.940
equals this matrix F,
the four by four matrix.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.480
Times c_0 to c_3.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.860
This is really the inverse DFT.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:26.870
It reconstructs the y's from
the c's, or an easier way

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:32.960
to say that is
add up the series.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.450
So that's the-- The
usual DFT is taking us,

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.150
starting with the y's
and giving us the c's.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:46.930
So this would be the
discrete Fourier transform.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.750
Take a function, produce
its coefficients.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.730
The reverse step is
take the coefficients,

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.170
add back, add up the
series, get the function.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.740
And that's what F does.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.030
So I'm going to focus on
F. Which is the ones that

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.740
involves this w guy.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.200
OK, can you read off,
peel off from here

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.150
what the matrix F is,
the Fourier matrix?

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.370
Its first row is all ones.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.910
Its first column is all ones.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:35.320
And then it's one, w, w^2,
w^3; w^2, w^4, w^6; w^3, w^6,

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.370
and w^9.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.640
To the ninth power.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.080
OK, so it's made up
of these powers of w.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:49.480
Zero, first, second, and third
power and then higher powers.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.150
But higher powers are
all-- Let's draw a picture.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.010
Where is w?

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.220
So this is the complex plane.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.630
Here's the real, and here's
the imaginary direction.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.140
And let me take N to
be, here N was four.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:10.210
Let me take N to be eight in
my picture, just to have some,

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.670
then I'll be able to spot
the fours and the eights.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.850
If N is eight,
where would w_8 be?

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:32.240
So w_8 is meant to be
the e^(2pi*i/8), now.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.520
Where's that number
in that picture?

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.950
Is it on the circle?

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.830
Absolutely.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.340
This discrete Fourier transform
never gets off the circle.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.780
And in fact, it never gets off
eight points on the circle.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.540
Which are the eight
equally spaced points.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.740
This says go 1/8 of the way
of the whole way around,

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.260
which will be here.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.050
So there's w_8.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.330
When I square it, what's
the square of w_8?

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:17.800
The angle, what happens to the
angle when I multiply numbers?

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.910
I add the exponents.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.830
Here, if I'm
multiplying by itself,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.280
it'll double the exponent.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.570
Double the angle.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:34.600
It'll be, there's w_8 squared,
so that point is w_8 squared.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.150
And it's the same as w_4 because
it's 1/4 of the way around.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:45.540
And what is that number
in ordinary language? i.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.830
It's i, right?

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:53.340
It's on the unit
circle at 90 degrees.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.750
And on the imaginary
axis it's just i.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:04.740
So all this here was i, i^2 i^3;
i^2, i^4, i^6; i^3, i^6, i^9.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.380
The four by four Fourier
matrix is just powers of i.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.260
And the N by N, the eight
by eight Fourier matrix

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.220
is powers of w_8.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.970
And let's find all the
rest of the powers.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.020
So there's w_8, w_8
squared, where's w_8 cubed?

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.370
Here.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.500
I multiply those guys, I add
the angle, I'm out to here.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.730
Here's the fourth power, here's
the fifth power, sixth power,

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.480
seventh power and
finally we get to w_8

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.900
to the eighth
power, which is one.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.950
Because if I take the eighth
power here, I've got e^(2pi*i),

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.410
and that's one.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.960
So that's the
picture to remember.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.210
And while looking
at that picture,

00:16:54.210 --> 00:17:00.780
could you tell me the sum
of those eight numbers?

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.340
What do those eight
members add up to?

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:13.280
So I just want to ask what
do one plus w up to w^7,

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.680
when I'm doing the
eighth guy, adds up to?

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.100
So the sum of those
eight numbers,

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.970
well I wouldn't ask
the question if it

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.200
didn't have a nice answer.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.900
Zero.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.390
That's of course the
usual answer in math.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.140
We do all this work
and we get zero.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.760
But now, of course
the real math is why.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.310
I mean, so math is,
you get equations

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.300
but then always there's
that kicker, why.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.380
And why do they add up to zero?

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.920
Here.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.690
Can you see that?

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:00.130
Why those eight numbers
would add to zero?

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.850
Well, yeah.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.350
So what do these add up to?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.890
Just those two guys?

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.780
One and minus one add to zero.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.470
That and that add to
zero, I can pair them off.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.390
This and this add to zero.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.840
That and that add to zero.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.800
Yeah, so that's one
way of seeing it.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.100
But actually, even if N was
three or five or some odd

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.140
number, and I had-- So should
I do the picture for N=3?

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.420
Just a little, doesn't need
a very big picture for N=3.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.050
So where would the
roots be for N=3?

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.370
One of them is always one.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.610
These are the three
cube roots of one.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.370
That I'm going to draw.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.040
Those were the eight
eighth roots of one.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.420
Because if I take any
one of those numbers

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.310
its eighth power
brings me back to one.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.060
So where are these guys, so
this is three numbers equally

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.770
spaced around the circle.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.490
Where do you think they are?

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:10.640
Well, it's gotta be at 120
degrees, 240 degrees and 360.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.140
And again, those
will add to zero.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.460
You can't pair them off
because we got an odd number,

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:23.610
but it's safely zero
and we could see why.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:33.830
OK, so this section, this
topic is all about that matrix.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.720
It's all about that four
by four, or N by N matrix.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.180
Which has powers of w.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.750
Notice that the matrix is,
it hasn't got any zeroes.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.430
Hasn't even got
anything close to zero.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.080
All those numbers are
on the unit circle.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.660
So multiplying by
that matrix, which

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.540
is the same as adding up the
Fourier series at the four

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:07.900
points, doing this
calculation, finding these y's

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.900
from the c's, reconstructing
the y's, given the coefficients,

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.270
has 16 terms.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.050
Right?

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:22.770
The matrix has got 16 entries,
all the entries in the matrix

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.810
are showing up here
in powers of w.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.280
We've got 16 multiplications.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.270
Well, maybe a couple of them
were easy, but basically 16

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.050
multiplications and additions.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.890
Pretty much N squared work.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:50.730
And that's not bad.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.260
Except if you want to do
it a million times, right?

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.930
Suppose we have a
typical N might be 1024.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.910
So the matrix has then got,
is 1024 squared numbers,

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.860
which is about a million.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.540
So if we have a matrix
with a million entries,

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:14.140
a million operations to do, and
then we do it a million times

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:20.160
then it's getting up
to money that Congress

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.820
would give to the banks.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.820
Whatever.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.590
Anyway.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.900
Serious money.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.040
Serious computing time.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:38.010
And the wonderful
thing is that there

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:43.940
is a faster way than N squared.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:50.050
There's a faster way to do these
16 terms than the obvious way.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.930
You might say, well,
they're pretty nice.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.210
And they are.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.600
But they're nicer
than you can know.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.600
I mean, nicer than you
can see immediately.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:07.520
This matrix will break
up into simple steps

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.950
with lots of zeroes
in each step,

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:16.110
and the final result is
that instead of n squared,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:20.720
capital N squared, which is
done the old fashioned way,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.890
let's say, that there's
a fast Fourier transform.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:32.990
So the FFT, I should
maybe find a better space

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.060
for the most important algorithm
in the last hundred years,

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:42.030
and here it is.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.320
Right there.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.770
So my one goal
for Wednesday will

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:52.430
be to give you some
insight into the FFT.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.400
But here I'm just
looking at the result.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.500
The number of computations
is, instead of N squared,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:05.530
it's N times log N. It's
log to the base two,

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:11.350
or maybe 1/2 N log N. So I'll
erase some of the other things

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.940
close by so you can see it.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.560
So that, where N squared
was, if N was a thousand,

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.100
N squared was a million.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.060
If N is a thousand,
this is a thousand,

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.940
and what's the logarithm of
a thousand, to the base two?

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.290
That's the ten, right?

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.480
The 2^10 gave us that 1,024.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.560
So this is 10^4.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:46.740
So N is 10^3, or 1,024 more
exactly, the logarithm is ten,

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.270
so we're 10^4 instead of 10^6.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.800
So that's a saving of a
factor of 100, that's true.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.570
I mean it just comes from doing
the addition and multiplication

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.030
in the right order.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.350
You get this incredible saving.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.620
And it's sort of makes
whole calculations that

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.950
were previously
impossible are now

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:18.590
possible because instead of
where it might have been 100

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:24.400
minutes, it's now one minute.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.670
So everything focuses on this
Fourier matrix and its inverse,

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:35.170
which we still have to find
but it'll come out beautifully.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.760
In fact, I could tell
you what F inverse,

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.300
just so you see it coming.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.200
F inverse will, so
what happened to w,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.520
that all-important number w?

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:59.310
Well, let me repeat what w is.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:02.530
I'll put it on this board.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:08.380
F has powers of w.
w is e^(2pi*i/N).

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.220
And what power has it got?

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.190
In the j,k position?

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:25.140
So now you can see the
formula for these entries.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:29.770
Only, you have to let me
start the count at j and k

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.020
equals zero.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.790
This is zero-based, where
MATLAB is one-based.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.560
And to do this stuff you always
have to shift things by one.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.870
Some other, more recent,
software like Python

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:50.870
is zero based, because
this is so common.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.670
So here's the formula.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:59.160
It's w to the power j times k.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.130
That's neat.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:09.320
That's what goes into the matrix
F. This here is row three.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.510
It looks like row four but
I'm starting with zero,

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.050
so that's row three.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.760
That's column three.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:20.230
This is w three
times three, w^9.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.950
Which by the way is
the same as what?

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:32.160
If w is i in this four by four,
it is. w is i, what's w^9,

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.800
what's i to the 9th power?

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.970
Same as?

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.330
Can you do i^9 in your head?

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.760
Sure.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.080
Because you're starting here.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.060
You're taking its ninth power,
so one, two, three, four,

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.610
you're back to one. i^4 is one.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.880
One, two, three, four
more, i^8 is one. i^9.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.810
That will actually
be just i. i^9.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.910
So they're all powers of i.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.910
But this is the
good way to see it.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.140
It's three times three, because
it's in-- And this, of course,

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.060
is three times two, and two
times two, and three times one.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.761
You see the entries of F?

00:27:15.761 --> 00:27:16.260
Yeah.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.120
So now I'd better
write down, I promised

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.820
to write this formula
in a better form.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.450
All those formulas
in a better-- Nobody

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:31.590
is going to write this out for
matrices of order 1000, right?

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:36.320
So we've got to write
the decent formula.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.120
So the decent formula
is that the j-th y,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.600
because it's going to
come in equation number j,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:55.720
will be the sum on k=0 to
N-1, of c_k times w^(jk).

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.510
Those are the entries, those
are the c's that it multiplies

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.680
and the y's.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:09.670
This is just y, vector
y, this is y=Fc.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:12.660
Now we've finally
got a good notation.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.710
So this was horrible notation.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.230
I mean, that's exhausting.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.350
This shows you the
algebra, but you

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.690
have to be sort of prepared--
Well, the information is here

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.090
because this is telling
you what the entries of F,

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.100
of the matrix, are.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:35.540
But this is with indices, and
this is with whole vectors.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.480
So that would be
y, in MATLAB that

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:49.490
would be the inverse fast
Fourier transform of c.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.880
So you see that
that's our matrix.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.820
Now, I was going
to say, before I

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.170
show why, I was going to
say what about the inverse?

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:07.760
Because if the FFT gave us
a fast way to multiply by F,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.370
we want it also to give us a
fast way to do the inverse.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.750
We have to go both ways here.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.350
We get our data, we put
it into frequency space,

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.280
we look at it in
frequency space,

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.020
we understand what's going on.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.160
By separating out
the frequencies.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.220
We maybe smooth it, we maybe
convolve it, whatever we do.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.440
Compress it.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.090
And then we've got to go
back to physical space.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.290
So we have to go both ways.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:41.290
And the question is
what about F inverse?

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:52.180
And let me just say,
what goes into F inverse?

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.380
The point is that the number
that goes into F inverse

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.250
is just like w.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:04.490
But it's the complex conjugate,
and I'll call it w bar.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.490
And that's e^(-2pi*i/N).

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.250
So the thing that's going to
go into the inverse matrix

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.540
is the powers of w bar.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.860
The complex conjugate. jk.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:28.040
Let me just say right away,
that just as there were 2pi's

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:34.640
in the Fourier series
world, that got in our way.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.390
And physicists can't
stand those 2pi's.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.140
They try to get rid of them
but course they can't, they're

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.770
there.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.240
So they put it up
into the exponent.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.850
Well, I guess, I'm blaming
physicists, I've done it too.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.310
I've put the 2pi up there.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.730
For the Fourier series.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.910
Anyway whatever, 2pi's
are all in your hair

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.280
in the Fourier series.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.210
And in this, for
the discrete one,

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.990
the corresponding thing
is an N. There's a factor

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.010
N that I have to deal with.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:13.420
Because look, here's
what I'm saying.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.260
Let me multiply F by F inverse.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.110
OK.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:23.530
Say, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1 i, i^2,
i^3, this is my F, right?

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.600
Whoops.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:33.270
Don't ever let me do that. i^2,
fourth, sixth; i^3, i^6, i^9.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.700
Now, my claim is
that F inverse is

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.620
going to involve the complex
conjugate, w bar. i bar.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.580
What is the complex
conjugate of i?

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.610
You see that we really have
to use complex numbers here,

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.000
but they're on the unit circle.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.990
You couldn't ask
for a better line.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.650
What's the complex
conjugate that's

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.930
going to go into F inverse?

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:03.660
If I take i and I take its
conjugate, what does that mean?

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.570
So the conjugate of
that is just, flip it

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:10.600
across the real axis
to the other one.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.030
You see, it's great?

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.470
The complex conjugate
of i is minus i.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:22.700
Here's w_8 here's w bar 8.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.280
It's just across the axis.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.020
So it still has size one.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.380
And, of course, it's e to the?

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.770
This angle, which is
just minus this angle.

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.610
So that's why we get this minus.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:41.710
Because when I flip it
across, i changes to minus i,

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.120
angle changes to minus angle.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.690
And finally I was going to
do this multiplication just

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:47.580
to see.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:54.630
So now I'm claiming that this is
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; -i, -i^2,

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:55.880
-i^3.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:08.690
So on, -i^2, -i^3, fourth,
sixth, sixth, and ninth.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.840
And now, if you do
that multiplication,

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.770
you will get the
identity matrix.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.250
That's the great thing.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.700
You get the identity.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.110
1, 1, 1, 1.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:27.580
Except for a factor N. And
do you see that coming?

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.490
When I multiply this
by this, what do I get?

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.220
Four.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.640
If they were N by N, I'd
have N ones against N ones,

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:45.070
so I'd have to
expect an N there.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:51.010
So F times F inverse,
so, in other words

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:57.340
if I want to get the identity,
I'd better divide this by N.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:03.650
So now I have F F inverse
equal I. So F inverse is just

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:09.240
like F, except complex
conjugate and divide by N.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.670
So if I want this formula
to be really correct,

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:17.740
I have to divide by N. OK?

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.280
So and that's what
w and w bar is.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.730
And another letter that
often gets used in this topic

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.990
is omega.

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:33.810
And I figure that's a
good way to separate out

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.680
the complex conjugates,
let's call this guy w

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.880
and call this guy omega.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.420
So this is w and here's omega.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.120
I don't know if that helps.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.000
But you do have to keep
straight whether you're

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.220
talking about this
number or that number.

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:54.040
And this number
could be called w,

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.100
because omega wouldn't
be easy to type.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:01.670
So you have to pay attention,
which one you're doing

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.610
and when, somewhere you
have to divide by N.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.540
But otherwise it's fantastic.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:17.340
It's just beautiful.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.770
Can we do that
multiplication, just

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.420
to see that it really works?

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.570
Well, the ones worked fine.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:32.560
What about the ones times,
or what about the ones

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.780
times that column.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:42.470
So I'm looking at the (1,2)
entry in this multiplication.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.230
Or rather, the (0,1),
entry I should say.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.610
This is the zeroth row, and
this is the row number one,

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.420
and what do I get out of that?

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.140
Zero, right.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.640
That was my point.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:01.380
That this is adding up, oh well,
going the other way around.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.730
Because it's the
complex conjugate,

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:08.540
but it's adding up the four,
same four numbers and giving me

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.260
that zero.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.220
And now how about the
ones on the diagonal?

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:20.580
When I do this times
this, so this is the same,

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.530
the row times itself.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.320
What am I seeing there?

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.480
What are these terms?

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.550
That's certainly
one, what is i times

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:35.270
minus i? i times
minus i is one again.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.480
A number's getting
multiplied by its conjugate.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.410
That gives you something
real and positive

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:44.380
when you multiply a
number by its conjugate.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.290
In fact, we get one every
time, so we get four ones,

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:57.240
we divide by four
and we get that.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:02.230
Maybe you actually see
here, just so you remember.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:11.650
So F inverse is, I'm concluding
that-- F inverse, I'm

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.320
looking now, what is F inverse?

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.590
It's F conjugate divided
by this nuisance number

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:22.970
N. I could put square
root of N with F,

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.480
and then square root of N
would show up with F inverse,

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.840
just the way I could have done,
square root of 2pi with one,

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.730
and square root of
2pi with the other.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:37.060
But let's leave it like so.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.360
So that's not proved in a way.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:48.740
Just, checked for a
couple of cases with N=4,

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.330
but it always works.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.180
That's the beauty.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:57.310
In other words,
the two directions,

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:01.570
the y to c and the
c to y, are both

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.560
going to be speeded
up by the FFT.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.900
The FFT, whatever
it did, whatever

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.000
it could do with the
w and powers of w,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.860
it can do the same with w bar.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.280
And powers of w bar.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.690
If the FFT is a fast way
to to multiply by that,

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:21.240
it'll also give me a
fast way to multiply,

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.110
to do the other transform.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:29.610
So the FFT is what makes every--
This would all be important

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.500
if the FFT didn't exist.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.800
And of course actually,
Fourier didn't notice it.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.640
Gauss again had the
idea, but he had

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:46.890
so many ideas it wasn't
very clear in his notes.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.230
The FFT idea.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:58.450
But then Cooley and Tukey,
guys at Bell Labs in the 1950s

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.320
discovered it.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.210
In a small paper, I don't
think they had any idea

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.880
how important it would be.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.850
But they published
their paper and people

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.620
saw what was happening, and
realized that they should,

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.890
that that gave the right
way to do the transforms.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:24.290
OK, I was going to say here, do
you notice that this one, when

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:29.440
I take a vector, that
vectors and its complex

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.180
conjugate, what am I getting?

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.560
I'm getting the length squared.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.330
I'm getting the
right inner product.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.190
This is the right inner product
when things are complex.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.690
Something times its conjugate.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:47.330
I'm just reminding you that the
inner product of two vectors,

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:55.080
uv, u dot v or u comma v,
should now be the sum--

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.330
It used to be the
sum of u_i*v_i.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.250
But now we're in
the complex case,

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:04.770
so we should take the
conjugate one of them.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:07.990
And here I guess that's
the v, and this is the u,

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:15.820
and so the point is that
we're taking the right, yeah.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:22.210
We have, oh yeah. let
me just say it this way.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:26.400
These columns are orthogonal.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.940
Those four columns, the
columns of the Fourier matrix,

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.130
are orthogonal.

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:36.530
In other words, we have
an orthogonal basis.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:38.990
And it's those four columns.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:43.820
I almost missed saying that.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.040
But you remember from last week,
the whole point about sines

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:52.380
and cosines and exponentials
in the function case,

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.690
was orthogonal.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.170
That's what made
everything work,

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.420
and it makes
everything work here.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.180
Here we have vectors,
not functions.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.900
Orthogonal just means
dot products are zero.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.330
But they're complex, so
that in the dot product,

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.720
one factor or the other
has to get conjugated.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.080
Anyway, that's an
orthogonal matrix.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:20.530
Apart from this N,
this capital N thing.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:25.550
So if I normalize it, if I take
out one over square root of N,

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.080
now the length of
every column is one.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.540
So now I have
orthonormal columns.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.940
One squared, one squared, one
squared, one squared is four,

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.310
divided by four is one.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:43.920
And every column has
length, is a vector

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.200
in four-dimensional complex
space, of length one.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.070
And orthogonal.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.950
So that means orthonormal.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.820
It's a fantastic matrix.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.730
That's the best
basis we'll ever have

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.930
for complex
four-dimensional space.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:06.870
That basis.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:10.290
Well, actually when I say the
best basis we'll ever have,

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.550
I realize I wrote a
book about wavelets.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.970
And the idea of wavelets
is, there's another basis.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:18.230
A wavelet basis.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.600
And I hope to tell
you about that

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.010
at the very end of the semester.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.050
So wavelets would
be another basis,

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.530
would you like to know
the wavelet basis?

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.340
Have we got?

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:37.540
Just in case the end of
the semester doesn't come,

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.420
can I write down here
the wavelet basis?

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.590
OK.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:45.800
And you can decide you
maybe like it better.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.610
So the four by four
wavelet basis, alright.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:53.010
So this will be
the wavelet matrix.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.750
Well, this was too
good to lose, right?

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.620
That's a terrific vector.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.740
All ones, constant vector.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.960
It's the thing that
gives us the average,

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:13.740
this c_0 is going to again
be the average of the y's.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.500
How do I get that average?

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.640
Somehow I'm doing, the
c_0, the constant term

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.690
is again I'm going to
take one of everything

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.740
and I'll divide by four
and I'll have the average.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.550
So I like that vector.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.770
That's the DC vector,
if I'm talking

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:36.010
about-- direct current vector,
if I'm talking about networks.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:39.350
In an image, it
would be the whole,

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.450
you could call it the
blackboard vector.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:46.580
The whole image of a empty
blackboard would be constant.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.390
OK, so that's too good to lose.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:52.100
Now, the obvious thing
orthogonal to that

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.910
would be [1, 1, -1, -1].

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:57.580
Right?

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.860
Now I've got two
orthogonal columns.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.380
And probably that's pretty close
to something I have over here.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.490
Now, here's the
point about wavelets.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:10.870
You'll see it with the next guy.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:14.530
The next one, you saw that
those two are orthogonal.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.140
And real, and
simple, nice numbers.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:24.930
Now, the next one will
be [1,  -1, 0, 0].

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.110
Do you see that
that's orthogonal?

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:31.160
Obviously, because its dot
product with that is zero

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.010
and that is zero.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:35.700
And you want to tell me the
last column of the wavelet,

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.940
of the simple wavelet matrix?

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:47.380
This would be the Haar, named
after Haar, the Haar wavelets.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.670
The whole point about
wavelets was a new basis.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.700
Somebody realized,
well actually, Haar

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.724
lived a long time ago, but
they got improved and improved,

00:44:56.724 --> 00:44:57.890
but here's the simplest one.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:00.140
What's the good fourth column?

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:05.100
Fourth orthogonal vector here?

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.150
What shall I start with?

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:17.170
Zeroes, and then I'll
put one, minus one.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:23.860
So the beauty of wavelets is,
I've got this averaging vector.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.490
And then I've got this
difference, sort of

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.890
on a big scale, and then
I've got differences

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:34.200
on a little scale with zero,
differences here with zeroes

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.950
so as I keep going I could
do eight by eight, 16 by 16,

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:44.020
it would-- I get
the averaging guy.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.570
And then I get differencing,
I get large scale differences

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.480
and then I get
finer differences.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.610
So coarse differences,
finer differences,

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.630
finer finer differences.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:46:03.190
And that's a really good
way to-- If your function,

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:10.130
if your signal has jumps, we
saw that Fourier wasn't perfect,

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.010
right?

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.200
And a lot of signals have jumps.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:13.700
Right?

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:18.980
Your shocks, whatever
you're trying to represent.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.140
This is a better
basis to represent

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.430
a jump, a discontinuity,
than Fourier.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:29.330
Because Fourier, at a
discontinuity, does its best

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.490
but it's not a local basis.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:37.280
It can't, like, especially
focus on that jump point.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.250
And and the result is the
coefficients decay very slowly

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.190
and it's hard to compute with.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:49.910
Whereas the wavelet is great
for signals that have jumps.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.660
If something happens
suddenly at a certain time.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.720
Anyway, that would be
another, and of course I

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.200
haven't made these
unit vectors, I'd

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.230
have to divide that by
the square root of four

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.140
and divide these guys by
the square root of two just

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.810
to normalize them.

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:08.730
But normalizing isn't important.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.670
Orthogonal is what is important.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:20.770
OK, so that's competition,
you could say.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:22.310
That's the competition.

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:30.520
OK, back to main guy, so this
is the famous formula that gives

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.440
the y's from the c's, and what's
the other formula that gives

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:40.400
the c's from the y's?

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.540
So now this is the transform
in the other direction.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:49.700
So it's going to be a
sum from j=0 to N-1.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:57.150
And what's going to go in there?

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:01.320
Have you got the idea
of the two transforms?

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.330
In one direction this is e^i--
You see why we don't want

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.070
to write it.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:17.030
That is, that number is
e to the 2pi*i*j*k/N.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:23.620
That's what that number
is, in the Fourier matrix.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:28.010
So you see using w
makes it much cleaner.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:34.160
OK, what goes there? w bar.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.530
The complex conjugate, e to
the minus all that stuff.

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:42.310
w bar to the same power, jk.

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:45.690
And then I have to remember
to divide by N somewhere.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.370
I can put it here, or
I can put it there.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:55.460
But the all ones vector has
length squared equal to N

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:59.130
and I've got to divide
by an N somewhere.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:01.350
OK, those are the two
formulas that many people

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:02.580
would just remember.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.730
For them that's the
discrete Fourier transform

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.660
and the inverse, and maybe they
would put the N over there.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.420
Probably that would
be more common.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.870
I got started with the Fourier
matrix, with this side,

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:24.080
and then the DFT matrix comes
here, and I needed the N.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.330
So those are the formulas.

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:29.330
I don't know how you'd
prefer to remember these.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:31.500
Somehow you have to commit
something to memory here,

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.590
certainly what w is.

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:37.150
And the fact that
it's w and w bar?

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:40.000
And the fact that the
sums start at zero.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.560
And the fact that you have
just these simple expressions

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.060
for the entries in the matrix.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:53.070
And this then would be
c equals F inverse y.

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:59.870
That's what I've written
down there in detail.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:05.460
OK, so that's the discrete
Fourier transform,

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.990
and I think we're out of time.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:10.510
I've got more to say in a
little bit about the FFT,

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:12.180
how that works.

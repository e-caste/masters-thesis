00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.960
PROFESSOR: So we're going to
talk about crypto exchanges

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.670
today, which very much relate
to blockchain technology.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.590
But it's not directly
an application

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.360
of blockchain technology itself.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.770
But it is so much a part of the
ecosystem of crypto finance,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.160
with well over 90% and in some
cryptocurrencies 95% to 98%

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.890
percent of the actual
transactions happening

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.630
on crypto exchanges.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.890
So I thought that no course in
blockchain technology and money

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.800
could really be complete without
talking about crypto exchanges.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.800
But I want to just dare
say not to be looking

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.840
throughout these talk
today and even on Thursday

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.060
when we'll also be talking
about crypto exchanges

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.420
with some outside guests,
about, where are we lowering

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.010
the cost of verification?

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.960
Or where are we lowering
the networking costs?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.350
This is about basically
the secondary markets

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.510
in this $200 billion ecosystem.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.310
And the first crypto exchanges
came about actually in 2000,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.470
late in 2010, I think it was.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.890
But it may have been early
'11, because just when there

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.950
was one blockchain
application, bitcoin,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.558
people wanted to move bitcoin.

00:01:42.558 --> 00:01:44.100
It was like, well,
how can I do this?

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.330
I can do it with another
individual on a blockchain.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.120
But there was even, how do I
find that other individual if I

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.100
want to sell it or exchange it?

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.290
And so there was a
business opportunity.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.790
Mt.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.790
Gox was one of the
first three or four.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.770
I don't think it was
literally the first one.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.050
But it was one of
the first handful

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.390
that started to take off.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.350
We'll talk about Mt.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.210
Gox that failed.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.170
Dozens, if not hundreds
failed early on.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.760
But they were trying to provide
a user experience to trade

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.040
initially just solely bitcoin.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.930
Bitcoin versus fiat
was really what it was.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.780
And it was providing
also a service

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.590
to people that were not as
technologically adept as some

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.830
of the MIT students.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.660
So I was going to
ask again and by show

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.920
of hands, how many in the
room have ever owned a bit--

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.670
of cryptocurrency or something
like that just to-- all right.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.460
So it's a third to a half.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.990
But you'll see
it's going to be--

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.420
far fewer even in
this MIT community

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.950
have done that directly
on a blockchain, as well.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.870
So is it Alin?

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.580
Anybody else?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.000
So of the 30 hands that
went up, the other 29

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.450
basically have done it
through a crypto exchange.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.060
So they provide a
service right there.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.870
Now, there's a central irony
that Satoshi Nakamoto's

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.160
impetus, the motivation
that we've talked about

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.640
was how to do peer-to-peer
movement of value

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.420
on the internet without central
authorities, this failed

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.520
attempt throughout the '90s
that finally he or she solved

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.370
that riddle in 2008.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.360
Here is a decentralized way to
move value around the internet.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.240
And here, even at MIT,
the 30 or so of you

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.800
or the 40 of you that have
owned a crypto asset, but one

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.520
of you-- now, this is Sloan.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.710
And it's not computer
science and AI class.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.740
But I suspect even over in
the computer science class,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.810
it would be less
than half actually

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.310
have gone and downloaded
the nodes, because there's

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.050
a convenience factor.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.010
It's human nature.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.130
And so that even
started in 2010.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.160
So I wanted to talk a little
about crypto exchanges,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.500
some of their challenges, and
some of the opportunities.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.770
And it will set up also
for Thursday's discussion,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.800
where we'll be talking about how
a crypto exchange might be used

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.340
for a payment solution
and how an entrepreneur,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.130
like Jeff Sprecher really
has looked at and said, no.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.590
This is where he can see value.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.810
You will hear Thursday
somebody, who is true to his--

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.470
[LAUGHS]

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.570
--entrepreneurial
skills is trying

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.110
to find value in this whole
blockchain technology bitcoin

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.360
world and has chosen a kind of
a mixture of a payment solution

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.640
and a crypto exchange or both.

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:59.050
Well, this might not be tied in.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.620
So I'll do it the
old-fashioned way.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.000
So we're going to talk, of
course, the readings, crypto

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.030
exchanges, a little bit of
the public policy challenges,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.640
and then my thoughts
on path forward.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:20.680
Where do I see the crypto
exchange space moving forward

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.980
in time?

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.190
So Tom, you get to
answer another question.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.710
How has--

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.210
[LAUGHS]

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.350
--crypto exchanges become
critical gateways for--

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean, so
obviously, the usability,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.600
the interface [INAUDIBLE]
discuss about how many people

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.340
have downloaded digital wallets
and other versions of crypto

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.840
exchanges.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.002
And this is still the--

00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:42.710
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.502
So let's go to the
other side, because Alin

00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:47.510
was the one hand that went up
that you've downloaded nodes.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.055
Have you ever used
a crypto exchange,

00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:50.180
if you're willing to share?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.260
AUDIENCE: Well,
yeah, so I used--

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.130
PROFESSOR: So you've done both.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I used Coinbase.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.327
I bought some bitcoin.

00:05:55.327 --> 00:05:57.160
And then, I transferred
some on my computer,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.690
because I was doing
a research project.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.200
And I thought I was
going to use it.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.750
But [INAUDIBLE] ended up
deciding that it's too valuable

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.834
to sort of use it--

00:06:03.834 --> 00:06:04.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:06.322
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:07.030
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.580
Right.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.230
So if it were 2018 now and you
were to transact in bitcoin,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.730
would you prefer to use a crypto
exchange or the nodes that

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.300
you've--

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.080
just bitcoin?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.220
AUDIENCE: I guess it depends
on the security goal.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.080
So if I'm [INAUDIBLE],,
I'll use the node.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.502
If I want to send money to
my mom, I'll use [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:27.460
PROFESSOR: That's neat.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.600
Your mom uses bitcoin.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.446
AUDIENCE: No, but surprisingly
she's quite open to it.

00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:32.904
PROFESSOR: She is
quite open to it.

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:33.790
OK.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.230
So even somebody who
is computer literate

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.210
and has both the
nodes and the exchange

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.290
is saying depends
on how tired I am

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.675
and what my goals--
security's goals.

00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:46.800
Maybe you didn't say tired.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.700
But and anybody want to
hit the second question?

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the amount
of time, the amount of disputes

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.050
that arise [INAUDIBLE]
resolve these things

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.655
[INAUDIBLE] that a regular
exchange could not [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:12.655 --> 00:07:14.280
PROFESSOR: Which type
of disputes then?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.103
AUDIENCE: Like, there was
money [INAUDIBLE] triple debits

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:21.031
from accounts or you know,
[INAUDIBLE] money not taken out

00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:23.977
or too much and [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.600
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.680
And how do these
exchanges compare

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.130
to traditional exchanges?

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.100
So the New York Stock Exchange--

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.198
how does Coinbase compare
to New York Stock Exchange?

00:07:39.198 --> 00:07:43.648
AUDIENCE: You must add it
to some kind of, like, user

00:07:43.648 --> 00:07:45.190
ready to buy some
bitcoin beforehand.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.110
And then, [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.460
PROFESSOR: So you're
saying they have reserves.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.510
AUDIENCE: I mean, I don't
know if it's a reserve.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.970
But like, we buy from Coinbase.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.930
We don't buy from another user.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.500
PROFESSOR: So Coinbase itself--

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.625
so one change difference--

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:05.830
and I'm going to highlight
three and see if we can get off

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.000
from this discussion.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.880
One is the exchange
itself might be

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.680
on the other side of the
transaction from you.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.170
Alexis called that that
they had a reserve.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.830
Some might call
that market making.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.600
I'm sorry.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.954
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I [INAUDIBLE]
crypto exchange [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:27.910
as a broker.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.762
So they face the customers
instead of facing [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:31.470
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.990
So a corollary to what
Alexis says that they

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.757
might be a market maker--

00:08:35.757 --> 00:08:37.090
remind me your first name again.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:37.950
AUDIENCE: Zhongling

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.220
PROFESSOR: What?

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.059
AUDIENCE: Zhongling

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.200
PROFESSOR: Johnny-- is
that they take on brokerage

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.880
responsibilities--

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.610
in the world of finance
or on trading platforms,

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.900
trading platforms, by
and large, early on

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.220
did not allow the
public to transact.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.710
The New York Stock Exchange,
when it started in the late

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:08.400
18th century by an arrangement
between members in the south

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.160
of Manhattan, you know,
near Wall Street--

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.580
the physical Wall
Street literally--

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.770
it was a membership society
or a membership club.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.020
And you had to be a
member to transact.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.950
Well, those
membership and clubs,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.150
just like a golf club or a
tennis club, had a set of rules

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.780
well before governments
got involved.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.850
And they would transact.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:37.230
That became, well, what is now
known as intermediated access

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.490
that I don't think any of you
are members of the New York

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.630
Stock Exchange, are you?

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.190
I'm not either.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.600
So we can't actually transact
with the New York Stock

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.520
Exchange.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.620
But we can use an
app, like Robinhood

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.650
and ask them to transact with
the New York Stock Exchange

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.410
or Goldman Sachs or
Vanguard or you know, whom--

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.170
so that's called
intermediated access.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.710
So two things we've
had is 1, is Coinbase

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.240
might be the other side.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.660
2, there's-- they don't-- they
lack intermediated access.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.160
Eric?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.470
AUDIENCE: They don't store
the [INAUDIBLE] that's being

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.112
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:09.112 --> 00:10:09.820
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.955
AUDIENCE: --in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:14.780
The Coinbase actually
stores the currency.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.680
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.600
So Eric says the
third big difference--

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.100
I mean, there are
other differences.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.280
But the third big difference
is crypto exchanges

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.310
store the value.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.640
The New York Stock Exchange
did not store the value.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.970
Your value is
technically ultimately

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:37.100
on a ledger at the
Depository Trust Corp., DTCC.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.940
And just like the payment
system has the central bank

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.420
and commercial banks,
securities ledgers

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.200
have a central ledger,
which is DTCC in the US

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.160
and in other countries, other
similar clearing organizations.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.250
And underneath it
are the brokers

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.910
that hold things-- it's
called in street name.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.360
But whatever it's called,
know that most exchanges,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.310
traditional securities markets--

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.630
those are the three big
difference-- custody,

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.690
intermediated access, and who's
making markets against you.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.270
Please.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.190
AUDIENCE: Maybe
just a question I

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.620
have is when I
click the exchange,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.200
every transaction is backed
by the [INAUDIBLE] right?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.630
So [INAUDIBLE] if
I sell bitcoin,

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.540
I must have owned
the bitcoin before,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.450
whereas in the relative
exchange you can just

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.820
issue trade without owning
[INAUDIBLE] or money,

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.480
just a promise.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.330
So you can create
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.430
PROFESSOR: Well,
so you're raising

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.980
a question of the
difference between cash

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.410
markets and derivative markets,
which exist and have existed

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.230
for a couple hundred years
so that in a cash market,

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.330
you're selling an
ownership right

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.860
and buying an ownership right
in a stock and bond or even

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.270
in bitcoin.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.450
And then, in derivative
markets, you're

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.210
entering into a contract--

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.820
or sometimes people call them
contract for differences,

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.210
but a contract that's going
to relate to a price--

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:17.800
a pricing mechanism
from some of--

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.395
oracle it can be called.

00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:21.020
In computer science,
they would call it

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.440
an oracle but in the
commodities market

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.470
by some index provider
or some pricing provider.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.330
That's the difference is
between cash and derivatives.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.060
But are you saying something
even in addition to that?

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.352
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because I
was going to get to the point

00:12:37.352 --> 00:12:39.620
that [INAUDIBLE] launched
the bitcoin [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.328
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:42.793
AUDIENCE: And I had
[INAUDIBLE] seems

00:12:42.793 --> 00:12:47.292
to always be the derivative in
[INAUDIBLE] cash [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:48.000
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.325
So I ask you all to
go as deep as you can

00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:52.200
between now and Thursday,
because you'll have

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.520
the founder of ICE with us.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.670
But ICE is a one-day futures
contract that literally you're

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.680
buying a derivative of bitcoin.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.230
But it's a very unusual
futures contract,

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.450
because it has to be
100% collateralized.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.650
So there's no margin.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.800
There's no ability to have
leverage or debt or credit

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.240
extension.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.350
And one day later, you
get delivered the bitcoin.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.730
So one of the interesting
questions for Thursday

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.690
that you can press
Jeff and Kelly on

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.990
is, is this really a
derivatives contract?

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.210
Or is it a form
of a cash contract

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.420
that just starts as a
derivative, and 24 hours later

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.190
it becomes cash, because
it's 100% collateralized.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.020
And it settles one day later--

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.730
very unusual future contract.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.430
I'm not aware of any
other one-day future 100%

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.500
collateralized contract.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.360
It feels to me that this is,
in essence, a cash contract

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.450
by another name for one
day that facilitates

00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:00.040
being regulated by an official
regulator for derivatives.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.500
That's for that one.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.690
But I thought you were saying
one other thing is, can you

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.150
sell short bitcoin?

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.720
Has anybody-- Sean?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.540
I don't know how, but
I have shorted bitcoin

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.830
before [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.772
PROFESSOR: Sean has
shorted ether bitcoin and--

00:14:21.772 --> 00:14:22.730
AUDIENCE: Bitcoin cash.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.260
PROFESSOR: Bitcoin cash.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.140
So how did you do it?

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.060
AUDIENCE: Well, there
is-- it's not organized,

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.500
for instance [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.600
PROFESSOR: Shorting is selling
something you don't own

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.070
and taking the
opposite price risk--

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.800
in essence, winning
when a price goes down

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.650
and losing when a price goes up.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.520
And it's existed for
hundreds of years.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.490
It's not new.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.860
But it's-- to short
something, in most markets,

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.560
you need to be able to
borrow the underlying.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.100
To sell a stock
that you don't own,

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.620
there's a whole market
called stock borrow, where

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.480
ultimately-- and we
debated this one day.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.340
And there are
experts in this room

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.050
that have worked in
stock borrow, where

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.430
you borrow the security.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.780
And then, you sell it.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.680
Or you sell it.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.620
And within the two days
that you have to deliver it,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.300
your broker borrows it for you.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.970
So I'm assuming,
Sean, that when you

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:22.710
shorted bitcoin, what was
behind that app-- somebody

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:23.210
borrowed it.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.122
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] borrowed it.

00:15:25.122 --> 00:15:28.290
And I think the
market [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.640
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.607
And so just to move to
the third question--

00:15:38.607 --> 00:15:41.190
so three big differences-- and
we're going to dig into these--

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.960
custody, intermediated broke--

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.170
you know, basically, do
you have an intermediary?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.180
Or are you direct?

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.940
And is the exchange
a market maker?

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:59.140
What are all the hacks and
manipulation and so forth?

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.710
Tell you about this state
of security at these

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.860
and the state of
market integrity.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:12.470
AUDIENCE: It makes the crypto
exchange insecure and less

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.057
[INAUDIBLE] and
[INAUDIBLE] less customers

00:16:16.057 --> 00:16:18.015
see the financial
institution or the mainstream

00:16:18.015 --> 00:16:19.476
financial institution.

00:16:19.476 --> 00:16:20.440
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.800
So in essence, that
regardless of where

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.670
you come out on pro-regulation
or anti-regulation or

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.660
pro-business or anti-business
or pro-bitcoin or anti,

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.610
it's a question of trust.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.670
When you're losing a
lot of assets to theft--

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.340
and a hack is just another
word for stealing--

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.540
or you're losing money
to market manipulation,

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.370
then that tends
to have, you know,

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.460
lower trust in
these institutions.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.290
I mean, we can debate
what to do about it.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.253
I publicly have a point of view.

00:16:56.253 --> 00:16:57.920
And I'm going to share
it with you as we

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.660
go through this class today.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.330
But you don't need to share
the second part, which

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.960
is where I am on how to
address that to recognize

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.890
that the high level
of custody issues

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.730
and the high level of
market manipulation issues

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.829
probably is
associated with lower

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.900
trust in these institutions.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.050
Even now, there's,
you know, 30 million

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.390
plus people that have
used crypto exchanges

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.390
and 30 or 40 people
in this class.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.130
So there is a level of trust.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:32.990
I'm just saying that
I think that's what's

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.780
really at the middle of this.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.150
So let's have-- so we
had a bunch of readings.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.400
I'll skip over that.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.620
So crypto exchanges-- so this
is what a centralized exchange

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.120
does.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.790
There's about 200 of them.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.210
Probably in the history of
bitcoin, there's 100 to 200

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.790
that have already opened
and shut, you know.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.640
So somewhere in the history,
there's been 300 or 400.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.850
It's still pretty
darn decentralized

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.770
in terms of the number of them.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.840
And I'll later say, I think one
of the things that will happen

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.590
is we'll see more consolidation.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.940
There's just so many of them.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.880
That's an unusual
market structure.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:20.150
Markets usually coalesce around
some central pricing function.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.360
You want to buy and sell your
apples hundreds of years ago.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.028
You'd come into
the center market

00:18:25.028 --> 00:18:26.945
if you wanted to get the
best price discovery.

00:18:26.945 --> 00:18:28.612
AUDIENCE: Is there a
reason now, though,

00:18:28.612 --> 00:18:32.260
because you have [INAUDIBLE]
in different areas alone.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.180
So [INAUDIBLE] same
assets [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.680
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, do we

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.270
have so many crypto exchanges
in part because of lots

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.270
of different regulation?

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.770
I think that contributes to it.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.920
I would say yes.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.040
But I don't think
that's the only reason.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.715
Yeah.

00:18:49.715 --> 00:18:53.110
AUDIENCE: I think another
reason might be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:01.935 --> 00:19:04.060
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
traditional exchanges--

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.490
there was the--

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.500
especially for
physical goods, apples,

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.060
there was a locational advantage
of being in the central square.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.090
I agree with that.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.765
There was locational advantages
to be in New York or London.

00:19:15.765 --> 00:19:18.270
Do you know in the 19th
century the Philadelphia Stock

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.640
Exchange was bigger than
the New York Stock Exchange

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.160
until about the 1840s or '50s?

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.250
Post-Civil War, New York took
off compared to Philadelphia,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.670
but there is
locational advantages.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.150
But in a digital age, there's
less locational advantages.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.130
I agree with that.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.580
I also think it's a very
early days in some regards.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.530
It doesn't take much.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.420
There's one software
provider that

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:48.075
provides the software for
over 100 crypto exchanges.

00:19:48.075 --> 00:19:50.450
They're not the biggest ones,
because some of the biggest

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.060
ones write their own software.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.360
But it's-- at least the
CEO that told me this,

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.410
who runs this software company
said that it was over 20%

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.730
and maybe 30% of the volume.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.150
So half of the crypto
exchanges, of that,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.940
a quarter of the volume,
all have the same software,

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.900
meaning the software
for the order book,

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.590
for the custody, solutions,
and things like that.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.280
You, too, could start
a crypto exchange.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.700
Please be compliant
with securities law

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.920
if you're going to
operate here in the US--

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.660
well, actually if you're going
to operate in any country,

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.260
but particularly in the US.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.762
So it's not hard to start up.

00:20:31.762 --> 00:20:32.720
That's one other thing.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.873
It's not hard to start
up a crypto exchange

00:20:34.873 --> 00:20:37.040
right now if you've got a
software provider that can

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.910
give you basically a package.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.510
And you put a new name on it.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.170
And off you're going.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.630
But they're matching agents,
meaning they're matching buys

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:48.640
and sells.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.170
They are also counterparties,
which we talked about.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.670
And they're custodians.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.130
Traditional exchanges
do the first.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.910
But they tend not to do
the second and third.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.870
Decentralized exchanges--
decentralized exchanges

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.060
are very small
part of the market.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.530
We'll see some
numbers later that

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.420
estimate it's a little
less than one half

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:15.160
of 1% of the volume right
now in October of 2018.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.550
But they're a computer algorithm
that allows you to trade peer

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.620
to peer without a centralized.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.410
And there's a lot of variation
in the decentralized space.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.880
And I'll take any
questions on it.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.130
But it's an interesting
piece, where it's saying,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.750
Kelly and I don't
really need Coinbase

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.840
to trade if there's
some application that

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.610
can find each of us.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.870
And we can find each other.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.240
Ross.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.145
AUDIENCE: So it's really--

00:21:46.145 --> 00:21:49.908
the decentralized exchange is--

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:52.200
I'm trying to understand what
you're saying correctly--

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.125
centralized but only for
the matching agent function.

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:56.000
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.255
Correct.

00:21:56.255 --> 00:21:56.510
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.310
And it just doesn't
have the other two,

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.908
because you can just trade--

00:21:59.908 --> 00:22:00.616
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:22:00.616 --> 00:22:01.908
AUDIENCE: --if you have a node.

00:22:01.908 --> 00:22:04.700
PROFESSOR: So Ross has
raised-- are decentralized

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.170
really centralized for matching
and don't have the other two?

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.420
Let me answer it in reverse.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:16.630
Decentralized exchanges do not
have any custody function--

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.050
no custody function,
though I could envision

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.750
that somehow they could set
up a decentralized escrow

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.210
function through some multisig.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.570
You could technologically
even do that decentralized.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.040
But what I know now is none of
them have a custody solution.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.470
And none of them
are counterparties.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.530
That is accurate.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.010
It's not clear that all
of them are centralized.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.420
There's one developer.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.080
There's one set of
computer technologists.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.060
But you can actually,
if you wish,

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.240
put that algorithm out and just
say, that was a fun project.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.220
I'm a computer scientist at MIT.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.330
And just put it out there.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.400
And Kelly and I could
find each other.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.310
But usually, there's an
economic model, where somebody

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.640
is trying to make some money.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.600
And so then, there's some
centralization of the software.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:13.030
And the SEC just brought their
first legal action last week

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.080
against a
decentralized exchange.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.080
And it was, in essence, against
the software developers.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
Now, there's the
First Amendment.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.160
Don't get me wrong.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.340
There is clearly a freedom
of speech and freedom

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.200
of expression in this country.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.850
But you could be a
software developer

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.580
and still be complicit
in some crime.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.440
And both the SEC and CFTC
have, in the past 12 months,

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.410
brought in legal actions
against software developers.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:45.460
And it's interesting that
in the last week, the SEC--

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.360
they settled.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:52.000
It was sort of a thing
where, EtherDelta

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.470
had put a decentralized
trading platform for--

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.530
what do you think the SEC
is most interested in?

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.697
What type of-- what's that--

00:24:01.697 --> 00:24:02.322
AUDIENCE: ICOs.

00:24:02.322 --> 00:24:03.290
PROFESSOR: --Catalina?

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.220
ICOs-- yeah, so it was
a decentralized platform

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:12.810
to trade Ethereum-based, more
specifically, ERC-20 tokens.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:18.670
Decentralized-- Eilon and I
could trade our ERC-20 tokens.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:21.536
But they said, no, no,
that's a Securities Exchange.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.270
So and it's the first action
the Securities and Exchange

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.555
Commission has brought
against any crypto exchange.

00:24:30.555 --> 00:24:32.680
Why they picked it
decentralized to be their first?

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.930
That's a story I don't know.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.860
But they did.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.250
So that's decentralized-- so
less than 1/2% of the volume,

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.710
but an interesting and
tough, you know, new area.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.030
And it brings you
back to maybe Nakamoto

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.990
more vision decentralized.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.450
So as I said,
responsible, just like

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:58.290
in this classroom for probably
95% percent of the bitcoin

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.890
and ether transactions--

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.100
who do you think the
biggest sellers are

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.700
in bitcoin around the globe?

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.020
AUDIENCE: Miners.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.000
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.708
AUDIENCE: Miners.

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:12.860
PROFESSOR: Miners--
right-- miners.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.580
Who do you think the
biggest sellers of ether--

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.884
ETH is?

00:25:17.884 --> 00:25:19.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.380
PROFESSOR: Anybody?

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.380
AUDIENCE: ICOs.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.338
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:25:22.338 --> 00:25:23.180
IC-- what'd you say?

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:23.870
AUDIENCE: ICOs.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.720
PROFESSOR: ICOs,
yes, because ICOs--

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.930
80% of ICOs are
done on Ethereum.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.490
And generally, in
the early days,

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.970
they were selling
a token for bitcoin

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.660
when Vitalik Buterin did his.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.190
And he sold ETH for bitcoin.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.500
But we've moved-- in
the last 12 months,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.380
it's basically selling for ETH.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.680
So then, you want to sell
it generally speaking.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.520
I mean, they might keep some.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.980
Over 30 million direct members--

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.920
and as we talked about, they
lack intermediated access

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.600
and as we'll see,
market integrity rules.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.620
So this is, you know,
the market as it is.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.130
The most important part of this
slide to me in this discussion

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.210
is not the volatility,
which we now.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.720
And frankly,
actually, recently, we

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.980
haven't had much
volatility for six months.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.430
But six months isn't enough
statistical relevance

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.970
to say what the next six
years or 60 years will be.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.050
But 54% is bitcoin.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.420
Ethereum is, what, 16%.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.320
So between them, that's 70%.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.860
So we already know in the US
and in many other jurisdictions

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.550
that 3/4 of the market
are not ICOs or not

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.250
what would be called securities,
even in the US, Canada,

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.310
and Taiwan, the three
jurisdictions that

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.270
follow something similar
to the Howey Test

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:50.570
that we've talked about.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:55.750
3/4 of the market
is non-securities.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:27:00.220
It's just a commodity,
a cash crypto.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.933
So you'll hear debates about
initial coin offerings.

00:27:02.933 --> 00:27:03.850
And what's a security?

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:04.933
And what's not a security?

00:27:04.933 --> 00:27:07.870
Relevant-- relevant
and important debate,

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.540
but for 3/4 of the
market, it's not

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.620
particularly relevant as a legal
matter, as a regulatory matter.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.570
Brodish.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.030
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:21.265
So which bitcoins will become
a stable value crypto currency?

00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:23.470
And what is the
relevance of an exchange?

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.340
If it is not an asset,
what is [INAUDIBLE]??

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.440
PROFESSOR: So is--

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.740
Brotish, is your
question that if there's

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.325
limited volatility, what's
the value of an exchange?

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.620
The value is still
is that some people

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.650
will want to sell that
asset or buy that asset.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.600
Some people might-- if
it's a store of value,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.390
I might still want to
sell that store of value

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.720
so that I can buy a
car or go to school

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.580
or pay for my medical bills.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.910
You don't think that's as
exciting as a volatile asset.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.425
Is that what you're
saying, Brodish?

00:28:00.425 --> 00:28:01.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.925
PROFESSOR: Well, at
Goldman Sachs, for years,

00:28:02.925 --> 00:28:06.220
it used to be that I was taught
volatility is our friend.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.700
When you're an
investment banking

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:16.760
business and making markets, a
market maker likes volatility.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.625
So you might be thinking
as a market maker

00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:19.840
or as an investment banker.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:25.330
But I still think that if
bitcoin or any of these

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.360
became very stable
stores of value,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.340
people would still want
to trade in and out of it.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.860
But you're saying it's
just less exciting.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.359
For you or for the
market, you think?

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:39.734
AUDIENCE: For the
market, maybe--

00:28:39.734 --> 00:28:40.776
I don't have any bitcoin.

00:28:40.776 --> 00:28:41.810
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.240
I don't either.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.370
So here are the top
crypto exchanges.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.560
I caution-- this was
printed a week ago.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:29:00.410
It's only accurate to say that
a web group, CryptoCompare, puts

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.200
out a monthly report.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.980
And I grabbed the
October report.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.550
But I would--
there's no confidence

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.520
that these numbers are accurate,
except for I can tell you

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.300
CryptoCompare has relationships
with about 140 exchanges.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.930
And those 140 exchanges
give their information

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.190
to CryptoCompare.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.290
But here are the big ones.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.980
What do you take
from this slide when

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.300
you look at either the average
trade side, the trades in 24

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.600
hours, the volumes--

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.240
anything?

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.560
I mean, has anybody
traded on an exchange

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.120
that's not listed there,
if you're willing to say?

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.120
Eilon has, huh?

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.550
AUDIENCE: In Coinbase.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:42.980
AUDIENCE: Coinbase.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.840
AUDIENCE: Coinbase.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.330
PROFESSOR: Coinbase isn't
listed in the top 14--

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:51.610
look at that-- for the month
of October by CryptoCompare.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:52.510
Sabrina.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.350
AUDIENCE: KuCoin.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.790
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.605
AUDIENCE: KuCoin.

00:29:54.605 --> 00:29:55.480
PROFESSOR: True Coin?

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.460
AUDIENCE: KuCoin.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.440
PROFESSOR: KuCoin.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.487
Oh, KuCoin.

00:29:59.487 --> 00:30:00.570
AUDIENCE: I used Poloniex.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.230
PROFESSOR: Poloniex
which is definitely

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.278
smaller than this [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:04.278 --> 00:30:06.570
AUDIENCE: I was just going
to say [INAUDIBLE] motivated

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:10.912
on selling [INAUDIBLE] is do
you know US-based exchanges?

00:30:10.912 --> 00:30:13.120
PROFESSOR: So the US-based
exchanges aren't up there.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.550
So we don't know if these
numbers are accurate.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.370
They are what CryptoCompare
collects from 140 exchanges.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.700
But it doesn't mean
they are accurate.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.220
One way they can be
inaccurate is an exchange

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.410
can just outright lie.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:32.363
And if there's no rule or law
against it, they can do that.

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:33.780
Another way they
can do it is they

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.740
can be honest about the
numbers, but inflate

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.890
the numbers through
something called wash trades.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:45.750
Wash trades are banned in
the US under securities laws

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.380
and under Commodity Futures
Trading Commission laws.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.950
A wash trade is when I buy
something and sell something

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.920
at the same time
basically to myself

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.390
or my affiliate or my colleague.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.200
And if I have even--
if Alon and I are not

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.760
even legally affiliated, but
if I sell something to Alon

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.270
and he buys it, and we have
an agreement that we are just

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.320
pumping the volume for some
reason, that's a wash sale.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.360
Why would somebody do
a wash sale between two

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.870
unaffiliated parties?

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:18.370
Come on.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.420
Think devious.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.193
Think like, you
know, a manipulator.

00:31:21.193 --> 00:31:22.693
AUDIENCE: If you're
starting a coin,

00:31:22.693 --> 00:31:23.919
you want to make
other people think

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:25.150
other people are using it.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you wanted to
make sure somebody else thought

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.210
something was used.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.500
What's the-- that's use--

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.042
another reason?

00:31:32.042 --> 00:31:35.070
AUDIENCE: It will show
artificial liquidity

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.330
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.580
PROFESSOR: So artificial
liquidity and one other thing

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.093
that you might show--
an artificial--

00:31:41.093 --> 00:31:41.760
AUDIENCE: Price.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.427
AUDIENCE: Price.

00:31:42.427 --> 00:31:43.690
PROFESSOR: Price-- thank you.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.690
So wash sales for a
long time in markets

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.510
was a good way for
manipulators to kind of, hey,

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.530
look at this liquidity.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.580
Look at this price--

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.410
pricing signals.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.870
So that's why in the US
Securities and Commodities

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.610
markets-- we say no.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:03.100
It's one small core
thing that's not allowed.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.190
But there's no
ban on wash sales,

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.875
though there's
academic literature.

00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:07.750
There's some studies.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.770
Some competitors, some exchanges
study other exchanges to say,

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.590
they have a lot of
wash sales over there.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:19.055
So we don't know how real
these volume figures are.

00:32:19.055 --> 00:32:20.680
The other thing that
I find interesting

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.200
is the average trade side--

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.590
$200 to $1,000, couple of
them a couple thousand.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.570
I mean, these are not
large transactions.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:29.247
Kelly.

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:31.330
AUDIENCE: So this isn't
really [INAUDIBLE] itself.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.010
But some of the
articles that we read

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:38.050
compared exchanges to, say,
like Scottrade and Fidelity

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.065
and some other
platforms like that

00:32:40.065 --> 00:32:41.190
for traditional securities.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.500
So I wonder-- and it basically
was saying, like, look,

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.140
you know, I think Coinbase
or something has, like,

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.130
30 billion registered--

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.767
PROFESSOR: 20 million acount.

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:52.100
AUDIENCE: 20 million-- so
that's obviously pretty good.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.650
I wonder how the other
metrics compare to--

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.400
PROFESSOR: So I went
around trying to find

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.840
a list of the membership.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.495
And I couldn't
find it for others.

00:33:01.495 --> 00:33:03.370
And maybe it's kind of--
it's a little harder

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.830
than pumping your numbers
through wash trading.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.400
I mean, you could also
lie about your membership.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.740
And even Coinbase's
20 million doesn't

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.035
mean they're active members.

00:33:13.035 --> 00:33:13.660
AUDIENCE: True.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] security
is [INAUDIBLE] Coinbase.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.830
PROFESSOR: Coinbase--
so here is another way

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:28.090
to look at-- it is by legal
jurisdiction-- same database.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:32.780
You're going to have eight or 10
slides that are same database.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.520
Coinbase is in the US.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.570
And this would say that it was
a little less than 140,000--

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.420
no, I can't quite see
where that line comes.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.030
Maybe it's $100 million a day.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.680
And this is just the
month of October.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.420
So that's where--

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.075
Sean.

00:33:50.075 --> 00:33:51.283
AUDIENCE: I was just curious.

00:33:51.283 --> 00:33:54.054
Why is that the Chinese
crypto exchange [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:54.054 --> 00:33:55.497
listed up there?

00:33:55.497 --> 00:33:59.890
[INAUDIBLE] to me [INAUDIBLE]
actually quite vague.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.130
PROFESSOR: It's listed
there in the Seychelles

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:07.410
at 300 [INAUDIBLE] I'm not sure
why it's not listed on this.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.760
It's the same database.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.550
It's not there.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.989
Yeah, there it is-- number 5--

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:12.489
number 5.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.360
So what would you
take around this

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.429
about the great financial
centers of the world?

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:20.929
Yes.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:24.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] one
of the questions that I

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.850
got to see in the
previous slide was

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.429
if you sum up all the trades
that those [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:33.170
are claiming that they are
doing on a 24-hour basis,

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.620
isn't that a lot larger than the
capacity of the system itself?

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.620
I can't remember-- what?

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.815
It was like seven
transactions per second that--

00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:41.690
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.860
So the question is, this looks
like a lot more volume that's

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.880
actually happening.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.219
And I'm going to agree with you.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:52.070
Why do you think
that's possible--

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.350
two reasons?

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:56.718
AUDIENCE: Because they're just
doing the exchanges internally.

00:34:56.718 --> 00:34:59.408
So they're not actually
transacting on the blockchain,

00:34:59.408 --> 00:35:00.450
because they [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:00.570
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:01.600
And remind me of
your first name.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:01.990
AUDIENCE: Jack.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.782
PROFESSOR: Jack-- so
Jack's point is, well,

00:35:03.782 --> 00:35:06.180
maybe not all of this is
going to the blockchain.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.210
It's happening on
a spreadsheet--

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.460
in some cases, an
Excel spreadsheet.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.430
But I'm not aware of
anybody storing it even

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:20.280
on a blockchain within
the Coinbase or Kraken

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.330
or [INAUDIBLE] system.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.148
Second reason?

00:35:25.148 --> 00:35:27.044
AUDIENCE: Like, I
would say [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:27.044 --> 00:35:29.890
because it's [INAUDIBLE]
the same second layer.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.500
PROFESSOR: So it might be
using a second layer solution

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.720
or a lightning or second layer.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.120
That's quite possible,
even though I'm not aware

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.500
if there's a lot of activity.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:42.980
Third reason?

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.930
There's a lot of
currency crosses here.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.710
This is not just bitcoin.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.560
There's probably 2,000
to 3,000 different pairs

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.420
that get traded on any day--

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.780
bitcoin-ether, bitcoin-dollar,
bitcoin-tether.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.940
You can bitcoin bitcoin cash,
but a lot of the crosses--

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:04.210
a cross in foreign currency
land is two currencies.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.370
It's often called
a currency pair.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.500
US dollar versus
euro or US dollar

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.010
versus yen, these
were currency pairs.

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:15.670
But now, if we can use
the same terminology here,

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:20.830
there's thousands of crosses or
pairs, so it's not all Bitcoin.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:25.480
But the first reason's the
biggest one, what Jack said.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:31.750
Not all of these exchanges
will settle to a blockchain

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:32.450
immediately.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.470
In fact, it's costly,
even for them.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.790
So they'll take some
price risk, and if they

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:44.510
have enough customers
and their market making

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.760
on the other side, they'll
take some price risk.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:51.630
And they might settle to the
blockchain multiple times a day

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.050
but only settle when
there have exposure.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.330
And I don't know, their
risk management might be,

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:00.500
I'll settle when I'm long 10
Bitcoin or short 10 Bitcoin,

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.230
but take some price exposure.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.020
That risk management,
in essence,

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.200
Coinbase or Cracken
or Gemini or Huobi

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.390
are basically saying, I'll
take some price exposure

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.240
and only settle to the
ultimate settlement

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.600
finality, the
blockchain, several times

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:24.300
a day which, of course, takes
10 to 60 minutes as well.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.700
So that's happened here.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.440
Good observation.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:28.940
Yes, Isabel.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.148
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] talks
a alot about how they key

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:34.450
digital wallets off of the
network for added security.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.530
So do other exchanges
not do that?

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:41.430
PROFESSOR: So Isabel has
raised that Coinbase promotes

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:45.600
that they have a secure custody
solution, and part of it

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:51.270
is keeping your Bitcoin
off of the network.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.530
The term is keeping
it in cold wallets

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:56.040
instead of a hot wallet.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.400
Anybody know what
a hot wallet is?

00:37:59.400 --> 00:37:59.927
Eric?

00:37:59.927 --> 00:38:01.260
AUDIENCE: Software-based wallet.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.460
PROFESSOR: Software-based wallet
that's connected, currently

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.820
connected, as opposed
to a wallet that's

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.205
disconnected and not signed up.

00:38:14.205 --> 00:38:15.830
Let me hold that
question, because I've

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:19.850
got a slide on that, but yes,
the answer is others also

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:23.130
have cold storage.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:23.630
Mt.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:27.830
Gox five years ago didn't
have much cold storage,

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.350
but what other
observation here about

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.660
the great financial
centers of the world?

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.190
James?

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.603
AUDIENCE: They're
all tax havens.

00:38:35.603 --> 00:38:37.020
PROFESSOR: They're
all tax havens.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.150
Malta, Binance,
and OKX, now again,

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.925
whether the Binance and
OKX numbers are legit.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.120
You're Hong Kong, right?

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.660
Yeah?

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.540
You're Hong Kong.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.540
Biggest tax haven of China.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.820
Yeah, the British
Virgin Islands,

00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:00.180
Seychelles, it's kind of--

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.892
so there's some regulatory
arbitrage going on.

00:39:03.892 --> 00:39:06.100
And these are the countries
where they're registered,

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.220
not necessarily the country
of the real operations.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.790
Some are-- Huobi is one
that started in the People's

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:21.280
Republic, but in Beijing, but
they registered elsewhere.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.318
PROFESSOR: You mean
you don't know them?

00:39:29.318 --> 00:39:30.360
Does anybody want to say?

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.064
Priya?

00:39:31.064 --> 00:39:31.727
AUDIENCE: Islands of
the South Pacific right?

00:39:31.727 --> 00:39:32.977
French Polynesia or something.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.377
PROFESSOR: There you go.

00:39:38.377 --> 00:39:39.960
I'm surprised that
you haven't learned

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.700
about this financial center.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.317
OK.

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:48.150
James is this going to
tell us more about it

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:52.260
and how much it costs to go
on Expedia during sip week.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.230
I think Sloan should
benefit from a true trip.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.740
OK.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.448
So this is a different
way to measure it.

00:39:57.448 --> 00:39:58.485
This is not on volume.

00:39:58.485 --> 00:39:59.610
I'm going to take a second.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.100
This is just number
of major exchanges,

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.125
and there's the eight
big ones in the US,

00:40:04.125 --> 00:40:05.250
starting with the biggest--

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:09.030
Coinbase, Bittrex, Poloniex,
that we talked about,

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.730
Cracken, Gemini, Itbit.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.920
Those are the ones
that are US-based,

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.660
that some of you in
the US might have.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.910
I think on this chart, if
you don't find your exchange

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.640
on this chart, I would be--

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.870
all right, all right,
maybe, because it

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.080
might have already failed,
whatever exchange you have.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.761
But Eric, who are
you looking for?

00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:29.755
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:29.755 --> 00:40:30.630
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.130
These slides will
all be on Canvas.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.505
I'm sorry, Joe,
you had a question?

00:40:34.505 --> 00:40:37.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.720
2 So what all of the
exchanges did very early on--

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.930
this is starting right
in late '10 and in '11--

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:55.550
they set up an account
structure literally

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:57.500
on Excel spreadsheets,
but an account

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.800
structure for all
of their customers.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.540
And let's say that you're buying
Bitcoin, and Kelly is selling.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.540
Maybe I could do that
transaction between you

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.600
and Kelly right on--

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.450
this is going to be called
the Gensler Exchange--

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.490
right on the Gensler Exchange.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:21.630
So I don't need to move that
to the blockchain, because--

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.040
oh, one really important thing.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.880
What happens when
you open an account?

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.380
I'm sorry.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.005
It's a good question,
and now I realize

00:41:27.005 --> 00:41:28.350
I skipped over something.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:31.800
What happens when you open an
account at a crypto exchange?

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.300
Alin.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.826
AUDIENCE: KYC and AML.

00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:36.600
GARY GENSLER: You
might do KYC and AML,

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.430
but that's not what
we're looking for.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.657
AUDIENCE: Would you
be issued a key pair?

00:41:40.657 --> 00:41:41.740
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.448
AUDIENCE: Would you
be issude a key pair?

00:41:43.448 --> 00:41:44.861
GARY GENSLER: What you--

00:41:44.861 --> 00:41:47.300
you might be, but
actually what I'm looking

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.860
for is what happens to your--

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:54.470
I have Bitcoin, and I open an
account, or I have US dollars

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.790
and I open an account.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.250
I sign a user
agreement with them

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:03.090
that they're going to store
any of my crypto in their name.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.390
Coinbase, Kraken,
Huobi-- they are not

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.940
storing it in Alpha's name.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.440
I don't know if you
have an account,

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.020
but I'm just using you.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.750
If Alpha has an account,
he signs a user agreement.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:22.320
He says, when I buy
Bitcoin, it's in a--

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.992
at best, it's on this Excel--

00:42:23.992 --> 00:42:26.200
well, it's probably better
than an Excel spreadsheet,

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.560
but it's in their
database in Alpha's name.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.490
But on the Bitcoin
blockchain, it's

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:38.500
in a bunch of Bitcoin addresses
that Coinbase controls

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.445
or Kraken controls.

00:42:39.445 --> 00:42:42.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:56.170
GARY GENSLER: It has a name
tag on a separate ledger.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:59.710
You have some legal rights
against Kraken or Gemini.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.180
I mean, you do.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:01.680
I mean--

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.888
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but after,
I mean, is it centralized?

00:43:03.888 --> 00:43:04.940
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.920
That's correct.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.300
And so because both
of you, Kelly and you,

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.460
have signed some
agreement, they're

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:16.390
moving Bitcoin to Kelly
and Bitcoin to you--

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:19.280
or if you put US dollars in
and you're buying Bitcoin.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.200
But it's because the market, the
customers want it that way too.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:36.240
So decentralized exchanges--
again, based on CryptoCompare,

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.670
these are the top five
in October by volume.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.340
But these are not the
five you read about most.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.860
The article that you
read talked about others.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.810
So I don't have a deep
confidence in these,

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.120
but these are the numbers
that CryptoCompare

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.440
could pull together.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.200
And you can see, they're
much smaller numbers.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.870
In aggregate, in
the crypto database,

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:01.182
it's only 0.4% of the volume.

00:44:01.182 --> 00:44:03.637
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Robinhood, it

00:44:03.637 --> 00:44:06.820
said that they waived the fees.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.280
In terms of competition, I
didn't understand the business

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.200
model--

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.492
how they're making revenue.

00:44:11.492 --> 00:44:13.450
GARY GENSLER: So how many
of you have Robinhood

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.270
app on your phones?

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.480
Yeah, about 10 of you.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.797
Do you pay any fees for
securities transactions?

00:44:20.797 --> 00:44:21.630
Remind me your name.

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:22.160
AUDIENCE: Erin.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:22.952
GARY GENSLER: Erin.

00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:23.880
No.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.020
Anybody pay any
fees to Robinhood?

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:26.970
No.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.555
Isn't that kind of neat?

00:44:28.555 --> 00:44:29.455
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:44:29.455 --> 00:44:30.580
GARY GENSLER: Whoa, you do.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.480
You pay some fees?

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.412
AUDIENCE: They sell your float.

00:44:33.412 --> 00:44:34.861
They sell your flow.

00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:36.310
They sell your data.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:37.752
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:37.752 --> 00:44:39.210
GARY GENSLER: OK,
and your name is?

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:39.960
AUDIENCE: Isaac.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.085
GARY GENSLER: Isaac, right.

00:44:41.085 --> 00:44:41.970
So Isaac's got it.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.720
They sell your data,
and they sell your flow.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.262
What was the third
thing you said?

00:44:47.262 --> 00:44:48.470
AUDIENCE: Float.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:51.633
I don't know exactly how their
custody of brokerage works,

00:44:51.633 --> 00:44:53.633
but I know that there's
an advantage to actually

00:44:53.633 --> 00:44:57.420
having the securities at
their brokerage [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.340
GARY GENSLER: OK, all right.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.040
So three things--
your data, your flow,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.220
and what Isaac called float,
but I would call that they have

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.620
the securities system to lend--

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.560
stock borrow or stock lend.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.390
And those are the three ways.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:13.890
How does Facebook make money?

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:15.930
They have your data.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:21.090
So we live in a time where
platforms sell your data

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.255
and use your data to
sell advertisement.

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:26.130
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say, with Robinhood,

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:30.240
you can also pay a premium
that's tiered to be [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.175
margin.

00:45:31.175 --> 00:45:33.450
So instead of paying
interest in the margin,

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.568
you play a flat fee.

00:45:34.568 --> 00:45:36.360
And then they also
advance your settlements

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.568
instead of taking three days.

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:38.820
They'll do it immediately.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:39.820
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.760
So there's a premium
service where you maybe

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.990
could get further.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.070
They sell your flow.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:48.850
What that means is there are
parties that will pay brokerage

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:53.530
houses payment for order flow.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.310
Vanguard does it as well.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.380
It's not-- Fidelity
probably does.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.540
I'm not certain.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:04.980
But many big brokerage firms,
when we all work with them--

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.070
and my account at Vanguard,
I have zero commissions,

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.500
but I know they're
selling my order flow.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.190
AUDIENCE: But who would
be interested in the data?

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:15.440
GARY GENSLER: So who would
be interested in the data--

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.195
or who is interested
in the flow?

00:46:17.195 --> 00:46:18.915
AUDIENCE: So Facebook,
I understand,

00:46:18.915 --> 00:46:22.235
would be marketing companies,
so they were targeting,

00:46:22.235 --> 00:46:27.350
but in this case, is it
federal agencies or--

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:28.500
GARY GENSLER: OK, no.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.420
Who is interested in the
data or the actual order

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:37.310
flow of financial transactions?

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:37.810
Tom?

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.610
AUDIENCE: Hedge funds,
trading entities.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:41.590
GARY GENSLER: Hedge funds.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.000
What type of trading entities?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.380
AUDIENCE:
High-frequency traders.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.120
GARY GENSLER:
High-frequency traders.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:54.190
So I believe that Robinhood
side contracts with initially,

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:59.600
I think, three and then five
high-frequency trading shops.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.655
And I've been told a
number of those names.

00:47:01.655 --> 00:47:04.280
I don't know if they're public,
so I'm not going to repeat them

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.640
on the camera, but big--

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.390
a couple of them--

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:11.540
US-based, high-frequency
trading shops.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.220
Why would a high-frequency
trading shop pay for it?

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:14.720
Daniel?

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.512
AUDIENCE: Go ahead.

00:47:15.512 --> 00:47:17.130
I had a question.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:19.130
GARY GENSLER: Why would
a high-frequency trading

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:20.490
shop pay for it?

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:26.760
GARY GENSLER: So they
think there's some value.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.260
Isaac?

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.330
AUDIENCE: Or you can front run.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:30.590
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, you
can-- right, right, right.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.840
So anybody who's read, you
know, some of the books

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.280
on high-frequency trading--

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.560
you can front run, but
there's also value--

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.630
to answer Rahim's
question-- there's

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.940
value in the order
flow, because if you

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.830
can see that the
market's leaning

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:47.880
just a little bit this way
even for a few seconds,

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.380
you can optimize your algorithms
and make money off of that.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.340
And the US equity markets--

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.760
well over 60% of the US equity
markets are trading with

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.160
high-frequency
trading right now--

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.780
any daily volume.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:08.010
In the commodity markets
when I was at the CFDC,

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:12.810
some contracts we thought
it could be as much as 90%.

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:19.150
The S&P 500 Futures contract
or the interest rates contracts

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:20.470
vary significantly.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.210
And they provide a service.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.860
There's a market-making function
those high-frequency traders

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.510
do, and mostly,
they do it legally.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:32.440
But there's a value
to that order flow.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.130
And so payment for order
flow is a very critical part

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:39.130
of financial markets all
the way around the globe

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:42.700
in any highly-liquid currency
market, bond markets, equity

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.690
markets, and, yes, Bitcoin.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:48.842
So Robinhood-- Erin, do
you trade Bitcoin on there

00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:50.500
or do you trade regular equity?

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.838
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I actually
don't use it that much,

00:48:51.838 --> 00:48:52.730
but it's on my phone.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.563
GARY GENSLER: It's on
your phone, all right.

00:48:54.563 --> 00:48:57.450
But the one or two times you
used it, you had zero fee,

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:01.410
because some trading
house in Chicago

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:08.450
has a contract with
Robinhood to do that.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.510
And Jeff Sprecher, who
you'll meet Thursday,

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.200
will tell you Robinhood,
with five million accounts

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:21.540
now, that's a real threat
to the brokerage model.

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:25.140
Why would people mostly of your
generation-- or Millennials,

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.070
because you're not--

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.620
some of you're Gen
Xers, I think, but--

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.450
I'm a Baby Boomer.

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:32.640
I know where I am.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.020
But Millennials, you get
so many services for free.

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.110
Robinhood saw an
opportunity, and they've

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:42.050
all of a sudden got
five million customers.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:46.790
But that's how they--
it's a very good question.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:50.240
And so moving a little
along just to give you--

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.450
So these are the main things
from this CryptoCompare

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:57.290
just in October to
give you a sense.

00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:00.200
Two thirds of the volume they
measure, spot in one third

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:00.940
is derivatives.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.440
And we're not talking about the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.160
$$$

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.920
The biggest derivatives
exchange actually in crypto

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:12.000
is BitMax that has
a perpetual Bitcoin

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.630
swap and a perpetual Eth
that has no settlement date.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:24.290
Highly-leveraged-- you can put
1% margin down and 99% borrow.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:28.320
And every 10 hours,
it reprices, but it's

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.843
a perpetual rolling
10-hour future.

00:50:31.843 --> 00:50:33.510
And that's why it's
called a perpetual--

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.640
Ross, I saw you look quizzical.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.580
It's made perpetual, because
it's rolling 10-hour pricing

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.740
settlements.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.480
But you don't
settle at 10 hours.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.760
You have to either
post more margin

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.263
or receive profit
every 10 hours.

00:50:47.263 --> 00:50:48.930
AUDIENCE: Why isn't
it a 10-hour future?

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:49.380
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.390
AUDIENCE: Why isn't it
just a 10-hour future?

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.807
GARY GENSLER: Because at 10-hour
future might not have you

00:50:53.807 --> 00:50:58.670
or may continue in the contract,
so they created a perpetual

00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.330
rolling--

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:02.360
AUDIENCE: If I don't post,
I'm out 10 hours later.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.346
GARY GENSLER: That's correct.

00:51:04.346 --> 00:51:06.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:12.230
GARY GENSLER: BitMax is
the largest in this volume.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.810
They say they don't operate in
the US, because if they did,

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:16.910
it would definitely have
to register its commodity

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.313
futures trading commission.

00:51:18.313 --> 00:51:19.730
But whether they
operate in the US

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.240
or not is probably for some
other people to figure out.

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.530
Crypto to crypto
versus Fiat to crypto--

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:32.783
70% of the volume is on
crypto to crypto exchanges.

00:51:32.783 --> 00:51:34.200
Again, we don't
know if the volume

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.310
figures are accurate, but
just based on these figures.

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:43.750
So the ecosystem is still
2/3 crypto to crypto

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.760
rather than switching
out to some other--

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:51.160
Decentralized-- we
already talk about this.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.210
Really important innovation.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.690
I think we're going to see
more about decentralized,

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:59.200
but right now we're
still at the early days.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.400
Bitcoin versus Fiat-- this
is just the month of October,

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:10.390
but 50% was versus US
dollar, 21% yen, Korea--

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:11.620
who's from Korea here?

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.550
Anybody, do we have anybody?

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:16.650
So tell us a little
bit about that figure.

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:19.520
Why 16% Korea?

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.180
Your views.

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.006
I know there's no
readings on it.

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:25.625
AUDIENCE: I am not
actually sure why.

00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:29.330
But there were a lot
of articles about how

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.870
there are some people who just
put all the money that they

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:38.160
have invested over your lifetime
to cryptocurrency [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:43.280
They didn't have any future
like making money by working.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.400
I don't know like [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.060
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.236
PROFESSOR: Any other views?

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:52.560
Are you--

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.940
AUDIENCE: I think
psychologically

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.462
a lot of the speculators thought
that this was a very even thing

00:52:57.462 --> 00:53:00.860
to just sort of speculating
on the stock market,

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.580
where you needed to have some
fundamental technical skill

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.770
sets.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:06.430
Whereas, this is
just a very pure--

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.120
PROFESSOR: Pure.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.855
AUDIENCE: --even keel.

00:53:08.855 --> 00:53:11.880
Not here, but, you know,
just that you didn't require

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.100
any specific skill sets.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.118
PROFESSOR: That's
just pure, up or down.

00:53:17.118 --> 00:53:18.870
AUDIENCE: Getting
around capital controls.

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:22.060
PROFESSOR: Getting around
curious to us capital controls?

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:22.560
Yeah.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.863
There's a kimchi premium
even that Bitcoin

00:53:24.863 --> 00:53:26.030
sells for a little bit more.

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:28.310
And that's what it's called.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.240
I didn't make that term up.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.670
There's a little
bit of a premium.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.110
And there's some
academic studies

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:37.010
on how that widens and narrows
sometimes depending upon what

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.510
the government's doing.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:40.310
It's measured in
single digit percent.

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:43.550
But you might pay
3% or 4% premium.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:45.350
Sometimes it's 1.5% premium.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:49.310
But there's a premium
on the Korean exchanges.

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:53.990
But three years ago, what cross
do you think was the largest,

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:56.330
over 50% just three years ago?

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.410
It's not even on
that chart right now.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:58.972
Tom?

00:53:58.972 --> 00:53:59.680
AUDIENCE: Rem NB.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.490
PROFESSOR: Rem NB.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:05.605
In 2015 and 2016, over half
the market was Rem NB Bitcoin.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.760
Kind of got the attention
from the Chinese central bank.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.180
By 2017, that all changed.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:20.010
And the US dollar thing then
kind of took that space.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.540
And a lot of folks
that gets really

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:28.500
US dollar to tether to
Bitcoin or other ways.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.490
This fluctuates.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.210
These numbers aren't stable.

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:33.390
There's some months that
yen is the biggest number.

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:42.520
We talked about the country's
wonderful financial centers.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.470
And then KYC, an
interesting statistic.

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:50.470
Now, this is about 140
exchanges that Crypto Compare

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:52.310
has in their database.

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:55.360
And they say only
half of them, 47%,

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.150
observe strict
know your customer.

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:02.004
1/4 partial and 28%
absolutely none, zero.

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.500
No.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.920
That's just sort of the
state of play of crypto.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.490
I hope none of those 28%
are operating in the US.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.960
But they might be.

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.150
So what are the
policy challenges?

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.810
One is the markets are
readily susceptible to fraud

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:24.550
and manipulation.

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:26.440
Any market-- it's human nature.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.500
I don't think we're going to
take the human out of human.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.200
It's going to look for
angles, look for ways to make

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.470
opportunities, even
the best meaning folks.

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:39.760
If you hold the assets in
custody and you might make

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.630
the markets, because you're
not settling to the blockchain,

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.450
even for short whiles
, this market model,

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:50.710
this business model is
to make markets maybe.

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:52.540
There's inherent
conflicts of interest.

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.930
There's conflicts of interest
in pretty much all of finance.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:57.280
But then we try to manage.

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.080
We either manage
conflicts of interest

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.530
by certain rules about
transparency or certain

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:05.240
prohibitions about,
in the custody world,

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.480
banks hold custody as well.

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.630
But we prohibit them
from using your assets

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:12.910
unless you permission
them to use your assets,

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:14.630
and things like that.

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:17.140
So what we try to
use usually is build

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:22.330
some system of transparency and
affirmative responsibilities

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:25.870
or prohibitive actions, those
three buckets, transparency,

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:27.940
some affirmative
responsibilities,

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:31.570
and prohibited actions
around conflicts.

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:34.150
But this space has the
conflicts without much

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.640
of those three
things, transparency,

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:41.050
either obligations or
prohibitive actions.

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.460
So inevitably, I think
it's human nature.

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.100
You're going to have some
kind of games going on.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:52.300
The custodial arrangements we
talked about, big challenge.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.530
We're going to see a
little bit more about that.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:58.380
Complying with anti-money
laundering, KYC,

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.750
and implementing tax reporting.

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:05.120
In the US, at least,
in the US, brokers

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.810
have to report to the
government when you buy and sell

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:10.510
something.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:13.030
This was not true
30 and 50 years ago.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.850
But we've come to
a place where I

00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:20.050
think it was in the last 15
to 20 years, laws changed.

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:22.010
Ross, maybe you know
on your legal work.

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:25.240
But laws change where brokerage
houses have to report.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:29.240
And those reports go into the US
government and other countries.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.730
So the brokers say James
sold this many shares of this

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:35.430
and had a basis of that.

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:38.350
And there's more tax compliance.

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:39.410
Here, there's no broker.

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:43.720
So it's hard to
attach something.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:48.880
And some of the exchanges
are rather slow when

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.200
the IRS comes knocking.

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:55.510
Coinbase and the IRS
had a little kerfluffle,

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:59.560
I'd call it, when the IRS
asked for data on their then 13

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.640
million customers.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.530
And they settled,
because the IRS

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:04.135
was bringing an
action against them

00:58:04.135 --> 00:58:06.010
when they wouldn't give
them any information.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.427
And they settled and gave them
information on their 10,000

00:58:08.427 --> 00:58:12.730
or 20,000 most active accounts.

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:15.460
But for a while, right
now, the coin basis

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:20.200
can act like they're
Swiss bank accounts.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.440
Is anybody from Switzerland?

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.060
All right, then I can say it.

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:26.150
But, you know, for decades--

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.650
wait.

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:28.430
Who?

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:30.287
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
But I lived there.

00:58:30.287 --> 00:58:31.370
PROFESSOR: You live there?

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:33.800
Well, what did for
decades, maybe centuries,

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.930
Swiss bank accounts
been known for?

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:36.680
AUDIENCE: Secrecy.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.700
PROFESSOR: Secrecy.

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:38.270
Secrecy.

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:41.930
That was their-- they had a lot
of other good things going on.

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:46.670
But that was one of their
marketing points, secrecy.

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:47.880
It's a little harder now.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:52.340
But it's still relative to a
German bank or a French bank,

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:55.810
probably a little bit
more secret, right?

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:57.040
AUDIENCE: Yes, it's less.

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.730
A lot because of US
pressure [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:00.630
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:01.320
Right.

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.290
AUDIENCE: Still more secret than
some of European [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:05.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.670
But crypto exchanges are
still thinking, oh, well,

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:11.560
how can we give up secrecy?

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.770
Because competitively, other
exchanges aren't doing it.

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:19.210
So I think Coinbase was
trying to be good citizens,

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:23.950
but also not give everything
to the IRS the IRS wanted.

00:59:26.227 --> 00:59:28.060
There's a big question
of what's a security?

00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:28.870
What's a commodity?

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:30.730
What's a derivative?

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:34.630
And in every legal
jurisdiction around the globe,

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:37.600
securities exchanges are
regulated pretty much

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.050
in every jurisdiction.

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:42.590
So what is a security
and what's not a security

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:47.120
does relate to what's currently
regulated under current law.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.830
I've testified in
the US Congress.

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:52.970
And I'd say regardless of that,
if it's even just a commodity,

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:56.360
like Bitcoin under US law
is considered a commodity,

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.180
you probably want these
exchanges regulated.

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.060
And if it's a derivative,
in most jurisdictions,

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.990
it also is regulated.

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:06.020
So the first and the
third in that list,

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:09.620
securities and derivatives,
exchanges are regulated.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:15.080
In most jurisdictions, commodity
exchanges are not, but not all.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:20.670
So the definitional thing
also relates to what comes in.

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:23.630
So in the US, there are
a number of exchanges

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.993
that will, I would predict
in the next 18 months,

01:00:25.993 --> 01:00:28.160
register with the Securities
and Exchange Commission

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.890
as broker-dealers under
regulation alternative trading

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.460
system Reg ATS.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:38.200
But I think that they will only
do it if they're category one.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.020
They have a bunch of
initial coin tokens

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:45.370
that are so clearly
securities, they register.

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:49.420
But what if you're only
trading Bitcoin, only trading

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.270
Bitcoin and Eth and so forth?

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:56.200
Those might say, I don't want
to have all those added costs.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.950
So question for Thursday is,
why did the Intercontinental

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:02.800
Exchange create
a one day future,

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.090
which appears to be like it was
like walking into and saying,

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:09.550
I want a regulated exchange?

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:12.430
As a business
proposition, that's

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.352
what it feels like to me.

01:01:14.352 --> 01:01:19.050
That that was part
of that decision set.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.835
But you can ask on Thursday.

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:26.873
Tracking beneficial ownership.

01:01:26.873 --> 01:01:29.040
We've tracked beneficial
ownership in the securities

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.450
markets for a long time,
from the first joint stock

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:34.680
companies.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.110
Because you track
beneficial ownership

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.550
to ensure that somebody
gets their dividends.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:42.420
And if they're voting once a
year on the board of directors

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.770
and things like that.

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.620
But somewhere in the
last 30 or 40 years,

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.230
law enforcement agencies
said that's a good way

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:51.810
to track against money
laundering and track

01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:53.700
against other things.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.694
So layered on top
of securities laws,

01:01:57.694 --> 01:01:59.740
law enforcement agencies
around the globe

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.330
said, we want to
know who owns what.

01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:06.060
For the prior 50
to 100 years, it

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.520
was just securities law
that cared about tracking

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.615
beneficial ownership.

01:02:10.615 --> 01:02:12.240
But there's some
international treaty--

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.615
I can't remember
the name of it--

01:02:13.615 --> 01:02:15.540
that says all securities
regulators have

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.120
to do something
extra and make sure

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.100
that there's transfer agents.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.440
And there's this whole
regime of keeping

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.010
ledgers of who owns what.

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:28.470
In addition to this
anti-money laundering stuff,

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:34.070
securities laws have this
embedded in most jurisdictions,

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.980
This is a tough
one for this space,

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:41.440
not only because it comes
from a libertarian basis.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.500
But it's also a tough
one just technologically,

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.690
just the technical solutions.

01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:49.330
The crypto exchanges,
half of them

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:53.980
have what Crypto Compare says
is strict anti-money laundering.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:57.370
But 1/4 don't have any,
which means they're not

01:02:57.370 --> 01:03:00.590
tracking beneficial ownership.

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:05.120
I think that will
slowly get ramped up.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.940
But if you see a lot of
registered exchanges leaving

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.310
one country for another,
they're probably

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:16.440
going to a place that
has lower regulation.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:23.270
Oh, and how do you remediate
a noncompliant exchange?

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:25.190
There's a bunch of
exchanges here in the US

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:27.080
that will register.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.580
Securities and
Exchange Commission

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.665
can do, look, we're
not going to fine you.

01:03:32.665 --> 01:03:34.790
We're not going to give
you penalties for the past.

01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:36.410
Can you just come
into compliance

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:38.690
in the next 12 to 18 months?

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.570
That's probably what's
going to happen.

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:43.520
But like the Ether
Delta situation

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.610
just last week, they
come to some settlement.

01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:49.460
They say, you've been violating
the law for the last X

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.180
number of months.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.935
But how do you come
into compliance?

01:03:52.935 --> 01:03:54.560
And so that will be
an interesting sort

01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:00.710
of what level of regulatory
forbearance will there be?

01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:02.480
I think that at
some point in time,

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.550
there will be fines
and penalties.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:09.840
But I think in the US context,
they'll bring a half a dozen,

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.110
or eight, or 10 into regulation.

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:18.090
And then they'll bring
down a heavier footprint,

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:22.710
bring down the hammer, if
you wish, in 2019 or 2020.

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:24.810
I don't think that's
going to be in 2018.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:25.665
Kelly?

01:04:25.665 --> 01:04:28.387
AUDIENCE: So maybe this is
a question for Thursday,

01:04:28.387 --> 01:04:33.090
but what is the thought on
the side of the exchanges?

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:36.555
Do you think that there
will be a huge cost to them

01:04:36.555 --> 01:04:38.040
to come into compliance?

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.010
Or do they think that
they're going to lose members

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:44.600
or maybe even it would increase
because it's [INAUDIBLE]??

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.730
PROFESSOR: So a
very good question.

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:52.230
What does being compliant with
some broad public policy norms

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.730
do?

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.370
And I think there's probably
different business models.

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:57.350
If you're an incumbent,
like NASDAQ--

01:04:57.350 --> 01:04:59.080
and there was a
brief article when

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.920
Adena Friedman who
runs NASDAQ said

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.550
she wanted to be in this space.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:04.970
If you're NASDAQ, if
you're CME, if you're

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:08.660
Deutsche Borse in
Germany, if you're ICE,

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.880
you really already know
how to be compliant.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.340
It's probably advantageous
to be registered

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:19.130
and for all those
startups to be registered.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.470
In some ways, it creates
a barrier to entry.

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:23.270
But you want to do it.

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:26.340
If you're a startup, you
could go one of two paths.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:30.350
So Gemini here in the US and
Coinbase, at least publicly,

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:32.097
are saying we want
to be compliant.

01:05:32.097 --> 01:05:32.930
How do we get there?

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:34.550
Coinbase may be,
because now they're

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:37.190
almost like an incumbent.

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:42.770
And so they might want to keep
the next round of startups out.

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:45.320
But I think around
the globe, there's

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.540
no doubt that it
would raise costs.

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:51.860
The question is whether it would
either secure your market share

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.660
or flush out some competitors.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.520
I would contend that
it would increase

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.740
the overall size of the market.

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.260
Because more people
would be interested.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.080
But some fear that it
would shrink the market.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:09.070
Because if you had known
beneficial ownership,

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.660
if you tracked
beneficial ownership

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:16.000
for 100% of this market, some
worry the market would shrink.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.290
That's from a
commercial concept.

01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:21.470
Meaning, if you're tracking
beneficial ownership.

01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:22.220
Question Riham?

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:25.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the whole
essence of Bitcoin, all of this

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:32.270
is deregulation, being away from
the government, and transaction

01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:34.310
between individuals
without having

01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:36.920
regulations, this
more libertarian

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.362
view of exchanges [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:41.362 --> 01:06:43.070
PROFESSOR: So the
nature of your question

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:48.230
is, isn't Bitcoin and crypto
about some off the rails,

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:51.800
libertarian, pro
libertarian, peer to peer?

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.150
I think it's genesis.

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:54.610
Eric, you want to answer?

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.456
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
there's common theme

01:06:56.456 --> 01:06:59.220
in the reading
about Coinbase where

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.660
[INAUDIBLE] the fact
that more and more people

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:04.610
with that libertarian
point of view

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:07.550
are constantly reminded
[INAUDIBLE] that it's

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:09.860
kind of betraying that ideal.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.750
But you don't have
to believe me.

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:17.220
I mean, he's trying to make
a business out of this.

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.650
So being compliant
with that is actually

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:22.070
trying to broaden
the base of customers

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:26.640
and make the business more
profitable and growth.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:31.170
PROFESSOR: I think that to
go from a $200 billion market

01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:33.480
to $2 trillion or
$10 trillion, it's

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.330
got to come inside the
public policy envelope.

01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:41.810
I just don't see particularly,
lowering the risk

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:44.270
of manipulation and fraud.

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:48.320
Then you're going to have a
broader societal acceptance.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.900
And investor protection matters.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.950
But there are others on
the other side of that.

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.040
These are on the numbers.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.207
I'm not going to stay on it.

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:59.630
But this is just
to say one thing

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:03.170
Crypto Compare does is
average daily visitors

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:04.870
versus their volume.

01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:07.880
Coinbase's average
daily visitors

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.400
is you can see that
a highest read chart

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.990
compared to their volume.

01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:14.920
They probably have
legitimate use.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:19.890
The two, ZB and EXX,
almost have no visitors.

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:22.840
And they report a lot of volume.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.325
So it's just an interesting
statistic to sort of say--

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:30.930
and it might well be that
Binance's volume statistics

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:32.420
are accurate.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.340
They're just a crypto
to crypto exchange.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.996
But they also, their ratio
of visitors to volume

01:08:37.996 --> 01:08:39.329
is very different than Coinbase.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:46.370
Just to give you a little flavor
for the craziness out there.

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:47.359
Investor protection.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:50.399
I sort of said investor
protection is critical.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.910
We're going to talk about
this in a week or so

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:54.420
about initial coin offerings.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.710
But it's further than
consumer protection.

01:08:57.710 --> 01:09:00.560
And importantly,
because we address.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.130
We know.

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.742
We are honest.

01:09:01.742 --> 01:09:02.700
We're earnest about it.

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.575
We say, yes, there are
conflicts of interest.

01:09:04.575 --> 01:09:06.290
How can we address
conflicts of interest?

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:08.160
You don't ban
conflicts of interest.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.180
But you sort of say, is
there ways to manage it?

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.189
How do we promote
market integrity

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:16.970
through transparency and
rules of anti-manipulation?

01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:20.740
So it's kind of those, you
know, the realities of humanity.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.930
And we say, well, how can we
sort of put some traffic lights

01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:29.460
and speed limits in the system
to give people confidence

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.720
that drive the roads?

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.155
And by the way, Rahim,
I can't tell you,

01:09:33.155 --> 01:09:35.530
because I wasn't there around
the debates in the nineteen

01:09:35.530 --> 01:09:37.145
teens and the 1920s.

01:09:37.145 --> 01:09:38.520
But you can be
assured there were

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:44.990
debates in whether to put
the first traffic light out.

01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:46.700
Literally, you know?

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.040
Whether to put the
first crosswalks.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.350
And do traffic
lights and crosswalks

01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:54.260
restrict the use of automobiles?

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.590
Absolutely.

01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:58.240
Absolutely.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.990
But think about this.

01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:03.430
Did they promote the
sales of automobiles?

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.290
And I would contend
they also promoted

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.300
the sales of automobiles.

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:10.780
That simple regulatory
intervention

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.020
meant that people could
feel a little bit more safe

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.490
having their neighbors drive.

01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:17.350
Because most people
didn't drive.

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:19.530
But having their
neighbors come down

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:23.560
pass there walking on the
street, the pedestrians.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.610
Pedestrians felt safer.

01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:28.650
So I think it's a bit of both.

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:32.310
All right, I might be
disclosing my point of view.

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:35.460
I think investor protection
bolsters investor confidence

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.600
in capital markets.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.890
And that everybody benefits.

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:40.590
But you've got to get
the balance right.

01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:42.510
And I'd respect if
half of you say,

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:45.180
no, it should be less
regulation, and have said more.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:47.580
I'm disclosing more
where I am and at least

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.240
the logic behind it.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.195
You know what the Howey Test is.

01:10:53.195 --> 01:10:54.570
We'll come back
to this in a week

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:57.780
when we do initial
coin offerings.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.700
In the center of
crypto exchanges,

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.330
it's an important issue as to
which crypto exchanges have

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:05.190
an ICO token.

01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:09.990
Then they've got to kind
of do a little bit more.

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.640
Hacks.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.920
These are the biggest
hacks I could find.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.180
These are reported hacks.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.370
Who knows what's
not been reported?

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:21.750
Coincheck and Mount Gox
each about a half a billion.

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:26.750
A couple of 50 to 100, 200.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:30.130
And here's a bunch of
tiny ones that I've put.

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:31.480
I mean, they'll be on Canvas.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.240
But there's a
bunch of basically,

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.590
steal somebody else's coins,
because they're [INAUDIBLE]..

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:42.230
Earlier question, cold storage.

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:46.510
This again, thanks to the
friends at Crypto Compare.

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:49.130
Isabella, that was your
question earlier, right?

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:52.430
So I can't really tell
you why BitFlyer only

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:56.760
has 80% in cold storage.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:01.080
And some of these others,
like Bit for Nexus 96% or 97%.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.450
But I think that if you have
a high volume and high flow,

01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:07.980
you could maybe keep
more in cold storage.

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:11.340
Or if your model is more about
custody than transactions,

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.960
you could have more
in cold storage.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.370
You do need something, you
know, probably connected

01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:21.390
to give your customer
base liquidity.

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:23.520
And somewhat depends
how long it takes

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.740
you to move something from
cold storage to hot storage.

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.372
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:29.372 --> 01:12:30.330
PROFESSOR: What's that?

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:33.450
AUDIENCE: At least they used
their own capital [INAUDIBLE]??

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:35.020
PROFESSOR: So they self-insure.

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.640
And Gemini announced
that they just

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.760
signed a contract with Aion
one of the world's largest

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:44.830
insurance companies, to
insure against loss of that

01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:46.990
which they're having custody.

01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:49.390
But don't confuse it
for 100% insurance.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:52.930
The insurance companies
are charging significantly,

01:12:52.930 --> 01:12:56.260
somewhere around 1.5% a quarter.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.250
So there's some
crypto exchanges,

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:01.320
which will allow you to
pay for the insurance.

01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:07.340
And Gemini says they've
signed a contract with Aion.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.840
And I can't quite tell whether
that's just because Gemini is

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.550
going to pay for the insurance.

01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:13.710
Or they're going
to allow you to pay

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:19.167
for the insurance in
that custody solution.

01:13:19.167 --> 01:13:20.000
Let's see what else.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.080
Oh, we're almost wrapping.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.400
So here's what I think.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.040
Custody, I think
the custody duties

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.500
either have to be
fixed or spun off.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.510
I think from a public
policy perspective,

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:32.310
they're better spun off.

01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:35.640
And that's because there's
such an inherent conflict.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.590
I think if you're
holding somebody's funds

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:41.790
and also transacting, it's just
too sweet a honeypot not just

01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:44.940
to be stolen, but for
the operator to say,

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:48.390
I want to use it in my own--

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:52.140
lend it, borrow it,
transact around it.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.880
But that's my thought.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:59.100
Fix it or spin it off
would be the custody.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:02.910
Illicit activity, I think we're
going to have to get to a place

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:07.950
where if not 100%, close to
100% are actually complying.

01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:11.610
And if 1/4 of them aren't
even doing AML and KYC,

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:14.820
there's still a lot of--
there's some road ahead here.

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:20.310
I know it might not fit, Rahim,
with the libertarian soul

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:22.560
of the genesis of all this.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.750
I won't say you
maybe personally.

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:30.900
I think that's going to
be the path for our--

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.490
if we're still two
and three years

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:35.730
from now 1/4 of the
market not doing it.

01:14:35.730 --> 01:14:37.470
I think that the
market integrity

01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:38.820
piece is the toughest one.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.160
And it's maybe where
my own personal views

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.480
shouldn't cloud my judgment.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.360
My own personal views is
we need market integrity,

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.290
anti-manipulation, no front
running, things like that.

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:50.930
But realistically,
it's probably going

01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:52.890
to be done by
individual exchanges

01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:55.470
or self-regulatory
organizations.

01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:57.240
Gemini and others
in the UK, there's

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.610
some self-regulatory
organizations.

01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:02.260
I don't think that's sufficient.

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.298
It's a step really in
the right direction.

01:15:04.298 --> 01:15:06.090
But I think somewhere,
if this gets bigger,

01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:09.690
it needs to be the official
sector putting some traffic

01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:14.490
lights and stop signs in.

01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:16.740
Registration and remediation.

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.840
First, to determine whether
you have to register

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.220
and then comply.

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.460
And that's a multiple
month or year period.

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:26.670
In Japan, they started
registering in late 2017.

01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:28.890
They started with
16 and another 16.

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:31.610
Some had to shut down in Japan.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:33.710
South Korea is registering.

01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:35.550
Now, some of those
registration regimes

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:39.530
are really just about
custody and Bank Secrecy Act.

01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:42.020
They're not going as far
as I would like to go,

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:44.240
which is into market integrity.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.760
But I think you're going to
see a bunch more jurisdictions,

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:51.860
registration, remediation,
some closing, and the like.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.640
Margin and fee compression,
I think that's inevitable,

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.400
whether it comes from the Robin
Hoods or the Intercontinental

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.650
Exchange.

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:03.540
But the juice is
so much right now.

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:06.620
I mean, some of these
are charging 1% to 3%.

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.730
You all transact.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.260
You know your fee
structures better.

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.910
But I think there'll be
margin and fee compression.

01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:14.810
And I think there'll
be some consolidation.

01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:19.580
There's not enough room
here for 200 plus exchanges.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.860
So those are my predictions.

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.470
And I think the
decentralized exchanges,

01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:26.910
once they have
enhanced customer UI,

01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:28.220
there will be more adoption.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:33.890
But right now, not that easy
to use for most regular people,

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:36.605
the non-computer scientists.

01:16:36.605 --> 01:16:38.480
Two questions and then
we might have to wrap.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.135
AUDIENCE: Is there
any indication

01:16:40.135 --> 01:16:42.188
that crypto exchanges
are profitable?

01:16:42.188 --> 01:16:43.980
PROFESSOR: Crypto
exchanges, profitability,

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.200
they're enormously profitable.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:52.570
Coinbase did a venture round
at an $8 billion valuation.

01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:55.410
One crypto exchange just
sold itself for $400 million.

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:58.560
And Coincheck that
lost the half a billion

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:03.000
of Nam, the 27-year-old
who ran that in Japan

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.765
did not declare bankruptcy.

01:17:04.765 --> 01:17:06.390
Because he had already
made over a half

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:08.730
a billion dollars in
the previous 12 months.

01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:11.960
They are enormously profitable.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.770
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: In
some ways, today's class,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.150
it's the most challenging
of the semester.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
These are really complicated,
difficult threshold issues.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.970
And we're just starting to
see the powerful ramifications

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.760
of having gotten a number of
things wrong in this space

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.070
and what it does.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.890
So I try to put
the manufacturing

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.390
stuff in early so you'd see
that there are real issues here,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.380
not just kind of abstract
science policy questions,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.770
but real issues that
have big implications.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.480
So let me start with Samuelson.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.820
And you're all probably
familiar with him,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.230
but probably among a handful
of the most famous economists

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.530
of the 20th century--

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.960
one of MIT'S great
stars, an amazing figure,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.800
lived well into his 90s.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.450
I heard him talk just a few
years ago, before he died.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.400
And he was incredibly sharp
and funny and astute--

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.020
just a phenomenal figure.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710
And he really rethought--

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.900
really was a
foundational creator

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.090
of neoclassical
economics-- the attempt

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.250
to bring discipline metrics
to economic thinking.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.170
So then he writes
this surprising piece

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.340
in 2004, which takes on
mainstream economics.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.780
Now, he had actually done
writing on this topic,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.400
coming to somewhat
similar conclusions

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.560
much, much earlier
in his career.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.590
But he comes back
to it in this piece.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.310
And it took everybody
aback, right.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.110
Mainstream economics
had thought this was

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.500
a completely settled territory.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.750
Mainstream economists
like Greenspan,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.890
Jagdish Bhagwati, Gregory
Mankiw, they were arguing--

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.870
and this is a
quote from Mankiw--

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.720
"Yes, good jobs may be
lost in the short run,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.260
but still total US net
national product must,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.480
by economic laws of
comparative advantage,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.670
be raised in the long run--

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.990
and in China, too.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.980
Never forget the real gains of
consumers alongside admitted

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.940
possible losses of some
producers in this working out

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.920
of what Schumpeter called
'creative capitalist

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.060
destruction.'

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.390
Correct economic law recognizes
that some American groups can

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.610
be hurt by dynamic free trade.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.100
But correct economic
law vindicates the word

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.680
'creative' destruction
by its proof

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.870
that the gains of
the American winners

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.010
are big enough to more than
compensate for the losers."

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.120
And then Samuelson concludes,
"The last paragraph can only

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.240
be in innuendo, for
it is dead wrong

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.990
about the necessary supply
of winnings over losings."

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.260
So here is the guy who created
mainstream economics taking

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.640
on the whole economic mainstream
assumption about the benefits

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.650
and gains of trade.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.480
And it's a startling moment.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.580
This article was like
a bombshell in 2004.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.460
So how could the US be a loser
in competition with a low wage,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.690
lower cost competitor
like China-- obviously,

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.000
there's others--

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.240
despite David Ricardo's theory
of comparative advantage?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.990
And remember, we talked
in the first class

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.480
about Ricardo's theory
of comparative advantage.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.600
We had the example of
Portugal and England.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.850
England gets a lot of rain,
and it has a lot of grass.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.475
It grows sheep.

00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:14.790
Portugal has a lot more
sun and a lot less rain.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.990
It grows grapes.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.010
It produces wine and port.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.800
Each side trades to their
comparative advantage.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.480
Now, he's thinking of a
resource advantage, right.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.810
He's not thinking about
a comparative innovation

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.020
advantage.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.410
So what happens in the time
from Ricardo to the present,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.520
is that nations begin building
a comparative innovation

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.830
advantage through building
strong innovation systems,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.720
right.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.920
And arguably, the US leads
that effort, coming out

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.890
of World War II to develop
a comparative innovation

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.780
advantage.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.510
And Samuelson goes on
to argue that if China

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.610
or another comparable
country begins

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.580
to make productivity-enhancing
gains in its production

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.160
and couples that with
a wage advantage,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.310
it can capture some of the
comparative advantage that

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.580
had belonged to a
competitor like the US.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.920
So in a Ricardo sense,
there's never unemployment

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.740
that lasts forever from trade.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.870
It will eventually
sort itself out, right.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.810
But the way in which it's
been sorting itself out

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.300
is that, as he
puts it, real wages

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.200
have been lowered by this
version of dynamic fair trade.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.760
So to compete, wages come
down, right, in the US.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.600
And that's what's been going on.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.530
So wages can drop
after a time to a point

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.920
where a productivity enhancement
or productivity advantage

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.970
in another country is offset.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.560
But these are still net
harmful terms of trade.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.210
And this is not a
new story, right.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.930
This story has been going on for
a long time, Samuelson argues.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.690
So farming moves from the
eastern part of the United

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.150
States to the Midwest.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.420
That's a straight
comparative advantage--

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.670
the ability to scale up
agricultural production

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.330
in the Midwest, as opposed
to the more crowded East

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.050
and hillier East
and rockier East.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.710
We can see it.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.070
We understand why
agricultural production

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.750
shifts to the Midwest.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.960
Textile and shoe manufacturing
moved from New England

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.220
to the lower wage South
early at the beginning

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.930
of the 20th century.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.490
English manufacturing
leadership shifts to the US,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.130
starting in the middle of
the 19th century, right.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.130
We develop the early
stages of mass production

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.130
through interchangeable,
machine-made parts, not

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.630
Britain.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.190
And we'll talk more about
that in a later class.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.800
So as Samuelson
puts it, even where

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.530
the leaders continue to
progress in absolute growth,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.160
their rate of growth
tended to be attenuated

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.190
by an adverse headwind
generated from lower wage

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.680
competitors and other
technical imitators

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.160
in each one of these examples.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.240
Right, so this is an
old economic story

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.490
that he's raising.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.250
So a productivity
gain in one country

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.070
can benefit that country alone,
while permanently hurting

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.920
the other country by
reducing the gains

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.220
from trade that are possible
between the two countries.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.600
And all of this,
he acknowledges,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.720
is long-run
Schumpeterian effects--

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.570
creative destruction
of capitalism effects.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.080
And he concludes that in effect
is a roulette wheel of evolving

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.000
comparative advantage.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.690
Now his warning
is a powerful one.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.680
If you respond with
tariffs and protectionism,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.335
you will be breeding
economic arterial sclerosis.

00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:04.710
You will be limiting
your ability

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.260
to effectively and
efficiently compete.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.520
So that's not a fix in his mind.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:17.610
So this is one of the
most important economists

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.540
of the last century,
and a good part of this,

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.220
weighing in on an
historic conclusion

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.820
that economics came to about
the overall benefits of trade,

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.919
and saying it's a much more
complicated story than that.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:39.059
So it was a powerful message
when he put this out.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.840
So I just finished
talking about Samuelson.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.180
So we're all set up for you to
do us your view of Samuelson

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.990
and lead us into some Q&A.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.244
AUDIENCE: He sounded very
certain of all of this, right.

00:08:54.244 --> 00:08:58.590
And this was something that a
lot of people actually asked

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:04.300
about as well, is if he's
so sure if this is something

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.000
that's regarded to be
pretty substantial,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.970
why did it take the mainstream
and why did it take economists

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:18.135
at large a lot of years to
start changing their mentality?

00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:19.510
And I remember
last week, we were

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.330
talking about the US's
hesitation as a country

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.820
to change their economic
outlook in certain ways.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.910
So I was wondering if anyone
thought that those two were

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.645
related somehow.

00:09:31.645 --> 00:09:33.270
So it's kind of two
separate questions.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.130
Why did it take
forever for people

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.530
to start adopting his views?

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.900
And does it have something
to do with cultural factors

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.380
in the United States
or any other factors?

00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:49.446
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I have a comment.

00:09:49.446 --> 00:09:50.412
It's Lilly.

00:09:50.412 --> 00:09:53.793
I was thinking
about the timeline.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:10:01.870
So Samuelson starts to put
forward earlier than the 1970s

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.757
or even in the '60s?

00:10:02.757 --> 00:10:05.090
Because he got the Nobel Prize
in '72, and in his speech

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.550
he talks about it.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.860
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.500
And this is not the
main work for which

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.030
he's been recognized for.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:15.480
But with an economist
named Wolfgang Stolfer,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.610
the two of them
put out a doctrine

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.992
on advantages and disadvantages
of trading regimes

00:10:21.992 --> 00:10:23.200
pretty early in their career.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.470
And I'm thinking
the '50s, but I'd

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.270
have to go back and
check the actual dates.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:27.990
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.740
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So he kind of launches

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.010
that theoretical, highly
mathematical framework.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.120
He returns to it in 2004
because, in his view,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.110
the mainstream of economics,
which, of course, he created,

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:48.270
has taken a departing path
by assuming the continuing

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.020
eternal benefits of
free trading system

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.840
without really analyzing the
competitive processes that

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.053
are going on here.

00:10:56.053 --> 00:10:57.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.920
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And just
add one more thing, Lilly,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.850
there's an economist at
MIT named David Autor who

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.630
is doing startling work--

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.870
and I refer to them in
some of the other readings

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.310
we got into-- but doing
startling work on these very

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.630
significant trade impacts.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.566
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I listened
to some of his interviews.

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:24.000
But I'm kind of wondering what
precipitated Samuelson to write

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.918
this sort of explosive article.

00:11:26.918 --> 00:11:27.960
I'm trying to think back.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.070
And I think Alan Greenspan--
wasn't he the economic advisor

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.260
during the Clinton era?

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:33.690
So he would have been--

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.310
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: No,
he was in the Bush--

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.695
AUDIENCE: He was?

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.275
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: --II regime.

00:11:36.275 --> 00:11:36.897
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:36.897 --> 00:11:37.110
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.180
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.120
OK, so then NAFTA
pre-dated Greenspan.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.700
But yeah, I'm just
wondering about the timing

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.850
of this article and what really
prompted Samuelson to finally

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.370
be like, listen, everyone,
this is completely wrong.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.160
Yeah, maybe people
weren't paying attention

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.720
until post-NAFTA or
other trade agreements,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.205
and then it started to become
really more noticeable?

00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:04.580
[AUDIENCE: I mean,
we'd discussed

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.760
before that the US doesn't
really respond until things

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.302
start going south, right.

00:12:10.302 --> 00:12:11.244
So.

00:12:11.244 --> 00:12:12.186
[CHUCKLES]

00:12:12.828 --> 00:12:15.370
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah, our
motto could be "be unprepared."

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.880
AUDIENCE: Or I would
have loved for Mankiw

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.820
to say that quote, like,
OK, yeah, tell that

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.770
to the losers. (LAUGHING)
Like, it's totally fine.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.270
Don't worry.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.580
The winners are going to win
higher than the losers are

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.663
going to lose, so it's OK.

00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:32.747
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:35.290
And it's not that there haven't
been a significant net gains,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.530
right.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.180
Consumers are, no
question about it,

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.200
significant beneficiaries
of the regime.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.100
But there just are
dramatic effects,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.130
is what Samuelson is arguing.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.050
AUDIENCE: And I think it sort of
assumed in creative destruction

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.680
that like, the winners win
bigger than the losers are

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.750
going to lose.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.398
And then you center
the winners--

00:12:59.398 --> 00:12:59.940
I don't know.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.797
Maybe in the US we've
just been the winners

00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:03.630
for like a lot of these
consecutive creative

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.230
destruction periods or cycles.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.730
And then we have to deal with
sort of competing productivity

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.180
rates, I guess, [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.910
And then now it's
probably a little bit more

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.010
of an issue in China.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.703
And so the losing
end starts expanding

00:13:17.703 --> 00:13:19.620
towards Samuelson's
sphere of influence, which

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.790
is probably inside the US.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.830
And he writes this in,
what, in like 2004?

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.640
And so China is really
becoming sort of the forefront

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.340
of what we're considering.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.503
And I guess, I think Greenspan--

00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:32.670
I just looked him up-- he's
like chairman of the Fed

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.930
at this time, from '87 to 2006.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.860
So he sees all of this,
but he's just probably

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.540
not in a position to respond.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:45.600
And he can't really kind of
shift everybody's opinion

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.520
here, because there's
a lot of, I guess,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.750
sort of like gravity in the way
that mainstream economics is

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.943
thinking that he's just got
to follow that, I would say.

00:13:54.943 --> 00:13:56.610
And then, while
Samuelson doesn't really

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.990
have these restrictions
or rules [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.780
He's got the backing
of having created

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.220
and the legitimacy of having
created mainstream economics.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.598
So I think it's pretty OK
to disagree with yourself.

00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:09.140
But it's probably
a little bit harder

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.680
to disagree with the
massive wave of folks, which

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.970
is why it might have taken
these other folks a little bit

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.880
more time to respond,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.770
AUDIENCE: He always wanted to
break the status quo, it seems,

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.740
with economics.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.132
Well, regarding the
winners-and-losers discussion,

00:14:29.132 --> 00:14:33.590
I think people also mentioned
that that sort of thought

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.270
process might
drive a wedge, too,

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.405
that could create
income inequality.

00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:48.900
And the question was, does this
model of international trade--

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.070
does free trade inherently
create that income inequality?

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:59.840
Or are there other things
that contribute to that?

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.990
But what I would add
to that is, so maybe we

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.493
do make more money
than we lose, right.

00:15:07.493 --> 00:15:09.410
But the distribution
will be affected, because

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.610
most likely it will be--

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.050
I think I made this point last
week with one of the Intel

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.110
founders, where it was like, you
end up making way more money,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.860
but you're not going
to spread the wealth,

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.450
because those jobs that amass
the middle wealth aren't here.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.480
So I think, yeah.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.730
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
that was your quote, Martin,

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.820
from Andy Grove of Intel.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.013
It was a great quote.

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.930
AUDIENCE: And so I think
that's a big problem.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.388
Especially with like, Apple,
most of the manufacturing work

00:15:34.388 --> 00:15:35.780
is outside the US.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.870
And the other problem, too, that
we haven't gotten to is taxes.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.260
A lot of times companies use
tax loopholes effectively.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.420
So maybe that money
should be coming here.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.840
And I think I made
this point when

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.340
I was making my
notes on this piece,

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.930
is there's a lot of
hidden variables.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.180
And the author constrained
his variables in such a way

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.477
to make a certain point.

00:15:51.477 --> 00:15:53.060
And there's a lot
of variables that he

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.360
didn't take into account for
how people actually do things.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.070
So theoretically,
it might work out.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.770
But in terms of the actual,
how it gets done in practice,

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.050
I don't think it does.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.395
AUDIENCE: Does Autor
take into account, maybe

00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:11.210
in his mathematical laws a
couple of these tax loopholes

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.990
and how people are actually
sort of using these systems,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.020
rather than kind of ignoring
them as variables to kind

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.730
of make their point here?

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.110
Because I wonder if Autor
is analyzing the way

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.690
that people actually
and effectively

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.740
use these trade laws in this
kind of globalized system.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.880
Like, will he arrive
at the same result?

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.195
Or will we end up getting
that income inequality?

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.320
AUDIENCE: But like, one of
the papers that he wrote

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.960
looks at specific communities or
areas that were heavily focused

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.730
on an industry that's now gone.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.240
So it's looking at real people
and how their real incomes have

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.740
changed.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.930
So I think it was like
furniture in North Carolina

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.430
or something like that.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.680
And so you can prove just by
looking at that group of people

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.388
before and after that there
has been income changes

00:16:58.388 --> 00:17:00.180
and that the support
that they're receiving

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.070
from the government hasn't made
up for those changes in income

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.380
that they're getting.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.250
So if you use that
as an example,

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.979
that can show that those
income inequalities remain.

00:17:16.204 --> 00:17:19.069
AUDIENCE: OK, well, I think
a lot of the economists who

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:27.410
are mainstream economists who
are providing globalization,

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.500
when they talk about
net gains being made,

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.310
they talk about [INAUDIBLE]
they almost necessitate

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.660
this assumption that
they all get spread out.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.410
But we don't necessarily
see that for sure.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.680
I do feel like
[INAUDIBLE] like it

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.398
was a little bit of
a contrived example.

00:17:47.398 --> 00:17:49.690
But I think that is to the
point that what he was doing

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:55.970
was specifically showing
that current ideas

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.760
about globalization always
being good isn't always true.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.860
And he only really
needed to provide

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.820
a single example there
to explain why China

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.764
and India were [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.520
AUDIENCE: Just to add, I
think that another point was

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.215
that a lot of this debate
is kind of predicated

00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:21.210
on the idea of trickle down.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.740
And I think going back to
the question of why now,

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.770
or why are we [doing this now,
is that you've kind of been

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.290
successively proving that
trickle down has some

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.600
limitations-- has a
lot of limitations--

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.030
especially considering
developments in other countries

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.690
and how the market clearing
wage rate of the United States

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:42.940
has just been subject
to a natural reduction

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.180
due to increased capital and
innovation in other countries.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.100
And so the gap between
the winners and the losers

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.986
kind of has a widened and has
made that trickle-down process

00:18:53.986 --> 00:18:55.402
even less [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:57.442 --> 00:18:58.900
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So why don't we

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.830
dive into the next
reading, which

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.190
was Gary Pisano and Willy Shih.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.990
And that's yours,
too, Kevin, right?

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.225
OK, great.

00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:10.600
I'll just summarize
very quickly.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.190
And you can add more.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.140
But this is an
article they wrote.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:19.090
They later turned this into
quite a well-known book.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.300
And in this article--

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.510
and they later expand on it--

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.090
they look at a whole
set of technology areas.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:34.270
But they start from the
Kindle 2 and point out

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.720
that very large portions
of that technology

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.840
can no longer be produced
in the United States.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.690
This is the source for a
number of the components,

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.960
that it can only be made in
various countries abroad.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.020
So they argue that
there's an eroding US

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.110
ability to create virtually
every brand of notebook

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.850
computer, except Apple.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:59.570
And mobile handheld designs are
now largely in Asia, as well.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.940
So then they look at a whole
series of technology fields,

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.860
right, and find
that there's been

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.500
a lot of erosion
in US leadership

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.490
in a series of these areas, from
advanced materials to computing

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.290
and communications.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.150
They identify fields
that are gone.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:20.410
And they identify fields that
remain competitive and at risk.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.190
Same story for energy
technologies and storage,

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.250
for different aspects of
semiconductor industry

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.680
and for the display sector.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.770
So the erosion of these
industrial capabilities,

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.620
they essentially portray.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.530
So they help us take
the Samuelson theory

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.870
and make it much more
concrete in terms

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.530
of actual affected
industry segments that

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:49.300
are no longer present at
significant scale in the US.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.710
So let me leave
it to you, Kevin.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.312
It's all yours.

00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:54.276
AUDIENCE: Well,
that's true, yeah.

00:20:54.276 --> 00:20:57.713
The, I think, big
focus in the paper

00:20:57.713 --> 00:21:02.623
was the destructive behavior
that outsourcing has caused.

00:21:02.623 --> 00:21:03.605
And you're right.

00:21:03.605 --> 00:21:07.660
Like you said, it's causing
the ability for the US

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.644
to create now.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.900
And I think following
our previous talks

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.030
on how governments
should intervene

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:24.110
in these kinds of situations
to sort of fix the issue,

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.485
what role should government
play in intervening

00:21:28.485 --> 00:21:34.220
in company decisions that affect
their profits when innovation

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.890
for the US is the consequence--

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:45.861
the US being able to
influence the consequence

00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:47.769
to any [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:47.769 --> 00:21:52.590
AUDIENCE: Well, one answer is,
[INAUDIBLE] I was wondering,

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.640
does this outsourcing,
other than unemployment,

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.730
does this really harm
the US to that extent?

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:06.650
Because they argue that there's
a reduced industrial commons?

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.550
And what if this
transfer of industrial

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.145
commons in other countries--

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:22.000
does it really affect
the US that much?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.470
Why can't the US still benefit
from industrial commons

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.740
from overseas other
than loss of employment?

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.230
Do you see what I mean?

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.320
AUDIENCE: And I think that's
an especially relevant point

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.355
in this innovation wave where a
global economy is more relevant

00:22:40.355 --> 00:22:41.355
than it was in the past.

00:22:44.192 --> 00:22:45.900
I don't know the answer
to that question.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.840
[LAUGHS]

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.740
AUDIENCE: If I had to guess,
I'd say that, well, we

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.920
can benefit from it.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.400
But the benefits
that we would get

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.170
would be orders
of magnitude less

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.264
than the benefits of
the country that hosts

00:22:56.264 --> 00:22:57.672
this industrial commons, right?

00:22:57.672 --> 00:22:58.380
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.630
AUDIENCE: So it would mean
having employment benefits.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.220
They'd get extra tax revenue.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.228
Just, their economy
in general-- like

00:23:06.228 --> 00:23:08.520
they might be able to even
undergo an entire innovation

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.900
wave because of this.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.000
So yeah.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.830
It's not so much that
we can't benefit,

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.980
so much that it is that
other people are benefiting

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.790
more, which means that
they can get ahead

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.140
in other technologies.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.310
So if you look at
long-term, then that

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.230
puts them ahead in a
lot of other fields.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.688
And that's just not good
for the US interest.

00:23:30.688 --> 00:23:33.588
AUDIENCE: So but to
that point, yeah,

00:23:33.588 --> 00:23:35.880
it might help in the short-term,
but then the long-term

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.680
what happens is they
build up capabilities

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.887
that we've just never had.

00:23:38.887 --> 00:23:41.220
Like in business, we talk a
lot about compound interest.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.430
So a lot of the value will
be created in the future.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.320
So the problem is more like
10 years in the future,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.065
they can produce things that we
never build up the capability.

00:23:49.065 --> 00:23:51.750
And those are
things that it's not

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.300
like knowing-- it's like
actually creating your supply

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.880
chain in a certain way
and creating the system.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.340
Silicon Valley
took like 80 years

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.950
to become Silicon
Valley because you

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.970
need a lot of [INAUDIBLE],,
a lot of mentors,

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.102
a lot of different expertises.

00:24:05.102 --> 00:24:06.810
And so my big worry
when I'm reading this

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.210
is more that we are very
short-term-focused in the US.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.190
We don't really save.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.670
We always assume the future's
going to be optimistic.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.230
And this is a point from
Peter Thiel, Professor,

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.960
since I know you
kind of like him.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.030
And like Asian countries
tend to be more--

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.930
let's say I think, like 30% to
[INAUDIBLE] a long-term focus.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.180
So I think that's really a
key point with this piece,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.830
that we're very
short-term-focused.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.160
We're trying to find the
big win very quickly.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.330
So that's why our industries
are kind of like tech--

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.710
technologies that
don't matter as much--

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.070
Wall Street, finance,
which debateably

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.445
doesn't add that much value.

00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:43.170
And these other industries
take a long time.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.670
But you'll get a
lot of capabilities

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.035
that you won't be able to get.

00:24:46.035 --> 00:24:49.070
AUDIENCE: What was
the paper where--

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.470
it was Japan that
looked hundreds of years

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.620
into the future and have that
anecdote about an advisor

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.120
or someone.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.090
And he said, oh, yeah, this is
my plan for the next 100 years.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.200
And he was criticized for
thinking too short-term.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.568
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: [CHUCKLES]

00:25:01.568 --> 00:25:02.480
Right.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.280
AUDIENCE: I think it's
interesting also--

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.070
I understand very strongly the
point you're making about how

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.028
other countries would
then benefit when we move

00:25:09.028 --> 00:25:11.400
our [INAUDIBLE] overseas--

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.600
but what's the link
between maybe moving

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.105
those processes overseas and
making room for new ideas

00:25:18.105 --> 00:25:20.336
to be borne?

00:25:20.336 --> 00:25:23.280
And if maybe the
US takes on more

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.020
of an innovative and
purely like the idea--

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.860
like blackboard
kind of innovation--

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.290
and then ships the idea
to another country where

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.147
they can actually produce them?

00:25:33.147 --> 00:25:34.980
Does there need to be
that separation for us

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.647
to be able to have
the room to innovate?

00:25:36.647 --> 00:25:38.998
Or can we still innovate and
keep all of our stuff here?

00:25:38.998 --> 00:25:40.415
AUDIENCE: I think
we can innovate.

00:25:40.415 --> 00:25:43.758
I don't know that the
US would like moving

00:25:43.758 --> 00:25:45.050
most of their profits overseas.

00:25:47.023 --> 00:25:49.440
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let me
jump in with a couple of slides

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.790
that I was going to use later.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:55.020
But they're relevant-- very
relevant to this discussion.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.960
So this is the share of
employment in services

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.040
versus manufacturing.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.540
So that's the left-hand chart.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.650
So services in the US,
86%, production, 14%.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.920
It's actually somewhat
lower than that.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.190
And then that's the share
of earnings in the Standard

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:18.260
& Poor 500 coming from
manufacturing versus services,

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.370
right.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.630
So one reason why
you manufacture

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.990
is, that's where
the money is, right.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.770
It's not in services.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.670
So if you develop an economy
that's overwhelmingly services,

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.790
as we have been heading
for for a long time,

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.130
look at the returns, right.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.700
And then-- I'm really
jumping ahead here--

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.540
but let's look at
the trade balance

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.950
for high technology goods versus
all manufactured products.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.340
So the US is running a
gigantic trade deficit

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.250
in all manufactured products.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.800
But now, we're
running a major trade

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.280
deficit in advanced
manufacturing technologies.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.910
So that goes right to
your point, Chloe, right?

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.530
Let's cede commodity production
and make it up on the high end.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.290
Except we're not
doing that, right.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.635
Instead, the whole
picture looks bleak.

00:27:12.635 --> 00:27:13.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:14.795
Right.

00:27:14.795 --> 00:27:16.670
This class is designed
to scare you to death.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.253
AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:27:17.253 --> 00:27:18.094
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:18.594 --> 00:27:21.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I find that isn't it

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.606
counter-intuitive for
the US to train so much

00:27:23.606 --> 00:27:26.843
international students, and
knowing that most of them

00:27:26.843 --> 00:27:28.586
will return to
their home country

00:27:28.586 --> 00:27:30.675
and contribute to the
industry commons over there?

00:27:30.675 --> 00:27:31.545
AUDIENCE: Well, see,
that's fascinating,

00:27:31.545 --> 00:27:33.655
because I heard the
assumption actually

00:27:33.655 --> 00:27:36.025
be that the US keeps the
international students,

00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:37.370
and that's why.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.296
I mean, we've mentioned it
in several classes, right?

00:27:40.296 --> 00:27:42.195
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:27:42.195 --> 00:27:44.023
AUDIENCE: They might still do.

00:27:44.023 --> 00:27:46.190
AUDIENCE: Probably true,
but maybe at a lesser rate.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.800
Because I think the
opportunities available now

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.590
in the US manufacturing sector,
just like outside the US--

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.470
for people that come
here and do train,

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.810
it's now a lot more
feasible for me to go back,

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.770
whereas previously I
would have had to stay.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.522
And so we're seeing sort of
a decreasing rate [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:01.522 --> 00:28:02.022
to stay.

00:28:02.022 --> 00:28:02.674
AUDIENCE: More desirable
to stay, right?

00:28:02.674 --> 00:28:05.114
It's like the common
example we've used in class,

00:28:05.114 --> 00:28:06.578
I think maybe two
or three times,

00:28:06.578 --> 00:28:09.018
is that with every diploma
and cap received in the US,

00:28:09.018 --> 00:28:11.713
we should staple a visa.

00:28:11.713 --> 00:28:13.880
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Heck,
let's staple a green card.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.857
To heck with the visa.

00:28:14.857 --> 00:28:15.095
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:15.095 --> 00:28:16.045
AUDIENCE: A green card, sorry.

00:28:16.045 --> 00:28:16.837
That's what I mean.

00:28:16.837 --> 00:28:19.528
But yeah, so what
does the data actually

00:28:19.528 --> 00:28:20.912
look like on that bill?

00:28:20.912 --> 00:28:22.870
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well,
a significant portion

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.840
of students from abroad
do stay here, right.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.620
But the numbers are in decline.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.620
And more are going back
to their home countries.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.050
But does that mean--
you all tell me--

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.550
that the US ought
to close its doors

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.725
to international students?

00:28:34.725 --> 00:28:36.100
Right, is that
what we should do?

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.980
Right, is that the
right economic strategy?

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.613
We've got somebody who
thinks it is, at the moment.

00:28:42.613 --> 00:28:45.030
AUDIENCE: You know yesterday
he passed another one, right?

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:45.640
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, I know.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.110
No.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.490
No, really-- I'm asking
in a serious kind of way.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.590
I mean, the US
model, historically,

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.668
was to have these
international universities

00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:57.460
and attract talent from
all over the place.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.550
Because if you're running
an innovation system

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.310
that feeds talent for
the entire world, what

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.680
an incredible competitive
advantage, right?

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.015
What an incredible
competitive opportunity.

00:29:08.015 --> 00:29:09.640
But I think the other
side of that coin

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.430
is that it's a value in itself.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.350
And yeah, you really asked
some terrific questions

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.480
in your email to me.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.550
And this is one of them.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.880
What are these Americans doing?

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.380
Right.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.290
What do they think
they're doing here?

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.720
But I still think
it's of overall value

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.570
to have as much talent here,
because that's how knowledge

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.670
gets sharpened, right.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.440
That's how we get
sharper and better.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.170
And so that would
be my argument.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.780
But people should
feel free to disagree.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.900
AUDIENCE: So in a way that--

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.910
I feel really uncomfortable
when people say,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.478
I want to play the
devil's advocate.

00:29:48.478 --> 00:29:51.020
Because I feel like those people
are trying to be incendiary.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.360
But I certainly have had
peers in the past that

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.060
would have raised the
point of this conversation

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.970
about whether students who are
coming from other countries

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.250
might be considered
spies, because they

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.840
would be then understanding
knowledge and the innovation

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.910
or sort of innovation
paradigm, and then

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.010
taking it back to
their home countries.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.440
And that also makes
me feel uncomfortable,

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.430
because I feel like trust
sort of precludes cooperation.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.310
And it precludes the
United States' ability

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.695
to work in a globalized system.

00:30:20.695 --> 00:30:22.987
So I was hoping that you
could talk about that a little

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:23.487
as well.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:33.290
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: In the
end, having a world talent base

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.563
with common education
experiences--

00:30:36.563 --> 00:30:38.480
that's very powerful for
the world in general.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.390
I mean, that's a
real huge net plus.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.350
And we can't assume
that all innovation is

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.850
going to happen in
the United States

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.140
and we can wall ourselves off.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.465
It's important for innovation
to occur elsewhere.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:31:01.320
There's an old story about
small towns and lawyers, right.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:07.871
So if there's a small town
and there's one lawyer,

00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:09.946
the lawyer is going to starve.

00:31:09.946 --> 00:31:12.940
If there's a small
town and two lawyers,

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.173
they're both going
to get rich, right.

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:17.590
Because their clients will be
suing each other constantly,

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.090
right.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.370
In other words, they're going
to create more net, right.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.210
And if China is doing
brilliant things

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.920
to bring 300, 400 or
more million people

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.040
into its middle class, that's
a great thing for the world.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.180
That's a great, overall
incredible net plus,

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.060
to create a massive
new middle class.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.880
And if the US can't figure out
how to take advantage of that,

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.670
then shame on us, right.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.490
Because it's really important
that the world do these things,

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.120
right.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.140
Same story in India.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.390
Same story and all kinds of
other developing countries

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.470
that are starting to
become emerging economies.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.660
So these things need to happen.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.610
And we're not going to
be able to wall them off.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.560
We just have to figure out--

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.480
to develop our own
competitive capabilities

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.075
to be participating.

00:32:06.075 --> 00:32:07.450
That would be what
I would argue.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.130
Now, a lot of people
see this differently.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.630
Matthew?

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.089
AUDIENCE: I think
another benefit--

00:32:12.089 --> 00:32:15.004
even if you didn't care about
the Chinese middle class

00:32:15.004 --> 00:32:18.880
or India's middle class, and
if you just cared about the US,

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.880
you'd still have to
recognize that we don't have

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.530
the comparative
advantage in everything

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.250
such as advanced manufacturing.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.210
By having those
international students there,

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.750
like say, a Sloan
student who was working

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.530
in manufacturing in China--

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.360
just as much as they're
maybe benefiting

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.690
from the US education and
that innovation mindset,

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.195
they're sharing with their
peers their experiences.

00:32:39.195 --> 00:32:39.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.862
I think that's important.

00:32:40.862 --> 00:32:43.330
And when we consider
the educational model

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.060
and bringing international
people into that,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.850
I think it's important to
not adopt the perspective

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.430
that we're the only ones
who have anything to offer.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.880
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You got it.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.880
AUDIENCE: Other people
bring other perspectives.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.963
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:32:55.963 --> 00:32:58.390
AUDIENCE: And that's valuable
even just for our benefit,

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.860
not to mention other countries'
benefit, which is good.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.160
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So, Luyao
have we answered your question?

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.783
Yeah?

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.950
Are you satisfied with what
we've talked about here?

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:08.783
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLES]

00:33:08.783 --> 00:33:11.283
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
You can critique us.

00:33:11.283 --> 00:33:14.040
AUDIENCE: Well,
personally I think

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.080
it, just for the
sake of the world,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.180
is benefiting to have an
international base of talents.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.950
And there are
countries that see this

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:27.505
as a national strategic
move, to attract talents,

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:28.720
like Singapore.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.780
But because they are such a
small country and their only

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.482
resources-- the human talents--

00:33:34.482 --> 00:33:38.242
then I don't know if the
US sees this as something

00:33:38.242 --> 00:33:40.220
of national importance.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.660
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.700
Your Singapore example
is very astute.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.700
It's really interesting.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.120
Because Singapore, at least
until fairly recently,

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.520
had a strategy for
higher education,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.500
in particular
graduate education,

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.020
to get its students out
into the world, right--

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.240
to send them to the best
educational institutions

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.660
around the world, so that they
would learn other countries

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.760
and how they worked
and what ideas

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.435
could be gained from them--

00:34:05.435 --> 00:34:07.560
and that they would be able
to set up relationships

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.510
with those countries.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.510
They would be able to
have working relationships

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.500
with the communities
that they learned.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:20.670
And Singapore--
small island nation--

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:24.870
city-state, really--
no real resources.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.820
They have to trade to live.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.199
So they organize themselves
around becoming intermediaries

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:34.380
in all kinds of
trading activities

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.900
worldwide, whether
it's petroleum

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.260
and oil and fossil
fuels, or it's

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.500
running the world's
most efficient port

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:49.093
or running the most efficient
cargo transport aircraft

00:34:49.093 --> 00:34:50.760
operation in the
world, they figured out

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.320
these intermediary spots.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.808
And then they used their
relationship building

00:34:54.808 --> 00:34:56.850
to be able to build the
relationships they needed

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.670
to play that dramatic
intermediary role benefited

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.140
by their geography.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.200
So it's a very interesting
example, Luyao,

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.120
of a country that's adopted kind
of a broad look at education

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.136
and where to get it.

00:35:11.136 --> 00:35:12.780
AUDIENCE: And to
add on to that--

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:13.066
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Please.

00:35:13.066 --> 00:35:15.690
AUDIENCE: --with that kind of
strategy, there are, of course,

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.280
social costs.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:23.030
There are like local hatreds
of international laborers.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.840
And the government
takes a responsibility

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.900
to settle this conflict
instead of reducing

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.080
international
talents, because they

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.440
see this as a strategic move.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.640
And so it is the question,
like, when we see maybe

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.580
there is an outsourcing
of manufacturing,

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.120
there are loss of talents.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.735
Or do we just stop doing it?

00:35:52.735 --> 00:35:55.090
Or should the government
take the responsibility

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.240
to solve the social
costs associated

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:03.982
with this kind of move,
together with globalization?

00:36:03.982 --> 00:36:05.920
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Have at it, team.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.975
What do you think?

00:36:07.975 --> 00:36:09.600
AUDIENCE: So on the
point of education,

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.560
higher education, that's one of
the US's important abilities.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.210
So it's a really good thing.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.710
It's dangerous to
assume that that's

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.015
going to be a core strength
for a long period of time.

00:36:19.015 --> 00:36:22.150
So people will learn
from us and [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.580
There's a couple good
universities popping up

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.957
in other countries
that are doing well.

00:36:26.957 --> 00:36:29.290
I think the big danger, though,
is the point [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:34.030
made previously about why should
[INAUDIBLE] create more value?

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.260
Because ideas don't matter as
much as the execution of ideas.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.635
Like, there's a
ton of people who

00:36:38.635 --> 00:36:39.790
came up with social networks.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:41.582
Facebook had 15 social
networks beforehand.

00:36:41.582 --> 00:36:43.988
But it wasn't until one
person executed it right.

00:36:43.988 --> 00:36:46.030
So the danger is, we could
invent something here,

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.860
and another company in
China has-- he's like,

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.340
oh, that's a great idea.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.010
We can do that.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:51.843
We can do it better.

00:36:51.843 --> 00:36:53.240
And we can do it cheaper.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.540
And that's the real kind of
thing I would worry about,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.770
is that capability of
being able to execute.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:01.380
And it's something
that's hard to understand

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.430
until you've see it just
happen and gone through it.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.262
But that's the danger.

00:37:06.262 --> 00:37:08.220
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
Kevin, how about another

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:14.633
question-- a closing question
on Gary Pisano and Willy Shih.

00:37:14.633 --> 00:37:16.525
AUDIENCE: Throughout
this whole discussion--

00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:18.672
this might be beyond
the scope of the class--

00:37:18.672 --> 00:37:20.505
there's a question that
popped into my head.

00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:22.890
If there stands to be
so much mutual benefit

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:28.590
from global cooperation, why
don't countries prioritize it?

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.140
That might be an
idealistic view.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.107
But if economies now are
so interconnected by trade

00:37:34.107 --> 00:37:38.550
and competition and everything,
why don't governments

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:43.810
of the world cooperate to
sort of prop each other up?

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.685
And I'm as cynical as
the next person, right.

00:37:45.685 --> 00:37:50.130
I understand human greed and
the desire for money, right--

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:51.900
desire to be the best.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.895
But why can't everyone
sort of be the best?

00:37:54.895 --> 00:37:56.270
AUDIENCE: That's
a good question.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.130
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLES]

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.790
AUDIENCE: So often
the people who

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:06.480
have to make these
decisions, they usually

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.520
want to put their people first--
like, hey, America first.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.955
So that usually means
it's America first

00:38:13.955 --> 00:38:16.670
at the cost of anyone else.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:20.450
So if you have 196
governments, all of which who

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.990
are thinking like that,
then, well, you kind of

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.970
end up where we are today.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:28.310
And it's short-term, yes.

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:31.893
And I'll try to play a
bit of devil's advocate.

00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:33.060
I know you hate that, Lilly.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:33.485
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:33.485 --> 00:38:34.335
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I hate it.

00:38:34.335 --> 00:38:35.270
AUDIENCE: I love it.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.757
Honestly, I love that phrase.

00:38:37.757 --> 00:38:39.340
AUDIENCE: As an
intellectual exercise,

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.150
I think it's important.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.730
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:42.580
AUDIENCE: But if you do it
from not a place of trying

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.620
to find an understanding
with other people,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.590
then I think it
is irresponsible.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:48.870
AUDIENCE: So I see the--

00:38:52.983 --> 00:38:53.650
I lost my point.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:57.050
AUDIENCE: Global
corporate [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:08.920
Yeah, so I see why long-term
it would be good to cooperate.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.350
But in the short-term,
if somebody, say,

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.140
reneges on a deal
when you've already

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.240
put billions and billions
of dollars into it,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.657
that could hurt
you significantly.

00:39:18.657 --> 00:39:20.455
And then they could
get away scot-free.

00:39:20.455 --> 00:39:21.830
And then they
could realize, hey,

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.390
I've damaged this country that--

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:26.780
I don't know-- for
whatever reason,

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:32.030
I wanted to have less economic
benefit than what I'm getting.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:35.860
So basically, it comes
down to mistrust.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.660
So like that could happen.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.340
Yes, "we are the world."

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.840
I'd love for it to happen.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.680
But I think it's going
to take a long time.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.253
AUDIENCE: So to point
out, we've definitely

00:39:46.253 --> 00:39:48.170
done the whole reneging
thing a billion times.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:48.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.688
AUDIENCE: Colonialism exists.

00:39:49.688 --> 00:39:50.188
So--

00:39:50.188 --> 00:39:51.030
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:52.405
AUDIENCE: --we've
definitely gone

00:39:52.405 --> 00:39:54.810
to countries and different
places around the world,

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:58.400
and really just
ravished for resources,

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.740
technological abilities,
what have you.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.175
And then, I think there's
a longstanding history

00:40:03.175 --> 00:40:07.640
of us kind of doing that and not
doing it right, just because it

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.015
is so advantageous for one
party to renege or do it wrong

00:40:11.015 --> 00:40:13.140
and go in for the wrong
reasons in the first place.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.710
And I think that
level of trust is

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.450
sort of hard to build
from that history,

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.710
but also, in the
case of [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:23.470
so let's say you build this
multi-national cooperation

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:28.780
and somebody does sort
of renege on a deal,

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.960
I can't see really
a conflict mediation

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.520
peace or a medium there that
doesn't escalate very quickly,

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.130
especially when large economic
threats are involved-- so maybe

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.330
war or something.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.110
War is the extreme
example, but like tariffs--

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.713
there could be large trade
implications that now--

00:40:47.713 --> 00:40:50.130
whereas previously they would
have been isolated to larger

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.963
countries, but now that
it's multi-national,

00:40:51.963 --> 00:40:53.650
it affects sort of everybody.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.317
AUDIENCE: I'm trying to think of
a memoir I was reading recently

00:40:56.317 --> 00:40:58.420
about a woman named
Wangari Maathai in Kenya

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.390
about her experiences of growing
up right as British colonialism

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:04.060
was taking off in the 1940s.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.550
And she was speaking of
the ways in which society

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.940
had been structured
in her village

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:15.300
and that different ethnic
groups had become, I guess,

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.975
specialized in
certain capacities.

00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:19.100
Like, some people were very
good at basket weaving.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.720
Other people had become
very good at agriculture.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.715
Other people have become
very good at medicine.

00:41:23.715 --> 00:41:26.215
And each of those communities
taught themselves those trades

00:41:26.215 --> 00:41:29.800
and perpetuated that
sort of, I guess,

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.140
capacity within generations.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.270
And then British
colonialism came in.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:39.040
They started exploiting people
for agricultural production.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.630
And that entire system imploded,
and along with it, [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:46.125
culture, the knowledge
that they had,

00:41:46.125 --> 00:41:47.500
the agricultural
systems that had

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.980
taken them thousands of years
to formulate, et cetera.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.680
And I think it's precisely what
this woman is talking about--

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.490
why cooperation is so difficult,
which is why I brought up game

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:58.210
theory I think two classes ago--

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.350
because cooperation and
collaboration are so important,

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.420
but they rest so much a
sort of fundamental trust.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.030
And that kind of
collaboration always

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.890
sort of implies
a power imbalance

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.590
that is negated by
that sense of trust.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:14.230
And it's so difficult
on a global scale

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:18.230
to enact trust and
collaboration because there

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.650
is such a sense of
histories and colonialism

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.750
of power imbalances-- of
domination and hegemony.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.930
And because we have
been, for the past 200

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.050
years in the United States,
such strong actors in that,

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.530
we've never had to take this
into consideration before.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.910
And I think now, in particular--

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.040
I really wish that
we had more students

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.630
in this course who
were sort of coming

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.113
from defense backgrounds.

00:42:40.113 --> 00:42:41.780
Because I feel like
we don't talk enough

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.930
about the implications of war or
the implications bioterrorism.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.930
But I do think it's
certainly important to think

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.000
about collaboration
as our ideal.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.660
But as we were talking
about last week

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.740
in the social organization
of organizations,

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.560
how is it that we can sort of
have a layered approach, where

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.930
there is collaboration
existing in a system

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.460
where we feel that
we are respecting

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.440
power dynamics, and
also the potential

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.616
for us to be heard in the
short and the long run.

00:43:07.616 --> 00:43:09.824
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because when
I think of collaboration

00:43:09.824 --> 00:43:12.570
between nations, the first
example that comes to me

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:13.690
is like World War I--

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:15.745
Axis versus Allies.

00:43:15.745 --> 00:43:17.370
They were in great
collaboration teams.

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:19.560
And then that embroiled
us into a massive mess

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.740
because fights
between one and each

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.595
let to fights
between all of them.

00:43:24.595 --> 00:43:27.200
So I think you raise the
issue of that occurring.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.380
AUDIENCE: Well, actually
to counter that--

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:34.150
the difference between now
and World War I is currently,

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.706
as we saw in the last week's
readings are our economies

00:43:37.706 --> 00:43:40.540
are just so linked, we
can't have that again.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:44.410
Because then, the entire world
could just completely collapse.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.000
And honestly, you
probably can't even

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.570
have the war, because you
need the gunpowder produced,

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:50.850
I don't know, in one country.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:52.392
You'd need the bullet
casing produced

00:43:52.392 --> 00:43:55.400
in another country, the
stock for a rifle built

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.430
in a third country.

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:00.100
Everything is so interconnected,
as was pointed out,

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.165
that, well, we can't
even mobilize very well.

00:44:02.165 --> 00:44:03.540
AUDIENCE: But what
if [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.582
AUDIENCE: If you're just
using rifles and sticks.

00:44:05.582 --> 00:44:06.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:07.248
AUDIENCE: I don't care.

00:44:07.248 --> 00:44:07.748
OK, yeah.

00:44:07.748 --> 00:44:08.740
Everyone gets sticks.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.573
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'm
going to put us back

00:44:10.573 --> 00:44:13.563
into manufacturing
and out of war.

00:44:13.563 --> 00:44:15.730
AUDIENCE: I mean, look at
the opposing view, though.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.320
There's a lot of
value in conflict.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.903
Like, in management,
we do this a lot,

00:44:18.903 --> 00:44:20.692
where it's like you
will put out something

00:44:20.692 --> 00:44:23.109
to make it seem like you're
doing bad when you're actually

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:25.895
doing OK so that people
will get to work.

00:44:25.895 --> 00:44:28.020
I think a good example was,
like in Silicon Valley,

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.920
somebody made out a
white paper about like,

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.977
oh, this is the
distribution of diversity.

00:44:31.977 --> 00:44:33.810
And a lot of the times,
it's very illogical.

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.250
But it's actually the
person you don't expect,

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.980
because they want people
to focus on that topic.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.880
So I think there's
a lot of value

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.300
from creating that conflict.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.065
So I think on the macro, I think
we are in a relative peace.

00:44:46.065 --> 00:44:47.440
Because is there
ever going to be

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.870
a time with no conflict at all?

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.180
Right, it's too utopian.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.100
So what you do is,
it's macro-utopian.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.020
But you create these minor
issues that really don't matter

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:57.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.620
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Maybe.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.904
Kevin, why don't you give us a
closing thought on this piece.

00:45:05.904 --> 00:45:13.200
AUDIENCE: Well, to counter all
the points, it's hard to tell--

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.790
especially in the
long, long term--

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.570
which is more sustainable--
our historical behaviors

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:23.180
or whatever future
model we come up with.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.770
But maybe the next big
innovation wave for the US

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:29.970
is a global one and not just
one leaning to the country.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.350
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Interesting.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.250
All right.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:40.090
We'll now dive into Jonas Nahm
and Ed Steinfeld, both of whom

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:41.020
worked in MIT.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:45.205
So Jonas is now teaching
at Johns Hopkins SAIS.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.340
And he's from Germany, fluent
Mandarin, spent lots and lots

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:52.070
of time in China.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.760
So he knows both German
and Chinese economics

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.070
and manufacturing
systems, in particular.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:02.140
Ed Steinfeld has gone on to head
the Watson Institute at Brown

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.240
from MIT political
science department.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:09.040
Both are terrific
scholars of the kind

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.260
of manufacturing
advances that China

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.110
has been able to put together.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.050
So this dramatic thing happens.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:21.833
China moves from 5.7% of global
manufacturing output in 2000

00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:27.100
to almost 20% in 2011,
passing the US in output.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.990
I mean, that is
startling, right.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.540
Those numbers jump off the page.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.230
How did that happen?

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.400
Right.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.480
So what happened here?

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.260
So the operating
assumption in the US

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.640
has been that China
had lower production

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:51.320
costs due to lower wage
costs and lower cost parts.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.480
That was the
operating assumption.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.300
And then there's been
an assumption in the US

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.650
that manufacturing naturally
migrates to low-cost producers

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.390
and that the knowledge required
for manufacturing processes

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:05.000
is comparatively trivial.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.813
And Nahm and Steinfeld argue,
neither of those is true.

00:47:09.813 --> 00:47:11.480
The assumption that
production knowledge

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.155
flowed via multinationals
from outside into China--

00:47:15.155 --> 00:47:17.030
it's a much more
complicated story than that.

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:20.690
The assumption that the IT
revolution enables severing

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:22.670
of manufacturing from R&D--

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:26.120
from production and design--

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.260
and turns out to be a
more complicated story.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:36.230
And none of these explanations
explain that dramatic rise

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:40.970
in China's production
capability and output.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:47.390
Instead, they argue
that China has developed

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:53.660
some remarkable new process
innovation and manufacturing

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:54.410
innovation.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.980
And that needs to be
understood and respected

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.290
as a major innovation advance.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:06.860
So China has tended, they argue,
to specialize in rapid scale-up

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:11.900
and cost reduction,
in combination.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:17.090
And they join really
remarkable skills

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:21.980
in simultaneous management
of the tempo of production

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.450
and production volume
and controlling cost,

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:32.990
and that that's a very powerful
set of skills and capabilities,

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:36.860
and that these kinds of factors
are much better explanations

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:42.950
for that remarkable rise than
simply a wage differential.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.950
So they argue that this has
enabled China to expand even

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:48.290
in industries that are
highly automated or not

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:52.280
on governmental priority lists.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.740
And low costs and
government support

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:58.040
are just not
sufficient to explain

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.230
China's remarkable
accomplishments

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:01.350
in manufacturing.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.340
So let's get more into
a little detail here.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.480
China's developing
production processes

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.490
in areas that were
previously thought

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:14.780
fully mature and impervious
to additional cost reductions

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.580
or technological improvement.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.180
China's taken on various sectors
and shown that, in fact, you

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:25.010
can bring innovation to
these in process and in cost.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:30.770
So the key has been accumulation
of firm-specific expertise

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:34.040
that has enabled what they call
"extensive, multidirectional,

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.310
inter-firm learning."

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:41.210
In other words, they're able
to get a community of producers

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:45.230
to operate together in a
unified kind of way that's

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:47.570
kind of unthinkable in
the much more fragmented,

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:49.985
decentralized US system--

00:49:49.985 --> 00:49:51.860
to build a level of
cooperation, particularly

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.670
in a regional basis, that is
able to scale up production

00:49:55.670 --> 00:50:01.990
very quickly in ways that
are pretty unprecedented.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:05.090
So elements of China's
new production model,

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:08.120
they argue, include
backward design capability--

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.520
in other words, taking
an existing product

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.370
and rethinking it,
right, so that you

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:21.120
can create lower cost production
systems for those components,

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.870
and therefore be able to sell
it into a lower cost, lower

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:30.960
wage Chinese economy, right,
in a creative kind of way here.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.420
Yes, there's been a
partnership of foreign design

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.860
and Chinese manufacturing.

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:38.010
But that has been
multidirectional, they argue.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.650
Both sides have been
informing each other.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:43.620
And technology absorption
and collaborative development

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.770
across networked production
firms has been remarkable.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:49.950
That's part of this ability
to do rapid scale-up.

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:55.090
So these are all new
elements that we haven't

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:59.380
seen in production systems, that
China's been able, they argue,

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.390
to put together in unique ways.

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:04.570
So an explanation of Chinese
manufacturing as just a wage

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.648
advantage completely
understates, they argue,

00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:09.440
what, in fact, China
has accomplished here.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.470
It's a remarkable story.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:15.040
So we have to kind
of keep this in mind

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.700
as we confront these global
competitive issues in the class

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.600
today.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.250
It's not a simple story
of a wage advantage.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.320
It's a much more complex
and interesting and

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.243
innovation-based story.

00:51:28.243 --> 00:51:31.734
AUDIENCE: When we're putting
into detail about why China

00:51:31.734 --> 00:51:33.442
was so successful,
why it could do things

00:51:33.442 --> 00:51:37.246
in such a short time span, but
my question and the question

00:51:37.246 --> 00:51:41.420
some people have as
well was, what next,

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.600
in terms of trade
relationships between--

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.230
economic relationships
between the US--

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:49.286
the United States, especially
in this political climate?

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:58.270
Are they a force to
be reckoned with?

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.880
Are we going to learn from them?

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.740
AUDIENCE: So actually
part of my thinking

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.420
that maybe they had
such a rapid growth

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:09.930
because, if you think about
it, they have a lot of people,

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.870
I think a lot of resources.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.240
AUDIENCE: Untapped potential.

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.573
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they just
haven't tapped their potential

00:52:15.573 --> 00:52:17.094
until relatively recently.

00:52:17.094 --> 00:52:19.094
The fact that they were
able to do it so quickly

00:52:19.094 --> 00:52:20.078
is pretty remarkable.

00:52:20.078 --> 00:52:25.730
But beyond that, the fact that
they are where they are now

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.710
should not be that surprising.

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:32.148
Yeah, I feel like they have
the expertise to do it.

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:34.528
And the internet's made
information pretty easy to get.

00:52:34.528 --> 00:52:39.060
So I don't know, maybe like
all manufacturing [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:42.020
you can't easily get, but.

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I do think,
kind of in line with this paper,

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.550
there's this presumption that if
we weren't buying manufactured

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.190
goods from China, we could
just make them in the US.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:53.280
But that's pretty clearly not
true, especially as emphasized

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.370
by a lot of these reading.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.030
Like, we simply can't
make them any more.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:00.960
So I see that there
can be a lot of talk

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.290
about not purchasing as
many goods from China.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:06.990
But if we want to
maintain our lifestyles,

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.750
have Kindles, have
these other devices,

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.360
I don't see a realistic way
in the short-term for us

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.900
to not have some
dependence on China.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.060
Like, long-term we
could change our systems

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:20.250
and try to gain back
some of that footing.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.950
But I think a lot of it
is just talk right now.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:26.410
AUDIENCE: And digging into why
China has the advantage here,

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:29.830
I think it's two things--
mostly because work

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:33.450
and kind of their life
has been very integrated.

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:36.910
For example, at factories,
like semiconductor factories,

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:38.680
you live in dorms.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.770
And you go to work.

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:42.970
And there's not
that much separation

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.500
between your work
and your actual life.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.500
So there's very
much an expectation

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.590
that you are very devoted
and dedicated to your work.

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:53.980
And also, I think
in China it's less

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:58.570
stigmatized to go into like
kind of manufacturing and work

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.810
on these really
innovation-driven

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:05.140
from manufacturing, kind
of in a reverse process.

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.500
And so that means a
lot of the academics

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.180
there aren't afraid to go
into these fields, which

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.690
is important because, especially
in a field like semiconductors,

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:15.880
you need a lot of
technical expertise

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.843
even though it might
just be manufacturing.

00:54:17.843 --> 00:54:19.510
If you want to make
those improvements--

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.910
make them faster,
smaller, et cetera--

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:25.430
you have to be able to have that
background to innovate further.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:28.420
And I think that's why
a lot of these firms

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:32.290
have been having success, taking
that extra step beyond just

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:37.230
learning from the innovations
posed by other countries.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.535
And this might be a
little bit controversial,

00:54:39.535 --> 00:54:41.410
but I think the government
structure in China

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:44.460
also has had a big
role in why they're

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.810
able to make that
happen so quickly,

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:49.063
because they're able
to come up with an idea

00:54:49.063 --> 00:54:50.980
and turn it around really
quickly because it's

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:53.890
very integrated and
more unilateral, as

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.990
opposed to our structure here.

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:57.940
So if they have a
construction project,

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:01.800
like they want to make a bridge
happen, it'll happen in a year.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.925
In the US, it would probably
take like three years.

00:55:03.925 --> 00:55:04.270
AUDIENCE: At least.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:05.725
AUDIENCE: Or yeah, if that.

00:55:05.725 --> 00:55:07.840
And it might not even happen.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.630
AUDIENCE: Well, that's true.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.620
The directed focus
of a government

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.920
definitely has some advantages.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.900
Like, if you want something
done, it gets done.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.710
But on the other hand,
there are disadvantages too.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:20.120
Like, any disagreement,
and it might end up

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.800
being a bridge that points
upward for no reason.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.392
So then it's not
actually useful,

00:55:24.392 --> 00:55:26.850
even if, oh, yeah, we got it
done really quickly and really

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.160
under-budget, it
doesn't actually

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.014
solve the problem
as well as it could,

00:55:31.014 --> 00:55:33.195
whatever the problem might be.

00:55:33.195 --> 00:55:33.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.390
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Kevin, why don't we

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:36.310
lead you back into this.

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:37.990
How are you reacting
to these comments?

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:41.460
AUDIENCE: So not only with the
discussion with this paper,

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.580
but with other papers
we've been discussing

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:49.310
short versus long-term in
terms of what direction

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:52.860
the nation might head in,
in terms of innovation.

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:57.760
Speaking of short-term
now, what do people

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.430
feel the US's reaction would be?

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.930
[LAUGHS]

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:02.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.445
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:03.445 --> 00:56:04.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:08.760
Can we fast-forward maybe
like one slide, two slides?

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.200
Yeah, one more please.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.176
Mm-hmm.

00:56:12.176 --> 00:56:13.024
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:13.024 --> 00:56:13.524
There we go.

00:56:13.524 --> 00:56:14.230
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It's OK.

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:18.890
So I think there is an
opportunity here in this second

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:22.402
point with this partnership
of foreign [INAUDIBLE]----

00:56:22.402 --> 00:56:24.110
rather than kind of
walling ourselves off

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:26.527
in the short-term, if we can
kind of just accept that they

00:56:26.527 --> 00:56:28.813
have this--

00:56:28.813 --> 00:56:30.980
I don't even want to say
like a built-in advantage--

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.405
but they've actually constructed
a system that we've just

00:56:33.405 --> 00:56:35.990
learned is super effective.

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:38.792
And so rather than
kind of copying

00:56:38.792 --> 00:56:40.750
the Chinese model, which
will take structurally

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:43.421
a lot more time and might even
be impossible because we're

00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:46.000
so fragmented, or kind
of walling ourselves off,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.260
I think it just might be
important to just capture

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.940
on this partnership
of foreign design

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:53.320
and Chinese manufacturing,
and facilitate

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.052
that multidirectional learning.

00:56:55.052 --> 00:56:57.010
So hopefully some of the
trends will come back.

00:56:57.010 --> 00:56:59.340
But at the end of
the day, I think

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:02.580
if I sprout a mustache
and glasses and a tie,

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:03.556
will I say this is OK?

00:57:03.556 --> 00:57:04.056
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:04.056 --> 00:57:07.490
But you're going to
have to just look

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:10.630
towards what's the
next innovation wave

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.458
so that we can kind of
capitalize on those.

00:57:12.458 --> 00:57:14.500
And I hope that those that
don't all go to China.

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.060
Because I think
we've kind of already

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.198
lost the ball on
what they've done

00:57:18.198 --> 00:57:20.240
with backward design and
these network production

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.100
firms because of structure
and how they do things.

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:24.470
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: We'll
come back to that, Rasheed,

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.230
when we talk about these
advanced manufacturing

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.772
partnerships.

00:57:26.772 --> 00:57:30.010
AUDIENCE: I agree only
in small part with you

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:32.080
on that, because I think
we need to be really

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.500
careful in the short-term.

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:38.710
Because we do maintain
the capability of--

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:42.160
so for example, in this paper,
[INAUDIBLE] solar cells.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.120
We can do that in
the United States.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.550
Problem is, in China,
the Chinese government

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:47.700
is dumping subsidies.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:52.230
So yeah, that's marginally
legal or even illegal.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:55.500
But how long is it going
to take us to work that out

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.970
in an international court?

00:57:56.970 --> 00:58:00.624
So we need very much
forge ahead with--

00:58:00.624 --> 00:58:04.680
or protect what we
can still do here.

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:08.337
I agree with you, we
need to understand

00:58:08.337 --> 00:58:10.920
that there are some things that
China does better-- maybe even

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.240
adopt some of their practices.

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:18.390
But we need to protect what
we can still do, I think.

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:21.223
Because we don't want to
lose the entire solar market.

00:58:21.223 --> 00:58:22.890
And then they take
their subsidies away,

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:24.220
and we could have competed.

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.180
You know what I mean?

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:28.060
AUDIENCE: Two questions-- or
two things I wanted to bring up.

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.470
One, I didn't realize--

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.587
is it illegal to subsidize
your own industry?

00:58:31.587 --> 00:58:33.170
AUDIENCE: In a lot
of trade agreements

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:35.869
there are rules about
what you can do.

00:58:35.869 --> 00:58:37.528
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:37.528 --> 00:58:39.570
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: There
are anti-dumping rules.

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:42.580
In other words, can you
dump on a foreign market

00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.840
a good that's produced and
sold at less than its cost

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.510
to produce.

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:47.010
Right.

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:48.517
So that's where you
begin to run into issues.

00:58:48.517 --> 00:58:50.142
AUDIENCE: Because
then internationally,

00:58:50.142 --> 00:58:52.706
they're ruining the ability
of other countries to produce.

00:58:52.706 --> 00:58:55.628
And then when they take
those subsidies away,

00:58:55.628 --> 00:58:58.344
they're no longer
cheaper or better.

00:58:58.344 --> 00:59:00.011
AUDIENCE: They're
just the only options.

00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:01.480
AUDIENCE: They're just
the only [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.563
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:59:02.563 --> 00:59:04.230
But remember, too,
Lilly, that China

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:08.520
is selling its solar capability
into its own market because

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.880
of its own staggering
demand for power resources.

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.150
So this is not
entirely an attempt

00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:17.490
to capture world solar markets.

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:23.640
This is serving a pretty
strong need in its own power

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.320
development areas.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.650
AUDIENCE: Just a
[INAUDIBLE] point--

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:33.010
from the Chinese market
preference perspective,

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:35.370
there's this
mysterious preference

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:38.640
for foreign goods,
especially US-made products

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:42.160
over our made-in-China goods.

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.570
So I do see the US still
has this advantage.

00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:49.640
For example, if there's two
medicines for you to choose--

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:53.290
there is one made in China, and
there is one three times more

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:55.590
expensive but it's
made in the US--

00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:57.463
people who can afford
it, will just buy it,

00:59:57.463 --> 01:00:01.125
like without any reason.

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:02.750
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's fascinating.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:03.463
AUDIENCE: Is it?

01:00:03.463 --> 01:00:05.630
AUDIENCE: My counterpoint
is, it's that way for now.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.470
But there's a thing called the
"innovator's dilemma," which is

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.802
a common strategy in business.

01:00:08.802 --> 01:00:11.260
What you do, is you make the
product that isn't that great,

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.758
but it's cheaper.

01:00:12.758 --> 01:00:14.800
And then what happens is
you do that specifically

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.550
so your competitors
don't attack you.

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:20.040
It's the equivalent of, say
you're at a dinner table

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.540
and there's a person
who eats a lot.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.790
Right, he eats like 10 plates.

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.420
And there's somebody who eats
like one little appetizer.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.710
You don't mind that
eating the appetizer.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.293
So they focus on
industries or markets

01:00:28.293 --> 01:00:30.130
that the big player
can't attack.

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.130
And they slowly grow
their advantage.

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:35.460
There's a strategy that was
used by Japanese companies

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.220
with cars.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.477
They made the cheap car
that companies in the US

01:00:39.477 --> 01:00:41.310
wouldn't focus on until
they could make cars

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:42.510
that were much, much better.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:44.058
But it's a common strategy.

01:00:47.072 --> 01:00:48.030
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: OK.

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:51.280
So a closing thought,
Kevin, on this great debate

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.380
you've kicked off here?

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.300
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.419
AUDIENCE: Well,
these next four years

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:57.586
are going to be interesting.

01:00:57.586 --> 01:00:58.020
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah, OK.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:58.520
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.514
It's going to be
very interesting.

01:01:01.514 --> 01:01:02.470
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:04.095
I didn't [INAUDIBLE]
my second thought.

01:01:04.095 --> 01:01:05.345
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Feel free.

01:01:05.345 --> 01:01:07.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that happens.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.760
So I was thinking
back to the point

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.047
that Chris had pointed
out, that there

01:01:14.047 --> 01:01:15.630
are differences
between our government

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:16.870
and the Chinese government.

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:18.810
I think one of the
differences that comes in--

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:20.870
I'm not certain about
China's government.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:23.090
I don't know-- are
there term limits?

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:26.752
Are there limits built into
these governmental permissions

01:01:26.752 --> 01:01:30.468
that, say, force them to be
re-elected every so often?

01:01:30.468 --> 01:01:33.810
AUDIENCE: I think probably,
but it's longer, right.

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:35.902
AUDIENCE: It is
every four years.

01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:37.110
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's also four?

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:37.818
AUDIENCE: Really?

01:01:37.818 --> 01:01:38.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:39.152
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:01:39.152 --> 01:01:41.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
their policies [INAUDIBLE]??

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.938
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I don't
know much about it at all.

01:01:42.938 --> 01:01:43.234
AUDIENCE: Yeah, me neither.

01:01:43.234 --> 01:01:43.726
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:43.726 --> 01:01:45.202
AUDIENCE: It's not
really elected.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.678
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:46.678 --> 01:01:49.140
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:49.937
AUDIENCE: OK, OK.

01:01:49.937 --> 01:01:50.931
AUDIENCE: It's like [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:50.931 --> 01:01:52.306
AUDIENCE: So it's
a dictatorship.

01:01:52.306 --> 01:01:54.407
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:01:54.907 --> 01:01:55.910
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:56.180
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:56.930
AUDIENCE: Then that--

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.138
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Go ahead.

01:01:58.138 --> 01:02:00.606
AUDIENCE: --yeah-- my point
to that would be that, well,

01:02:00.606 --> 01:02:03.804
then the governmental officials
can think a lot more long-term.

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:10.160
Because the way that our current
electoral system is made,

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.197
at least representatives
have to think

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:14.280
like two years in advance.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.110
And that's basically the
most they can think of.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.443
They need to produce results
within that very short time

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:19.344
period.

01:02:19.344 --> 01:02:21.500
Senators, they have six years.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.770
A president, if he's
lucky, he gets eight.

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:30.410
So there's just a
different emphasis

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:33.275
on what the governments
are able to do

01:02:33.275 --> 01:02:35.450
and what they're
incentivized to do.

01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:38.610
So with that, if we
were to try to adopt

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:40.510
that kind of a
structure, we'd have

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:43.760
to make some radical
changes to the Constitution

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.660
and a lot of stuff.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.370
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.620
It's hard for democracies
to think longer term.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:58.250
So we're going to dive
into Suzanne Berger's work

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.830
on the "Production in the
Innovation Economy" study.

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:03.530
So we talked last
class about her work

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.540
on distributed production.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:10.250
And she led this big study
at MIT, the "PIE" study--

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.680
"Production in the
Innovation Economy."

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.940
Pulled together a whole faculty
group from a variety of fields

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:23.030
and ended up with this
in-depth, two-volume study

01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:25.550
of what had been happening
in US production.

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:29.870
And I think there's some
very important stories here.

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:33.770
I had you read the kind
of preliminary report.

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:37.650
The depth in the two volumes
is really quite powerful.

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:40.370
So if you want to read
further in this area,

01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:41.780
this is a great place to start.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:46.160
So Suzanne wrote the kind
of cover, overall view,

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.130
drawing on chapters that
particular faculty members

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:52.625
and researchers pulled
together in different segments.

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:54.500
And then she did that
kind of overview piece.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.950
The overview piece is one
of the most powerful books,

01:03:57.950 --> 01:04:01.610
in my view, that's been
written about US manufacturing.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:04.670
So well worth thinking about.

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:07.550
You're just getting a
kind of early snapshot,

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:11.390
frankly, from the preliminary
report I had you read.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.150
But I want to try and
pull out, frankly,

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:16.700
blending the preliminary
report with my knowledge

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:21.830
of the underlying
report some stories

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:26.630
that I think help us
understand what's been going on

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:29.720
in US manufacturing.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:34.220
And she tells a series
of these in her book.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.320
One story is that
manufacturing turns out

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.910
not to be agriculture.

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:40.160
And I'll explain
what in heaven's name

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.040
I'm talking about in a minute.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.550
Secondly, that our manufacturing
firms are increasingly,

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:50.660
as she puts it, "home alone,"
that small, mid-sized,

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.180
and startup firms are
having a lot of trouble

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.570
scaling up their
production in the US.

01:04:56.570 --> 01:05:01.610
A fourth story is about if you
want to keep strong innovation,

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:03.770
you need to think about
the link between innovation

01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:08.900
and production, which this
book argues is profound--

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:13.250
that there's a real link between
innovation and production.

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.860
There's deep workforce
training education issues.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.990
There's important
lessons from Germany.

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:23.030
And then there's some very
interesting jobs stories here,

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:24.053
too.

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:25.595
So let me try and
tell these quickly.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:31.100
First, manufacturing
is not agriculture.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:36.530
For a long time, the economists
thought that manufacturing

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:37.760
was agriculture.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.480
In other words, in 1900,
half the population--

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.030
not quite-- but half the
population was farming.

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:48.710
And now less than 2% of
the population is farming.

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:51.710
And we're producing
much, much more, right.

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:55.040
So it's a story of
staggering productivity gains

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.630
and advances.

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:59.780
But the MIT report takes
that argument apart.

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:01.400
So economists were
saying, oh, this

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.870
is just productivity gains.

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:05.100
We're just much more
efficient in production.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.610
So what if you lost one
third of your manufacturing

01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:10.280
jobs between 2000 and 2010?

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.180
No problem.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.400
Productivity gains, right.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.890
But then the story turns out
to be much more complicated.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.850
We thought that manufacturing
output was holding firm.

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:27.780
But it turns out that
it wasn't, right.

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:31.500
So we thought we were producing
the same with less labor.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.800
But it wasn't the case.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:39.120
In fact, in 15 of 19 industrial
sectors, we had output decline.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.870
And our official statistics
overestimated output

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:49.890
because we adopted a view of
computing and IT technologies

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:55.030
that assumed the components,
for definitional reasons,

01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:56.515
were because the United States.

01:06:56.515 --> 01:06:58.030
But they weren't, right.

01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:02.500
That's the Willy Shih,
Gary Pisano story, right.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.560
So we were completely
inflating our numbers.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.720
And output wasn't what
we thought it was.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.890
So if output, which is obviously
half the story of productivity,

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:18.160
is not what you thought it was,
then the productivity numbers

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.070
were considerably lower
than mainstream economics

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:22.063
had been telling us.

01:07:22.063 --> 01:07:23.980
It's not that there
weren't productivity gains

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.040
in that period.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.140
There were.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.240
But they weren't what
we thought they were.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.810
So instead, the job loss
numbers really tells us

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:38.170
the sector is hollowing out,
not getting more productive.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:42.070
So a second story--

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:45.080
what Suzanne calls the
"home alone" story.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.190
So she tells a story that,
for the last several decades,

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:52.930
we've been thinning out in the
US our manufacturing sector.

01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:55.930
We used to have firms
and supply chains that

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:58.070
had to be very
vertically integrated.

01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:01.870
This is the story we told last
week about LEGOs and model

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.180
airplanes, right.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.970
We hit on a financial model.

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:09.280
And Martin, you had been
pointing some of this out.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.300
We hit on a financial model that
emphasized quarterly returns,

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:18.430
which led us to want to reduce
interim risk, which led us

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.729
in the financial sector
to focus on getting firms

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:24.819
to nurture their
core competency,

01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:27.010
not do a lot of other stuff.

01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:31.850
So therefore, they should go
what's called "asset light."

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:34.840
Strip the firm of
assets that are not

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.800
part of its core competency.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.300
Right.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:41.830
So we began to thin out what
had been these very vertically

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:46.149
integrated groups of firms.

01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:52.859
So the companies in the system
are now much more "home alone."

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:55.770
Story number 3 is related.

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:58.109
This is the scale-up problem.

01:08:58.109 --> 01:09:02.250
So the US is home to
a large percentage

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:04.140
of the world's multinationals.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.069
They're global.

01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:06.779
They can get
production efficiencies

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:09.540
by producing in
lower-cost countries.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.558
And they need to be
in global markets.

01:09:11.558 --> 01:09:12.850
They don't have an option here.

01:09:12.850 --> 01:09:15.990
They need to be worldwide.

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:18.930
Generally speaking, they're OK.

01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:22.229
They're producing more abroad
than they did in the past.

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:24.870
But there's two much
more vulnerable sectors.

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:28.079
So one of those sectors
are what we could call,

01:09:28.079 --> 01:09:31.529
and what the book calls,
"Main Street firms."

01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:36.000
So these are the small
and mid-sized firms.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.620
So there are between 250,000
and 300,000-- let's call

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.960
the 250,000 of these
small and mid-sized firms

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.569
that employ less
than 500 people.

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:47.760
That is most of the
manufacturing sector, that's

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.090
a majority of US production.

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:54.510
They have trouble
getting scale-up funding.

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:56.970
They are thinly capitalized.

01:09:56.970 --> 01:10:00.330
They have to be risk
averse to survive.

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:06.400
They don't do what we would
consider R&D, although they

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.330
can be very innovative in
modifying products and changing

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:11.150
processes.

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:13.930
But they don't do
what we would consider

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:17.110
innovation-based research.

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:23.920
So they're kind of outside
of the US innovation system.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.870
And there are a lot of them.

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:28.000
It's a big part of this.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.650
For them to innovate,
they have to have

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:33.330
access to ideas, which they
don't necessarily have,

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:35.740
and a thinned-out ecosystem.

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:39.370
And they've got to have
the financing to scale up.

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:42.430
Part of the Production in
the Innovation Economy study

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:48.100
was led by John Reed, who
was head of the MIT Executive

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.360
Committee and former
chairman of Citicorp--

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.620
a brilliant, famous
banker, who created

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.830
a lot of the amazing
Citicorp model.

01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:59.170
John Reed was part of
these deliberations.

01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:05.410
And he said, yes, we ended local
banking in the United States.

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:09.040
That was the historic era where
your neighborhood banker would

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:15.340
know, in your city or town,
who the quality producers were

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.380
and know who to lend to.

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:18.460
That's gone.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:23.170
We substituted really
national and then

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:25.330
international financing models.

01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:28.660
And we replaced that
face-to-face, kind

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:34.090
of relationship-based banking
to a very significant extent.

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:35.830
The Main Street firms
were dramatically

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:39.400
affected by their ability
to get scale-up money out

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.670
of their banking system.

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:42.835
Right, it really hit them.

01:11:42.835 --> 01:11:44.710
And there isn't really
a substitute for them.

01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:47.085
And then meanwhile-- and we'll
talk about this more later

01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:49.240
in class--

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.010
the other
manufacturing community

01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:53.560
is entrepreneurial
startups that want

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.930
to make something-- that want
to make a hard technology.

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:01.020
Unfortunately, the
venture capital system

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:04.700
has walked from this territory.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.360
So venture capital at this point
in the US funds predominantly

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.180
software, secondarily
biotech, then

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.940
a series of service sectors like
media entertainment business

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.490
services.

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:20.060
They're not funding firms
that want to make something,

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.430
that have hard technologies.

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:26.127
So the implications of this
are really quite powerful.

01:12:26.127 --> 01:12:28.460
That's part of the reason why
Rafael Reif put The Engine

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.560
together down the
street, because a lot

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.900
of MIT-developed hard technology
was just not getting out.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.670
We had to have a different
way to stand them up.

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:40.810
But this is where the next
generation of manufacturing

01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:41.540
will come from.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.790
This is what the next
generation of manufactured goods

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:45.230
will come from.

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:47.080
And we're not doing it.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:47.760
Right.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.900
Big-time societal
implications here.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:57.995
So there's a big scale-up
problem for these two, right.

01:12:57.995 --> 01:13:00.120
How are you going to scale
up innovative production

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.982
and innovative technologies?

01:13:01.982 --> 01:13:03.940
We're in trouble to the
extent we rely on them.

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:06.530
We rely on them a lot.

01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:10.470
This is just a chart that
shows who does the R&D.

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:15.330
So large companies do R&D.
Small companies don't.

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:15.830
Right.

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.288
So the small
companies are just not

01:13:17.288 --> 01:13:18.590
part of the innovation system.

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.440
Story 4-- the relationship
between innovation

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.330
and production.

01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:31.260
So what's wrong with
scaling up abroad?

01:13:35.705 --> 01:13:38.780
The issue is that for most
products-- not all products--

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.050
and it looks like there's a lot
of exceptions in the IT area--

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:44.180
but for most products,
you need your innovation

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.820
pretty closely
related, particularly

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.950
to your initial
production stage.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:53.030
In other words, there's
a lot of interchange

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:54.320
as you design for production.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.740
You take your idea, and you
design it for production.

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:57.768
Right.

01:13:57.768 --> 01:13:59.060
That's a very creative process.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.860
Lots of engineering.

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.400
You often have to rethink
your basic science.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.875
So if you're shifting your
production capability abroad--

01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:13.850
and this is the most important
conclusion of the PIE study--

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:16.280
you're starting to affect
your innovation capability.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.440
So the US has thought that its
competitive advantage, really

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.340
since the end of World War
II, is in a strong innovation

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:25.550
system.

01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:27.640
But if it's shifting
production--

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.370
particularly
initial production--

01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:35.470
it's losing that interaction
between initial production

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:39.460
and its innovation capability.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:43.570
So a fifth story
is, how do you begin

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:44.890
to wrestle with these issues?

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:47.480
They looked hard at workforce.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.470
So there's lots of
workforce studies out.

01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:52.240
And they consist
of CEOs saying, we

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.310
don't have enough
skilled workers.

01:14:55.310 --> 01:15:01.740
And the MIT approach, led
by Paul Osterman, a faculty

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:07.890
member at Sloan, said, look,
let's not ask the CEOs, right.

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:12.670
The CEOs may be saying
there's a tremendous shortage

01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:16.030
of $10,000 Cadillacs, right.

01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:18.307
That may be what they're,
in effect, saying.

01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:20.140
In other words, what
they're prepared to pay

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:23.995
for skills is not an appropriate
compensation for the skills.

01:15:23.995 --> 01:15:25.660
It doesn't match markets.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.560
So let's actually ask the
human resources departments.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.050
And let's not ask them, are
you short of skilled workers?

01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:35.260
Let's ask them, how
long did it take

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:39.430
you to hire for positions that
have come up in your firm?

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:43.660
And what they found was that
75% of the firms studied--

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:45.740
and they reached
way over 1,000--

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.530
I think was several thousand--

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:51.170
they were able to
hire within one month.

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:52.190
Now, that's logical.

01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:55.400
Because, after all, we just laid
off almost 6 million production

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.310
workers, right.

01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:59.830
And they've been largely shunted
into the lower end service

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:01.012
sectors.

01:16:01.012 --> 01:16:02.470
Maybe they would
want to come back.

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:07.150
So presumably, there's a
surplus of capability out there.

01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:14.760
But the most interesting
part of what they found

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.210
was that for 25% of
the firms, they weren't

01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:20.010
able to hire in a month.

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:21.780
It was taking them a lot longer.

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:25.620
And interestingly, these
tended to be the smaller,

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:32.550
more innovative,
technology-focused firms.

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:34.710
And they were having a
much harder time, actually,

01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:37.530
because they needed a higher
skill raft of workers.

01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:41.220
They are having a lot of trouble
hiring in a reasonable time

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.180
frame.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.930
So Paul Osterman would
summarize saying,

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:47.670
there's not an
immediate emergency here

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:49.470
on workforce skills.

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:51.210
But we're going to
have trouble ahead.

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:56.970
And the signal is the 25%
of more innovative firms

01:16:56.970 --> 01:16:59.310
that are having more trouble
getting the skill sets

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:01.170
that they needed.

01:17:01.170 --> 01:17:04.260
And look, we've got a
big demographics problem.

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:08.200
So the manufacturing workforce
is an aging workforce.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.860
And it's going to
need replacing.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.620
Sixth story-- and there's only
one more to go after this--

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:17.720
what can we learn from Germany?

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.980
So the US has been sitting
around for at least a decade--

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:22.390
more like 20 years--

01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:27.650
thinking, oh, we have to
lose manufacturing jobs,

01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:29.840
because we're high
wage and high cost.

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.330
So we have to lose these jobs.

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:35.360
Somebody never sent
that memo to Germany.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.820
They failed to get
that word, right.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.983
Because Germany is much
higher wage and higher

01:17:39.983 --> 01:17:41.150
cost than the United States.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:45.080
Their wages and benefits are 66%
higher for their manufacturing

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.050
workers than for US
manufacturing workers.

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:51.950
And they are running staggering
trade surpluses with everybody,

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:54.590
including a major trade
surplus with Germany--

01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:56.960
I mean with China, excuse me.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.280
What are they doing?

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.140
They're supposed to
lose this sector,

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.880
right, according
to our thinking.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:03.420
But they didn't.

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:08.000
So the US has about 8% of its
workforce in production jobs.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.860
Germany, 20%.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.390
What are they doing?

01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:13.230
Right.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:17.340
This is an important
set of lessons here.

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:20.640
How has Germany organized
its manufacturing sector

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.260
so that it's able to run
an extremely successful

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:26.850
manufacturing sector
that continues

01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:29.883
to bring major returns
back to its economy,

01:18:29.883 --> 01:18:31.800
even though it's very
high wage and high cost?

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.100
What are they doing?

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.230
Right.

01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:40.020
So there may be important
lessons for us to learn.

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.680
And the PIE study, in fact,
went through a number of these.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.400
They found that, unlike the
US, which was thinning out its

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.470
ecosystem for its manufacturers,
that its small and mid-sized

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:55.110
manufacturers, in particular,
were more "home alone,"

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:57.330
Germany was doing the opposite--

01:18:57.330 --> 01:19:00.190
a much more connected,
collaborative system,

01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:04.317
right-- in part through a
Fraunhofer network system that,

01:19:04.317 --> 01:19:06.900
starting at the end of World War
II and partially, by the way,

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:10.140
paid for by the
Marshall Plan by the US,

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:13.242
brought large and small
and mid-sized firms.

01:19:13.242 --> 01:19:14.950
In Germany, the small
and mid-sized firms

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:16.440
are called Mittelstand.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.010
And it's a famous German
capability, these very talented

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:22.490
small and mid-sized firms.

01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:24.150
They were able to
bring them together

01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:29.460
in collaborations around new
innovations in production.

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:33.480
And they would work together,
assisted by German engineering

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.880
academics in the process.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.170
They have 60 of these
Fraunhofer institutes,

01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:44.130
really manufacturing institutes,
spread all over the country.

01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:48.450
So they have a way of avoiding
the "home alone" problem.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.220
If anything, they're
ever enriching

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.080
the collaboration
between their firms

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.205
and the trade-off of ideas.

01:19:55.830 --> 01:20:00.945
They have a whole system
for collaborative R&D

01:20:00.945 --> 01:20:03.070
that's shared between the
small and mid-sized firms

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:04.420
and the larger firms.

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:08.560
Through that system, they
have the most famous workforce

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.480
training system in
the world, through

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.700
a remarkable
apprenticeship system

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.520
that consistently
produces incredibly highly

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.980
skilled workers.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.450
And the apprenticeships
will last

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:21.910
for three or four years, right.

01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:23.437
Really in-depth training.

01:20:23.437 --> 01:20:24.520
We have nothing like that.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.660
We have highly
decentralized labor markets

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.610
in the United States.

01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:30.370
We have nothing close to this.

01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:32.050
So they have a whole
shared training

01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:34.540
system for their workforce.

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:36.850
And they've developed
ways through

01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:39.280
these collaborative
mechanisms to rapidly scale up

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.630
their production.

01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:47.720
So Germany's workforce in
manufacturing is 80% unionized.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.170
We're not remotely
close to that.

01:20:50.170 --> 01:20:51.695
It's a different system.

01:20:51.695 --> 01:20:54.070
It's hard for the US to do an
apprenticeship system here.

01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:57.370
It doesn't quite match the
way we organize things.

01:20:57.370 --> 01:21:02.260
But there are some ideas
that we could learn from.

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:06.170
And the seventh and last
story is about jobs.

01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:12.340
The manufacturing sector
affects our services sector.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:21.220
And Suzanne Berger and the team
tell an interesting story here,

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:25.470
that the 21st
century firm, right,

01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:30.390
is going to increasingly
tie a complex hard product

01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:34.650
to a service and link
them, and offer customers

01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:38.880
solutions-- not a
good or a service,

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.050
but a solution to a problem.

01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:44.310
So your Apple
iPhone, in many ways,

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:49.410
is a combined service delivery
hardware technology, right.

01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:52.130
There's lots of service delivery
through that Apple iPhone,

01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:53.280
right.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.630
Things are going to be more
like that in the future.

01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:03.660
Now, personal services
tend to be face-to-face.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:08.020
And they're hard to
scale up quickly, right.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.240
It's their kind of one-to-one
relationship building.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.940
And that process
takes a long time.

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:16.000
Whereas if you're producing
a manufactured good,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.550
you can produce one
product on day 1.

01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:22.760
On day 12, you can produce
a million products, right.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.190
You can scale very quickly--

01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:27.170
much faster than through a
personal service operation,

01:22:27.170 --> 01:22:27.670
right.

01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:29.980
So one advantage
of manufacturing

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:33.220
is that it tends to scale
up the gains in your economy

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.997
much more quickly.

01:22:34.997 --> 01:22:36.580
Part of the reason
why it took so long

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:40.570
to recover from the
2007, 2008 recession

01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:43.450
is that we had so damaged
our manufacturing sector

01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:47.140
that the normal scale-up
coming out of a recession just

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:47.860
wasn't happening.

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:48.777
It was taking forever.

01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:56.820
But if you're able to combine
a tradable good, right, that

01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:03.600
can scale with a
service, then the service

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.710
starts to become
tradable as well, right--

01:23:07.710 --> 01:23:09.780
and can scale.

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.850
So that's a whole new
capability in services

01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:14.670
that we haven't really spent
a lot of time thinking about.

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:17.950
But it's very interesting,
since 86% of our workforce

01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:20.022
is in services.

01:23:20.022 --> 01:23:21.730
Maybe we ought to work
on this territory.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:24.870
But a prerequisite is
having the tradable goods

01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:28.020
that you can tie to
a service, right.

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:32.220
Yet another reason why, in
the next generation of firms,

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:37.300
manufacturing capability
is going to be important.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:38.800
You saw this chart before.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.590
This shows you where societal
returns come from, right.

01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:46.950
Predominantly from
production, not from services.

01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:49.410
So let me just summarize.

01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:53.550
Here's the stories that Suzanne
and the PIE study taught us.

01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:55.960
Manufacturing is
not agriculture.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.510
This sector was hollowing out.

01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:01.350
It wasn't enjoying productivity
advances to the extent

01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:02.620
we thought possible.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.190
Our manufacturing firms are
increasingly "home alone."

01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:08.160
Their ecosystems of
support are thinned out.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.690
There's less of what Pisano
and Shih called a "commons"

01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.610
available to support them.

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:17.895
There's a real scale-up problem
for small, mid-sized firms,

01:24:17.895 --> 01:24:20.145
and for startup firms, for
somewhat different reasons.

01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:26.640
There's important linkage
between innovation

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.120
and production.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.340
These are very related
and tied to each other.

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.680
And if you lose one,
it'll affect the other.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.250
There's interesting
lessons about workforce,

01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:40.850
that we've got a problem ahead
in up-scaling our workforce.

01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:42.600
It's not an emergency
now, but we probably

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.550
have a problem ahead.

01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:46.840
Very important
lessons from Germany

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.760
on the societal benefits of
a strong production sector.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:53.070
And then, in this
jobs area, if you're

01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:57.330
able to tie tradable
goods to services,

01:24:57.330 --> 01:25:00.780
then the services themselves
become tradable and scalable,

01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:02.290
as well.

01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:05.680
And then, there's an
underlying question

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.020
about how our manufacturing
sector, therefore,

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.700
affects our services sector.

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:13.263
So let's come back and do
some questions about this.

01:25:13.263 --> 01:25:15.430
And then we'll dive into
the next round of readings.

01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:17.970
And Steph will lead us in those.

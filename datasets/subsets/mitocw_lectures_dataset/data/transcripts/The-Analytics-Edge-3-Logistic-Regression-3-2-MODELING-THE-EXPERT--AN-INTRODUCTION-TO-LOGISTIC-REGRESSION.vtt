00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.120
In this lecture, we'll
examine how analytics

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.970
can model an expert, in
this case a physician,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.730
in the context of assessing the
quality of healthcare patients

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.010
receive, and introduce
a technique called

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.750
logistic regression to
achieve this objective.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.420
From the early
2000s, I was a member

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.360
of the board of a company
called D2Hawkeye, a medical data

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.990
mining company.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.400
The company received
claims data.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.480
These are data
that are generated

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.370
when an insured patient
goes to a medical provider

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.730
to receive a
diagnosis or to have

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
a procedure, for example an
x-ray, or to obtain drugs.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.920
The medical providers
need to get compensated,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.560
so the claims data provide
the means for them to be paid.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.010
An important question
is whether we

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.170
can assess the quality of health
care given this claims data.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920
But let's first
ask why assessing

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.560
the quality of healthcare
is an important objective.

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.450
If one identifies patients
that have low quality care,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.580
one can intervene and improve
outcomes for these patients.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.740
Moreover, assessing
quality correctly

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100
can control costs better.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.789
However, defining quality is a
complex, not well-defined task.

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.400
For example, consider
what is involved

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.470
when we talk about
the quality of a book.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.380
It is not a well-defined,
algorithmically understood task

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.660
of defining such a quality.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.400
Currently, assessing
quality is done

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.070
by physicians who are experts
in the health space using

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.290
their knowledge, their
expertise, and their intuition.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.020
So how do physicians
assess quality?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.870
Physicians are,
of course, humans

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.310
who are limited by
memory and time.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.730
They typically evaluate
quality by examining

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.960
a patient's records,
a time consuming

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.480
and inefficient process.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.970
Clearly, physicians cannot
assess quality for millions

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.160
of patients, and
D2Hawkeye had, indeed,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:57.270
millions of patients who receive
claims data on a monthly basis

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.280
that the quality of them
needs to be assessed.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.580
So the key question
is as follows.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.480
Can we develop analytics
tools that replicate expert

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.790
assessment on a large scale?

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.810
The goal is to learn from
expert human judgment

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.240
by developing a model, interpret
the results of the model,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.300
and further adjust the model
to improve predictability.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.850
The objective is to make
predictions and evaluations

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.380
on a large scale basis, to
be able to process millions

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.840
of assessing the health care
quality for millions of people.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.100
So the lecture is a
story of using analytics

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:59.090
in identifying poor quality
care using claims data.

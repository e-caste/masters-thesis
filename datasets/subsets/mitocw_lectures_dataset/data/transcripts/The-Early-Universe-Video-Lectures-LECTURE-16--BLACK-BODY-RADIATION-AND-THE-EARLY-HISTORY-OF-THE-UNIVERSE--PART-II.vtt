00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.790
PROFESSOR: OK, in that
case, let's get started.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.650
As usual, I like
to begin by giving

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.040
a review of what we
talked about last time.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.722
This time on slides instead
of on the blackboard.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.680
We're talking mainly
about relativistic energy,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.500
or relativistic energy and
momentum, and pressure,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.940
sometimes.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.440
The key equation is probably
the most famous equation

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.220
in physics, Einstein's
e equals m c squared.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.967
And I gave some
numerical examples.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.050
I actually looked up some
more numbers since then,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.037
when I was revising
the lecture notes.

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:55.620
So these are slightly
more up to date.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.340
But it's still true that
if you could burn matter

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.840
at the rate of one
kilogram per hour,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.290
you would have about
one and a half times

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.640
the total power
output of the world.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.710
And that's apparently
still valid in 2011.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.620
I only had 2008 figures,
actually, at the lecture

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.950
last time.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.552
And if you imagine the
15-gallon tank of gasoline,

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:21.010
and you could figure out how
much that-- what it's mass is,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.430
and convert that to
energy, it turns out

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.080
that a 15-gallon
tank of gasoline

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.570
could power the world for about
two and half days, if you could

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.130
convert all of it into energy.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.330
The catch, of course, is
that we can't convert matter

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.710
into energy.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.930
We can't get around the problem
that, at least at the energies

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.600
that we deal with,
baryon number.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.280
And that number of protons
and neutrons is conserved,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.600
so we can't make protons
and neutrons disappear.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.760
And that means that we're
limited in what we can do.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.530
In particular, one of the most
efficient things we can do

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.380
is fission uranium 235.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.170
But when uranium 235 undergoes
fission, less than 1/10

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.100
of 1% of the mass is
actually converted

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.580
into energy, which is why we
can't actually avail ourselves

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.340
of these fantastic
numbers that would apply,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.690
if we could literally just
convert matter into energy.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.037
We went on to talk about
the relativistic definitions

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:22.120
of energy and momentum,
and how they come together

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.190
to form a Lorentz four vector,
and the underlying theme here

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.580
is that we consider ourselves
users of special relativity.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.720
Most of you I know have taken
special relativity courses,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.370
and for those of you who
have, this is a review.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.820
For those you who have not,
and there are some of those

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.070
also, no need to panic.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.700
I intend to tell you
every fact that you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.740
need to know about
special relativity.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.110
I won't tell you how
to derive them all,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.890
but I'll tell you all you'll
need to know for this class.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.830
So in particular, it's
useful for this class

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.780
to recognize that energy and
momentum can be put together

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.850
into a four vector, where
the zeroth component

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.450
is the energy divided
by the speed of light.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.590
And the three spatial components
are just the three components

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.490
of the spatial
momentum, although they

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.400
have to be defined
relativistically.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.360
The relativistic
definition of momentum,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.430
at least how it
relates to velocity,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.440
is that it's equal to
gamma times the rest

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.459
mass times the velocity, where
gamma is the famous factor

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.000
that we've been
seeing all along when

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.080
we've talked about relativity.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.360
The Lorentz
contraction factor, one

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.180
over the square root of 1
minus v squared over c squared.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.080
The energy of a particle,
relativistically,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.750
is the same gamma, times m
0 times c squared, and it

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.370
can also be written as
the square root of m 0

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.970
c squared squared, plus
the momentum squared,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.090
times c squared.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.360
Since the momentum
forms a four vector,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.780
its Lorentz and variant square
should be Lorentz and variant,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.970
and that means that
the momentum squared

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.300
minus p 0 squared should be the
same in all inertial reference

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.650
frames.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.230
And that's just
equal when you put

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.600
in what p 0 means,
the momentum squared

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.530
minus the energy squared,
divided by c 0 squared.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.030
And to know what value it's
equal to in all frames,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.564
it's efficient to know what
it's equal to in one frame.

00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:19.980
And the one frame
where we do know

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.870
what it's equal to is the
rest frame of a particle.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.160
So in the rest frame,
the momentum vanishes,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.039
and the energy is
just m 0 c squared.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.830
So in the rest frame,
we can evaluate this,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.310
and we get minus m
0 c squared squared.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.880
And that means that has to
be the value in every frame.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.280
And this in fact is
the easy way to derive

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.450
the relationship between
energy and momentum.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.310
If we go back, the
equation we had

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.210
relating energy and momentum is
really exactly that equation,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.710
rearranged.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.490
Just to give an example of how
this works, when we actually

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.040
have energy exchanges,
I pointed out

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.900
that we could talk about the
energy of a hydrogen atom.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.250
And because energy and
mass are equivalent,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.550
the hydrogen atom clearly
has a little bit less energy

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.020
than an isolated proton,
plus an isolated electron.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.520
Because when you
bring them together

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.880
there's a binding energy,
and that binding energy

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.350
is called delta e, and has
a value of 13.6 electron

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.290
volts for the ground
state of hydrogen.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.290
So that tells us the
mass of an hydrogen atom

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.130
is not the sum of
the two masses,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.150
but rather has this
correction factor,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.564
because we've taken out a little
bit of energy for the binding.

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.730
And that means we've taken
out a little bit of mass.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.125
OK, then we talked about the
mass density of radiation

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:46.040
and how-- building up to how
that will affect the universe.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.280
And we said that the
mass density of radiation

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.710
is just the energy density
divided by c squared.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.240
And that can be taken, really,
as a definition of what

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.040
we call relativistic
mass, and hence

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.070
relativistic mass density.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.750
But the important point is
that this mass density actually

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.590
does gravitate the
same as any other mass

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.380
density of the same value.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.490
It really does create
gravity in the same way.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.390
Now I mentioned that things are
much more complicated if you

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.580
want to talk about the
gravitational field produced

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.520
by a single moving particle.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.990
That's asymmetric, the
velocity of the particle

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.720
shows up in the equations that
describe the metric surrounding

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.570
a single moving particle.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.280
But if you have a gas
of particles moving

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.270
at high velocities, where
the velocities nonetheless

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.850
average to zero, which
tends to happen, in a gas

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.290
at least in the rest
frame of the gas.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.810
Then that gas will produce
gravitational fields,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.650
just like a static mass density.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.430
Where the mass density is this
relativistic energy divided

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.010
by c squared, the relativistic
definition of the mass density.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.260
It's also useful to know
that the photon-- if we want

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.280
to describe it as a particle,
is a particle of zero rest mass.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.430
Which means that it
can never be at rest,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.350
it always moves at
the speed of light.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.030
And it also means that its
energy can be arbitrarily

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.970
small, because the energy
is proportional of momentum,

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.049
and the momentum of a photon
can be as small as you like.

00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:26.340
For giving frequency, of
course, the energy of a photon

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.570
is fixed.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.820
It's h times nu but
if you're allowed

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.270
to vary the frequency,
which you can do if you just

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.450
look at it in
different frames, you

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.710
can make the energy
as small as you like.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.099
And the famous equation
then, p squared minus e

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:44.140
squared c squared, which
would have on the right,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.370
minus m 0 squared
c to the 4th m 0

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.280
squared c squared, excuse me--
has zero on the right hand

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.070
side, because m 0
is 0 And that means

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.230
that for photons, the energy is
just the speed of light times

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.220
the momentum.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.790
And that's a famous
relationship that photons obey.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.310
Now, thinking about
how this gas of photons

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:15.400
will behave in the universe,
we realized immediately

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.360
that it does not
behave the same way

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.760
as a mass density of ordinary
non-relativistic particles.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.202
Which is what we have
been dealing with to date.

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:27.180
The important difference
is that in both cases,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.370
the number density falls
off like 1 over a cubed,

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.190
as the universe expands,
these particles are not

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.159
created and destroyed
in significant numbers,

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.700
they just persevere.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.690
So the number density of either
non-relativistic particles,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.470
or photons, just falls off
like one over the volume,

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.950
as the volume increases and
the number density dilutes.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.380
But what makes photons
different from non-relativistic

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.350
particles, is that a
non-relativistic particle

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.650
will maintain the
energy of that particle

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.200
as the universe
expands, but photons

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.350
will redshift as the
universe expands.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.200
So each photon will
itself lose energy.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.070
And it loses energy proportional
to one over the scale factor.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.820
And that's just because the
frequency shift proportionally

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.220
to the scale factor.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.390
And that means that
the energy per photon

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.720
shifts, because
quantum mechanically

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.710
we know that the
energy of a photon

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.920
is proportional
to its frequency.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.000
So if the frequency
redshifts so must the energy.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.250
In exactly the same
way, 1 over a f t.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.416
Yes, question?

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:34.890
AUDIENCE: You said
previously that neutrinos

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.730
behave like radiation
in the sense

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.810
that theta energy
falls is 1 over a.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.472
What is it about them
that makes this happen?

00:09:43.472 --> 00:09:47.452
Because there are also particles
with standard kinetic energy,

00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:48.077
right?

00:09:48.077 --> 00:09:50.410
PROFESSOR: OK, the question,
in case you didn't hear it,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.100
is why-- how did
neutrinos fit in here?

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.520
I've made the claim that
neutrinos act like radiation

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.820
in the early universe, but
neutrinos have a non-zero mass,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.630
so they should obey the
standard formulas for particles

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.440
with nonzero masses.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.590
The answer to that
is-- there is,

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.730
I think, a simple answer,
which is that as long

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.760
as the energy is large
compared to the mass,

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.480
particles with masses will still
act like massless particles.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.430
It doesn't really matter
if the mass is zero or not,

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.979
the key thing, really,
is this equation.

00:10:23.979 --> 00:10:25.520
So if the term on
the right hand side

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.270
is small compared to either
of the two on the left,

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.360
it's not much different
from being zero.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.120
And that's what
happens for neutrinos

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.740
in the early universe.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.470
And we'll see soon that if
you go to early enough times,

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.300
it's true even for
electron-positron pairs.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.960
They will also act
like radiation.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.930
Any particle will
act like radiation

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.390
as long as the energy is large
compared to the rest energy.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.530
So getting back
to the discussion

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.340
of the early universe, if
the energy of each photon

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.396
falls off like one
over the scale factor,

00:10:59.396 --> 00:11:02.020
and the number density falls off
like one over the scale factor

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.315
cubed, it means that
the energy density,

00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:07.580
and hence, the mass
density of radiation

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.540
will fall off like one
over a to the fourth,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.270
in contrast to the one over
a cubed, that we found when

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.015
we were talking about
non-relativistic matter.

00:11:17.015 --> 00:11:19.140
And that, of course, is
going to make a difference.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.119
Because those issues play a
key role in our discussions

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:24.410
about how the universe evolved.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.400
An important feature,
which we see immediately,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.760
is that if we extrapolate
backwards in time,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.050
since the radiation mass density
is falling off like one over a

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.980
to the fourth, and the
matter density is falling off

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.960
like one over a cubed, it means
that as you go back in time,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.990
the radiation becomes
more and more important

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:52.020
relative to the matter, by
factor of the scale factor.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.190
So if we go back far
enough, we will even

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.910
find a time when the
mass density in radiation

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.700
equaled the mass density
in non-relativistic matter.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.490
And we calculated about
when that would be.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.030
We said that the energy
density in radiation today

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.650
is given by this number, 7
times 10 to the minus 14,

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.737
joules per meter cubed.

00:12:12.737 --> 00:12:15.070
And I just gave you this
number, I didn't derive it yet.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.800
We will derive it,
probably later today.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.010
But for now, we're
just accepting it.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.310
And that implies
we can calculate

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.060
from that the ratio
of the mass densities

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.800
in radiation and
ordinary matter.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.520
Here, we use the fact
that ordinary matter

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.750
can be described
by having an omega

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.697
ratio to the critical
density of about 0.3.

00:12:34.697 --> 00:12:36.780
And we know how to calculate
the critical density,

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.420
and that allowed us to calculate
the density of ordinary matter.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.160
And then this ratio turned
out to be 3.1 times 10

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.980
to the minus four.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.740
So radiation in
today's universe is

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.000
almost negligible
in its contribution

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.220
to the overall energy
balance, compared

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.910
to non-relativistic matter.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.730
But if you
extrapolate backwards,

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.800
we know that this ratio will
vary as one over the scale

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.837
factor.

00:13:02.837 --> 00:13:04.420
And we could figure
out what constants

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.890
to put this equation by
putting in the right constant,

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.630
so that this equation gives
us the right value today.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.586
Where the right value today is
3.1 times 10 to the minus four.

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:15.960
And notice that
this works, if we

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.860
let t be equal to t sub
zero, this factors one

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.020
and we get 3.1 times
10 to the minus four.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.200
So these two factors
together they

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.860
have t zero and the 3.1
times 10 to the minus four,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.890
are just the right
factors to put in

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.110
to give us the right
constant of proportionality

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.516
in that equation.

00:13:34.516 --> 00:13:35.890
Having this
equation, we can then

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.180
ask, how far back do we
have to go, how much we have

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.610
to change t, for
the ratio to be one?

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.110
And that's a
straightforward calculation.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.490
And the ratio of the a is
then just one over 3.1 times

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.154
10 to the minus four, or 3,200.

00:13:54.154 --> 00:13:56.320
So if we talk about it in
terms of a redshift, which

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.240
is how astronomers always talk
about distances, or times,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.710
we're talking about going
back to a redshift of 3,200.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.420
We can figure out what time,
then, corresponds to also,

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.160
if we know how a f
t depends on time.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.100
And we do, approximately.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.260
For this calculation,
I assume for now, we

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.316
could do better
later, and we will--

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.940
but I assume for now
that we could just

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:25.285
treat the period between matter
radiation equality, so-called t

00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:29.000
x and now as being
entirely described

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.989
by a matter-dominated universe.

00:14:30.989 --> 00:14:32.405
That's only a crude
approximation,

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:34.930
but it will get us the
right order of magnitude.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:39.000
And we'll learn how to do
better later in the course.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.930
So if we assume that, then t x
is just this number to the 3/2

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.550
power, cancelling the 2/3, times
the age of universe, t naught.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:52.110
And that turned out to
be about 75,000 years.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.280
So somewhere in the range of
100,000 years, 50,000 years,

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.790
is the time in the history of
the universe when radiation

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.340
ceased to be more
important than matter.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.490
And for earlier times than
that, the radiation dominated.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.910
And that's what we refer to as
the radiation dominated era.

00:15:18.727 --> 00:15:19.310
Any questions?

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.775
OK, now I think we get
on to what is really

00:15:26.775 --> 00:15:30.440
the important subject that
we want to understand,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.440
and most of this you did
yourself on the homework.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.914
But I'll summarize
the argument here.

00:15:35.914 --> 00:15:37.580
We want to understand
what this tells us

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.250
about the Friedmann Equations.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.820
And first, we'd
like to understand

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.170
what it says about pressure.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.820
Because it turns
out that pressure

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.660
is the crucial
issue in determining

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.320
how fast row falls
off as a expands.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.690
So if row is proportional
to one over a cubed,

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.770
we can just differentiate
that, putting

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.800
in a constant proportionality
temporarily, just

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.577
to keep track of
what we're doing.

00:16:02.577 --> 00:16:04.410
Since we know how to
differentiate qualities

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.590
and we're less familiar
with how to differentiate

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.400
proportionalities.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.430
But what we find immediately,
is that row dot is then minus 3,

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:16.435
where that 3 is that 3,
times a dot over a times row.

00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:18.560
On the other hand, if
row of t falls like one

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.270
over a to the fourth,
row dot is minus 4 times

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.710
a dot over a times row,
just by differentiation.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.850
So we get different
expressions from row dot,

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.815
between radiation and matter.

00:16:28.815 --> 00:16:31.200
And we want to explore
the consequences

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.280
of that difference.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.510
It's related to the
pressure of the gas,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.020
because we can relate
the pressure to row dot.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.950
Because we know that
as a gas expands,

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:51.380
it loses energy, which is
just equal in amount to pdV.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.450
And we illustrated this by
a piston thought experiment,

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.680
but it's true in general.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.200
So we can apply this famous
formula, dU equals minus pdV,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.540
to a patch of the
expanding universe.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:12.710
And by a patch I mean some fixed
region and coordinate space.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:16.180
So the total energy in that
region of coordinate space

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.660
will be the physical
volume, which

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.380
will be a cubed times
the coordinate volume.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.310
Which is going to cancel out
of this equation on both sides.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.140
So it's a cubed times
the coordinate volume

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.060
times the energy density,
which is row c squared.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.680
The rate of change
of that is Du.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.180
And then on the
right hand side, we

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.000
have minus p minus
b times dV, which

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.410
is the rate of change
of a cubed, again

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.390
times the coordinate volume
that we're talking about.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.130
But that will cancel out on
the two sides of the equation.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.400
So this is really
just a description

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:53.250
for the universe of the dU
equals minus pdV equation.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.820
And this can just be rearranged,
expanding the time derivatives,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.960
to give us row dot, and
we get minus 3 a dot

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.120
over a, times row
plus p over c squared.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.550
So this tells us how to relate
row dot to the pressure.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.730
And it tells us that the
formula that we started

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.840
with a long time ago, which
just said that row fell off

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.720
like 1 over a cubed, was
synonymous with saying

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.060
the pressure is zero, for a gas
of non-relativistic particles,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.500
the pressure is negligible.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.350
But for radiation,
clearly if we're

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.640
going to get a four
instead of a three,

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.545
the pressure will
be non-negligible.

00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:34.060
And in fact, it implies
that the pressure

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.770
is exactly equal to
one third of the energy

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.025
density for a gas of radiation.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.880
OK, knowing that, we can now
look back at the Friedmann

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.700
equations and ask,
how do they stand up?

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.470
Are they still consistent, or
do we have to modify something?

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.420
And this is really
the crucial point.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.059
What we know are
these three equations,

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.600
which are the two
Friedmann equations

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.590
and the equation for row dot.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.150
And we could see immediately
that those equations are not

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.190
independent of each other.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.910
The easiest thing
to see is that if we

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.700
start with the top equation,
we could differentiate it.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.910
And since the top
equation has a dot in it,

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.590
when we differentiate, we'll get
an equation for a double dot.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.440
But the equation will
also involve row dot,

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.360
if we take the time derivative
of that top equation.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.025
But if we know
what row dot is, we

00:19:32.025 --> 00:19:33.400
could put that
in, and in the end

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.900
we'll get an equation for
a double dot by itself.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.110
And it will in fact
agree with the equation

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.960
on the middle line.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.670
Again, things would
be inconsistent.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.600
Things are consistent, we
didn't make any mistakes.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.110
If we derive the
equation for a double dot

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.210
by using the first and
third of those equations,

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.790
then we'll get the second
of those equations.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.550
But the catch is
that now we want

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.200
to modify the third
of those equations,

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.440
the equations for row dot.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.210
And then the Friedmann
equations as we've

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.634
written them will not
be consistent anymore.

00:20:04.634 --> 00:20:06.800
Because we'll have a different
equation for row dot,

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.010
we'll get a different
equation for a double dot.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.370
So we have to decide what gives.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.930
What can we change to make
everything consistent?

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.290
And here, the rigorous
way of proceeding

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.804
is to look at general
relativity and see what it says,

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.470
and the answer we're
going to write down

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.079
is exactly what general
relativity says.

00:20:26.079 --> 00:20:27.870
But we can motivate
the answer in, I think,

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.850
a pretty sensible
way, by noticing

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.770
that as the universe
expands, we'd

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.820
expect the energy density
to vary continuously,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.990
because energies are conserved.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:43.490
And we also expect a dot
to vary continuously,

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.140
because basically, the
mechanics of the universe

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.480
are like ton's laws.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.610
And velocities don't
change discontinuously.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.100
You can apply a
force, and that causes

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.010
velocities to have
a rate of change.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.480
But velocities don't
change instantaneously,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.650
unless you somehow
apply an infinite force.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.910
And the same thing will
be true with the universe.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.101
On the other hand, accelerations
can change instantaneously.

00:21:05.101 --> 00:21:07.100
You could change the force
acting on a particle,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.090
in principle, as
fast as you want,

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.590
and the acceleration
of the particle

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.610
will change at that same rate.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.640
So if we look at
these equations,

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.620
we would expect that the first
equation and the third equation

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.750
would not be allowed to
involve the pressure.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.130
Because the pressure basically
is a measure of a force.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.880
Pressures can change
instantaneously.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.400
So what you need to
do, if we're going

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.730
to make these equations
consistent in the presence

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.155
of pressure-- which changes
the row dot equation,

00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:41.672
the only equation we can
change is the second one.

00:21:41.672 --> 00:21:43.130
And then we can
ask ourselves, what

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.330
do we have to change it to make
the three equations consistent?

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.670
And this is what you
looked at on your homework.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.770
And the answer is that
the a double dot equation

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.380
has to be modified
to give the equation

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.930
at the bottom of
the screen here.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.530
And this is the correct form
of the a double dot equation

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.335
in cosmology.

00:22:01.335 --> 00:22:03.710
And this is what we'll be
using for the rest of the term,

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.240
this is exactly what you would
get from general relativity.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.990
As long as we're talking
about homogeneous

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.040
and isotropic universes,
this formula as exact

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.030
as far as we know.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.370
OK, any questions about that?

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.250
Yes.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.590
AUDIENCE: Why when we derive
that equation do we use--

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.852
PROFESSOR: This equation?

00:22:22.852 --> 00:22:23.814
AUDIENCE: Or the one above that.

00:22:23.814 --> 00:22:24.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.700
AUDIENCE: We use dU
equals minus pdV?

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.060
I mean, I agree with
that, but couldn't we

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.384
use a more complete version?

00:22:30.384 --> 00:22:32.175
Like, the complete
version of the first law

00:22:32.175 --> 00:22:37.047
of thermodynamics, that
dU equals TDS minus pdV.

00:22:37.047 --> 00:22:37.880
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.330
The question was when we wrote
down dU equals minus pdV,

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.110
why did we not include
a plus TDS term here,

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.110
which could also be relevant.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.422
The answer is that
for the applications

00:22:50.422 --> 00:22:52.130
we're interested in--
you're quite right,

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.470
it could be important,
but for the applications

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.470
that we're interested in,
which is the expanding

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.250
gas in the universe, the
expanding gas in the universe

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.720
will be making use of this fact.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.370
It really does expand
adiabatically, that is,

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.460
there's nothing
putting heat in or out,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.330
and everything is remaining very
close to thermal equilibrium,

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.250
which means that entropy does
not spontaneously change.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.760
So the TDS term we will be
assuming is very, very small,

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.557
and that's accurate.

00:23:19.557 --> 00:23:21.390
And you're right, if
that were not the case,

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.780
there would be further
complications in terms

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.350
of figuring out what row dot is.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.750
Let me point out here that
this equation actually

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.240
does contain a somewhat
startling perhaps fact

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.190
about gravity it says
that in the context

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.132
of general relativity.

00:23:48.132 --> 00:23:49.965
And that's really the
context that we're in,

00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:53.350
even though we haven't learned
a lot of general relativity.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.310
But it says that in the
context of general relativity,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.700
pressures, as well
as mass densities,

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.480
contribute to the
gravitational field.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.160
A double dot is
basically a measure

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.450
of how fast gravity is
slowing down the universe.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.620
And this says that
there's a pressure.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.460
It can also help to
slow down the universe.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:20.450
Meaning that pressure itself can
create a gravitational field.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.210
In the early universe,
where we go back

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.270
to this radiation
dominated period,

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.240
we know that the pressure is
one third of the energy density.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.740
That says that
this pressure term

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:34.240
is the same size exactly
as the mass density term.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.520
So in the radiation
dominated phase,

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.580
the pressure is just
as important in effect

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.900
for slowing down the universe
as is the mass density.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.730
In today's universe
it's negligible.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.734
Well, we'll come back that.

00:24:47.734 --> 00:24:49.525
The dark energy has a
non-trivial pressure,

00:24:49.525 --> 00:24:52.120
but the pressure of ordinary
matter in today's universe

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.020
is negligible.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.140
The other important
fact about this equation

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.237
is that energy densities,
so far as we know,

00:25:02.237 --> 00:25:03.070
are always positive.

00:25:04.887 --> 00:25:07.220
We don't know for sure what
the ultimate laws of physics

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.770
are, but for all the laws
of physics that we know,

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.770
energy densities are positive.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.590
On the other hand,
pressures actually

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.480
can be negative for
some kinds of material.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.230
And we'll talk a little
bit more about how

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.610
to get a negative
pressure later.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.560
But this formula tells us
that positive pressures

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.930
act the same way as
positive mass densities,

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.030
creating an attractive
gravitational field which

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.370
slows down the expansion
of the universe.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.860
But if there could be a material
with a negative pressure,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.180
this same equation, which
would presumably still hold,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.240
and believe it
does, would tell us

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.240
that that negative
pressure would actually

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.130
cause the universe to
accelerate, because

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.895
of its gravitational effects.

00:25:46.895 --> 00:25:49.020
Now, we're not talking
about the mechanical effects

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.590
of the pressure.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.680
Mechanical effects
of pressure only

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.910
show up when there are
pressure gradients, when

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.350
the pressure is uneven.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.600
So the very large air
pressure in this room,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.470
which really is quite
large, we don't feel all,

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.500
because it's acting
equally in all directions.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.384
Uniform pressures do
not produce forces.

00:26:07.384 --> 00:26:10.050
So the mechanical effects of the
pressure in the early universe,

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.500
which we're assuming is
completely homogeneous,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.790
is zilch.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.560
There is no mechanical effect.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.750
But what we're seeing
in this equation

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.736
is a gravitational effect
caused by the pressure.

00:26:20.736 --> 00:26:22.110
And it's obviously
gravitational,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.520
business the effect is
proportional to Newton's

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.850
capital G, a
constant determining

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.030
the strength of gravity.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.640
So the equation is telling
us that a positive pressure

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.930
creates a gravitational
attraction, which

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.310
would cause the universe to
slow down in its expansion.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.490
But a negative
pressure would produce

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.650
a gravitational repulsion,
which would cause universe

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.750
to speed up.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.070
And we now know that,
today-- in fact,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:51.850
for the last five billion
years or so-- our universe

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.770
itself is actually accelerating
under the influence

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:55.940
of something.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.600
And the only
explanation we have is

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.530
that the something that's
causing the universe

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.640
to accelerate is the
repulsive gravity caused

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.640
by some kind of a negative
pressure material.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.330
And that negative
pressure material

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.654
is what we call the dark energy.

00:27:10.654 --> 00:27:12.820
And we'll talk a little
more later about what it is.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.850
It's very likely
just vacuum energy.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.210
But we'll come back to
that later in the course.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.656
Yes?

00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:21.031
AUDIENCE: When we looked at
the toy example of the piston

00:27:21.031 --> 00:27:24.867
in the cavity, the
pressure of the gas

00:27:24.867 --> 00:27:28.080
was pushing outwards against
the wall of the container.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.552
But we can't have that view
of the universe, really,

00:27:32.552 --> 00:27:35.182
because there's no
exteriors in the universe.

00:27:35.182 --> 00:27:36.640
PROFESSOR: There's
no walls, right.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.970
AUDIENCE: So how should we view
pressure in the sense that--

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.610
Yeah.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:48.800
OK, the question is, in our toy
problem involving the piston,

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.840
we had walls for the
pressure to push against.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.420
And that was where
the energy went.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.750
It went into pushing the walls.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.630
When we're talking about the
universe, there are no walls.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.020
How does that analogy work?

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.530
What plays the
role of the walls?

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:06.460
And the answer, I think, is
that the role of the walls, when

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.690
we're talking about the
universe, first of all, you

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.310
can ignore it if you just
took in a small region.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.060
You could still just
say, the small region

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.480
is pushing out on the
regions around it.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.192
And I think that's enough
to make the logic clear.

00:28:18.192 --> 00:28:20.400
But it still leaves open
the question of, ultimately,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.170
where does this energy go?

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.800
So saying it goes
from here to there

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.383
doesn't help you
unless you know where

00:28:25.383 --> 00:28:27.670
it goes after it goes
from and there and there.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.878
So you might want to ask
the question more generally,

00:28:29.878 --> 00:28:32.330
where does the energy
ultimately end up?

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.350
And then I think the
answer is that it ends up

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.372
in gravitational
potential energy.

00:28:36.372 --> 00:28:38.580
You could certainly build
a toy model, where you just

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:44.879
have a gas in a finite region,
self-contained under gravity.

00:28:44.879 --> 00:28:47.170
And then you'd have to make
up some kind of a mechanism

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.495
to cause it to expand.

00:28:48.495 --> 00:28:50.120
But when you cause
it to expand, you'll

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.500
be pulling particles
apart, which

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.740
are attracting each
other gravitationally.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.640
And that means
you'll be increasing

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.070
the gravitational
potential energy

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.610
as you pull the gas apart.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.800
So I think, ultimately, the
answer is the energy imbalance

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.100
that we seem to be
seeing here is taken up

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.799
by the gravitational field
so that, all in all, energy

00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:08.465
still conserved.

00:29:11.797 --> 00:29:12.630
Any other questions?

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:24.630
OK, in that case, let us
continue on the blackboard.

00:29:39.455 --> 00:29:40.955
OK, first thing I
want to look at it

00:29:40.955 --> 00:29:43.625
is just the behavior of a
radiation-dominated flat

00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:44.125
universe.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.520
So a flat universe
is going to obey

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.590
H squared equals
8 pi over 3 G rho,

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:24.375
and then the potential minus
kc squared over a squared.

00:30:27.835 --> 00:30:29.710
Hard to write dotted
lines on the blackboard.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:34.890
But this potential term is
not there, because k equals 0.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.850
We're talking about
the flat case.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:41.380
So for a flat case, we could
just express H in terms of rho.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.000
And we know how rho
behaves for radiation.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.180
Rho falls off as
1/a to the fourth.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.870
So H squared is proportional
to 1/a to the fourth.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.630
That means that H itself is
proportional to 1/a squared.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.700
So we can do that.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:14.760
a-dot over a is equal to
some constant over a squared,

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.930
a-dot over a being H. And now
we can multiply both sides

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.800
by a, of course.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:28.450
And we get a-dot is equal
to a constant over a.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.760
And this we can integrate.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.090
The way to integrate is
to put all the a's on one

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:42.510
side and all of the
dt's on the other side.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:49.230
So we get ada,
writing this as da/dt.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:54.890
So ada is equal to
the constant times dt.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.090
And then, as we've
done before, when

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.590
we're talking about matter,
it's the same calculation there.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.480
I just did different
power of a appears

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.550
so we'd know how to do it.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:17.420
Integrating, we get 1/2a squared
is equal to the constant times

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:24.120
t, and then plus a new constant
of integration, constant prime.

00:32:28.297 --> 00:32:30.630
Now we make the same argument
as we've made in the past.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.530
We have not yet
said anything that

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.930
determines how our clocks
are going to be set.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.709
So we can choose to set our
clocks in the standard way,

00:32:38.709 --> 00:32:40.500
which is to set our
clocks so that t equals

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.050
0 corresponds to the moment
where a is equal to 0.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.170
And if a is going to be equal
to 0 when t is equal to 0,

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.009
it means constant prime
is going to be equal to 0.

00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:51.800
So by choosing the
value of constant prime,

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.050
we really are just
determining how

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.730
we're going to set
our clocks, how

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.680
we're going to
choose the 0 of time.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:03.520
And we'll do that by setting
constant prime equal to 0.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.020
And then we get
the famous formula

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.020
for a radiation-dominated
universe, a of t

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.910
is just proportional to
the square root of t,

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.570
or t to the 1/2 power.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.160
And this is for a
radiation-dominated flat

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:28.589
universe, replacing
the t to the 2/3

00:33:28.589 --> 00:33:30.755
that we have for the
matter-dominated flat universe.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.034
Once we know that
a is proportional

00:33:36.034 --> 00:33:38.200
to the square root of t--
and for the flat universe,

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.450
the constant proportionality
mean nothing, by the way.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.429
It's not that we haven't
been smart enough

00:33:42.429 --> 00:33:43.470
to figure out what it is.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.217
It really has no
meaning whatever.

00:33:45.217 --> 00:33:47.050
You could set it equal
to whatever you want,

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.700
and it just determines
your definition

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.980
of the notch, your
definition of how you're

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.220
going to measure the
comoving coordinate system.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.390
Once we know this, we should
know pretty much everything.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.820
So in particular,
we can calculate

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.976
h, which a-dot over a.

00:34:03.976 --> 00:34:05.660
And the constant
proportionality drops

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.750
when we compute a-dot over a.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.949
As we expect, it has no meaning.

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.415
So it should not appear in
the equation for anything

00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:14.889
that does have physical meaning.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:22.880
So H is just 1/2t,
the 1/2 here coming

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.714
from differentiating
the t the 1/2 power.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.940
We can also compute
the horizon distance.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:37.520
So the physical horizon
distance, l sub p horizon,

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:45.100
where p stands for physical,
is equal to the scale factor

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.710
times the coordinate
horizon distance.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.469
And the coordinate
horizon distance

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.400
is just the total
coordinate distance

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.047
that light could travel from
the beginning of the universe.

00:34:54.047 --> 00:34:55.880
And we know the coordinate
velocity of light

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.750
is c divided by a.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:02.300
So we just integrate that to get
the total coordinate distance.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:08.610
So it's the integral
from 0 to t of c

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:13.005
over a of t prime dt prime.

00:35:16.338 --> 00:35:18.870
And since a of t is
just t to the 1/2,

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.230
this is a trivial
integral to do.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:26.690
And the answer is
2 times c times t.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.550
So in a radiation-dominated
universe,

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:32.720
the horizon's distance
is twice c times t.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.100
For a static universe,
the horizon distance

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.541
would just be c times t.

00:35:36.541 --> 00:35:38.915
It would just be the distance
light can travel in time t,

00:35:38.915 --> 00:35:41.920
but more complicated in
an expanding universe.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.110
For the matter-dominated
case, we

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.580
discovered that the
horizon distance was 3ct,

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.859
if you remember.

00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:49.650
For the radiation-dominated
case, it's 2ct.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.200
And finally, an
important equation

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:03.510
is that, going back to
here, where we started,

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.300
this equation relates H to rho.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.530
We found out that,
merely by knowing

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.700
the universe is
radiation-dominated,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.915
without even caring about
what kind of radiation

00:36:12.915 --> 00:36:16.090
it is, how much neutrinos,
how much photons, whatever--

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.590
doesn't matter-- merely
by knowing the universe

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:23.820
is radiation-dominated, we were
able to tell that H is 1/2t.

00:36:26.362 --> 00:36:28.320
And if we know what H
is, that formula tells us

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.620
we also know what rho is.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.160
So without even knowing
what kind of radiation

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.690
is contributing, we know that,
for a radiation-dominated

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:44.080
universe, rho is just
equal to 3 over 32

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.185
pi Newton's constant G times
time, little t, squared.

00:36:55.459 --> 00:36:57.750
It's rather amazing that we
can write down that formula

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:01.500
without even knowing what kind
of radiation is contributing.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.180
But as long as that
radiation falls

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:08.310
off as 1 over the scale
factor to the fourth,

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.280
and as long as we know
the universe is flat,

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.556
then we know what that
energy density has to be.

00:37:14.556 --> 00:37:15.930
This is crucial
here, by the way.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.580
The energy could be
anything if we did not

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.996
assume that the
universe was flat.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:25.010
OK, any questions about this?

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.958
Yes?

00:37:25.958 --> 00:37:28.328
AUDIENCE: If we assumed
that it was almost flat,

00:37:28.328 --> 00:37:31.112
would we be able to
have any bounds on it?

00:37:31.112 --> 00:37:32.820
PROFESSOR: OK, question
is, if we assumed

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.195
that it was almost
flat, would we

00:37:34.195 --> 00:37:35.800
be able to have
any bounds on it?

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.674
The answer is, yeah, if
you were quantitative

00:37:37.674 --> 00:37:39.580
about what you meant
by "almost flat,"

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.780
you could know how almost true
that formula would have to be.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.350
OK, if there are
no other questions,

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.560
I want to switch
gears slightly now

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.690
and go back to talk about some
of the basic underlying physics

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:04.240
that we are going to need,
and in particular, the physics

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.260
of black-body radiation.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.560
So this is really just a little
chapter of a stat mech course

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.900
that we're inserting
here, because we need it.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.761
And because it comes
from another course,

00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:25.760
we're not going try to
do it in complete detail.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.780
But I'll try to write down
formulas that make sense.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:32.270
And that will give us what
we need to know to proceed.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.110
So that will be the goal.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.310
So what is black-body radiation?

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:46.330
The physical phenomenon
is that, if one imagines

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.012
a box with a cavity
in it-- that's

00:38:49.012 --> 00:38:50.720
supposed to be a box
with a cavity in it,

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:55.600
in case you can't recognize the
picture-- if the box is held

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.480
at some uniform temperature
t-- t is temperature--

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.460
then is claimed and
verified experimentally

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:10.360
that the cavity will fill up
with radiation-- in this case,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.580
we're really just talking about
electromagnetic radiation--

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.550
the calving will fill up with
electromagnetic radiation

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.720
whose characteristics
would be determined solely

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.780
by that temperature
t and will therefore

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:27.270
be totally independent of the
material that makes up the box.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.970
Roughly speaking,
I think the way

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:33.560
to think about it is to say
that the box will fill up

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.060
with radiation at temperature t.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.920
And saying that the
radiation has temperature t

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.680
is enough to completely
describe the radiation.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.710
It doesn't matter
what kind of a box

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.630
that radiation is sitting in.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:58.840
So the box will fill with
radiation at temperature t.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.380
And that radiation is
called black-body radiation.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.350
Like many things in physics,
it has a variety of names,

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.419
just to confuse us all.

00:40:29.419 --> 00:40:30.960
So it's also called
cavity radiation,

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.334
which makes a lot
of sense, given

00:40:32.334 --> 00:40:34.570
the description we just gave.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.930
And it's also sometimes called
just thermal equilibrium

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:37.920
radiation.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.180
This is radiation
at temperature t.

00:40:42.921 --> 00:40:44.920
I haven't really justified
the word "black-body"

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.000
radiation yet, so let me
try to do that quickly.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.980
The reason why it can be called
black-body radiation-- and this

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.447
will be important for
some things in cosmology;

00:40:53.447 --> 00:40:55.530
I'm not sure if it will
be important to us or not,

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.940
but certainly important to
know-- the reason why it's

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.010
called black-body radiation is
because we imagine inserting

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:10.990
into this cavity a black
body, in the literal sense.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.500
What is the literal
sense of a black body?

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.850
It's a body which is
black in the sense

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.980
that all radiation that
hits it is absorbed.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.050
Now, this black body
is still going to glow.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.900
If you heat a piece
of iron or something

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.220
to very high temperatures,
you see it glow.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.910
That glow is not reflection.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.240
That glow is emission
by the hot atoms

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.860
in the piece of
iron or whatever.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.630
Emission is different
from reflection.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.580
When we say it
absorbs everything,

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.610
we mean it does not
reflect anything.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:45.950
But it will still admit
by thermal de-excitation.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:53.770
The crucial distinction between
reflection and thermal emission

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.694
is that reflection
is instantaneous.

00:41:55.694 --> 00:41:57.610
When a light beam comes
in, if it's reflected,

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:01.290
it just goes back
out instantaneously.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:05.080
Emission, thermal emission,
is a slower process.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.810
Atoms get excited,
and eventually, they

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.950
de-excite and emit radiation.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:10.896
So it takes time.

00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:12.020
And that's the distinction.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.140
We're going to assume that
this body is black in the sense

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.265
that there's no reflection.

00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:31.140
OK, now we're going to
make use of the fact

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.800
that we know that thermal
equilibrium works.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.850
That is, if you let any
isolated system sit long enough,

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:41.850
it will approach a unique
state of thermal equilibrium

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.120
determined by its constituents,
which you've put in

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:50.350
to begin with, but otherwise
independent of how exactly

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.680
you arrange those constituents.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.520
So if we put in, for
example, a cold black body,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.440
it will start to get
harder, warming up

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.300
to the same temperature
as everything else.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.510
If we put in an
extra hot black body,

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.740
it would emit energy
and start to cool down

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.850
to the temperature
of everything else.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.080
But eventually,
this black body will

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.220
be at the same temperature
as everything else.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.240
And we're going to be assuming
here that the box itself

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.610
is being held at some
fixed temperature t.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.342
So wherever energy
exchange occurs

00:43:22.342 --> 00:43:23.800
because of this
black body, it will

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.860
be absorbed by
whatever is holding

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:29.070
the outer box at the
fixed temperature.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:30.900
So in the end, if
we wait long enough,

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.480
this black body is going to
acquire the same temperature

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.117
as everything else and
hold that temperature.

00:43:37.117 --> 00:43:38.700
Now, if it's holding
that temperature,

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.977
it means that the energy input
to the box, to the black body,

00:43:42.977 --> 00:43:44.560
will have to be the
same as the energy

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.444
output of the black body.

00:43:47.444 --> 00:43:49.735
Now, the black body is going
to be absorbing radiation,

00:43:49.735 --> 00:43:51.318
because we have
radiation here, and we

00:43:51.318 --> 00:43:53.600
said that any radiation
that hits it is absorbed.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.380
That was the
definition of "black."

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.250
So it's clearly
absorbing energy.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.850
If it's not going
to be heating up--

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:03.610
and we know that it's
not, because it's

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.754
in thermal equilibrium; the
temperature will remain fixed--

00:44:06.754 --> 00:44:08.170
in order for it
to not heat up, it

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.870
has to radiate energy, as well.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:13.220
And the energy it radiates
has to be exactly the same

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.749
as the energy it's
absorbing once it

00:44:14.749 --> 00:44:15.915
reaches thermal equilibrium.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:46.158
So in equilibrium, the black
body, BB, radiates at same rate

00:44:46.158 --> 00:44:47.785
that it absorbs energy.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.810
This radiation process
is this slow process

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.300
of thermal emission.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.920
There are atoms inside this
black body that are excited.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.870
Those atoms will
de-excite over time,

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:12.500
releasing photons
that will go off.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.980
And the important thing
about that slow mechanism

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.390
is that, if we imagine
taking this black body out

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:24.929
of its cavity, but not waiting
long enough for its temperature

00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:26.720
to change-- so we'll
assume its temperature

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.880
is still the same, t.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:42.655
So this is a picture of the same
black body at temperature t,

00:45:42.655 --> 00:45:44.310
but now outside the cavity.

00:45:51.786 --> 00:45:54.160
Its radiation rate is not
going to change when we take it

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.743
outside the cavity, because the
radiation was caused by things

00:45:56.743 --> 00:46:00.250
happening inside the black body,
which are not changed when we

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.030
put it in or out of the cavity.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.620
So it will continue to radiate
at exactly the same rate

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.740
that it was radiating
when it was in the cavity.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.240
And that means it's
going to radiate

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.720
at exactly the same
rate as the energy

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:16.690
that it would have
absorbed if it were bathed

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:19.510
by this black-body radiation.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.420
So essentially, it means it
will emit black-body radiation

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.780
with exactly the intensity that
the black-body radiation would

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.285
have on the outside if
the black body were still

00:46:29.285 --> 00:46:30.035
inside the cavity.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.980
So it radiates with exactly the
same intensity as the energy

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.220
that it would receive if
it were inside the cavity.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.940
And furthermore, you
could even elaborate a bit

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.780
on his argument to show that
the radiation that it radiates

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.340
has exactly the same spectrum,
exactly the same decomposition

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.320
into wavelengths, as
the black-body radiation

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.970
inside the cavity.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.840
And the way to see
that is to imagine

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:15.700
surrounding this black body by
absorption filters that only

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.369
let through certain frequencies.

00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:19.410
And the point is that, no
matter what frequencies

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.747
you limit going
through this filter,

00:47:22.747 --> 00:47:24.080
you have to stay in equilibrium.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.880
It will never get
hotter or colder.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.640
So that means that each
frequency by itself

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.000
has to balance, has to have
exactly the same emission

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.180
as it would have abortion
if the black body were just

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:39.340
exposed to black-body
radiation surrounding it.

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.410
So it radiates
black-body radiation.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:59.500
And the intensity
and spectrum must

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:04.015
match what we call black-body
or cavity radiation.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.000
So the cavity radiation
has to exactly mimic

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.754
the radiation emitted
by this black body.

00:48:14.754 --> 00:48:16.420
And that's the
motivation for calling it

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.295
black-body radiation.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.840
Now, if this black body
absorbed some radiation

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.766
and reflected some, then it
would emit different radiation.

00:48:25.766 --> 00:48:27.140
So it is important
that this body

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.320
be black, in the sense that
it doesn't reflect anything.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.306
All radiation hitting
it is absorbed.

00:48:33.306 --> 00:48:34.680
And only under
that assumption do

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.970
we know exactly what
it's going to emit.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:38.470
Yes?

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.136
AUDIENCE: So is this
only true for right

00:48:40.136 --> 00:48:41.470
after you take it out?

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.150
PROFESSOR: Well, it will start
to cool after you take it out.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.350
And as it cools, its
temperature will change.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.350
But if you account for
the changing temperature,

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:49.187
it will be true at
anytime, actually.

00:48:49.187 --> 00:48:50.520
But the temperature will change.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.144
AUDIENCE: Because,
in the black cavity,

00:48:52.144 --> 00:48:53.558
it has things exciting it.

00:48:53.558 --> 00:48:54.932
And when you take
it out, there's

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:58.708
no photons, no constant
radiation to excite it.

00:48:58.708 --> 00:49:00.925
So it can radiate--

00:49:00.925 --> 00:49:01.550
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.810
Once you take it out, it's
no longer being excited.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:07.327
And I think, technically,
you're right.

00:49:07.327 --> 00:49:09.160
Once you take it out,
it will not only cool,

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.960
but it will cease to be
at a uniform temperature.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.840
And that's basically
what we're saying

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.070
if we're saying that the
atoms that are excited

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.570
won't necessarily be in the
right thermal distribution

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.460
as they would be if
it was on the inside.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.090
That would be a
statement that is not

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.120
any longer in
thermal equilibrium.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.020
But as long as the
radiation is slow,

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.186
you could just account for
the changing temperature.

00:49:29.186 --> 00:49:30.646
You would know how it radiates.

00:49:30.646 --> 00:49:32.520
And I think that's a
very good approximation.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.285
Although in principle,
it will cease

00:49:34.285 --> 00:49:36.660
to be in thermal equilibrium,
as soon as you take it out,

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.785
the edges will be cool,
and the center will be hot.

00:49:38.785 --> 00:49:41.370
And you'd have to take into
account all of those things

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.078
to be able to understand
how it radiates.

00:49:47.107 --> 00:49:47.940
Any other questions?

00:49:54.209 --> 00:49:55.750
OK, next, I want to
talk a little bit

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:59.870
about what this
black-body radiation is.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:04.140
And one can begin by
trying to understand

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.550
it purely classically,
which, of course,

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.160
is what happened historically.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.940
In the 1800s, people tried to
understand cavity radiation

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:16.090
or black-body radiation using
classical physics, Maxwell's

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:19.680
equations, to describe
the radiation.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.980
And then, in a
nutshell-- we're just

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.090
trying to establish
basic ideas here--

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:31.630
one can try to treat a field
statistical-mechanically

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:34.760
by imagining not
fields in empty space,

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.160
but fields in some
kind of a box.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.660
In this case, it
doesn't necessarily

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.618
have to be the cavity
that we're talking about.

00:50:40.618 --> 00:50:44.200
It could be a big box that just
enclosed the system somehow

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.756
to make it easier to talk about.

00:50:45.756 --> 00:50:47.130
And in the end,
you could imagine

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:51.060
taking that box to infinity,
this theoretical box

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.280
that you use to
simplify the problem.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.160
But once you put
the system in a box,

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.070
then a field, like the
electromagnetic field,

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:01.000
can always be broken
up into normal modes,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.570
standing wave patterns that have
an integer or a half integer

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.650
number of wavelengths
inside the box.

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:10.680
And no matter how complicated
the field is inside the box,

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.290
you could always describe
it as a superposition

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.726
of some set of standing waves.

00:51:17.726 --> 00:51:19.350
In general, it takes
an infinite number

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:21.690
of standing wave components
to describe an arbitrary

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:26.690
field-- that is, with shorter
and shorter wavelengths.

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:29.960
But you can always-- and
this is Fourier's theorem--

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.000
you can always
describe an arbitrary

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.089
field in terms of
the standing waves.

00:51:36.089 --> 00:51:37.630
And that's good for
the point of view

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:39.331
of thinking about
statistical mechanics,

00:51:39.331 --> 00:51:41.330
because you could think
about each standing wave

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:43.700
almost as if it were a particle.

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.240
It really is a
harmonic oscillator.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.900
So if you think you know
the statistical mechanics

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.670
of harmonic oscillators,
each standing wave in the box

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:53.990
is just a harmonic
oscillator, so simple.

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:56.360
We now try to ask what
is the thermodynamics

00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:01.400
of this system of
harmonic oscillators.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.480
And the rule for harmonic
oscillator is simple.

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.860
Stat mech tells
you that you have

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.505
1/2 kT per degree of freedom
in thermal equilibrium.

00:52:29.054 --> 00:52:30.470
The energy of a
system should just

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:35.995
be 1/2 kT per degree of freedom.

00:52:42.774 --> 00:52:44.690
Having said that, all
the complicate questions

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:46.148
come about by asking
ourselves what

00:52:46.148 --> 00:52:48.150
is meant by degree of freedom.

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:51.039
But for the harmonic oscillator,
that has a simple answer.

00:52:51.039 --> 00:52:52.580
A harmonic oscillator
has two degrees

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.597
of freedom-- the kinetic energy
and the potential energy.

00:52:55.597 --> 00:52:57.180
So the energy of a
harmonic oscillator

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.180
should just be kT per
degree of freedom.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.680
And we could apply that to our
gas in the box and we could,

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.965
ask how much energy
should the gas absorb

00:53:05.965 --> 00:53:08.309
at a given temperature?

00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:10.600
What should be the energy
density of the gas at a given

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.330
temperature-- this
gas of photons.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:19.710
But it was noticed in
the 1900-- the 1800s

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:24.560
that this doesn't work because
there's no limit to how short

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.610
the wavelengths can be.

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.050
And therefore, there's
not just some finite set

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:30.130
of harmonic oscillators.

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:31.630
There's an infinite
set of harmonic

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:35.240
oscillators where you have
more and more harmonic

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.870
oscillators at shorter
and shorter wavelengths

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:40.150
ad infinitum, no limit.

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.316
And that came to be
known as Jean's Paradox.

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:21.710
So what it suggests is that
if this classical stat mech

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:23.726
worked-- which obviously
it's not working.

00:54:23.726 --> 00:54:25.100
But if it did
work, it would mean

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:29.810
that as you tried to put a gas
in just an empty box in contact

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:31.630
with something at a
fixed temperature,

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:35.210
the box would absorb more and
more energy without limit.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.314
And ultimately, it
would presumably

00:54:37.314 --> 00:54:38.855
cause the temperature
of the whatever

00:54:38.855 --> 00:54:40.396
is trying to maintain
the temperature

00:54:40.396 --> 00:54:43.510
to go to 0 as energy
gets siphoned off

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:46.410
to shorter and shorter
wavelengths of excitations.

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:52.520
That obviously isn't the
way the world behaves.

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.260
We'd all freeze to
death if it did.

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.880
So something has to
happen to save it.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.050
And it wasn't at all
obvious for many years

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:00.446
what it was that saves it.

00:55:00.446 --> 00:55:01.820
But this Jean's
Paradox turns out

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.194
to be saved by
quantum mechanics.

00:55:19.297 --> 00:55:21.380
And the important implication
of quantum mechanics

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:31.870
is that the energy of
a harmonic oscillator

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.620
is no longer allowed to
have any possible value,

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:42.570
but is now quantized
as some integer times

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.650
h times nu, the
frequency-- h being

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:48.160
Planck's constant,
nu being frequency, n

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:53.080
being some integer where
this integer might be called

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.080
the excitation level of
the harmonic oscillator.

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:06.750
Depending how you choose your
0, you might have an n plus 1/2

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:07.830
there.

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:09.970
But that's not important
for us right now.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:12.536
It will be important
later actually.

00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:14.910
But for now, we'll just allow
ourselves to readjust the 0

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:19.202
and just think of it as n
times h nu, or h bar omega.

00:56:19.202 --> 00:56:20.660
Now, this makes
all the difference,

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.140
statistical mechanically.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.670
One can apply
statistical mechanics

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.230
using basically
the same principles

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:27.720
to the quantum
mechanical system.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.850
And the key thing now is that
for the very short wavelengths,

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:32.850
which are the ones that
were giving us trouble--

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:35.050
the infinities came
to short wavelengths.

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:39.580
For the short wavelengths
where nu is high, h nu is high.

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.680
And it means that
there's a minimum ante

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:45.650
that you could put in to
excite those short wavelength

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:47.100
harmonic oscillators.

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.544
And it's a large number.

00:56:48.544 --> 00:56:50.960
You either put in a large
amount of energy or none at all.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.470
Quantum mechanics doesn't let
you do anything in between.

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:56.440
Now remember, the
classical mechanics answer

00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.670
was that you have kT in
each harmonic oscillator.

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:02.960
And kT would be small
compared to h nu,

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.356
if we're talking about
a very short wavelength.

00:57:05.356 --> 00:57:06.730
So the classic
answer is just not

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.970
allowed by quantum mechanics.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:12.380
You either have to put in
nothing or an amount much, much

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:15.225
larger than the
classical answer.

00:57:15.225 --> 00:57:17.850
And when you do the statistical
mechanics quantum mechanically,

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:19.710
which is not a big
deal really, you

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:23.090
find that when you're
confronted with that choice,

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:26.120
the most likely answer is
to put in no energy at all.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.750
So quantum mechanics freezes out
these short wavelength modes.

00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:33.330
And then the n produces
a finite energy density

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.660
for a gas of photons.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.337
Yes?

00:57:37.337 --> 00:57:39.170
AUDIENCE: Seems like
if you were to sum over

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:43.180
like all the possible
wave numbers, that-- well,

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:46.570
so the energy is inversely
related to wavelength, right?

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.390
So even if you quantize it,
like for large wavelengths,

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:53.324
isn't the sum still like a sum
of one over lambda wavelength,

00:57:53.324 --> 00:57:56.320
with its derivative?

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.070
PROFESSOR: You're
saying, isn't there also

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:00.511
a divergence at the
large wavelength n?

00:58:00.511 --> 00:58:01.927
AUDIENCE: Because
that sum doesn't

00:58:01.927 --> 00:58:03.770
seem like it would work.

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:04.870
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:05.815
No, that's important.

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:11.850
The reason that's
not a problem is

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:15.217
that if you're talking
about the energy in a box,

00:58:15.217 --> 00:58:17.050
the wavelength can't
be bigger than the box.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.850
The largest possible
wavelength is twice the box so

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:22.167
that half a wavelength
fits in the box.

00:58:22.167 --> 00:58:24.500
If you're talking about the
energy in the whole infinite

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.870
universe, then we expect
the answer to infinite.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.160
And it is.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.600
There's no problem with
having infinite total energy

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.240
if you want to have
a finite energy

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.010
density throughout
an infinite universe.

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:39.510
So the size of the box cuts
off the large wavelengths.

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:41.920
And quantum mechanics cuts
off the small wavelengths.

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.320
So in the end, one does
get a finite answer

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.600
for the energy density
of black-body radiation.

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:51.182
And that's crucial
for our survival,

00:58:51.182 --> 00:58:52.890
crucial for the
existence of the universe

00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:55.100
as we know it, and also
crucial for the calculations

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.058
that we're about to do.

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:13.350
OK, so when one does these
calculations initially

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:24.260
for photons only, what we'd
find is that the energy density

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:29.280
is equal to a fudge factor,
which I'm going to call g.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.660
And you'll see later why I'm
introducing a fudge factor.

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.750
For now, g is just 2.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:36.660
But later, we'll generalize the
application of this formula,

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.900
and g will have
different values.

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.810
But for now, we're
dealing with photons.

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:44.060
There's a factor of 2 there,
but I'm going to write 2 as g,

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.410
writing g equals 2 underneath.

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:49.190
And then the pi
squared over 30--

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:52.200
you can really
calculate this-- times

00:59:52.200 --> 01:00:03.000
kT to the fourth power divided
by h bar c cubed, h bar

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.164
being Plank's constant
divided by 2 pi and little k

01:00:07.164 --> 01:00:08.205
being Boltzmann constant.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:15.950
So this is calculated just by
thinking of the gas in a box

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:19.110
as a lot of harmonic oscillators
and applying standard stat

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.970
mech to each
harmonic oscillator,

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:22.730
but you apply the quantum
mechanical version of the stat

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:24.105
mech to each
harmonic oscillator.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:37.360
And you can also find, by doing
the same kind of analysis,

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.490
that the pressure is
1/3 the energy density,

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:43.010
which we also derived
earlier by different means.

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:46.290
And it's all consistent so you
get the same answer every time,

01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:48.370
even if you think
about it differently.

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.480
So here, I have mine deriving
it directly from the stat mech.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.400
You can also, from
the stat mech,

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.120
calculate the number density of
photons in thermal equilibrium.

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:21.452
And that will be equal to --
again, there's a factor of 2.

01:01:21.452 --> 01:01:22.910
But this time, I'll
call the factor

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:27.750
of 2 g star, where g star
also equals 2 for photons.

01:01:31.177 --> 01:01:32.760
But when we generalize
these formulas,

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.470
g will not necessarily
equal g star,

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.340
which is why I'm
giving it two names.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:44.360
And this g star
multiplies zeta of 3,

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.660
where zeta refers to the
Riemann zeta function, which

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:54.000
I'll define in a second,
divided by pi squared times

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.145
kT cubed divided
by h bar c cubed.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:09.390
OK.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:39.080
OK, so I need to
define this zeta of 3.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:50.470
It's 1 over 1 cubed plus 1 over
2 cubed plus 1 over 3 cubed

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:51.610
plus dot dot dot.

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:53.460
It's an infinite series.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.690
And if you sum up
that infinite series,

01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:07.144
at least to three decimal
places, it's 1.202.

01:03:07.144 --> 01:03:08.560
OK, then there's
one other formula

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.310
that will be of interest to us.

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:12.545
And that'll be a formula
for the entropy density.

01:03:25.017 --> 01:03:26.600
Now, if you've had
a stat mech course,

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.030
you have some idea of what
entropy density means.

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:34.150
If you have not, suffice
it to say for this class

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:37.900
that it is some measure of
the disorder in the sense

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.430
of the total number of
different quantum states

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:42.965
that contribute to a given
macroscopic description.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.140
The more different
microstates there

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.530
are that contribute to a
macroscopic description,

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.659
the higher the entropy.

01:03:53.659 --> 01:03:55.700
And the other important
thing about entropy to us

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.950
besides that vague definition--
which will be enough--

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.450
but the important
thing for us is

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:04.100
that under most circumstances,
entropy will be conserved.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.930
It's conserved as
long as things stay

01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:08.197
at or near thermal equilibrium.

01:04:08.197 --> 01:04:10.280
And in the early universe
as the universe expands,

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.120
that's the case.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.320
So for us, the
entropy of our gas

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.240
will simply be a
conserved quantity

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.440
that we can make use of.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.246
And we will make use of
it in some important ways.

01:04:20.246 --> 01:04:21.620
And we could write
down a formula

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.940
for the entropy
density of photons.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.220
And it's g, where this g in
fact the same g as over there.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.940
It is related to the energy.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.050
So it's the same g that
appears in two cases, 2

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:35.626
in both cases for
protons by themselves.

01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:37.750
And then there are factors
that you can calculate--

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:50.000
2 pi squared over 45 times k to
the fourth T cubed over h bar

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.910
c cubed.

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:55.341
OK, this time, the number
of k's and T's do not match.

01:04:55.341 --> 01:04:57.090
That's mainly due to
the conventions about

01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:58.460
how entropy is defined.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.250
It's not really anything deep.

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:06.205
I might mention at
this point that the 2's

01:05:06.205 --> 01:05:08.330
that I've been writing for
everything-- g equals 2,

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:11.330
g star equals 2-- the
reason those 2's are written

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:14.080
explicitly rather than just
absorbing the factor of 2

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.610
into the other factors is
that photons are characterized

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.380
by the fact that there are
two polarizations of photons.

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.880
So if I have a beam
of photons, they

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.350
could be right-handed
or left-handed.

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:24.891
And anything else
could be considered

01:05:24.891 --> 01:05:26.802
a superposition of those two.

01:05:26.802 --> 01:05:28.990
So there are two
independent polarizations.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:31.420
And it's useful to keep
track of these formulas

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.990
as the amount of energy
density per polarization.

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:36.770
Thus, different
kinds of particles

01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:39.190
will have different
numbers of polarizations.

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:42.620
So if we know the
amount per polarization,

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.334
we'll be able to more easily
apply it to other particles.

01:05:46.334 --> 01:05:46.834
Yes?

01:05:46.834 --> 01:05:50.280
AUDIENCE: Sorry, just to kind
of bring up the same question,

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.383
if we-- I read that
in the early universe,

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:55.675
the temperature is constantly
changing or it's cooling.

01:05:55.675 --> 01:05:56.382
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:05:56.382 --> 01:05:58.620
AUDIENCE: So then if the
temperature is changing,

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.982
then how can we say that
the entropy is constant?

01:06:01.982 --> 01:06:03.440
PROFESSOR: OK,
important question--

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.560
we'll be getting
to it very soon.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.643
But since you asked the
question, I'll ask it now.

01:06:06.643 --> 01:06:09.230
The question was if the
universe is expanding,

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:11.270
and the entropy
density is going down

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:13.831
because it thins,
how can that happen--

01:06:13.831 --> 01:06:15.580
I guess it was asked
the other way around.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.142
If the temperature
is falling, how

01:06:17.142 --> 01:06:18.600
can entropy be
conserved if this is

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.120
the formula for entropy density?

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:25.520
And the answer-- when I tell
you, you'll see it's obvious.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.310
We don't expect
the entropy density

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:29.230
to be conserved if the
entropy is conserved.

01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:31.790
The entropy thins out
as the universe expands.

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:35.040
So if we just had a gas
with nothing else changing,

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.980
we expect the entropy density
to go down like 1 over the scale

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:44.350
factor cubed, just like the
number density of particles.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:48.541
So if s is going to go down like
1 over the scale factor cubed,

01:06:48.541 --> 01:06:50.290
that would be consistent
with this formula

01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:53.880
if the temperature also fell
as 1 over the scale factor.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.640
So that to cubing it
made things match.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.400
And that's what we'll find.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.860
The temperature falls off,
like 1 over the scale factor.

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:00.240
And that's consistent
with everything

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.156
that we said about energy
densities and so on.

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.074
OK.

01:07:19.074 --> 01:07:20.490
Next thing I want
to talk about is

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:23.030
neutrinos, which
I told you earlier

01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:28.366
contributes in a significant
way to the radiation energy

01:07:28.366 --> 01:07:29.615
density in the universe today.

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:41.880
Neutrinos are particles
which for a long time,

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.670
were thought to be massless.

01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:47.590
Until around 2000
or so, neutrinos

01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:49.260
were thought to be massless.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:53.550
Now we know that in fact, they
have a very small mass, which

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:55.310
complicates the
description here.

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:57.140
It turns out that
cosmologically, neutrinos

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.930
still act as if
they were massless

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:02.020
for almost all purposes
and for really all purposes

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:05.060
that we'll be dealing with in
this class, although if we were

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.740
interested in the effects
of neutrinos on structure

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.875
formation, we'd be
interested in whether or not

01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:13.550
the neutrinos have a
small mass or whether it's

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:15.100
smaller than that.

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.744
We know it's non-zero.

01:08:16.744 --> 01:08:18.910
We don't know what the
neutrino mass is, by the way.

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:22.279
What we actually know
from observations

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:26.546
is that there are three
types of neutrinos.

01:08:26.546 --> 01:08:27.754
And those are called flavors.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.329
And I'll use the letter
nu for the word neutrino.

01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:45.149
And those three
types of neutrinos

01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:49.020
are called nu sub e, called
the electron neutrino;

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:55.130
nu subbed mu, called the muon
neutrino, and nu sub tau,

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.380
called the tau neutrino.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:04.390
And these letters e, mu, and tau
link to the names of particles.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.200
This is the electron neutrino.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.800
This is the muon
neutrino connected

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.300
to a particle called
the muon, which

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.430
is like the electron but
heavier and different.

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:16.710
And this is linked to a particle
called the tau, which is also

01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:22.055
like the electron but much more
heavier but otherwise similar

01:09:22.055 --> 01:09:23.640
in its properties.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.850
And the neutrinos are
linked in the sense

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:29.240
that when a neutrino
is produced, depending

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.370
on how you start, it is
very typically produced

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:34.939
in conjunction with one
of these other particles.

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:37.590
So an electron
neutrino is typically

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.634
produced in conjunction
with an electron.

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.220
And similarly, a muon
neutrino is typically

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.260
produced in conjunction
with a muon.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.170
And a tau neutrino is typically
produced in conjunction

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:52.679
with a tau.

01:10:01.004 --> 01:10:03.170
Now, what does this have
to do with neutrino masses?

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:10.270
We've never actually measured
the mass of neutrino.

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:14.160
So we only know that they
have mass indirectly.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.050
What we have seen is one
flavor of neutrino turn

01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:20.110
into another flavor.

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:22.860
And it turns out, in the
context of quantum field theory

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:25.026
and I think this does make
a certain amount of sense

01:10:25.026 --> 01:10:27.390
just by intuition, if
a particle is massless,

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.890
it can never change
into anything.

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:31.940
The process by which
one changes into another

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.860
is pretty quantum
mechanical and a little hard

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.560
to understand anyway.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.550
But if the particles
were really massless,

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:41.430
they would move at
the speed of light.

01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:43.790
And if the particles were
moving at the speed of light,

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:46.680
if the particle had any kind
of a clock on the particle,

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.750
that clock would literally
stop with the particle

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.540
moving at the speed of light.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.970
So if particles are massless,
any internal workings

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:58.997
that that particle
might have to be frozen.

01:10:58.997 --> 01:11:00.580
That is, if it's a
clock, it has to be

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.820
a clock that's
stopped completely.

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.600
And for reasons that
are essentially that,

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.650
although they can be made
more formal and more rigorous,

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:11.000
a truly massless
particle could never

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.970
undergo any kind
of change whatever.

01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:15.020
It would have to
stay exactly like it

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.070
looks like to start with.

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:18.850
Because it just has no time.

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:21.870
So the fact that these
neutrinos turn into each other

01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:24.650
implies that they must
have a nonzero mass.

01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:28.080
It must not really be moving
at quite the speed of light.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.580
And that's the way
the formalism works.

01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:33.250
And we could set
limits on the masses

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:36.310
based on what we know about
the transitions between one

01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:38.620
kind of neutrino and another.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:39.421
Yes?

01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:41.614
AUDIENCE: How do we
explain photon decaying

01:11:41.614 --> 01:11:43.030
to an electron-positron
pair then?

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:45.410
PROFESSOR: A photon decaying
to an electron-positron pair?

01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:45.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.580
PROFESSOR: The answer is a
free photon never does decay

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.244
to an electron-positron pair.

01:11:49.244 --> 01:11:50.660
Photons can collide
with something

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.510
and produce an
electron-positron pair.

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:55.760
But that collision, that's
a more complicated process.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.150
What I'm saying is-- I'm sorry.

01:11:57.150 --> 01:12:00.050
This process of conversion--
maybe I should have clarified--

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:02.746
happens just as the
neutrinos travel.

01:12:02.746 --> 01:12:03.870
It's not due to collisions.

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.369
Due to collsions,
complicated things

01:12:05.369 --> 01:12:08.680
can happen whether the
particle is massless or not.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:17.740
But a massless particle simply
in transit cannot undergo any

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.020
kind of transition.

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.300
And these neutrinos are seen
to undergo transitions simply

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.660
being in transit
without any collisions.

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:33.720
In terms of my clock
analogy and a stopped clock,

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.428
I think the reason
the photon can convert

01:12:35.428 --> 01:12:38.200
into electron-positron pairs
if it collides with something

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.525
is that when it collides, it
essentially breaks the clock.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.060
You don't have a
photon that's just

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.580
moving along without
time anymore.

01:12:50.210 --> 01:12:53.060
OK, so these
neutrinos have masses.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.852
And maybe I should,
at this point,

01:12:56.852 --> 01:12:59.185
write down some bounds
on these masses.

01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:13.780
m squared 21 times c to the
fourth is equal to 7.50 plus

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:25.300
or minus 0.2 times 10 to the
minus 5 electron volts squared.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.630
These numbers come from the
latest particle data tables,

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:32.630
which I gave references
for in the notes.

01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:35.610
So this is the difference
of the mass squared.

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:44.920
And delta m 23 squared
times c to the fourth

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.860
to turn it into the
square of an energy

01:13:47.860 --> 01:14:01.260
is 2.32 plus 0.12
minus 0.08 times 10

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:04.850
to the minus third
electron volts squared.

01:14:07.112 --> 01:14:08.570
So one thing you
notice immediately

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.460
is that these are
incredibly small masses.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:17.150
Remember, the proton
weighs 938 MeV,

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:18.460
three million electron volts.

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.620
And these are fractions
of one electron volt.

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.690
So by the standards
of particle physics,

01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:27.060
these are unbelievably
small energies,

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.150
unbelievably small
mass differences.

01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:31.010
But they're there.

01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:34.652
They have to be there for the
physics we know to make sense.

01:14:34.652 --> 01:14:36.110
The other thing
that you may notice

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:38.318
about this notation-- which
I don't want to elaborate

01:14:38.318 --> 01:14:40.680
on but I'll just mention--
this is called 21.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.270
This is called 23.

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:43.600
There's no 1, 2, or 3 there.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.890
There's an e and a mu and a tau.

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:49.256
The complication here is
something very quantum

01:14:49.256 --> 01:14:49.755
mechanical.

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:57.380
The e, mu and tau
labels are labels

01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:01.000
which basically label
the neutrino according

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.245
to how the neutrino is created.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:09.720
It turns out that their mass
eigenstates-- states which

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.090
actually have a
definite mass-- are not

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:15.800
the e, the mu or the tau.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.570
In fact, if the e
had a definite mass,

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.278
that would be saying
that an e would just

01:15:19.278 --> 01:15:21.130
propagate as a particle
with a certain mass.

01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:23.920
It would not convert
into anything else.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.670
The fact that an e converts
into other particles--

01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:28.800
a nu sub e converts
into other particles

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.160
is really the statement
that nu sub e is not

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.222
a state with a definite mass.

01:15:33.222 --> 01:15:34.930
But there are states
with definite masses

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:37.660
which could be expressed quantum
mechanically as superpositions

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.070
of these flavor eigenstates.

01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:43.220
So nu sub 1, nu
sub 2 and nu sub 3

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:46.410
are states of neutrinos
that have definite masses.

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:48.600
And each one of them is
a superposition of nu sub

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.720
e, nu sub mu and nu sub tau.

01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:54.360
Yes?

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:58.029
AUDIENCE: How come we don't
have a delta n from 31?

01:15:58.029 --> 01:15:59.070
PROFESSOR: Good question.

01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:03.080
I think it's just the
lack of knowledge.

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.470
I don't think there's any
reason it's not defined.

01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:07.590
I'm sure it is defined.

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:09.804
I think it's just
lack of knowledge.

01:16:09.804 --> 01:16:12.470
And if I knew more details about
how these things were measured,

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:13.970
I could give you a
better story about that.

01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:14.845
But I don't, frankly.

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:23.620
So in the end, it's a rather
complicated quantum mechanical

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:27.070
system which we're not going
to go into any details about.

01:16:30.792 --> 01:16:32.000
What more should I say today?

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:37.060
OK, let me just
mention for today

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:42.770
and we'll continue next
time after the quiz,

01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:45.090
for our purposes, we're going
to treat these neutrinos

01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:46.580
as if they're massless.

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.640
And it turns out that that's
actually extraordinarily

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.014
accurate from the point
of view of cosmology,

01:16:52.014 --> 01:16:53.430
at least for the
kind of cosmology

01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:54.410
that we're doing
where we're just

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.380
interested in the effect
of these neutrinos

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.190
on the expansion
rate of the universe.

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:03.570
And treating them as
massless particles,

01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:07.620
I will shortly give
you the formulas

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:10.010
for how they contribute to
the black-body radiation.

01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.301
But it I think there's no
point in my writing them now.

01:17:12.301 --> 01:17:14.820
I'll just write them again in
the beginning of next period.

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.903
But they do contribute to
the black-body radiation

01:17:16.903 --> 01:17:19.930
and in a way that we actually
know how to calculate.

01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:23.280
And they have a
noticeable effect

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.050
on the evolution
of our universe.

01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:28.320
OK, that's all for today.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.020
Good luck on the
quiz on Thursday.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.280
I'll be here to help proctor.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.050
I think Tim [INAUDIBLE]
will be here too.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:39.350
And I'll see you more intimately
either at my office hour

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:43.180
tomorrow or at lecture
a week from now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.491
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:02.982
[RUSTLING]

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:04.473
[CLICKING]

00:00:15.407 --> 00:00:16.450
SARAH HEWETT: All right.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.770
I guess we can get started.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.890
So today, we're going
to talk about what's

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.540
significant in
laboratory measurement

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.165
and how to take measurements in
the lab, how to do calculations

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:27.640
with the lab, and how to do
some of the data analysis

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.010
when you have a lot of
quantitative data, which you

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.560
will have in the lab coming up
when we do the Ellen Swallow

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.755
Richards or the
Charles River Lab.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:36.130
One thing I wanted
to point out--

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.505
so there's hand-outs
in the back.

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.480
We're going to be going through
how to do the calculations

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.102
and how to do all
the statistics.

00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:43.810
And there's an example
problem that we're

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.948
going to work through
as we go in the back.

00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:47.740
So if you want to make
sure you have a copy

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.170
of that, that might be helpful.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.920
And one of the things
that was pointed out

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.930
this week in the lab
is that in the lab,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.000
there is a typo left
over from when we were

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.560
in the old labs in Building 4.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.443
And so this Wednesday and
Thursday, the TA session

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:02.110
that it says, the
help session about how

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.520
to write the
ferrocene lab report

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.580
is going to be in the lab,
not in 4:00, 4:30 as it

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.810
says in the lab manual.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.060
So just come to lab as normal.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.830
The beginning of
the lab period will

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.730
be a quiz on the ferrocene
lab, so anything procedure

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.615
wise, calculations, reactions,
all that good stuff, things

00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:20.740
that you should know, having
done the ferrocene lab

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.407
and hopefully having
started to write up

00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:24.620
your report a little bit.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.080
And then after the
first 20 minutes

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.455
or so, it's going
to be the quiz.

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:29.860
And then your TAs will give
a little bit of a lecture

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.280
about what they're looking
for in the ferrocene reports.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.750
So that's a good time to
ask any questions about--

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.630
if you're unsure about where
to write anything, how to

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.525
write anything up
if you have anything

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:41.900
that you've already written
and you want them to look at.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.080
They will be in the lab
to help you out with that.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.955
And we have some more
office hours, too,

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.080
that got posted to Stellar.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.850
And I will have a
slide about them

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.730
at the end of this lecture,
too, for more help.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.360
But, yeah, day four of
ferrocene-- come take the quiz,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.920
then get some help
on your reports.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.730
It is in the lab.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.188
You don't have to
go anywhere else.

00:01:59.188 --> 00:02:00.800
Just come to lab as normal.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.480
OK, so if we're going to be
talking about measurement

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.293
today, then we need to
talk about what things you

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.710
should be thinking
about if you're

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.880
going to measure something.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.130
So if you're going to measure
the length of this piece

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.460
of wood with this
ruler, how long

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.962
would you be able to say
this piece of wood is?

00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:19.330
AUDIENCE: There's no units.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.622
SARAH HEWETT: There's no units.

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:21.910
Yeah, that's a problem.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.408
What else is wrong?

00:02:23.408 --> 00:02:24.700
AUDIENCE: It's not long enough.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.470
SARAH HEWETT: It's
not long enough.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.054
So what's the minimum we could
say about this piece of wood?

00:02:30.054 --> 00:02:31.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.590
SARAH HEWETT: It's
longer than 1 something.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.480
So this is not a
great measuring tool.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.980
What about this?

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.840
Any better?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.210
Slightly better.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.960
So now, what could we
say about the length

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.620
of the piece of wood?

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.504
AUDIENCE: Between 1.

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:47.587
AUDIENCE: Between 1 and 2.

00:02:47.587 --> 00:02:49.310
SARAH HEWETT: It's
between 1 and 2,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.630
probably a little closer to 2.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.005
But we can't really say too
much more about it than that.

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:54.990
And we still don't
have any units.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.780
So this is just to
get you thinking

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.210
about what we need to be
considering when we are

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.620
choosing how we're going
to measure something

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.280
and when we were recording
measurements, what

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.430
information we can reasonably
get from the measuring tools

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.810
that we're using.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.330
So to talk about measurements
a little bit more,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.870
we're going to need to
talk about some terminology

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.350
and get this out of the
way, so that we're all

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.460
using the same language.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.410
And you've probably
seen these terms

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.540
before in your other
science classes

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.880
in high school and middle
school, going way back.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.000
But just as a quick refresher,
so we're all on the same page,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.070
precision is how close
repeated measurements

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.220
are to one another.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.303
So if you measure the same
thing a bunch of times,

00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:33.438
you would like the
results to be the same.

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:35.480
And you've probably seen
these bulls-eye diagrams

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.290
where if the results are
all really close together,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.820
that is very precise.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.150
And you can measure that
with the standard deviation.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.608
So the standard
deviation gives you

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:49.470
an idea of relatively how close
your points are to each other.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.300
Accuracy is how
close a measurement

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.160
is to the true
value or the value

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.390
that you actually are
trying to measure.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.810
So if you are
throwing darts and you

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.750
are trying to get the bulls-eye,
then if you have high accuracy,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.430
then you have them
all in the bulls-eye.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.388
If you have a high accuracy
and high precision,

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:08.070
then all of your darts
always go to the center.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.170
You can have high accuracy
where you're always

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.893
around the target, but
your points are scattered.

00:04:12.893 --> 00:04:15.060
And then you can have low
accuracy and low precision

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.779
where you're just
all over the place.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.769
We measure accuracy
by the percent error.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.310
So it's the error
relative to the result

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.660
that you're trying to get.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.045
And the answers don't need
to be close to each other

00:04:27.045 --> 00:04:27.670
to be accurate.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.587
Like I said, they can
be spread out, but still

00:04:29.587 --> 00:04:32.832
all close to the target value.

00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:34.540
So these are some
terms that you probably

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.160
heard there a little
bit, used differently

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.577
in chemistry sometimes than
you may use them colloquially.

00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:41.050
So we just want to go over that.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.150
More terminology--
absolute error

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.090
is how far away a
measurement is from

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.930
the true or accepted value.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.480
So if you are trying to measure,
let's see, with this here,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.360
pipette, this
pipette is designed

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.712
to measure 10 milliliters.

00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:57.670
And you can look at it.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.430
And it has a tolerance
of 0.04 milliliters.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.130
So that's an absolute error.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.840
It is how far away
your measurement will

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.048
be from the true value if
you're trying to measure 10

00:05:07.048 --> 00:05:08.650
and you measured 10.04.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.405
Then your absolute error
is 0.04 milliliters.

00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:13.780
So you just subtract
what you got

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.020
from what you intended to get.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.240
The relative error is
how far a measurement

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.880
is from the true value, but
it's relative to the quantity

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.620
that you're trying to measure.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.357
So if you've measured
0.04 or 10.04

00:05:28.357 --> 00:05:30.690
and you intended to measure
10, then your absolute error

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.823
is the 0.04.

00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:33.990
To get your relative error,
you'll make it a percent

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.330
and divide it by the 10 that
you intended to measure.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.910
So now, you have a 0.4% error.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.700
One way to think about this is
if you have an absolute error

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.190
of 1 milliliter when you're
measuring out 2.5 liters

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.660
of material, that's
pretty small.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.060
But if you have an absolute
error of 1 milliliter when

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.550
you're measuring out 2.5
milliliters of material,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.165
then that becomes a
much bigger problem.

00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:57.290
So depending on the quantity
that you're measuring,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.420
sometimes it's a little
bit more useful to report

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.030
the relative error
than the absolute error

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.230
and vice versa, depending
on the application.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.430
If you say, yeah, it had
an error of 1 milliliter,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.450
and your friends are all saying,
oh, you did such a great job,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.908
and then you say,
I was only trying

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:13.220
to measure 2 milliliters,
then not so great.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.490
Other types of error are random
error and systematic error.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.940
So random error is things
that we can't really

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.540
control for or identify.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.420
And it causes data to
fluctuate relatively uniformly

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.100
around a mean value.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.080
And that's one of
the things that's

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.230
given on the uncertainty
in the measuring apparatus

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.500
that you're using.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.420
So this pipette measures 10
milliliters, plus or minus

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.930
0.04 milliliters.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.290
That is a random or
indeterminate error.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.070
The data will fluctuate around
10 milliliters within 0.04.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.413
You know that.

00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:51.830
And you can control
for that using

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.205
statistical
analyses, which we'll

00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:55.130
talk about in a little bit.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.780
Systematic or
determined error is

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.640
error that has a known cause.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.880
And that could be from faulty or
poorly calibrated instruments,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.070
human error, or chemical
behavior inside reactions.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.345
So if you intended to
get 5 grams of product

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.970
and you got less than
5 grams, then you

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.690
know that there is
some error associated

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.240
with your experiment.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.140
And it could be because maybe
some of your iron oxidized.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.650
Or maybe you spilled
some of your ferrocene.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.900
Or maybe you were not tearing
the balance every time

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.410
you used it.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.580
So that'll introduce error
into your measurement

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.102
if you were using the
equipment improperly.

00:07:32.102 --> 00:07:33.560
Or if you're reading
from a burette

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.560
and you're always reading
in the wrong direction

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.910
or you didn't read to
enough significant figures,

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.930
that's systematic error.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.350
And so that's not necessarily
from the glassware itself.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.008
That's from how
you were using it.

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:47.550
And these are types
of error that you

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.500
can talk about in your
discussion section of your lab

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.220
report.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.170
So you could talk about the
error that is associated with

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.570
the measurements that you can
control and that you cannot

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.070
control.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.860
So the last term that we
need to talk about in terms

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.020
of when we're making
measurements or doing things

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.270
in the lab is, what does
it mean for something

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.690
to be significant?

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.590
So you may have heard of the
term "significant" figures

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.990
or this is a significant
result. What does it

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.450
mean for a number or
measurement to be significant?

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.670
And what makes a measurement
that we take significant

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.230
in the lab?

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.200
Yeah?

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.780
AUDIENCE: Ideally, significant
means all the numbers

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.023
that you're certain about plus
one estimate or one final.

00:08:33.023 --> 00:08:33.940
SARAH HEWETT: Exactly.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.690
Yeah.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.690
So a number is significant.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.299
And you report the
significant figures--

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.159
are in a measurement,
all of the numbers

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:46.270
that you're certain of, plus
the first uncertain digit.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.590
So a lot of times, you'll
have some sort of--

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.370
you won't have
measurements every--

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.830
maybe tenth of a
milliliter or 1 milliliter,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.727
depending on the size of the
glassware that you're using.

00:08:59.727 --> 00:09:01.810
So you can be certain of
some of the measurements.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.810
And then you're
uncertain of others.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.120
So in our piece of
wood, we were certain

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.470
that it was bigger
than 1, but we were

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.665
uncertain of the next digit.

00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:08.290
So we could estimate
that second digit.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.267
And that counts as significant.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.300
A quick review of significant
figures and how to use them.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.510
All non-zero digits in a
number are significant.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.230
Zeros in between non-zero
digits are also significant.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.087
Zeros to the left of a non-zero
digit are not significant.

00:09:29.087 --> 00:09:31.170
Zeros to the right are
only significant if there's

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.460
a decimal place.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.130
And you can avoid ambiguity in
that with scientific notation.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.680
So if we just go
through these really

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.490
quickly, how many significant
figures does this have?

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.744
Four.

00:09:41.744 --> 00:09:42.610
AUDIENCE: Three

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.932
SARAH HEWETT: Three.

00:09:43.932 --> 00:09:45.330
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.500
SARAH HEWETT: Six.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.190
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.644
SARAH HEWETT: Two, maybe.

00:09:48.644 --> 00:09:49.410
AUDIENCE: Maybe?

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.400
SARAH HEWETT: As
written, yeah, you

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.960
would probably call it
two, because the zero is

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.690
to the right.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.940
But if you wanted the
zero to be significant,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.370
then you could
write it like this.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.840
And now, how many significant
figures do we have?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.260
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.093
SARAH HEWETT: Three.

00:09:59.093 --> 00:10:00.675
And if the zero is
not significant,

00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:02.550
then to avoid people
being confused about it,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.758
you could write it like this.

00:10:03.758 --> 00:10:06.180
And we have two.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.760
So that's one way you can
use scientific notation

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.180
to get around ambiguity.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.680
Yes?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.097
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question.

00:10:12.097 --> 00:10:14.700
So for 590, if someone put a
decimal point after the zero--

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.513
would it be three significant
figures, or would it be two?

00:10:17.513 --> 00:10:18.930
SARAH HEWETT: So
that's a question

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.010
that I've always gotten.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.810
I think, just
conventionally speaking,

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:31.080
if you wrote something
as like this, maybe.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.340
More conventionally correct
would be to write it as 5.90

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.150
times 10 to the 2.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.817
Because you don't
usually have a decimal

00:10:37.817 --> 00:10:39.450
place if there's
nothing after it.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.890
And then if you wrote
it like this, though,

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.450
then you have four
significant figures.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.700
And that's more than you want.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.520
So just go with the
scientific notation,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.270
instead of having a
hanging decimal place.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.665
Because that's not the
typical way to write numbers.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.315
When you're doing math
with significant figures,

00:10:59.315 --> 00:11:00.690
if you're adding
and subtracting,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.150
then your final answer
should have the same number

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.830
of decimal places
as the number you

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.300
started with that
has the smallest

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.647
number of decimal places.

00:11:08.647 --> 00:11:10.230
When you are multiplying
and dividing,

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.060
the answer should be
rounded to the same number

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.680
of significant
figures as the number

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.150
you started with
that has the least

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.672
number of significant figures.

00:11:17.672 --> 00:11:19.380
So when you are
multiplying and dividing,

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.853
you want to count
up your sig figs.

00:11:21.853 --> 00:11:23.520
And when you are
adding and subtracting,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.980
then you pay attention
to your decimal places.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:34.190
So if we go back to
our piece of wood,

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:39.800
then using that ruler that we
had earlier, we can estimate.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.750
Maybe this is 1.8.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.490
So we have gradations
every one unit.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.210
We still don't have units.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.070
Whatever this is.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.980
And then you can estimate
this, one digit pass that.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.760
And then our uncertainty is
our gradations divided by 2.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.520
So we know that we are within
0.5 of the correct answer.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.620
Because we can
estimate that it's

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.600
within this half
of our interval.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.150
If we add more
gradations to our ruler--

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.410
so if we have markings
every 0.1, still no units,

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.770
then we can say with certainty
that our piece of wood

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.880
is 1.567 bigger than 1.7
and smaller than 1.8.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.250
So it's 1.7 something.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.230
You can estimate that
last decimal place.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.110
And then your error gets
smaller to your uncertainty

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.136
in that measurement.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.682
This is important in the lab.

00:12:34.682 --> 00:12:36.390
Because you need to
make sure that you're

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.670
choosing the correct apparatus
for the amount of uncertainty

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.240
that you want in
your measurement.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.990
So if you see something
in your lab manual

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.420
that says measure 1.2
grams, then this balance

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.560
is totally fine.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.470
Because the balances-- if
you've never noticed at the top,

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.300
they have the uncertainty
written on there.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.640
So the uncertainty is in
this last decimal place here.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.720
So if you want 1.2 grams,
then you can't get 1.2.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.880
And then your last digit
is the uncertain one.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.100
Should always write down
all of the digits that

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.190
are on the balance screen.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.680
But when you're going to
calculate uncertainty or do

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.340
an error propagation, then
you know that the last digit

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.900
is where your uncertainty is.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.847
This is plus or
minus 0.01 grams.

00:13:19.847 --> 00:13:22.180
So we have three different
types of balances in the lab.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.560
So you want to make sure that
you're choosing the one that

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.318
has the correct number of
decimal places for the quantity

00:13:26.318 --> 00:13:27.610
that you are trying to measure.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.202
And the same thing
goes for glassware.

00:13:32.202 --> 00:13:33.660
So the uncertainty
in the glassware

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.210
is frequently reported
on the glassware itself.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.560
And there are standard
tolerances for various sizes

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.560
and grades of glassware.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.980
So if you've ever seen
glassware that's volumetric,

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.320
it may say either
an A or a B on it.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.240
So the A is the
highest standard.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.480
And then B is a slightly
higher tolerance.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.380
And there are standard things
of those that you can look up.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.130
But it's usually written
on the glassware.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.500
And so this is an example
of the 10-milliliter pipette

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.178
that I was showing you earlier.

00:14:00.178 --> 00:14:01.470
So you can look at the pipette.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.320
And then on the top part here,
it'll say 10 milliliters.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.420
And this one says
plus or minus 0.04.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.690
This pipette says
plus or minus 0.02.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:16.850
So that one is calibrated a
little bit more precisely.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.530
These are also
10-milliliter pipettes.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.470
And you can look on
the top part here

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.970
to figure out what
their tolerances.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.460
These are both 0.06.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.960
And one of the other
things that you

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.655
need to make sure
when you are using

00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:30.530
different types of
glassware is to figure out

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.172
where the markings end.

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:34.880
So these are both
10-milliliter pipettes.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.340
And they are designed to
measure 10 milliliters

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.833
within 0.06 milliliters.

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:41.000
This one-- I don't know if
you can see it from here.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.690
Probably not, but maybe
if I hold it up here.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.132
The markings-- and
they go from 0 to 10.

00:14:47.132 --> 00:14:47.840
And it ends here.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.090
And there are no more
markings at the tip.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.700
So that means the only time
you're measuring something

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.685
is when your liquid is within
where the markings are.

00:14:55.685 --> 00:14:57.560
So if you're going to
measure 10 milliliters,

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.880
you need to start your
liquid here, end it at 10.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.390
And don't go below that,
because that quantity is not

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.920
calibrated.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.140
There are some pipettes
like this one that are also

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.670
designed to measure
10 milliliters,

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.010
but these have
gradations all the way

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.300
to the end of the pipette.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.008
So to get 10 milliliters
out of this one,

00:15:16.008 --> 00:15:18.020
you would fill it up to
here and then drain it

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.640
all the way out to the bottom.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.810
So you want to make sure that
you check your glassware ahead

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.390
of time to figure
out how much of it

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:29.333
you can use to measure
liquids and what

00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:31.000
you get if you empty
it all the way out,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.172
versus measuring by difference.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.900
If you look at your
graduated cylinders,

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.470
your graduated cylinders
are different sizes.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.510
And the markings come in
different levels of precision.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.590
So this has markings every
half of a milliliter.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:53.360
And its tolerance is listed at
the top as plus or minus 0.3.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.080
The 50-milliliter
graduated cylinder

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.900
has markings every 1 milliliter.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.050
And at the top, it'll tell
you that its tolerance is

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.580
plus or minus 0.5 milliliter.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.780
So again, that's the 1
milliliter divided by 2 rule.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.920
So sometimes that holds.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.493
And sometimes it's a
little bit different.

00:16:11.493 --> 00:16:13.660
Volumetric glassware always
has a smaller tolerance,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.250
so this is to 250-milliliter
volumetric flask.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.250
And on here, it will tell
you that its tolerance

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.302
is plus or minus 0.12.

00:16:20.302 --> 00:16:21.760
So you should always
look at these.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.900
And when you are
making measurements

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.525
in the lab, when you're writing
things down in your lab manual,

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:27.052
you should always
write down what

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:29.260
the uncertainty in the
measurement that you're making

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:29.760
is.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.410
So whether it's on one of
the balances or a volume,

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:33.910
always make sure
that you write down

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.940
what the uncertainty of the
glassware that you're using is.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.650
If you look at
something like a beaker,

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.180
this also has a tolerance on it.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.280
And it's plus or minus 5%.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.710
So that's a lot
when you are looking

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.720
at a 300-milliliter beaker.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.640
That's going to be
a lot more uncertain

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.120
than any of these other
measuring implements.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.950
So it's good to know
before you choose,

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.360
what piece of
glassware you going

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.902
to use to measure something,
how precise you want your answer

00:16:57.902 --> 00:16:59.470
to be, and how
much uncertainty is

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.100
acceptable in the measurement
that you are making.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.180
With burettes-- so this is
a 50-milliliter burette.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.130
And it doesn't have a
tolerance listed on it,

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.290
but it has markings every
tenth of a milliliter.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.130
So what would be
uncertainty in the burette?

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.530
Point?

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.599
So if the markings are every--

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.369
a 50-milliliter burette.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.290
The markings are
every 0.1 milliliters.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.835
So the uncertainty is--

00:17:31.835 --> 00:17:32.620
AUDIENCE: 0.05.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:39.840
SARAH HEWETT: 0.05, so plus
or minus 0.05 milliliters.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.180
In a 10-milliliter burette,
the markings are every--

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.080
let's see.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.020
I think they're every 0.2.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.166
No.

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:53.375
What are these?

00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:55.780
0.05.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:01.510
Yeah, these are every 0.01
in a 10-milliliter burette.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.350
So what would the
uncertainty be here?

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.330
AUDIENCE: 0.005.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.122
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:18:07.395 --> 00:18:08.770
So make sure that
you are looking

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.395
at what glassware
you're using, and you

00:18:10.395 --> 00:18:14.000
record the correct number
of significant figures.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.280
Because it changes based
on the type of burette

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.800
and even within different types
of glassware where they are,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.170
made different with
varying levels of quality.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.892
So we can make one measurement.

00:18:28.892 --> 00:18:30.850
And then we can figure
out what the uncertainty

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.270
is in that one measurement.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.450
But what happens if we
take multiple measurements

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.470
and have to do math with them?

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.510
So if you look at
your worksheet here,

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.010
this is an example of something
that you might do in the lab

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.830
where you have done a
series of titrations

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.150
to calculate the concentration
of some sort of HCl solution.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.650
So the first question is, what
is the uncertainty associated

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.858
with a 50-milliliter burette?

00:18:51.858 --> 00:18:53.630
We already figured that out.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.380
And then if we were going to
calculate the volume dispensed

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.495
in each titration trial
with the correct error,

00:18:59.495 --> 00:19:00.370
how would we do that?

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.500
So one of the ways that you
could think about adding up

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.280
the error in these measurements
is just straight up,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.130
adding the error.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:24.800
So for this first example,
we have 12.52 milliliters.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.500
This chalk is no good.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.660
And then do volume
by difference.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.460
We have 0.24 milliliters.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.200
And each of these
has an uncertainty

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:42.050
of plus or minus
0.05 milliliters.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.720
So if we added up the error
in these measurements,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.260
then we would get
0.1 milliliters.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.690
But it is probably
pretty unlikely

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.090
that both of these
measurements were off

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.590
by the full 0.05 milliliters.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.590
So this would tend to
overestimate the amount

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.180
of error in your final answer.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.135
So what we do is we
propagate the error.

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.760
And when you're adding
and subtracting,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.927
you use the absolute errors.

00:20:05.927 --> 00:20:07.880
Because you should
be adding quantities

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.220
that have the same units.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.240
So units will be consistent
throughout your calculation.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.290
And when you do this-- did
anybody subtract this out?

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.590
I don't know if anyone
has a calculator.

00:20:28.404 --> 00:20:29.270
Got one?

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.895
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.095
SARAH HEWETT: Great.

00:20:31.095 --> 00:20:32.845
So if we subtract these
two numbers and we

00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:34.140
get 12.2 milliliters.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.944
And then how do we propagate
the error for this calculation?

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.890
So our error is going
to be the square root

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.250
of the squares of the errors
of each individual measurement.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.555
So each one is--

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.980
so if anyone has done that--

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.670
or you do it in your head.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.170
Why not?

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:20.930
The answer that you
get is 0.070710678.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.220
So that's a lot of
extra decimal places.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.580
And what we really care
about in uncertainty

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.610
is, where is the first decimal
point that is uncertain?

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.170
What is that first digit
that we don't know for sure?

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.320
And so we always
round an error to

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.030
the first significant figure.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.160
So the error associated
with these measurements

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.133
is just 0.07 mL.

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.050
So to right this perfectly,
you would write it

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:51.630
as 12.28 minus 0.07 milliliters.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.730
And you can
calculate the volumes

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.930
for each of those trials.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.530
And then the error for all of
them is going to be the same.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.630
Because the error for
each of your direct

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.247
measurements is
going to be 0.05.

00:22:04.247 --> 00:22:05.830
So then we can talk
about what happens

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.510
to the error in a
calculation when

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.660
you are multiplying
or dividing something,

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.750
which is this next part.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.540
So if you're going
to use this value

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.720
to calculate the
concentration of the HCl

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.168
in this fake
experiment, then you

00:22:20.168 --> 00:22:22.210
will have to do some
multiplication and division.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.070
And you'll be using
different quantities

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.460
that have different units.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.660
So you can't just use
the absolute error,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.680
because they have
different units.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.567
So if you have your error
with your burette reading,

00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:35.650
that'll be in milliliters.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.608
If you have your error
with your concentration,

00:22:37.608 --> 00:22:38.440
that's in molarity.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.532
So we can't use
the absolute error.

00:22:40.532 --> 00:22:42.490
So we'll have to use the
relative error, which,

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.770
if you remember, is the
absolute error divided

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.430
by the measurement
that you've made.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.680
So you want to take
a second and do out

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.170
that calculation
for how to calculate

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.880
the concentration of the HCl.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.150
Then we can do it all
together in a second.

00:23:08.002 --> 00:23:09.710
And we'll just do it
for the first trial.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.230
And then if you guys want
to have more practice,

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.550
you can do it for the
others afterwards.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.730
So if we're going to
set up this calculation

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.480
for the concentration of the HCl
solution, where would we start?

00:23:42.545 --> 00:23:43.920
It's the first
thing that we have

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.200
to do or to calculate in this.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.360
Yeah?

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.652
AUDIENCE: Figure out how much
sodium hydroxide we have.

00:23:52.652 --> 00:23:53.443
SARAH HEWETT: Yeah.

00:23:53.443 --> 00:23:54.350
In what units?

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.030
AUDIENCE: Moles.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:55.900
SARAH HEWETT: Moles.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.775
So we can figure out
how many moles of sodium

00:23:57.775 --> 00:24:01.660
hydroxide we have by
taking our volume.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.580
And then we have our units,
our concentration return,

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.250
moles per liter.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.905
So we need to turn
this into liters.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.650
And then we can use our
molarity to get moles.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:34.460
I guess we could do that as
moles of NaOH in 1 liter.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.250
And then we can go from moles
of NaOH to moles of HCl.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.450
What's our mole ratio?

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.350
AUDIENCE: One to one.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.770
SARAH HEWETT: Too easy.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.442
One to one.

00:24:42.442 --> 00:24:44.602
Yeah.

00:24:44.602 --> 00:24:45.430
1 mole.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.740
And then we have moles of HCl.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.830
And then the last step is to
divide by our volume of HCl.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:03.380
Yes, which in this
case is 0.0100.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.950
Yeah, liters.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.310
And that should give you,
if anybody did it out,

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:22.350
0.60172 molar, hopefully.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.827
So that's our concentration.

00:25:23.827 --> 00:25:26.160
And now, we have to figure
out what the error associated

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.285
with that concentration is.

00:25:27.285 --> 00:25:30.450
So we will look at
the error involved

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.230
in each of these terms.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:36.360
So we have our error associated
with our burette measurement.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:46.590
So our first one is going to
be the 0.07 over 12.28 squared

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.952
plus-- what's the next
error that we have?

00:25:49.952 --> 00:25:52.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.370
SARAH HEWETT: Which one?

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.326
No, say it.

00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:55.312
AUDIENCE: The last one.

00:25:55.312 --> 00:25:56.270
SARAH HEWETT: Last one.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.360
Yeah, we have error associated
with this measurement, right?

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.930
And the error associated with
that is 0.02 milliliters.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:07.577
So you have 0.02 milliliters
over your 10 milliliters.

00:26:07.577 --> 00:26:09.410
And then what's the
last error that we have?

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:12.520
Yeah?

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.260
AUDIENCE: Concentration of NaOH.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.927
SARAH HEWETT: The
concentration of NaOH.

00:26:14.927 --> 00:26:15.660
The 0.04.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:24.410
So you have 0.04 over 0.49.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.110
That's how you will
calculate your error

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.710
for the concentration
of the HCl.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:42.930
And if you do this
out, you get 0.08.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.620
So then, how would we
report these two together?

00:26:52.202 --> 00:26:53.410
That's the thing from before.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.250
So what is this?

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.650
What type of error is this?

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.490
Is it an absolute
or a relative error?

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.463
Relative.

00:27:06.463 --> 00:27:08.630
So we calculated it from
all of the relative errors.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:09.797
So this is a relative error.

00:27:09.797 --> 00:27:14.710
And it's also-- you could
think of this as 8%.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.560
So in order to get it
back into a standard error

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.700
that we can report
with our 6.60172,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.160
then we have to multiply
these two together.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.248
And if we go back to our
sig figs from before--

00:27:27.248 --> 00:27:29.290
in this calculation, how
many significant figures

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.140
should our final
concentration answer have?

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:31.900
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.710
SARAH HEWETT: Two.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:33.850
So this has two sig figs.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.660
So we'll round this to 0.60.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.640
Then you can multiply that
by your 0.08 relative error.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.090
And your final answer should
look something like this,

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.740
way down here--

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:59.630
0.60 plus or minus 0.05 molar.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.680
Any questions about
calculating errors

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.100
and doing error propagation?

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.850
So this is why it's
important to make sure

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:10.385
that you have the
correct tolerances

00:28:10.385 --> 00:28:11.760
and the correct
errors associated

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.540
with all of your measurements.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.190
Because when you go to do
all of your calculations

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.020
and write your lab
report up, it will

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.110
be very hard to figure out your
error if you are missing some.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.010
OK.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.850
So now that we know how to deal
with the various independent

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.350
measurements, what happens when
we make the same measurement

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.050
more than once?

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.720
And this goes back
way-- probably

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.420
to middle school when we talk
about the mean or the average

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.630
of a sample.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:41.430
So in statistics land, they
call all of the possible values

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:45.428
that you could measure of
something the population.

00:28:45.428 --> 00:28:47.970
And it's really hard to know
the true mean of the population,

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.860
unless you have access
to the entire population

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.652
and you've taken all
possible measurements,

00:28:51.652 --> 00:28:54.480
which is pretty much impossible,
especially in the case

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.368
of 5.310.

00:28:55.368 --> 00:28:57.910
We're not going to be making
all of the possible measurements

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.942
there are for each
quantity that we measure.

00:29:00.942 --> 00:29:02.400
So in the lab, we
can take the mean

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.650
of a subset of the population.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.550
We call that the sample and
then calculate our sample mean.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.300
So population mean, if you ever
see in statistical literature,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.500
is denoted as mu.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.080
And then our sample
population is

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.417
denoted as the x bar,
where you just add up

00:29:15.417 --> 00:29:18.000
all of your measurements, divide
by the number of measurements

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.500
you took.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.910
And that's your mean.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:25.900
So we calculate an average or
a mean for the HCl solution

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.000
on the back.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.200
If you didn't do the
calculations from before,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.010
the concentrations that you
should get are 0.60, 0.61,

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.468
0.61, and 0.64.

00:29:42.468 --> 00:29:44.260
So if you add all those
up and divide by 5,

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.814
then your mean
concentration is 0.615

00:29:48.814 --> 00:29:51.340
or rounded to the correct
number of significant figures--

00:29:51.340 --> 00:30:01.037
0.62 molar.

00:30:01.037 --> 00:30:02.620
The other thing that
you can calculate

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.740
is the standard deviation
of your measurements.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.828
And so remember, that's
a measure of precision

00:30:07.828 --> 00:30:09.370
or how close all of
your measurements

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.695
are to one another.

00:30:10.695 --> 00:30:12.070
So small standard
deviation means

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.320
that all of your measurements
are very close together,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.210
very precise.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.020
And to calculate the
standard deviation,

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.020
again you could calculate
the standard deviation

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.760
of an entire population.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.230
It's the sigma up there.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.340
And then you need to know
your population mean.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.180
But in the lab, we are
taking a smaller subset

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.063
of the population.

00:30:28.063 --> 00:30:30.480
So we have to calculate a
sample standard deviation, which

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.240
is denoted as S. And the
major difference here

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.610
is that instead of
dividing by N, which

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.070
is the number of samples,
you divide by N minus 1,

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.328
so the number of measurements
you took, minus 1.

00:30:41.328 --> 00:30:42.870
So to calculate a
standard deviation,

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.550
you calculate each
of your measurements,

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.230
subtract it from
the sample mean,

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.980
square it, add those all
up, divide by N minus 1,

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.520
and then take the square root.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.843
And you can do this on
a scientific calculator,

00:30:53.843 --> 00:30:54.760
a graphing calculator.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.670
Excel does it for you,
any statistical program

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:57.253
that you want.

00:30:57.253 --> 00:31:00.223
You don't have to calculate
this by hand in your lab manual

00:31:00.223 --> 00:31:01.140
or in your lab report.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.870
You could just show
the formula for it.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:10.412
And then you can calculate
it using any sort

00:31:10.412 --> 00:31:11.370
of statistical program.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.170
So if we calculate
the standard deviation

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:22.260
for our concentration of the HCl
solution, then you should get--

00:31:24.763 --> 00:31:27.180
not going to do this all out
by hand right now, because we

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.222
don't have a lot of time.

00:31:28.222 --> 00:31:30.330
But if you wanted to try
it out later or check

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:34.590
your answer for somewhere
else, it should be 0.1732.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.560
It keeps going.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.408
So the standard
deviation is typically

00:31:37.408 --> 00:31:39.450
rounded to the same number
of significant figures

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:42.010
as the measurements
that you are using

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.260
to get the standard deviation.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.385
You'll see it reported
pretty frequently like that.

00:31:45.385 --> 00:31:55.470
So we can report our
standard deviation as 0.017.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.160
Since we are taking a mean that
is not the population mean,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.922
we know that we may
not have exactly--

00:32:01.922 --> 00:32:03.630
the mean of your sample
will probably not

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.100
be exactly the same as
the population mean.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.580
But you can figure out
how good of an estimate

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.950
your mean is, of the
overall population mean,

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.200
by calculating the
standard error of the mean.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.470
And that is done by taking
the standard deviation

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.080
of your sample and dividing by
the square root of the number

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.790
of data points that you have.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.180
So if you want to get a
better and better estimate

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.530
of the true mean
of your population,

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.410
then you can keep
increasing the N value.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:30.960
And eventually, it'll
make your standard error

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.270
smaller to a point, since
it's the square root.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.050
Once you get a big enough
number of N, then incrementally,

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.550
you get less and less benefit
from adding more and more data

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.092
points.

00:32:39.092 --> 00:32:40.800
But you can also make
your standard error

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.750
smaller by decreasing
your standard deviation.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.440
And so if you can make
more precise measurements,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:51.040
then that will also help
improve the quality of your mean

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.560
and how accurate it is toward
the actual population mean.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:03.280
All of this is leading
up to doing statistics.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.580
And all of statistics
is essentially

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.725
based on the
Gaussian distribution

00:33:08.725 --> 00:33:09.850
or the normal distribution.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:14.620
And you've probably
seen this before.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.570
And this graph is
an axis of where

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.660
the x-axis is the number
of standard deviations away

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.070
from the mean.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.050
And then the y is
the probability

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.338
of finding a measurement
in that space.

00:33:25.338 --> 00:33:27.130
So you can see that
the highest probability

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.120
of all of your
measurements is going

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.150
to be very close to the mean.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.983
So if you're taking
measurements accurately,

00:33:30.983 --> 00:33:32.995
they should be very
close to the mean.

00:33:32.995 --> 00:33:34.870
And then as you get
further and further away,

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.850
there is less probability
that some measurement you take

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.017
will be three standard
deviations away from the mean

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:39.920
and so on.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.983
So this number Z is calculated
by subtracting your number

00:33:42.983 --> 00:33:44.650
from the mean and
dividing by the number

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:45.608
of standard deviations.

00:33:45.608 --> 00:33:48.580
So it's just essentially the
number of standard deviations

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.440
away from the mean--
your measurement is.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.110
Oh, back up.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.070
We cannot go back.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.320
There we go.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.450
One way that we can use
this is to figure out

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:06.790
confidence levels of the
measurements that we take

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.110
or the means that we calculate.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:13.960
And so you can come to an error
under the curve analysis here--

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.610
or an area under
the curve analysis.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.489
And so for all
measurements that are

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:21.790
within one standard deviation,
plus or minus from the mean,

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:26.150
that accounts for 68%
of the area there.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.270
If you go within two
standard deviations,

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.130
you can stay within
95% confidence

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.105
that your mean is
within that area.

00:34:32.105 --> 00:34:34.480
And then within three standard
deviations, plus or minus,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:40.030
so 99% chance that your
mean is within that area.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:44.650
So we can use this when we
are calculating the accuracy

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.290
or how confident we
are that have measured

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.300
the population mean
with the samples

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.633
that we have taken in the lab.

00:34:50.633 --> 00:34:53.050
We can do this because of the
central limit theorem, which

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.449
states that the distribution
of sample means in a population

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.100
will constitute a
normal distribution,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.410
even if the population itself
is not normally distributed.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:01.960
So if you take a
bunch of samples

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.000
or take a bunch of
measurements in the lab,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.580
then you can use the
normal distribution

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.830
to statistically
analyze them, even

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.390
if you don't know the
distribution of the population

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.890
itself.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.200
So we can use that information
to calculate confidence levels

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.700
of a mean that we calculate.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:26.440
So what that means is we can
calculate how confident we

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:32.470
are that our mean falls
within a certain range

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.620
of the actual population mean.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.210
And you can say it with
different levels of confidence.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.760
You could say I'm 99% confident.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.792
And you'll get a wider
range or 95% confident.

00:35:41.792 --> 00:35:43.750
And you'll get a little
bit of a smaller range.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.660
And the range of the values
is what we call the confidence

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:47.568
interval.

00:35:47.568 --> 00:35:49.360
And you can calculate
a confidence interval

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.580
for the actual population mean.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.160
And that is your standard
mean, that Z square root

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.680
we were talking about,
times the standard deviation

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.700
of the population, divided
by the square root of N.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.400
To use Z as in the
previous slide,

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.260
you need to have a
big enough sample

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.860
size that your estimates of the
mean and the standard deviation

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.120
are a good enough substitute
for the actual sigma,

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.277
the population
standard deviation.

00:36:15.277 --> 00:36:17.110
That's really challenging
in lab situations.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.730
And in 5 through
10, we will not ever

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.200
have a big enough sample
size for that to be the case.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.350
So as an alternative, we
can use the t statistic.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.240
So to calculate a confidence
interval for a mean

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.740
that you calculate
in lab, you can

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.008
take your mean, plus or
minus the t statistic,

00:36:34.008 --> 00:36:35.550
times your sample
standard deviation,

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.470
over the square
root of N. And you

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:41.430
can calculate t statistics
using this formula if you

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.380
have all of this information.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.710
Or you can get a
table of t values

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:50.920
for varying confidence levels
and varying degrees of freedom,

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.650
which is N minus 1, which is
the number of measurements

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.193
that you took, minus 1.

00:36:58.193 --> 00:37:00.360
So if we're going to calculate
a confidence interval

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.020
for the mean of our
HCl concentration,

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.320
then we will have
something like--

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:16.943
we need our average, plus or
minus ts, square root of N.

00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:18.860
And you'll notice that
this standard deviation

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.090
over the square root of N is
the standard error of the mean.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.760
So if you calculate
that, then it'll

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.960
make it slightly easier to
calculate your confidence

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.460
interval.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.210
Yeah.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.360
And so to do that, we're going
to need some t table, which

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.070
gives you the t statistics.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:40.680
Our average of the mean
was 0.62, plus or minus.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.710
So the t value-- if we
have four measurements,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.790
then our degrees of freedom is
going to be 3, so N minus 1.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.520
And then we want to use
a two-tailed t-test.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.820
Because we don't know
which way our measurement

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.970
is going to vary.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.330
So the two-tail means that
it could be higher or lower

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.710
than the actual mean.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.470
So you want to calculate one
that has a value of 0.05.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.550
So that corresponds to the
95% confidence interval.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:23.985
And 3-- so 3.182 is our t
value and then times 0.017.

00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:25.735
And what you get, if
you do that out, is--

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.890
so when you're going to report
your 95% confidence interval,

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.955
you would add this number
and subtract this number

00:38:38.955 --> 00:38:40.330
from your mean
and then report it

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:50.220
as a range in parentheses,
so 0.593,0.647.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.108
And so that's your 95%
confidence interval.

00:38:54.108 --> 00:38:56.400
And so what that's saying is
that there is a 95% chance

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.730
that the actual population mean
lies between these two numbers.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:02.220
You are 95% sure that the
actual mean is in there.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.720
So in your lab
reports, when it says

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.540
to calculate a 95%
confidence interval,

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.880
that is what we are looking for.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.750
Other issues you may
run across in your data

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.760
is if you take
repeated measurements

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.170
of the same quantity.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.240
You may have outliers.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.588
And sometimes you
can look at your data

00:39:32.588 --> 00:39:34.380
and say, wow, there's
definitely an outlier

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.090
here and other times--

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.530
but even if you
can do that, it's

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.405
nice to be able to
mathematically demonstrate

00:39:39.405 --> 00:39:41.380
that it is, in fact, an outlier.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.820
And so to avoid subjectivity
in whether you're tossing out

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.850
data points left or right, just
to make yourself look better,

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.130
you can use the
Q-test to help decide

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.440
whether a value can
be kept in a data set

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.343
or should be rejected
as an outlier.

00:39:54.343 --> 00:39:56.010
And the way that the
Q-test works is you

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.980
take the absolute
value of the result

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.530
that you're worried about,
the questionable value.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.020
Subtract it from its
nearest neighbor,

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.020
so whatever the next closest
value that you measured was.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.888
And then divide it by the spread
of the data, which is just

00:40:09.888 --> 00:40:11.430
your highest value
that you measured,

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:14.450
minus your lowest value
that you measured.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.180
And then you have to look at
another table of standardized Q

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.810
values.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.720
And if the Q that
you calculate is

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.210
greater than the Q in the
table for the number of data

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.610
points in the confidence
level that you want,

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.680
then you can reject
that point as an outlier

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.640
at that confidence level.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.550
So the last question
on here is not

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.490
really related to the first
whole set of problems.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.320
But if you took the
following measurements

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.330
for a concentration
of an NaOH solution,

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.070
are there any outliers
in that data set?

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.990
So what's our Q calculation
for this data set?

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.008
Which result might
be questionable?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.910
2.86.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.780
Yeah, that seems to be a little
bit higher than everybody else.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.177
So our questionable
result is 2.86 minus--

00:41:10.177 --> 00:41:11.580
AUDIENCE: 2.52.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.930
SARAH HEWETT: 2.52 is its next
closest neighbor divided by--

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:25.295
how do we calculate
the spread of our data?

00:41:25.295 --> 00:41:26.873
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:26.873 --> 00:41:28.540
SARAH HEWETT: So 2.86,
which is our max.

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:34.180
And our minimum is 2.38.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:43.620
So if you do that out, you
get 0.34 divided by 0.48.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.800
So our Q value is 0.708.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.420
Now, if we look at a table
of values for our Q-test--

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.150
so we can either calculate
it at 90% confident

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.180
that it's an outlier, 95%
confident that it's an outlier,

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.160
and all the way down.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.700
So if we wanted to calculate
at 95% confidence level

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.510
that this point is
an outlier, then we

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.870
had how many data
points in this data set?

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.870
6.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:12.815
So we'd look at 6.

00:42:12.815 --> 00:42:13.535
95%.

00:42:13.535 --> 00:42:16.205
Our Q value is 0.625.

00:42:16.205 --> 00:42:22.580
So 0.708 is greater than 0.625.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.720
So is it an outlier or not?

00:42:29.512 --> 00:42:31.970
The Q that you calculate is
bigger than the Q in the table.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.262
Then it is, indeed, an outlier.

00:42:33.262 --> 00:42:36.550
And we can confidently
say that that does not

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.945
belong in our data set.

00:42:39.945 --> 00:42:42.970
Ooh, we're working on it.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:43.470
Come on.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.140
So you can see that if
anything had changed,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.090
like if we had had
fewer data points,

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.710
then it would not be an outlier.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.050
Or if you wanted a
higher confidence level,

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.190
then it also would not
have been an outlier.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.220
So it's a little more
strict, how far away

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.180
from the rest of
the points it has

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.847
to be before you can
call it an outlier.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.380
Last thing we're
going to talk about

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.420
is doing the least
squares regression.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.550
You'll make a bunch
of calibration curves

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:15.980
when you are doing different
measurements with UV-Vis

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.050
spectroscopy.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:20.620
So in UV-Vis, which you'll
talk about in the next couple

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.680
of labs, the
absorbance of a sample

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.020
at a certain wavelength,
how much light it absorbs

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:30.380
is related to its concentration.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.960
And this is a calibration
curve with the concentration

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.530
of bovine serum albumin protein
versus absorbance, which

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.180
you guys will be
making a similar one

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.820
in the catalase lab coming up.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.530
So it assumes that
one variable is known.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.490
So that's our
concentration, that we

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.140
have known concentrations,
and that all

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:52.420
of the variation in the
y-axis is linearly related

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.460
to our x values.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.890
So that's one
assumption that you

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:59.770
have to have before you
are going to make a least

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.860
squares linear regression.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.610
The way that you can
calculate all of the values

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:13.120
in a least squares regression--
which the whole idea of is

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:20.320
to get an equation for a line in
the form of y equals mx plus b.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.360
So that's the point of all this.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.402
And you'll have
different points.

00:44:24.402 --> 00:44:26.110
And you want to
calculate a straight line

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:27.748
through all of your points.

00:44:27.748 --> 00:44:30.040
So some of the terminology
that is associated with this

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.780
is the residual value.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.300
And so that's your vertical
distance between a point

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.810
and the line of best fit.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:38.290
So this is your residual value.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.690
Each point has a residual value.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.470
And the way that
the line of best fit

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:46.480
is generated in the
"least squares method"

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.300
is they take the square of
all of these residual values

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.470
and try to minimize it.

00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:54.940
And so you can calculate
various quantities

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.162
if you take all of the
x values, subtract them

00:44:58.162 --> 00:44:59.620
from the average
x and square them.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.135
Then you'll get the Sxx.

00:45:01.135 --> 00:45:03.010
You could do the same
thing with the y values

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.920
and then the x and the y values.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.360
The slope of the line is
this value over this one.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.760
To get the y-intercept,
you take the average y,

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.832
subtract it from the
slope and the average x.

00:45:14.832 --> 00:45:15.790
And then the r squared.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.960
This was a misprint in
your slide hand-outs.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.920
It should be 1 minus this
quantity in the hand-outs.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.960
The 1 is not on there.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.890
And so the R
squared value, which

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:32.590
you've probably seen
before, is the coefficient

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.190
of determination.

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.930
And that is a measure of
how well this best fit

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:43.280
line can explain the variation
in y in a linear fashion.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.580
So essentially, how
well do your points

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.830
fit a linear relationship?

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:49.540
Is that a good way
to explain your data?

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.020
So the best way to
generate this is in Excel.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.460
You could calculate all
those quantities by hand

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.085
if you want to.

00:45:58.085 --> 00:46:00.610
But Excel will do it for
you or your other favorite

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.700
mathematical software program.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.650
You graph your points
as an x-y scatterplot.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.358
Then you can right
click the data points.

00:46:07.358 --> 00:46:08.590
And it'll say add trend line.

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:11.350
And then you can have options
to display the equation

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.640
and the R squared on the graph.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.450
So you'll get your y equals
mx plus b equation there

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.590
and your R squared value there.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:21.670
So you can see that this
line is-- this is not

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.120
a very linear set of data.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.150
So your R squared,
ideally, is close to 1.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.910
And this is close-ish to
1, but that is definitely

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:32.170
not a linear relationship.

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:34.192
You can get it higher than that.

00:46:34.192 --> 00:46:35.650
And we'll talk
about that more when

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:39.250
you guys make your calibration
curves for the bovine serum

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:39.750
albumin.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.820
The Coomassie blue
dye is only linear

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.840
in certain regions of
the calibration curve.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.583
So you'll have to
calculate different lines

00:46:46.583 --> 00:46:48.000
for different
pieces of the curve,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.667
depending on what
your concentration is.

00:46:51.905 --> 00:46:54.280
The last thing that we can do
to get more information out

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.430
of a set of linear data is
to use the LINEST program

00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:58.210
in Excel.

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.810
And if you've never done this
before, you type in your data

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.850
as a series of x and y points.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.680
And then instead
of graphing it--

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.847
well, you can graph it, too.

00:47:06.847 --> 00:47:09.940
But in addition to graphing
it, you highlight a 2

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.850
by 5 area of empty cells.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:16.150
And while that's highlighted
in the first cell,

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.962
you type in equals LINEST.

00:47:17.962 --> 00:47:20.170
And then it'll prompt you
to highlight your y values,

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.440
then highlight your x values.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.650
And then you can
type true and true.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.900
And what that'll do
is if you type false,

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.087
it'll set the
y-intercept to zero.

00:47:28.087 --> 00:47:30.170
And we don't want to force
our lines through zero.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:34.050
So you will have your slope.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.880
And then if you press
Control-Shift-Enter,

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.890
even on a Mac-- so on a Mac,
press Control, not Command.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.410
Press Control-Shift-Enter.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.697
And it'll give you
this array of data.

00:47:42.697 --> 00:47:44.280
Once you get this
array of data, don't

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.655
try to change any
of these values

00:47:45.655 --> 00:47:49.460
or Excel will get mad at
you, so just leave it.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.378
And this is the key to what each
of the cells is telling you,

00:47:53.378 --> 00:47:55.170
because it won't give
you this information.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:57.570
You can look it up online,
or it'll be on these slides.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:58.720
So your first thing--
it'll just give you

00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.580
your slope and your intercept.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:00.510
And then it'll give
you-- these are

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.800
the two that we
care about the most,

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.583
are the standard
deviation of the slope

00:48:03.583 --> 00:48:05.500
and the standard deviation
of the y-intercept.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.110
So sometimes in
this course, you'll

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.270
make graphs where the
slope is representative

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:10.680
of a certain quantity.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.480
Or the y-intercept
is representative

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.390
of a certain quantity
if you're graphing

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.360
any equation in linear form.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.250
So then you'll have
the standard deviations

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:21.625
of each of those measurements.

00:48:21.625 --> 00:48:23.250
Then it'll also give
you your R squared

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:25.890
and a bunch of other information
that you want if you're doing

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:28.130
different statistical tests.

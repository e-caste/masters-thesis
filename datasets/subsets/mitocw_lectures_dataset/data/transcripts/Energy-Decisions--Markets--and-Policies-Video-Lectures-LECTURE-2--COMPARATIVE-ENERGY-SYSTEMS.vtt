00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:32.330
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So I want
to start with a small puzzle,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.680
if I can get this thing to work.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.640
This is satellite capture
of carbon monoxide plumes

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.300
globally.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.133
I'll let this run for
a while, and then I'll

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:48.440
show you another one that's
got more information but harder

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.420
to read.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.850
So the question is why?

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.970
Why are they where
they are, which

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.030
requires you to first figure
out where carbon monoxide comes

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.440
from--

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.290
which I figure most
of you probably know.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.160
Quick response-- how do
you get carbon monoxide

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.310
in the atmosphere in quantity.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.998
Yeah.

00:01:13.998 --> 00:01:15.290
AUDIENCE: Burning hydrocarbons.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.638
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Burning
hydrocarbons completely,

00:01:17.638 --> 00:01:18.180
incompletely?

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.050
AUDIENCE: Incompletely.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.467
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Incompletely.

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:22.940
So it's incomplete
combustion of hydrocarbons.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.150
So you see the red spots is
where there's a lot of it.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.885
A lot of energy is
burning hydrocarbons,

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:34.760
so it's not too surprising
we have this here.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.390
Let me start the other
one, which gives you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.850
a little bit of the same.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:49.790
You see a lot over Asia,
India, South Asia, Africa,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.420
some over Latin America.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.180
Why?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.150
How come we're seeing incomplete
combustion of hydrocarbons

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.500
in those areas?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.740
A lot of it-- enough to make
plumes detectable from space.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.380
How come?

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.220
Thoughts?

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.965
Yes.

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:14.050
AUDIENCE: A lot of those
are developing areas,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.405
and they don't have the tissue
processes to burn hydrocarbons.

00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:23.200
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's right.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.550
Let me restart this thing.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.580
So we're dealing with--

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.910
a lot of those are
developing areas.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.530
What kind of
hydrocarbons do you think

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.697
they're burning in quantity?

00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:42.790
And the plume that you
occasionally see over Brazil

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.090
is a fair amount of
deforestation in the Amazon,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.480
just large-scale burning.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.040
But what kind of
hydrocarbons do you

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.476
find being burned in
very poor countries?

00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:55.101
AUDIENCE: Coal.

00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:55.220
Coal.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.695
Coal.

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:56.195
Coal.

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:58.070
Wood.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.700
Coal.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.820
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Coal's one answer.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.320
What else?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.755
AUDIENCE: Wood.

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:02.255
Wood.

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:02.755
Wood.

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:04.200
I hear mumbling.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.090
It's very hard to
grade participation

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.620
when you do chorus.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.850
So just put up a hand.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.510
Take a shot at it.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.463
Wood's what I was after.

00:03:13.463 --> 00:03:14.880
They do burn coal,
and we're going

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.270
to see a fair amount of
that, but this is UN data

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.960
on the fraction of total energy
from quote, "primary biomass,"

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.790
which is largely wood--

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.310
wood and brush and
stuff like that.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.860
And you will notice
how high it is

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.640
in a number of poor countries.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.000
I was struck by the
Cambodia number,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.070
just because I was
there recently.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.240
But look at Ethiopia.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.060
Almost all the energy available.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.920
And these are estimates.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.320
You can't measure how much
they're doing and cooking

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.470
fires in remote villages, but
the dominant energy source

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.340
in those two very poor
countries is gathering wood

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.200
and burning it to cook.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.380
Most of the time, most of
the energy data you will see

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.140
does not have that, in part
because the best you can do

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.030
is estimate it.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.589
But historically, this is very
important as an energy source,

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.220
and it's still important in a
lot of developing countries.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.840
We will come back to this.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.960
That's one source of
energy that humans

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.680
use to supplement their
own before we began

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.570
using fossil fuels in quantity.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.700
What else did we use?

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.490
Yeah.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.290
AUDIENCE: Water.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.840
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Water, like water power,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.350
water wheels of various kinds.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.470
Anything else?

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.970
Yes.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.595
AUDIENCE: Wind.

00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:53.250
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Wind--
sailing ships, windmills.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.970
Anything else?

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.470
David.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.390
AUDIENCE: Horses.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.980
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Animals, yeah.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.040
And the availability of all
of those things varies a lot.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.660
I'm sorry about the fly in.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.800
I'm a little careless in
setting up the animation.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.620
The availability of all
of those energy sources

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.300
varies enormously globally.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.820
If you're in a desert, you're
not gathering a lot of wood

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.470
to burn.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.450
If you're in Africa, you're
short of domesticated animals,

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.130
and so on.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.040
If you look across
pre-industrial economies,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.763
and you ask what do their
energy systems look like,

00:05:34.763 --> 00:05:36.180
they're going to
differ, depending

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.550
on available resources.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.130
They're going to differ
depending on climate.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.420
Do you really need to heat?

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.310
Is it really important?

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.920
They're going to differ
level of technology, which

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.153
varied a lot in
pre-industrial times,

00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:51.570
particularly because
communication

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.760
was slow and erratic, and
the level of organization.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.930
When the Roman Empire fell,
energy systems changed,

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.190
organization changed.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.120
So I'm sure there are
other differences.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.930
So today, what we're
going to look at--

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.310
and just briefly, this is a
little bit like Wednesday's.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.230
This will, I think,
set a record,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.450
which I hope not to break,
for the number of slides.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.840
But this is background
and overview

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.370
of what the world's
energy systems look like.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.830
One of the important
things to think about

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.290
is when you go beyond--

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.330
this is the fancy slide
that I showed you last time

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.140
about national energy
systems in context.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.460
If you look at the
global energy system,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.540
it's more than a set
of national ones.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.090
There's a global
background-- if you will,

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.260
a social background of cultural
communications, rivalry,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
emulation, and so forth.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.430
Greenhouse gases
are a global issue.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.090
There is a set of international
institutions and regimes--

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.570
the World Trade Organization,
climate agreements,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.970
NAFTA, et cetera, et cetera,
that affect the global system.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.040
There are international
energy markets,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.510
international
financial markets, and

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.880
transnational
multinational firms

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.770
that link the global markets.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.550
So we don't have a
single world energy

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.060
market, and that'll become clear
as we go through the course.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.300
But we do have a lot of linkages
between national markets.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.610
So let's look first
at what's the world

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.640
look like in aggregate?

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.870
What does the US look
like in the world?

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.700
Then we'll look at
some differences.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.340
So that's what the world burns.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.780
You will notice there really
isn't any biomass up there.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.930
This is from BP, formerly
known as British Petroleum.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.380
This is how the
standard statistics go.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:13.620
You've got oil, natural
gas, nuclear, hydro power,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.125
the tiny little non-hydro
renewables, and then coal

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:17.625
on top.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.060
For the US, coal
was very important.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.990
For the world, oil is the most
important in terms of energy

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.480
content.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.260
Oil's share has been declining
for some time, however.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.380
You'll notice the total
world consumption is growing.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.970
Oil looks pretty flat.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.440
Oil share's declining.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.000
Oil share is declining at the
expense of natural gas not too

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.810
surprising in the US context.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.705
But the importance
of coal is growing,

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:54.080
which is a little odd if you
think about it, because coal

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.030
was the first of the
fossil fuels that

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:02.470
were used to any extent and it's
now on a global basis growing.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.680
And we'll come back to that.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.590
So in terms of the US--

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.860
these are a year or two old,
but they're about right,

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.410
we're about 4 and 1/2% of
the world's population.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.350
We produce about 15%
of primary energy.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.050
We consume over 20%.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.050
5% of the world's
population-- less than 5%

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.670
consuming more than 20%
of the world's energy.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.080
A theme I will sound
today is the whole world

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.690
can't live like we do.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.880
The arithmetic doesn't work.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.270
This is the point that
Tom Friedman makes

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.690
in the article on the list.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.840
He makes it in more
colorful fashion,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.820
but the numbers
are pretty clear.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.390
And we'll come back to that.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.580
This is almost
illegible, but this

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:05.160
is more than five metric
tons of oil equivalent

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.480
per capita, and down
to less than 1 and 1/2.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.060
You see enormous
variation in the amount

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.670
of energy consumed per
capita, with the US, Canada,

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.170
Saudi Arabia, and a few European
countries clearly in the lead.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.750
And countries where
there was all that carbon

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.400
monoxide-- many of them,
very low down in terms

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.190
of using commercial energy.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.270
So there's a lot of gathered
wood being done in those areas.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.950
Not a lot of commercial energy.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.060
Russia's high, Norway's high.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.040
I think that's Norwegian.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:52.210
In any case, lots of
energy, lots of variation.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.770
If you look at energy
use per capita over time,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.150
you will see as we saw last time
for the US, it's pretty flat.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.960
Slightly different data source,
slightly different measures,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.750
but flat for the
US for a long time.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:13.420
Considerably higher than
other rich countries.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:19.220
And here's the world
average per capita.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.620
Here's the US.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.420
Here's China rapidly growing
toward the world average

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:31.940
per capita, the growth of
China being a very big story

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.510
that I'll spend a little
more time on today

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.130
and then come back to.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.140
So if any of this stuff
raises questions, by the way,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.850
raise your hand.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:46.080
This is a session with a
fair amount of me talking.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.530
But if I have to just talk
the whole way through,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.550
it'll be boring for
both of us-- all of us.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.050
David

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.900
AUDIENCE: Why are we double what
France and Germany [INAUDIBLE]??

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.442
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That's a
really good question, isn't it?

00:11:56.442 --> 00:11:58.190
We're going to want
to explore that.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.130
Let me not say an
answer right now,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.216
but have you been to Europe?

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:04.910
AUDIENCE: No.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.910
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.750
You will notice that
the houses are smaller.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.210
Many of the cars are smaller.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.310
The cities are denser.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.800
The railroads, the passenger
railroads, are better.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.250
The activity mix is different.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.560
The countries are denser.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.430
There are a whole
set of reasons.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.770
It's not that we're bad
people, although maybe we're

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.820
bad people.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.700
But there are
differences in history,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.510
differences in circumstances.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.260
I'll show you how
several of these--

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.570
I don't think I
have the UK, what

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.650
several of the energy structures
in these countries look like.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.540
We worry about imported oil.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.410
That's all they
have, so you would

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.040
think they might act a little
differently toward using

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.130
automobiles.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.590
So there are a bunch of reasons.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.820
We'll spend some time on it.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:00.340
It's important to understand
why countries differ if you want

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.233
to change things going forward.

00:13:03.233 --> 00:13:04.650
It's important to
see what history

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.950
has done to get a sense
of what you can do.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.370
But just think about how
we use energy, how energy

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.900
could be used differently.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.490
I mean, people in
those countries

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.850
live perfectly pleasant
lives by our standards.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.560
They're just different.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.620
There was another hand.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.120
Yeah.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.370
AUDIENCE: I can't remember
what it was in the reading.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.734
I think it was [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:24.734 --> 00:13:29.820
But I remembered [INAUDIBLE]
Japan [INAUDIBLE] was less than

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.340
China's.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.210
Or maybe it was in the
units of America [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.630
that Japan had, like, one and
China was [INAUDIBLE] two.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.400
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Per
dollar of GDP, Japan is lower.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.560
This is per person.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:50.070
And China, despite its rapid
increase in wealth and income,

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.130
is still a poor
country on average,

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.870
and certainly in '07 was.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.360
I mean, that graph
goes up from '07.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.760
Anything else?

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.290
OK, this is gives
you a little sense.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.400
Tells you that the world
differs in how it uses energy.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.300
This is from BP, and
this is by region.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.360
So you will notice
that in Asia-Pacific,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.260
which will be heavily China,
Australia, New Zealand, coal

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.210
is the dominant fuel.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:29.030
In the Middle East, not
too surprisingly, it's

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:33.560
oil and natural
gas, and there are

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.340
various mixtures in-between.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.010
Here's North America.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.000
We use a lot of oil.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.290
We use a lot of natural gas.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.400
We use a fair amount of coal.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.830
So there are regional
differences in part

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:51.192
because, with the
exception of oil--

00:14:51.192 --> 00:14:52.900
well, not even with
the exception of oil,

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:58.060
transporting this stuff
globally is not that easy.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.960
It's easier than it used to
be, but transporting coal,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.900
to transport natural
gas, you either

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.190
build a pipeline or
you liquefy it, put it

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.330
in a very expensive
ship and move it.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:16.660
So the regional differences in
patterns of energy use-- again,

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.270
we'll come back to
this reflect in part

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.575
differences in endowments,
and in part transport costs.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:37.200
OK, David asked about why France
and the US differ in energy,

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.580
or European countries differ
from the US in energy use.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.470
Let me ask a broader question.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.050
What factors determine
differences in structure,

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.070
not just in level?

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.730
But if you try to compare
two countries, what might

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.430
you look at to
compare differences

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.910
in where they get energy
and how they use it?

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.250
Anybody, take a shot.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.400
Erica, you're writing
very, very diligently,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.842
and I didn't say that much.

00:16:05.842 --> 00:16:06.800
What would you look at?

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.858
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:13.650
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
To explain differences

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.290
between countries in how they
get and how they use energy.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.910
AUDIENCE: Well, one of
[INAUDIBLE] available resources

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.410
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.930
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Available resources, yeah,

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:21.630
that's a gimme.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.443
I hit the thing too quickly.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:26.610
Can you give me another one?

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:33.897
AUDIENCE: The standard
government, or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:33.897 --> 00:16:35.730
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So government policies,

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.605
which would come out of
the political system.

00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:38.430
That's another one.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.230
Anything else?

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.317
Mathoura?

00:16:41.317 --> 00:16:42.385
AUDIENCE: Very good.

00:16:42.385 --> 00:16:44.385
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I
hesitated, you'll notice.

00:16:44.385 --> 00:16:46.718
AUDIENCE: One thing would be
also, like, transportation.

00:16:46.718 --> 00:16:48.984
Like for example, if
the country's landlocked

00:16:48.984 --> 00:16:51.504
or if it has access
to waterways,

00:16:51.504 --> 00:16:53.728
it has a good system that
allows the transport of oil

00:16:53.728 --> 00:16:55.770
in and out of the country
and to various regions.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.300
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's a good point.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.620
It's not one that's on my list.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.170
It's the geography
of the country.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:05.910
Can you get various energy
sources like oil by tanker,

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:11.520
or do you have to pipe it
in or take it in by rail?

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.220
Another influence
is geography, which

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.230
is in available resources.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.810
Do you have water,
do you have wind?

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.630
Yeah, Alex.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.300
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say development history.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.064
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Development history?

00:17:22.064 --> 00:17:24.522
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so like what's
happened in the past-- like,

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:26.549
how developed
there's this country?

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.442
Was there previous
economic history?

00:17:32.442 --> 00:17:34.650
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So the
previous economic history

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.370
would be both, say, level of
income, level of development,

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.980
and you're suggesting how
they got there would matter.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.750
Say a little more.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.500
AUDIENCE: Or like how
fast they got there.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.570
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: How
fast they got there, OK.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:50.040
Did they develop in the 19th
century and put a lot of money

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.730
into 19th century assets
that are still going,

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.280
or did they develop
recently and were

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.970
able to use new technology?

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.050
That's a very nice point.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.200
The Chinese are building
lots of power plants.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.950
Their power plants
are, on average,

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.450
more efficient than ours because
they're much younger than ours

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.410
on average.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.000
Anybody else?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.690
Yeah.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.683
AUDIENCE: Like,
population density.

00:18:14.683 --> 00:18:16.350
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Population density.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.095
James, OK.

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.720
AUDIENCE: It would
be easier per person

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.678
to heat, like, an apartment
building in Japan--

00:18:20.678 --> 00:18:22.012
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So density?

00:18:22.012 --> 00:18:22.840
Yes.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.840
AUDIENCE: --as opposed
to a bunch of big houses,

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.492
but across Texas, per person.

00:18:26.492 --> 00:18:28.575
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: We
always come back to Texas,

00:18:28.575 --> 00:18:29.242
don't we really?

00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:38.190
[CHUCKLES] Some of that's
just people per square mile

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.000
and some of it
reflects policy, how

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.790
you react to sprawl when
you're doing land use

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.180
policy and other things.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.250
So both things matter.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.500
Exactly right.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.315
Yeah, Ryan.

00:18:51.315 --> 00:18:53.493
AUDIENCE: Well the sort
of products that you make

00:18:53.493 --> 00:18:54.910
and the products
that you consume.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:19:00.750
So like, an agrarian society
might use so much oil,

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.940
but somebody who's going
to be manufacturing

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.940
of a certain product would
definitely use a lot more.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.240
Also, if you're making a
product for your own country,

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.862
then you're going to make a
product for your own country.

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.570
So the consumption is
going to be higher,

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.840
so you're going to make more.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.900
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So the activity mix.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.460
So you get less
energy if the country

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.460
is a financial
center, like England,

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.700
than if it's a manufacturing
center, like China.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.800
When we looked at the variation
in energy use across US states,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.840
Wyoming was very high.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.640
And I neglected to
mention last time

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.370
that one of the big things
that goes on in Wyoming

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.800
is strip mining of coal
in huge quantities,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.830
using very, very
large machinery,

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.320
and not a lot of
people doing this.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.730
So that's rather different
from what goes on in Manhattan.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.850
So, yeah.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.320
AUDIENCE: I would say political
and geographical relations

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.735
with foreign exporters.

00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:03.210
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
how you can get your access

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.210
to the world markets, the terms
on which you can access them.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.490
Who is nearby, not
just what do you have.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.940
So China can get coal from
Australia, for instance,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.540
in ways that would be
more complicated if they

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.240
were farther away and
Australia didn't speak to them.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.220
And actually, I was talking
to somebody about getting--

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.850
the country of Lebanon
evidently built its power plants

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.950
assuming it would get
natural gas to run them.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.740
It has to run them on oil
because it can no longer get

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.660
natural gas from its neighbors.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.580
And as a result,
efficiency is cut in half.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.970
So these things do matter.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:42.926
Orson, you were--

00:20:42.926 --> 00:20:47.690
AUDIENCE: I think
that, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.708
if you're going to try and
develop a type of engine that's

00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:53.890
going to be sustainable
for your own country,

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.960
you want to try to do
something that the technology

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.530
in your country is
there, and there's

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.710
the people who are
educated to develop

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.000
those types of technologies.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.375
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So what
you're saying is you could--

00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:10.530
we talked about policy
just in general terms.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.750
But you're saying
very specifically,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.960
energy policy could focus
on a particular technology,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.360
develop local expertise
in that technology--

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.130
develop a cluster of people
who could then advance it,

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.530
and make it more efficient
and more usable and more

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.720
friendly for you, and
more economical for you.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.550
I think that's a good list.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.990
And for an economist,
it's a great list.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:44.520
I would, however, add one
other thing, which is culture--

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.620
culture and habits.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.550
I mean, the Germans
recycle relentlessly.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.630
We don't.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.410
I mean, we do, but it's nothing
like recycling in Germany.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.310
It's nothing like concern
for materials and packaging

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.270
in Germany.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:04.250
It's nothing like concern
for efficiency in Japan

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.660
or in Germany.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.230
The culture does matter
and does affect--

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.110
let's see, I think I've
got everything we said.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.310
Everything that people
decide to do-- the habits.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:21.890
Americans are persuaded,
we should drive.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.550
Automobiles are important.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.910
Well, that's not God-given.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.500
That's just part of the culture.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.550
So those things do matter.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.040
And one of the
things I mentioned

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.460
when I talked about
pre-industrial is

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.810
climate in the sense of
how hot and how cold.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:48.320
This is an old graph on heating
and cooling requirements.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.845
I don't want to go into how
do you measure a degree day,

00:22:50.845 --> 00:22:52.220
in part because
I don't remember.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:57.980
But it's a measure of how
much you need to spend cooling

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.020
and how much you need
to spend heating.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.810
Obviously, Russia
spends a lot-- has

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.460
to spend a fair
amount of energy.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.220
Heating, Bangladesh,
not so much.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.640
And of course, before the advent
of economical air conditioning,

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.050
these countries did very
little to deal with the weather

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.310
because they couldn't.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.640
Now that you can,
India in particular,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.920
you do see more
air conditioning,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.320
and it is an important
use of energy.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:35.520
Another way, just to do some
more of these comparisons,

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.070
this is requirements.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:42.110
This is a little
bit of the influence

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.580
of a couple of things--

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:50.170
first, activity mix,
and second, efficiency.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.710
This is energy intensity.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.190
Basically, tons of oil
equivalent per dollar of GDP.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.250
It's an old graph.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.100
It hasn't changed that much.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.160
You'll notice that Kenya
uses a lot of energy

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.710
per dollar of GDP.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.380
Is that because Kenya is
doing massive high-energy

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.730
manufacturing, or is that
because Kenyan technology tends

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.750
to be old and inefficient?

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:20.810
So per dollar of GDP, they end
up wasting a lot of energy.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.200
Japan, you will notice, uses
less per dollar of GDP--

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.620
and this may be what
you remember than China.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.620
Less than the US, Japan
has very expensive energy

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.290
for a variety of reasons--
very high prices,

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:40.390
very dense cities, very small
residences by our standards,

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.030
and per dollar of
GDP, even though it

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:48.210
does a fair amount of
manufacturing a lot less.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.700
The Russian story
is a combination.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.740
Again, this is 2003.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.350
It's a combination
of historically lots

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:01.060
of heavy industry and
cheap energy that led

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.560
to inefficient capital stock.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.830
In Soviet times, they built
some of the most amazingly

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.810
inefficient stuff
you could imagine

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.200
because energy was subsidized.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.570
Anyplace else you worry
about energy costs,

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.070
they worried less.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.980
So Germany does a
lot of manufacturing.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.450
It's more efficient than we are.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.670
Its energy is more expensive.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:28.670
So I will pause there
to see if anything

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.910
strikes you or anything
you'd want to comment on.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:37.650
I mean, you can run these data
we'll do a little bit of this

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.630
later.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.950
This is a bizarre graph.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.600
This shows changes over time.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.880
You may wonder why
the Russian Federation

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.490
jumps up right after 1990.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.670
That's, of course, because the
Russian Federation didn't exist

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.290
before 1990, and whoever did
this graph couldn't quite

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.030
do a not present.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.130
But you'll see a
couple of things.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.280
There's the US.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.380
Again, this is energy
per dollar of GDP.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.350
We showed last time a decline.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.960
Look at the decline in China.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.200
Look at the decline in energy
per dollar of GDP in China.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.950
This is just getting
more efficient

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.360
because GDP is rising.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.770
They're using new equipment.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.380
This is just an enormous
increase in efficiency.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.440
This is not doing
less manufacturing.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.220
It's just becoming
more efficient.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.870
There's a general-- and again,
Russia, enormously inefficient,

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:35.550
coming down over time as
they begin to modernize

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.410
their industrial plant.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.620
The others, there's a
general downward trend

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.140
if you've got an eye for it
among most of these developed

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.900
countries, but it's slight.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.440
In Russia and China,
they had a lot

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.330
of inefficient heavy industry.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.780
The trend is very
pronounced, but China

00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:00.110
is a very energy-intensive
operation.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:06.290
One of the things, of course,
that drives energy structure

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:11.580
is prices faced by
people making decisions.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.800
We didn't mention prices
on the earlier list

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.310
because prices don't
drop out of the sky.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.070
They come from,
among other things,

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.870
most of the things on the list.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:28.860
These are gasoline prices, 2006.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:34.380
The units are
dollars per gallon.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.540
I assume a US gallon.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.320
But you'll notice the big
difference between Germany here

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:46.290
at $6, the US at $2.50 at
that point, China $2.11.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.320
And if the graph
had more countries,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.600
I'm sure we'd see around $1 in
Venezuela, maybe $1 and a half

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.220
in Egypt.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.710
Huge range of
prices for gasoline,

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.250
which is traded
internationally, which gets

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.810
shipped around the
world on large tankers.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.490
That's policy.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.890
That's mostly policy.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.250
The Europeans and the
Koreans don't have oil.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.090
They tax it.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.210
The Japanese tax it.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.710
We tax it, but not so much.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.790
Mexico has a fair amount of oil.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.760
They tax it less, and
other countries actively

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.730
subsidize the
consumption of gasoline,

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:38.600
Venezuela being the most
glaring that I'm aware of.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.850
You may ask politically--

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.440
and this is the kind
of question we're

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.160
going to come to, how come?

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.820
How come Germany makes a
political decision to tax

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.540
the heck out of
gasoline, and Venezuela,

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.610
even before the Chavez regime,
makes a political decision

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.930
to spend tax money to
subsidize gasoline?

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.760
I'm not going to
answer that question.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.200
But it is the question.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.150
It is a social science of energy
question-- kind of a basic one.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.030
How does that decision get made?

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.200
Here's another one.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.070
These are electricity
prices, and you'll

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.090
see there are two
bars for each country.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.570
The darker one is
household prices.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:32.490
And again, there's
an effective policy.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:36.990
Prices differ between
countries that are nearby.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.430
Let's see if I
can find a couple.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.540
Here's the Czech Republic
and here's Germany.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.730
That difference in
residential prices

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:49.080
presumably reflects
policy, among other things.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.850
The lighter-colored bar
is what industry pays.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:56.300
Now, industry will always
pay less than households,

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.985
typically because it'll take
power at higher voltages,

00:29:58.985 --> 00:30:04.010
there are lower costs, lots of
reasons why the light bar is

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.070
always below the dark bar.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.900
But look at how
big the differences

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.970
are in some countries
and how small in others.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.450
That's just a-- compare
what happens in Norway,

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.150
where that's got to
be more than double,

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.760
with what we got
here, Italy, where

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.110
those prices are quite close.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.830
That is, in many of
these countries--

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:38.900
most of these countries, the
outcome of a political process.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.700
Electricity prices are
importantly political.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.490
Many of these are government-run
electricity companies.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:52.150
The ones that aren't in
the US are least regulated,

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.400
and the outcome of
the regulatory process

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.220
is, as we will
discuss, political.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:12.430
So when we talk about prices,
where do prices come from?

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.678
I'll just list a few
here, rather than

00:31:16.678 --> 00:31:18.220
spend a while on
this, because I want

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.590
to make sure I get through this
massive collection of slides.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.650
Sometimes, prices
reflect cost differences.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:28.750
We have a lot of coal.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.520
Other people don't.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.320
Electricity is
cheaper in the Midwest

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.910
because there's a lot of coal
and coal-fired power plants.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:40.060
OK, that's local resources.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.230
People use oil to
generate electricity.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:46.240
The price of electricity varies
with the world price of oil.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.520
Some countries, capital
and labor are cheap.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.280
Some countries are expensive.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.360
We talked about some countries
have efficient technology,

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.300
some countries don't.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.360
And it's not just
level of development--

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.120
not just level of development.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.700
It is, for instance,
house size--

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.660
how large your house is,
how well-insulated are they.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.670
Different rich countries
have different answers

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.800
to that question.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.593
Taxes and subsidies,
that's political.

00:32:14.593 --> 00:32:16.010
And one thing we
haven't mentioned

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.620
is environmental policy.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.250
US, Europe, pretty tight
environmental policies.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.600
Lots to debate.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.420
China, not so much.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.850
Russia, not so much.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:35.560
Those policies affect the costs
of producing and using energy.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.070
You can think of other
things that affect prices,

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.230
but I think those
are the big ones.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:53.700
You could do this whole
session on electricity.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.130
There are lots of
people in this world who

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.640
are off-grid who don't have
any electricity at all.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.540
So we don't have
electricity prices for them.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.650
And this isn't price.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.110
This is consumption per capita.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.140
Notice the world
leader is Iceland.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.690
Does anybody know why?

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.970
Anybody know how electricity
is produced in Iceland?

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.470
Yeah.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.360
AUDIENCE: Thermoelectric
generation.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.070
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It's geothermal.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:22.130
They use geothermal heat.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.540
It's really cheap--
really cheap,

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.060
and that's a local resource.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:33.880
Norway-- anybody know what the
dominant method for producing

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.120
electricity in Norway is?

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:35.380
Yeah.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.380
AUDIENCE: Hydroelectricity.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.963
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Hydroelectricity.

00:33:37.963 --> 00:33:40.360
Norway has a lot of hydropower.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.950
And again, if you're
lucky in geography,

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.470
you can have cheap
electricity from hydropower.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.470
Are you willing to
build a lot of dams?

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.300
Norwegians are also
environmentalists,

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.390
so they do worry about the dams.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.180
And Qatar is third.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.600
What do you think they
do, or what do they have?

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.620
It's a tiny little country
in the Persian Gulf.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.120
Yeah.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:04.510
AUDIENCE: Oil.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.260
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: What?

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.032
AUDIENCE: Oil?

00:34:06.032 --> 00:34:07.990
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, oil is a good guess.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.679
It's close.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.659
It's natural gas.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.850
They have literally
boatloads of natural gas.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:15.190
They liquefy it and
export it in quantity,

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:18.402
and they use it locally
to generate electricity.

00:34:18.402 --> 00:34:20.110
Back in the bad old
days, they would just

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.060
burn it to get rid of it.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.420
Now they spend a lot of money
freezing it, liquefying it,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.500
and selling it.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:31.270
But look at the world number.

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.540
Compare how much electricity we
consume with the world average.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.090
We're not among the leaders.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.179
We're pretty high, but we're
not the top two or three.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:47.070
But the world average,
my heavens, my heavens,

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.929
less than a quarter--

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.820
less than a quarter.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.440
OK, what I want to do
for a little while--

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.070
you may remember this
picture from last time.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.090
This is one of those
great visual displays

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.450
of quantitative information
from Lawrence Livermore.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.450
Lawrence Livermore, if
you go on their website,

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:14.250
you can find these for 2007,
which is why I have 2007,

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.660
for something like
100 countries.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.130
So if you're curious about what
energy looks like in country X,

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.530
you can find a bunch of them.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:27.360
And I'm going to show
you some variation.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.600
I do want to make a couple
of points about the US,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.690
because it'll relate
to others we will see.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.680
Notice most of our
natural gas is domestic.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.570
Most of our coal is domestic.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.450
In fact, our exports for coal in
that year exceeded our imports.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.500
We import biomass.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:57.120
I have no idea what that is, but
our worry about imports is oil.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:02.460
You'll notice for electricity,
we do a lot of coal

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.680
and nuclear and gas,
a little bit of wind

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.850
and a little bit of solar.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.990
Now, you may wonder what this
little yellow line, which is

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.380
solar going into residential.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.100
What is that?

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.970
Solar energy used
in the household.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:20.715
Yeah.

00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:24.730
AUDIENCE: Is that where people
have their own solar panels

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:28.765
and use that to keep their
homes, pools, et cetera,

00:36:28.765 --> 00:36:30.140
potentially
[INAUDIBLE] the grid?

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.520
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, probably in 2007,

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.680
it's a little bit
too big for that.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.930
But you're right about the
rooftop, at least in part--

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.070
solar hot water heaters.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:47.800
And we actually lead the
world in use of solar energy

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.300
because we do a lot of swimming
pools heated with solar energy.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.040
If you take that out,
we're not so good.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:00.910
But a lot of this is solar
heating of swimming pools--

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.490
a critical thing.

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.840
OK, so let me do a few.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.070
And again, raise
questions if weird things

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:12.490
strike you or don't strike you.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:13.465
This is France.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.700
What do you see in the
electricity side for France?

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.200
Yeah.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.240
AUDIENCE: A lot of nuclear.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.865
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
A lot of nuclear--

00:37:24.865 --> 00:37:27.740
a lot of nuclear.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.550
France made a
strategic commitment

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:35.520
to nuclear power years ago.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.740
Those plants are very expensive.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.290
They're going to
last a long time.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.210
There they are.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.352
You don't turn them off.

00:37:45.352 --> 00:37:46.810
You don't turn them
off right away.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.030
Almost all the coal
they use is imported.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.130
Almost all the natural
gas is imported.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.910
Almost all the oil is imported.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.610
Nuclear has energy
security benefits

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.850
for France, which is
an important reason

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.320
for that decision.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.970
It also makes France a
leader in nuclear technology.

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:13.720
To come back to Everson's point
about building an industry

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.150
and building a critical
mass, it's had that effect.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:20.700
France exports reactors,
exports designs--

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.750
a decision, but also a
decision based on the fact

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:29.440
that the natural endowment of
these fossil fuels is terrible.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.590
You can drill a long time and
you're not going to find oil.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.970
They apparently have some.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:38.920
I have no idea where it
is, but not a lot of it.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.920
OK, let's look at
another country.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.565
This is Norway.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.640
And as we saw up here, the big--

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.870
unfortunately,
different countries

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.300
have different sized
bars on everything.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.870
But you'll see the big
thing in electricity

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:02.110
is hydro, as we
discussed earlier.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.610
Norway is lucky.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.490
They have a lot of natural
gas, most of which they export.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.500
They have a lot of oil,
most of which they export.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.200
That's a country with lots
of natural endowments.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.500
They use some of
the natural gas.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.670
They use some of the oil
to generate electricity.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:24.050
And apparently, they
even burn some wood.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.680
But mostly, they
rely on hydropower,

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.530
and they export the
natural gas and the oil.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:31.690
Yeah.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.625
AUDIENCE: So Norway has really
high electricity consumption.

00:39:35.625 --> 00:39:38.035
And he explained that the
reason's mostly due to hydro?

00:39:38.035 --> 00:39:39.410
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Cheap hydro.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.910
Yes.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:44.750
AUDIENCE: Right, but Brazil also
has a cost of 70% to 80% hydro.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:48.110
But we looked at the
electricity consumption graph,

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.345
it was not even listed.

00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:51.770
Is there a reason for that?

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I don't
know electricity prices

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:54.930
in Brazil.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.030
I did look at this
thing for Brazil.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.013
Brazil is running
about 30% hydro

00:40:01.013 --> 00:40:02.180
maybe-- something like that.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.160
It's pretty high.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.790
But they may also tax it.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:11.600
In a country like Brazil,
where a lot of poor people

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.390
don't have electricity,
electricity becomes--

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.480
as it was in the United
States, say, through the '20s,

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.860
it becomes predominantly
consumed by wealthier people.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.660
So it becomes something
you might want

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.070
to tax for political reasons.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:25.820
I'm just guessing.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:31.640
I don't know that, and
I don't know the cost

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.430
of Brazil's fossil fuel plants.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.770
They don't have
coal, so I assume

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.300
the fossil is mostly oil.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.055
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:40.055 --> 00:40:43.640
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And
oil is not that cheap.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.120
Oil is not that cheap to
generate electricity with.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.210
Yeah.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.060
AUDIENCE: For the
right-hand side,

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:55.797
for the uses of the energy, what
does the non-energy box mean?

00:40:55.797 --> 00:40:57.380
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Chemicals mostly.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.302
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:58.302 --> 00:40:59.510
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Use oil.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:02.957
I mean, in the later US graph
that I showed last time,

00:41:02.957 --> 00:41:03.665
it didn't appear.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.410
Lawrence Livermore kept
it until quite recently.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.650
And I read that-- since
the only thing that

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.500
ever goes in there is
oil and natural gas,

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.302
I view that as the
chemical industry.

00:41:17.302 --> 00:41:18.260
They're not burning it.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.120
They're using it
for petrochemicals.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:20.620
Yeah.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.470
AUDIENCE: Why does
it [INAUDIBLE]??

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.010
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Different
parts of the country.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.220
Maybe it's that they've got--

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.220
I would guess this
is refined product.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.350
So maybe there is a
refinery in Sweden, say,

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:43.560
that happens to be
close to a major source,

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.220
so it's just easier to
import some from Sweden.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:52.360
Normally, this happens, and
you see it a lot of places--

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.073
well, you see it
here in electricity.

00:41:54.073 --> 00:41:55.615
For instance, they
import electricity

00:41:55.615 --> 00:41:57.810
and they export electricity.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.010
That's geography.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.340
You've got a line going here
where demand exceeds supply.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.130
You got a line over here
where supply exceeds demand,

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.240
and we do too.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.670
You import one energy
export at the other.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:13.710
I would assume that
this is refined product

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:14.820
that they're getting.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.190
There happens to be a
convenient refinery that's

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:22.560
willing to sell, and they're
exporting mostly crude.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.470
But normally, that's
what this will be.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:26.140
Yeah.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.580
AUDIENCE: Do most countries have
the same breakdown of energy

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.380
services in rejected energy?

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.045
Are there some type
of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:42:33.045 --> 00:42:34.878
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I
haven't looked at it.

00:42:34.878 --> 00:42:38.470
I assume they're similar,
because it has to do with--

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.620
I mean, it's inefficiency.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.690
So you're going to
lose a bunch up here,

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.840
depending on how efficient
your generation plant is.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.480
And how you do the efficiency
for hydro and nuclear

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.630
is just a tricky
definitional issue.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.980
Everybody's going
to have more reject.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.860
I thought you'd have
more rejected than used.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.720
I think that's what
we have, isn't it?

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.300
Let's take a look.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:07.490
There's France with
more rejected than used.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.170
There's the US is more
rejected than used.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.640
And there are the Norwegians.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.440
Aside from the
size of the blocs,

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.740
the numbers say more
used than rejected.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.670
Got me.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:19.230
You got me.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.590
Yeah.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.090
AUDIENCE: Maybe
it's due to the fact

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.880
that, like, hydroelectricity
is a lot more efficient, as

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.960
opposed to, like, nuclear
coal burns off a lot,

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.835
and a lot of heat is
lost or not transferred.

00:43:29.835 --> 00:43:32.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That may
just be how you define it.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.490
How do you define the
efficiency of a hydro plant?

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.570
I don't know what they do
in terms of the efficiency.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.190
I'd have to look.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:48.660
In transportation, you've
got more waste than used.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:52.560
In industrial, the reverse.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:44:01.440
In household, in commercial,
yeah, if I read--

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.510
I can't tell how much
is going down here.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.930
I can't sort it out by sector.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.340
That's a departure.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.930
Most countries have
more rejected than used.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.792
It might be the hydro.

00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:14.130
Yeah, Matthew.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.860
AUDIENCE: What would
cause a country that

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:20.373
has such large domestic amounts
of natural gas and petroleum

00:44:20.373 --> 00:44:22.235
to develop hydro like they do?

00:44:22.235 --> 00:44:25.220
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: They
developed the hydro earlier.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:29.920
So the hydro is earlier, and
then they found the natural gas

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.940
and petroleum offshore later.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.000
And they worked very
hard at learning

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.250
how to manage hydro systems.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:43.120
It's actually a little tricky
because it doesn't always rain

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.360
and the snow doesn't always
melt when you want it to.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.620
And they also worked very
hard to develop hydro

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:54.460
without wrecking
the environment.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.350
So once you've got
that capability

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:59.860
and you're good at it, and
you've got the geography

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.470
and you discover you've got
a lot of natural gas and oil

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.290
offshore, it may make
more sense to export

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.670
that than to burn it locally.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:08.170
Yeah.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.900
AUDIENCE: Could you please give
examples of energy services

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.992
which is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:13.992 --> 00:45:15.700
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Oh, energy services?

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:24.740
Driving, running factories.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:30.020
And this is mostly
heating, ventilating,

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.790
and air conditioning, but
electric ranges, refrigerators,

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:36.790
running your computer,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:40.600
all the things you use it for.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.410
This is puzzling.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:44.260
AUDIENCE: But doesn't it come
from the electricity and heat?

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.716
I would [INAUDIBLE] it on
the left side of that box.

00:45:47.716 --> 00:45:49.510
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, your computer

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:53.110
doesn't use 100% of the
energy and the electricity

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.310
for useful work.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:56.290
There's waste heat.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:59.290
Your refrigerator wastes--
there's waste heat that

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.415
comes off the refrigerator.

00:46:00.415 --> 00:46:01.832
AUDIENCE: There's
more [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:01.832 --> 00:46:03.360
services than
electricity and heat.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.955
There's 640 versus--

00:46:04.955 --> 00:46:08.930
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
here you're running machinery.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.760
I mean-- oh, I see
what you're saying.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.670
I mean, here you're running
a car from gasoline.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:18.570
Here, you are running
machinery of various kinds.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:19.200
I don't know.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.680
I'd have to list it.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:29.307
And you're also burning
oil directly to heat.

00:46:29.307 --> 00:46:31.640
You're burning oil directly
to heat in all these places.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.070
We'll go through
some other examples,

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.650
but I'm not sure
what you're missing.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:46.240
I guess the thing to think of
is what do you use energy for.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.300
I used it for my electric
toothbrush this morning.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.410
That's an energy service.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.445
Energy powered that
little machine.

00:46:56.445 --> 00:46:57.820
That's something
that energy did.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.760
I mean, you don't
want electricity.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.850
You want things that
electricity runs.

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:07.130
I care about keeping
the food cold.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:09.890
I get no utility from
the electricity that

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.140
runs through the refrigerator.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.550
The service is
keeping the food cold.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.400
The service is
the refrigeration.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.470
The energy input is
the energy input.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.840
That's produced by
energy and capital.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.470
Capital in the refrigerator
energy comes into it.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:31.572
Now, we'll come back.

00:47:31.572 --> 00:47:32.780
What else have I got for you?

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:33.613
Oh, there's Germany.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.860
Germany also uses a fair
amount of nuclear, which it

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.210
says it's going to shut down.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.430
And it has shut
down a fair amount.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.174
It also uses coal.

00:47:49.174 --> 00:47:51.700
It also buys electricity,
and will probably

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.400
buy more electricity
from France if it shuts

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.000
those nuclear plants down fast.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.990
Germany, again, has coal,
but doesn't really--

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.860
it does have coal, but it
really doesn't have natural gas

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.520
and it doesn't have
any oil to speak of.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.040
There again, you'll see
it's importing a ton of oil

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.450
and exporting some.

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:17.020
And this has got to
be refined product,

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.690
and less stuff just gets shipped
through on a tanker somehow.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:29.310
But actually,
that's interesting.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:33.150
This has got to be heat.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.370
You'll notice it uses
this particular color

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.480
for electricity.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.590
And then coming out of
here is this red band.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:45.360
In a lot of countries,
much more than in the US,

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.860
power plants provide
heat to nearby buildings.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.880
So it's called district heating
or combined heat and power.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:58.250
And that has to be what this red
is, because it's not nuclear.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:01.475
This has got to be heat
going to nearby industry.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.670
Anything else weird here?

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:12.630
Not much, except you'll see
solar going into commercial.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:17.670
Germany has big solar
subsidies, and that may actually

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:21.570
be solar panels on the roofs
of warehouses and stores.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:26.920
It may be big enough to
register, even in 2007.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.950
Anything else here?

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:32.670
Oh, and the natural gas export--
most of Germany's natural gas

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.190
comes from Russia.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:38.710
So if you want to worry
about energy security,

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:41.470
worry about energy security.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.170
And that's just transshipment
of some Russian gas.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.810
This is Japan.

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:50.880
Now if you want to worry
about energy security,

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.360
look over on the left.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.600
Everything is imported.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.780
Nuclear power's important.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:03.018
Nuclear plants are being
shut down, or are shut down.

00:50:03.018 --> 00:50:05.310
I'm not sure whether there's
anything currently running

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:05.893
at the moment.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:12.510
You wonder why Japan
is energy efficient.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.880
Suppose you're having
a political debate

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.790
about energy policy, and you
look at the left-hand side

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:19.520
of this graph.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.210
And you worry about
energy security,

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.837
and you say, well, we
can build nuclear plants

00:50:25.837 --> 00:50:28.420
and develop an efficient nuclear
industry, which they've done.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:36.210
Not clear what else you can do
but be efficient in energy use.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:41.700
Small houses, taxes on energy
to hold down consumption,

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.480
and so on and so forth.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:48.070
So to some extent, the natural
endowment and other things

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:54.280
will drive the local policy,
will drive the energy mix.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.880
So let's leave the
developed world.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:02.320
There is a middle
income neighbor, Mexico.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.740
Mexico has oil.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.490
Mexico is a significant
oil exporter.

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.710
Mexico's oil production
is declining.

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:18.150
So Mexico has a
long-term problem,

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:21.780
but it heavily uses its
oil and its natural gas

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.475
to generate electricity.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:29.020
What else do I want to say?

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.760
Oh, all of these
have electricity

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.000
going into transportation.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.340
And that's not electric
cars in Mexico in 2007.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.005
That's railroads
and mass transit.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:52.380
So what else do
we see in Mexico?

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.280
Not too much.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.670
Anything grab you?

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:58.912
Yeah.

00:51:58.912 --> 00:52:00.870
AUDIENCE: I noticed that
all their solar energy

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:03.110
is going directly to
commercial, and that [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:04.080
use electricity.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.480
What do you think that
they might be using it for,

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.160
on the commercial level?

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.760
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Hot
water would be my guess.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:16.680
Solar hot water is a pretty
mature, pretty widespread

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.190
technology.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.930
I'm surprised we
don't see more of it

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:22.410
residential, because that's
a pretty good climate for it.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.200
And electricity is not that
cheap or reliable in Mexico.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:25.890
Yeah.

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:29.078
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] had
my hand raised before that.

00:52:29.078 --> 00:52:31.170
I'm just going to ask
something more general.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:32.253
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Sure.

00:52:32.253 --> 00:52:34.470
AUDIENCE: I noticed that
for Germany, [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:36.470
in Japan [INAUDIBLE] nuclear.

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:39.850
I just though, given
their endowments,

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:43.890
that especially for Germany,
making such a hard decision

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:48.830
about closing all their
nuclear, I just didn't know--

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:50.730
a general comment
about countries.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:55.980
Why would you just go ahead
and purchase a huge blow

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:56.850
to yourself?

00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:59.916
Because you don't have
so many other resources?

00:52:59.916 --> 00:53:04.390
[INAUDIBLE] so maybe
they're scared,

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:07.500
so they want to veer
away from the nuclear.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:10.200
But given their situation,
as you said other,

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.620
than being extra
efficient, you may be

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:16.720
forced to go down some roads.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.150
And I'm just curious to see
why any political process,

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.728
or lobbying, or whatever could
have happened to lead you

00:53:23.728 --> 00:53:26.210
down the quite tricky
road, especially

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:30.420
with nuclear generators shutting
down on a very small fraction,

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:31.420
if I remember correctly.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.380
And they have to
replace that with,

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.310
what, the natural gas in Russia.

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:37.010
[INAUDIBLE] Russia [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:40.080
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It's caused
a lot of people outside Germany

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.480
to scratch their heads.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.160
But you got to remember, Germany
has a very, very powerful Green

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.390
Party.

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:49.950
The environmental
movement in Germany

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:54.270
is stronger than here--
stronger than a lot of places.

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:57.150
It was a political calculation.

00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:02.820
Mrs. Merkel is not crazy
and she's not dumb.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.130
So to answer that question--

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:06.307
I mean, I've read answers.

00:54:06.307 --> 00:54:07.890
I can't reproduce
them because I don't

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.650
know the German
system that well,

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.390
but that's a
political calculation.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.780
It remains to be seen how
quickly they do it, in fact.

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.800
It remains to be seen what
the public reaction is going

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.740
to be when they realize how
much nuclear electricity

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:30.580
they're importing from
France right next door

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:34.900
and elsewhere to fill the gap.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:39.610
They are also heavily committed
to renewables, and have been.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.610
They're going to spend
a lot of money building

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:46.870
offshore windmills, which won't
replace nuclear power plants,

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:50.290
because the wind
doesn't always blow,

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:55.210
but that's part of the
political calculus.

00:54:55.210 --> 00:55:01.210
If you were a green eyeshade
economist, and you said,

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:05.530
well, the public
overstates the risk--

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:09.430
Germany doesn't have
that many tidal waves,

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:13.060
these reactors are inland,
we're not earthquake prone,

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:19.810
these facilities are much
safer, what we really should do

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:26.510
is take a deep breath, review
our safety considerations,

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.970
and go on, and
reconsider how much we

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:32.390
want to do with nuclear versus
renewables going forward.

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:37.790
But that's a green eyeshade
cost-benefit calculation.

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:42.290
The political world, as
we will discuss next week,

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:45.600
is not always the
green eyeshade world.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:52.510
It's a world in which you may do
things because of their impact

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:55.990
on your political
situation, on your ability

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:59.530
to get something else done, or
your ability to maintain office

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:03.700
or a variety of other things
that have economic costs.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:08.370
Not irrational, but a
different kind of calculation,

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:11.390
which I hope at the end
of this semester we all

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:14.060
come a little closer
to understanding.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.550
But that's a hard one.

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:18.140
That one in particular is hard.

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.460
People gasped.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.040
Even knowledgeable
people gasped.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.960
The current, or is he former,
German foreign minister,

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.930
who came from the Green
Party, spoke at MIT

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:34.130
toward the end of last
semester about that.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.470
And I went to the talk, and
I actually went to dinner

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.440
with him afterward.

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.990
And it still isn't clear to
say what they were thinking

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:49.340
and why, because I don't know
German politics well enough.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.650
OK, good question.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:54.240
There's China.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:59.530
China, you'll notice,
has a lot of coal,

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:01.480
and their electricity
is driven--

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.323
2007 is true, still
true, driven by coal.

00:57:06.323 --> 00:57:07.240
We have a lot of coal.

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.220
China has a lot of coal.

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.810
They burn the coal.

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:16.050
Building power plants
at a rapid rate.

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:20.310
That's the main
story here I think

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:21.825
that's of any interesting.

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.000
This is India.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.460
India is not as
wealthy as China.

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.960
India has some coal.

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.060
Oil is imported.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:37.940
Now you see biomass in
the residential area,

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.800
oddly enough, much
more important in India

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:45.550
than in China, structure
of villages and so forth.

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:47.470
But this is an estimate
now, basically,

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:50.980
of wood being burned
to cook, rather than

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:54.370
other fuels being used.

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:59.068
And electricity is
again dominated by coal.

00:57:59.068 --> 00:58:00.235
Most of the oil is imported.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:08.540
with again, some exports, which
have to be refined product.

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:09.040
Yeah.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.880
AUDIENCE: So a lot
of the breakdowns

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.805
we've been looking at
are all by the country.

00:58:12.805 --> 00:58:13.420
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yes.

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.700
AUDIENCE: But some of these
countries are really big.

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:19.700
Would it make sense,
especially for internal policy,

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:22.010
to look at different
regions, especially

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:23.160
like in India and China?

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.375
I feel like this big picture
blurs things together.

00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:28.460
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, you're right.

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.150
These are the data we have.

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:32.840
There's some work
ongoing at MIT,

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.660
in the joint program on
the Science and Policy

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:39.410
of Global Change to
model China regionally.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:41.420
And of course, you can
model the US regionally.

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.660
That model exists.

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:46.820
And when you do Europe,
you're modeling,

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.380
to some extent,
bite-sized countries.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.100
But you're right.

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.050
India and China are anomalous.

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:56.630
I think that the
basic story, coal

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.990
is the big driver, that's true.

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:02.720
They're putting photovoltaics
in Western China,

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:08.120
but the big story is coal
and some offshore oil.

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.180
Similarly in India,
but of course,

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.810
you don't have cooking
fires in downtown Mumbai.

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:17.060
So this notion
that there's a lot

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:21.410
of mass going into residential
use, that's true in aggregate.

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:22.580
It's not true everywhere.

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:23.930
Can't be true everywhere.

00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:25.640
There are places in
the deserts where

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.830
there isn't that
much wind, and there

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.480
are metropolitan
areas where it's

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.330
tough to gather wood to cook.

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:36.080
So you're right, these
are big countries.

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.205
Doing this was heroic.

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:48.150
As I say, there are projects
on now to disaggregate China.

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.790
But they aren't that good--

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:51.780
they aren't that good.

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.040
Yeah.

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.430
AUDIENCE: I noticed that almost
all the electricity and heat

00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:59.010
that India generates goes
to this rejected energy.

00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:00.840
Is that just because
they're using

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.725
inefficient,
outdated generators?

01:00:04.725 --> 01:00:06.943
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That
would be my guess, yeah.

01:00:06.943 --> 01:00:08.110
Yeah, I hadn't noticed that.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:12.390
But you're right, as
compared to-- let's see.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:15.390
Yeah, just by i
the relative size

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:21.150
of the useful and the wasted
are different in China,

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:24.210
where the plants are
newer than in India.

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.766
Yeah, I think that's right.

01:00:26.766 --> 01:00:29.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] stay
there, the electricity grid.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.293
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, that's true, too.

01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:33.060
The Chinese grid is
much more modern.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:36.330
China has a lot of
very high voltage lines

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:37.320
that are quite new.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.150
Their losses are less.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:42.690
So also, often, you
measure rejected

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:46.140
as the difference between
stuff that's generated

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.060
and stuff that gets paid for.

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:52.560
So a lot of these countries
have huge numbers for losses,

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.820
and a lot of that's theft.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.890
I don't know if
that's true here,

01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:58.140
but I know it's
true in some places.

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:00.270
OK, there's India.

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:01.860
Just for humor,
here's Saudi Arabia.

01:01:04.842 --> 01:01:06.410
[CHUCKLES]

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:07.957
They use oil and
gas for everything.

01:01:07.957 --> 01:01:09.290
Don't bother with anything else.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.870
And they appear to
import wood for fires.

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:13.490
I don't know what that's about.

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.310
But you notice all the
biomass is, imported

01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:17.690
and it's all residential.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.090
And I assume that
fires for show.

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:23.330
I don't know what that is.

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:26.810
And there is a poor
country, and poor countries

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:29.410
tend to look like that.

01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:33.020
A lot of biomass, all
the oil is imported,

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:38.470
all the coal's imported, little
snippets of other things.

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:44.050
And then just to really get
there, there's Cambodia.

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:46.120
Some hydro, I don't
know where it is.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.870
Well, I do know where
it is-- not much of it.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:54.790
Domestic biomass
used in residences.

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:59.420
All the oil is imported,
used to power motorbikes.

01:01:59.420 --> 01:01:59.920
Yeah.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.190
AUDIENCE: Do you
know what biomass is?

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:06.325
I know it shows it on the left
side of the box [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:06.325 --> 01:02:08.950
domestic, but it doesn't do that
for wood, [INAUDIBLE],, hydro,

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:10.658
and solar energy.

01:02:10.658 --> 01:02:12.700
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
here, there isn't any.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.160
Hydro is domestic.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.832
If you import electricity as
they do, it shows up here.

01:02:17.832 --> 01:02:18.790
AUDIENCE: Right, right.

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:21.082
So biomass always comes up
on the left side of the box,

01:02:21.082 --> 01:02:24.116
even though it's still domestic,
whereas like solar and hydro

01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:25.810
[INAUDIBLE].

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:28.440
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I'm not sure.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.950
There is some-- I'm
not sure what you mean.

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.560
AUDIENCE: The source is biomass
as domestic, as well as solar,

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.712
or geothermal, or--

01:02:35.712 --> 01:02:37.920
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I think
solar and geothermal are

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.660
by definition
domestic, since these

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.720
are used except for solar,
for hot water, and so forth.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.260
These are used for electricity
and they're domestic.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.340
You don't import sun.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:52.110
You import electricity.

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:54.000
So I don't know how
this is powered,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.570
but you import electricity.

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:57.030
You don't import.

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:59.467
I mean, if you had a
line to a nuclear plant

01:02:59.467 --> 01:03:01.050
across the border,
you might count it.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:04.440
But electricity is electricity.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.430
OK, so I want to close
with a little bit of data

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:10.813
on rich countries
and poor countries.

01:03:10.813 --> 01:03:11.730
And this is something.

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:15.600
You should see you will
see data lots of places,

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.840
in some of the assignments,
that relate to the OECD.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.310
This is just for
your background.

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:21.690
This is who the OECD is.

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.900
It's basically a
rich countries club,

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:28.050
Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development,

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:31.530
with a few not quite
so rich countries

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:35.820
that have entered recently
under US and other sponsorship.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.630
So we pulled in
Mexico and Chile.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.347
We probably pulled
in Korea as well.

01:03:44.347 --> 01:03:45.930
Korea is getting to
be a rich country.

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:50.640
It began, it was Japan, Western
Europe, and North America.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.855
But you see, it's just under
18% of the world population,

01:03:55.855 --> 01:03:58.640
almost half of the
world's energy use.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.950
You don't go too far
wrong thinking of this

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:03.200
is the rich countries club.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.190
So I want to do a little rich
and poor here going forward

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:10.310
in aggregate, not
country by country.

01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:13.880
This is energy use.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.160
This is from the EIA assignment.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.850
This is energy use actual,
the first three bars,

01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:20.750
and projected.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:23.090
But this is a pretty
standard projection.

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:27.890
The growth is expected
to come outside the OECD.

01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:30.320
17 and 1/2% rich
country population

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.630
of the world, half
the energy use.

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:35.720
You see by the time
you get to 2030, 2035,

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.180
it's well under
half the energy use.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:44.150
Some growth in rich countries,
most of the growth outside.

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:48.380
If you do the numbers,
this is one of those--

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:53.690
suppose the world had actual
OECD energy per capita.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:56.720
All else equal, that
would increase world

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.820
use-- this is just
doing percentages.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.560
This would increase
world consumption

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.840
by a factor of almost 3.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.900
If the whole world had
us energy per capita,

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.645
it would increase world
consumption by a factor of 4.

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:15.320
No growth-- just take
a snapshot of 2009.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.450
Those are scary numbers.

01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:21.810
And of course, there
will be growth.

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:25.950
This is where is
it going to happen.

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:28.320
And you'll see the
projection-- and again,

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.030
up to 2008, the actual, and
we're getting close to 2015,

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.030
is non-OECD Asia.

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:37.890
What is non-OECD Asia?

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:41.970
Non-OECD Asia is
mainly India and China,

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:44.340
and Indonesia for that
matter, but it's mainly

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.720
India and China.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.840
So here's coal consumption.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:52.830
Recall, I said the coal
market share has been growing.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.210
Where is that coming from?

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:59.480
Non-OECD Asia-- India and China.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.060
You will recall India and
China have a lot of coal.

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:11.390
India and China, as they move
out of poverty, are burning it.

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:14.990
Not unreasonable at
one level, but that's

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:18.770
how you get CO2
emissions growth.

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:26.120
This is world energy-related
CO2 emissions, OECD, non-OECD.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.060
What's the growth?

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:31.511
The growth is non-OECD
Asia burning coal largely--

01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:32.780
largely.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.980
So again, if you run
these kinds of numbers,

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:41.000
suppose the world got to
where the OECD is, or suppose

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.930
the world got to where
the US is, forget growth.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:49.655
After that, you'd have CO2
emissions up by a multiple.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:57.450
As we will discuss when
we talk about climate--

01:06:57.450 --> 01:06:59.600
we'll talk about climate
a little bit next time

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.062
and more later, that's scary.

01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:08.300
If you go to double CO2
emissions, that's scary.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:13.940
But if I'm a poor country,
I say, wait a minute.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.770
You guys burned your coal.

01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:19.830
You're using much more energy
than we are per capita.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.450
You got rich.

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:27.340
Don't we get a
chance to get rich?

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:30.030
You guys sit in fancy
classrooms at MIT

01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:33.930
and try hard to stay
awake and all of that.

01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.340
Don't we get to do that?

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:41.100
So we'll come back
to this, because I

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:45.120
think this is one of the
great issues of the day.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.400
I'm going to close with
some final thoughts.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.790
I hope you got that
there's a lot of diversity.

01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:52.950
Some of it comes from resources.

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.960
But some of it comes from
culture and some of it

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.640
comes from politics,
and some of it

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.160
comes from a variety of
technology, efficiency,

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.280
history-- a variety of reasons.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.550
The last point, which will be
a very important point going

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.970
forward, which is we
expect the growth to come

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:13.000
in the future,
absent anything else,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.690
from the developing world--

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:19.680
if the rest of the world gets
rich the way we got rich,

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.970
there will be enormous increases
in energy use, which may not

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:28.859
be feasible, and in
CO2 emissions, which

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:31.229
at least your children
and grandchildren will not

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:33.140
like much.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.700
I know that's an
impossible thought,

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:40.529
but you will have children
and grandchildren.

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:45.439
And this is something
we'll be talking about.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:46.310
That's hard.

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.529
We know how we got rich.

01:08:48.529 --> 01:08:51.590
We burned fossil
fuels, and we used

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:54.170
that to acquire capital
stock and knowledge,

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:58.410
and build universities and
do all those great things.

01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:00.979
But that won't work--

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:03.960
that won't work.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.412
What will work, you got me.

01:09:07.412 --> 01:09:08.620
That's what you guys are for.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:14.830
OK, any questions or
comments, reactions, thoughts?

01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:15.525
Yeah.

01:09:15.525 --> 01:09:17.483
AUDIENCE: You said
something in the last class.

01:09:17.483 --> 01:09:20.527
Most of the US
energy [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:20.527 --> 01:09:21.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

01:09:21.610 --> 01:09:22.970
AUDIENCE: So that's true, right?

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:23.680
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's true, right.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.880
AUDIENCE: Are you going to
explain that more as you go on?

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:33.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.520
Which part would
you like explained?

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.402
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:38.402 --> 01:09:40.319
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK,
we'll talk about that

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:41.640
when we go sector by sector.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.609
But an awful lot of
the infrastructure

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:47.609
is in regulated areas.

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:50.910
So part of the reason you
could raise private capital

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:54.790
was the capital
wasn't hugely at risk.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:58.090
So for electric
power, for instance,

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:01.570
if you build a power plant, the
regulator says yeah go ahead,

01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:03.780
you would get a return
on your investment.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.430
That makes it easier.

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:07.200
We'll come back to that.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.410
OK, thank you.

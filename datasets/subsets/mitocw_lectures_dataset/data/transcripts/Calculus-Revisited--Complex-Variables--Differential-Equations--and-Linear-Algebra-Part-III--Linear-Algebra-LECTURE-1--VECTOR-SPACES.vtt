00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:32.940
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.490
Today, we begin our
eighth and final block

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.900
of material in our course.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.880
And since we began the
course with an emphasis

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120
on structure, in
particular vector spaces,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.110
it's only appropriate that we
conclude on the same level.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, you may recall,
when we first

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.580
started talking
about vectors, we

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.570
began with the rather simple
interpretation of arrows.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.930
Then we got to
2-tuples and 3-tuples

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.500
to revisit what arrows
looked like numerically.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.840
Then we generalized this
to n-dimensional n-tuples

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.140
so that we could talk about
functions of n real variables.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.060
And what we did was we defined a
vector space to be the n-tuples

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.800
together with certain
structural properties.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.880
And at the very end, we
then did the usual thing

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.650
that one does in a structure.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.900
We showed what a
vector space would

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.530
look like without
reference to n-tuples.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.200
Now what I'd like to
do in this lecture,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.650
and emphasize this for the
remainder of our course,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.070
is to show what vector spaces
would have looked like,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.520
what enrichment we could
have gained if we had stuck

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.970
with our more generalized
axiomatic definition

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.840
in the first place.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.170
And rather than go on
about this philosophically,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.220
let me get to the gist of our
lecture today, which, as I say,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.710
is simply called vector
spaces, but hopefully

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.400
from a perspective different
from what was had before,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.150
that the structural axiomatic
definition, you'll recall,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.850
was that V was called a
vector space with respect

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.280
to the real numbers R.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.210
And I should mention
here that there

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.700
are places where one
might talk about a vector

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.750
space with respect to the
complex numbers C, or something

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.280
like this.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.120
But, for our
purposes, we are going

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.500
to be content to stick with
what is called real vector

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.660
spaces, namely a vector
space with respect

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.110
to the real numbers.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.850
And what were the
structural properties?

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.830
Well, the sum of two
vectors had to be a vector,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.570
that the sum had to obey
the associative rule.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.490
There had to be an
additive identity.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.460
There had to be
additive inverses.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.520
And the sum had
to be commutative.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.910
We also had a scalar
multiplication structure,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.770
if you'll recall, that said
that if a scalar multiplied

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.170
the sum of two vectors,
the distributive rule held,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.320
namely that c times alpha
plus beta was c alpha

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.560
plus c beta, where
c was a real number.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.100
And the distributive rule also
held if the sum of two numbers

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.490
was multiplying a
vector, you see,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.030
where c1 and c2 here
are real numbers.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.900
And, finally, if a scalar times
a scalar multiple of a vector

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.160
were given, this product
was also associative, namely

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.520
that c1 times the
vector c2 alpha

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.200
is the same as the scalar
multiple c1 c2 times alpha.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.790
And, finally, that the number 1
multiplied by the vector alpha,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.360
the scalar multiple 1 times
alpha, was still alpha.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.030
In other words,
that the scalar--

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.170
that, with respect to
scalar multiplication,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.680
1 still behaves like the
multiplicative identity.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.940
And what we noted was that
the properties of n-tuples

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.930
were now theorems with respect
to the structural definition.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.430
You see, we could show that if
alpha were an n-tuple, that 0

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.230
times alpha was 0 for
all n-tuples in V.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.560
But now what we're saying is
we also showed at that time

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.170
that, axiomatically, one could
prove all of these results,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.600
that the 0 scalar times
a vector was always 0.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.470
The scalar c times the
0 vector was always

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.470
the 0 vector for all scalars.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.830
That if alpha plus beta
equals alpha plus gamma,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.970
beta equaled gamma.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.820
The cancellation rule held.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.580
If c times alpha
was 0, either c was

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.920
0 or alpha was 0,
et cetera, meaning,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.320
we had all of these theorems.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.150
And, just again by way of
refreshing your memories,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.980
I very quickly jotted down
a semi-proof of this result,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.570
namely, if c wasn't 0, knowing
that c times alpha was 0,

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.480
we multiply both
sides by 1 over c.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.210
By the associative property,
I can group 1 over c with c.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.640
And 1 over c times c is 1.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.930
I also know that c
times 0 is still 0.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.040
And in words, any real
number time the 0 vector

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.580
is still the 0 vector.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.000
Putting all of this together,
you see I have what?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.820
That regrouping
this in this form,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.130
this must equal the 0 vector.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.920
But this is 1 times
alpha equaling 0.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.280
But by our ninth axiom,
1 times alpha is alpha.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.140
Therefore, alpha equals 0.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.830
And we can go on in this
particular way, re-deriving

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.390
all of the properties that we
previously talked about when

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.920
we were dealing with n-tuples.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.840
The question that
comes up is, what's

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.690
so great about doing the same
thing in two different ways?

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.950
Why do we have to come back
to the structural definition

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.100
when the n-tuples were
working very nicely for us?

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.830
And what I'd like
to do is two things,

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.410
and I'm going to
introduce one new concept,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.260
and let it drop fairly
rapidly, and then come back

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.680
to a older concept from
a new point of view.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.150
In the first place, my claim is
that the axiomatic definition

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.850
of a vector space opens up
a whole new avenue of things

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.210
that we can call vector spaces
that we couldn't have called

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.510
vector spaces before, because
they couldn't be represented

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.165
as n-tuples, for example.

00:06:16.165 --> 00:06:19.220
And let me just say that-- so
you see it written down here--

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.730
new definition permits
new vector spaces.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.650
By way of example, let me
take the set of all functions

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.980
subject only to the condition
that they have a common domain.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.680
For example, let's take
a set of all functions f

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.170
whose domain of definitions,
say, is the closed

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.310
interval from a to b.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.030
In other words, all you
need to belong to the set V

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.000
is a function defined
for all real numbers

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.340
on the closed
interval from a to b.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.700
Notice that, both in part 1
and part 2 of this course,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.090
we had already defined
very special meanings

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.430
for what it meant by
the sum of two functions

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.525
and the scalar multiple of a
function, namely, by f plus g,

00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:03.440
where f and g were functions
with a common domain,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.360
and by c times f.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.370
Recall our
definitions were what?

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.610
That f plus g of x is simply f
of x plus g of x, and cf of x

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.430
is simply c times
f of x, where x

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.940
is any number in the close
interval from a to b.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.400
Notice, in terms of a
picture, what we're saying

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.690
is that, for the f plus g
machine, if the input is x,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.390
the output is f
of x plus g of x.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.510
For the cf machine,
if the input is x,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.970
the output is c times f of x.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.450
Notice that if f is defined
on the closed interval from a

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.260
to b, c times f is
defined on the closed

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.560
interval from a to b.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.010
And if f and g have
a common domain,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.840
in particular if
the domain happens

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.880
to be the closed
interval from a to b,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.180
notice that x belongs to
both the domains of f and g,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.700
and that, consequently,
this summation makes sense.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.580
In other words, if
we had a number which

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.480
belonged to the domain of f
but not to the domain of g,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.960
this wouldn't even be defined.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.480
All right.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.090
So here is a new
type of set that

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.440
doesn't look like n-tuples.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.560
In other words, there
are a voluminous number

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.580
of independent functions which
are defined on some interval

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.380
from a to b.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.650
But the key point is
that this new vector--

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.000
that this new set V
satisfies axioms 1

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.080
through 9 of our new definition
of our structural definition.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.030
In other words, the
set of all functions

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.870
which are continuous--

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.799
I'm sorry-- which are defined
on the interval from a to b,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.500
according to our
structural definition,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.539
would also be a vector space.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.010
In other words, our key point
is that the new definition

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.590
enlarges the concept
of a vector space,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.690
where, by enlarges
the concept, I

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.640
mean it allows new animals
to get in to the definition,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.330
that we have enlarged what can
now be called a vector space.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.400
Let me pause here
for a moment just

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.860
to enforce one little
detail for you,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.150
and that is keep in mind that
I am appreciative of the fact

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.330
that, probably, you are
not used to visualizing

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.690
a set of functions as
being a vector space.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.720
Consequently, it's my
feeling that if I continue

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.990
harping on this particular
example, much of what I say

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.680
will be lost on you because you
haven't had enough time to have

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.700
this new concept sink in.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.320
So what I'm going to do is to
leave a number of exercises

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.150
for our study
guide where you can

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.490
get adequate drill on what we
mean by this new type of vector

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.450
space.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.050
What I'd like to do for the
next part of our lecture

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.730
is to get away from this new
concept, which, by the way,

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.320
is very important,
which we will emphasize

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.080
as the remainder of
this block continues.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.480
But for those who say,
I'm not that interested

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.130
in functions as vector spaces--

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.660
I can't visualize that--

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.600
I would like to point
out a second key point.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.290
And that is that even when
you deal with n-tuples,

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.590
the structural
definition has advantages

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.710
over the n-tuple definition.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.810
In particular, which I
call key point number

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.510
2, the new definition--
and by new I

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.030
mean the structural
definition-- is

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:21.270
free of any dependence
of a coordinate system.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.660
Now, what do I
mean by dependence

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.080
of a coordinate system?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.260
Let's see if I can't
make that clear by means

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.090
of a particular example.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.280
Let's suppose I'm
dealing in the--

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.070
I'm in the xy plane, and we're
used to the vectors i and j

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.240
as being the basic
vectors of the xy plane.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.130
Let's assume for
the sake of argument

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.020
that, for one
reason or another--

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.150
and I'll clarify what
one reason or another

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.430
means as our course goes on.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.080
But, for one reason
or another, let's

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.880
suppose that, for the
particular problems

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.940
I'm interested in,
the two vectors alpha

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.320
and beta, where alpha is defined
to be i plus j, and beta, say,

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.990
is defined to be
3i plus 2j, let's

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.350
suppose that the two
vectors alpha and beta

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.960
happen to be the
two vectors that we,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.940
for some reason or
other, happen to be

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.350
more interested in than we
are interested in i and j.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.250
Now, the idea is
something like this.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.180
First of all, observe that,
because of the arithmetic,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.480
the axioms that a
vector space satisfies,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.440
I can treat alpha, beta, i
and j, the same as I would

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.730
real variables, so to speak.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.610
And I can solve
algebraically for i

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.130
and j in terms of
alpha and beta,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.830
which I've just done over here.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.020
And I leave the details for you.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.020
You just solve these as two
equations and two unknowns.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.420
Solve for the i and j in
terms of alpha and beta.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.920
Now the idea is this.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.560
Let's suppose I'm
given some vector

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:53.740
v. For the sake of argument,
let v be the vector 4i plus 5j.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.740
Now, notice that the
vector v is well defined,

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.470
and I'll show you that
pictorially in a few moments.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.830
But that vector v
exists independently of

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.110
whether we talk about i
and j components or not.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.770
In other words, once I tell
you that v is 4i plus 5j,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.050
it exists as an
arrow in the plane.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.320
And once I've drawn
that arrow, that arrow

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.360
is well defined even if I now
erase what this definition is.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.870
The point I wanted to
make, though, is this.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.030
You will recall that when
we dealt with 2-tuples,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.090
we picked i and j as being
the important vectors,

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.870
and we abbreviated
v as 4 comma 5,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.880
indicating that the
vector 4i plus 5j,

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.040
if it originated at
0, 0, would terminate

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.090
at the point 4 comma 5.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.910
Now suppose, for the
sake of argument,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.310
we were interested in v
not in terms of i and j

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.910
but in terms of the new
vectors alpha and beta.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.030
Knowing that i is minus
2 alpha plus beta,

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.230
and j is 3 alpha minus beta,
by direct substitution,

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.560
we can replace i and j by
what they're equal to in terms

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.180
of alpha and beta.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.680
So just by direct substitution.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.610
And I can conclude--

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.850
again, notice the
arithmetic here.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.960
You see 4--

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.940
I can multiply this out--

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.700
minus 8 alpha plus
4 beta, because I

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.390
have a rule that tells me that
a scalar times the sum of two

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.180
vectors is a scalar
times the first vector

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.700
plus a scalar times the
second vector, et cetera.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.840
All the rules of
arithmetic apply here.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.210
So I very quickly say 15 alpha
minus 8 alpha is 7 alpha.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.640
4 beta minus 5
beta is minus beta.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.570
So relative to alpha
and beta, notice

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.410
that v has the unique
representation 7 alpha

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.610
minus beta.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.780
Now, suppose I wanted to
abbreviate v with reference

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.840
to the basis vectors
alpha and beta, where

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.390
the convention would be that I
would list the alpha component

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.240
first and the beta
component secondly.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.970
Notice that the
2-tuple that names v

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.092
would be 7 comma minus 1.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.410
See, 7 is the
coefficient of alpha.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.780
Minus 1 is the
coefficient of beta.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.530
7 comma minus 1
would be the 2-tuple

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.920
that represents v if
I use alpha and beta

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.870
as my representative vectors.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.720
Whereas the 2-tuple
4 comma 5 represents

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.840
v with respect to the,
in quotation marks,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.980
the "usual" representation
in terms of i and j.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.760
Notice that v is
the same vector.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.980
That hasn't changed.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.265
But, certainly, the
2-tuple 7 comma minus 1

00:14:32.265 --> 00:14:36.300
and the 2-tuple 4 comma
5 do not look alike.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.460
In other words, there
is a big danger--

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.590
as, for one reason
or another, we

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.020
switch from different
representative vectors

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.650
to other, often a given set
of representative vectors

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.600
to another set of
representative vectors--

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.710
that we can become confused
as to which 2-tuple--

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.230
in this case, 2-tuple would
be n-tuple in general--

00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:01.040
but which representation
goes with which 2-tuple.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.620
See, the whole idea is that our
new definition, structurally,

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.650
never pays any attention to what
the particular representation

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.150
is.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.790
And from the mathematician's
point of view,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.060
what we feel is that what should
happen in the study of vector

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.690
spaces should be consequences
of the vectors, not

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.280
the particular
coordinate system.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.770
And if that phrase
confuses you, I'm

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.770
using the coordinate system
in the following sense.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.770
When I talk about i and
j, I think about i and j

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.630
as being my coordinate system.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.080
When I talk about alpha and
beta, I think of alpha and beta

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.880
as being my coordinate system.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.200
For example, given the vector
v, let's suppose this is alpha

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.460
and this is beta.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.550
Notice that v certainly
is a linear combination

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.570
of alpha and beta.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.260
In other words, it's this
vector plus this vector.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.420
It's also a linear combination
of i and j, certainly

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.360
a different linear
combination of alpha and beta

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.180
than it is a linear
combination of i and j.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.270
But also certain is the
fact that the representation

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.770
of v in terms of alpha and
beta as our coordinate system

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.320
is unique, just as
the representation

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.590
of v in terms of an i and j
coordinate system is unique.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.890
In other words, v has
a unique representation

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.120
as some scalar multiple of alpha
plus a scalar multiple of beta.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.550
But it also has a
unique representation

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:28.080
in the form a scalar multiple of
i plus a scalar multiple of j.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.930
You see, we do not mean
that the representation

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.980
is unique in the sense they
can only be written as one

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.330
set of linear combinations.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.800
What we mean is that, for
each coordinate system,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.790
for each coordinate
system, there

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.450
is a unique representation
as a linear combination

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.960
of the coordinates, but
different coordinate systems

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.390
lead to different
linear combinations.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.030
But the key point from the
mathematician's point of view

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.720
is that v exists independently
of the choices of alpha

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.700
and beta.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.720
You see, again, we
ran into this problem

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.420
before when we talked about
the distance between two points

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.319
in a plane.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.470
Certainly, the distance
between two points in a plane

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.560
was independent of what
coordinate system we used.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.480
But with respect to
polar coordinates,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.900
the recipe for finding the
distance between the two points

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.880
did not look the
same as the recipe

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.880
that one used for finding the
distance between the same two

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.710
points when the
points were expressed

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.390
in Cartesian coordinates.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.069
The same thing
we're saying here.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:30.300
We would like our mathematics
to depend only on the vectors,

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.090
not on their representation.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.990
Well, enough said about
that part of the theory.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.000
What we'd next--
again, the exercises

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.850
will hopefully fill
in any gaps that

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.350
may be missing in
the logical structure

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.660
from your point of view.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.760
But the next thing
we'd like to talk about

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.000
is a thing called
a substructure,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.690
that whenever one talks about
a new type of structure,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.820
the concept of what we used to
call a subset becomes too weak,

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.650
and what one wants
to talk about,

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.410
then, is the concept
of a substructure.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.380
What I mean by that is the
next topic I want to talk about

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.970
is called subspaces.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.560
And to give you an idea
of what I'm talking about,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.540
let's do the following.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.920
Let's go back into the
plane and take just

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.120
the two individual
vectors i and j.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.770
Not the whole plane,
just the two vectors--

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.620
the unit vector in the direction
of the positive x-axis,

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.490
the unit vector in the direction
of the positive y-axis.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.090
Just these two vectors.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.720
Now, certainly, the set
consisting of just these two

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:36.370
vectors is a subset of
two-dimensional vector space.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.020
In other words, the set of
all vectors in the xy plane

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.570
certainly includes the i
vector and the j vector.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.960
So it would certainly
be fair to say

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:51.980
that this set A is a subset of
two-dimensional vector spaces.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.310
But the idea is that a
vector space has a structure.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:19:00.110
We care much more about
how you combine vectors

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.150
and what you get
than we worry about

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.420
whether you just have a set.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.600
Remember, mathematically,
a structure is what?

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.400
A set together
with certain rules.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.360
And so what we're saying here is
look what goes wrong with this.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.090
If we were looking at
this thing structurally,

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.840
one would say something
like, gee, let's add i and j.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.380
If we add i and j,
we get i plus j.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.070
i plus j is neither the
vector i nor the vector j.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:31.550
In other words, in terms of a
picture, here's i, here's j.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.920
What is i plus j?

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.245
i plus j is just the sum
of these two vectors.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.730
What we're saying is i
and j belong to the set A,

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.940
but i plus j certainly
is neither i nor j.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.310
Since they consist
solely of i and j,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.160
the fact that i plus
j is neither i nor j

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.890
means that i plus
j does not belong

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.940
to A. And, similarly, neither
does, for example, twice i.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.280
If I double i, I
get the vector which

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.240
has the same direction and sense
as i but it's twice as long.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.330
Consequently, that vector
is neither i nor j.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:13.100
So, in particular, given the
set whose only two elements are

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.790
i and j, notice that if I
add two vectors in the set A,

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.400
I need not get a
vector in the set A.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.210
And if I take a scalar multiple
of any vector in the set A,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.970
I need not get a
vector in the set A.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.520
And so, structurally, this is
a bad thing, because notice

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.970
that, structurally, we
will be adding vectors.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.310
Consequently, if
we start with a set

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:38.120
and add two members in that
set, and the resulting vector

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.610
can then be a vector
which isn't in that set,

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.970
we don't have a very
convenient structure.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.960
So what we do is we
isolate a very key point.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.510
And let me give you the
definition abstractly first,

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.970
and then show you in
terms of familiar examples

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.500
that we already knew this.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.250
Let's suppose that we
have a vector space V

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.850
and that W is simply
a subset of V.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.980
So this just means
subset so far.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:08.000
Then W is called a
subspace of V provided

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.100
that, one, the sum of any
two elements in the subset W

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.610
is also an element in W. In
other words, that the subset

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:21.140
W is close with respect to
the addition operation that

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.270
makes V a vector space.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:27.560
And, secondly, that, for
any element in the subset W,

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.630
any scalar multiple
of that element

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:35.360
is also in W. In other words, W
must also be close with respect

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.300
to that same scalar
multiplication with respect

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.930
to which V is defined.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.510
And, by the way, I think if you
think about that for a while,

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.580
you will notice
that this is true.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.730
For example, we have
often talked about a line

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.165
being a subset of a plane.

00:21:52.165 --> 00:21:53.540
But in terms of
vectors, we could

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.730
have made a stronger
statement, namely

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.860
a line is a subspace
of the plane.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.180
And, in a similar
way, a plane is

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.090
a subspace of
three-dimensional space,

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.570
namely, starting with a plane,
if you take two vectors which

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.700
lie in the plane
and you add them,

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.555
the sum of those two vectors
is still in the plane.

00:22:13.555 --> 00:22:14.930
And if you take
a scalar multiple

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.330
of any vector in a plane,
the resulting vector

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.160
still lies in that plane.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.980
So by means of a
few examples, then,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.640
if V now is usual
three-dimensional Euclidean

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.290
space, if I let W be the set
of all linear combinations of i

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.280
and j--

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.520
and, by the way, contrast
that with the set W--

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.780
with the set A over here.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.960
Notice that the set A
over here consisted only

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.120
of the vectors i and j.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.280
The set W here consists of all
linear combinations of i and j.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.180
In other words, it's all
vectors of the form c1 i plus c2

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.460
j, where c1 and c2
are real numbers.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.930
And notice that W is
the entire xy plane.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.570
And, after all, any
vector in the xy plane

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.200
can be written as a linear
combination of i and j.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.550
Why is this a subspace?

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.860
Well, leaving the
details to you,

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.810
notice, first of
all, that it's clear

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.850
that this should
certainly be a subset,

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.340
namely every vector
in here is a vector

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.080
that belongs to
three-dimensional space

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.550
even though it lies in a plane.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.340
But notice that the sum of any
two linear combinations of i

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.130
and j is again a linear
combination of i and j.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.350
And any scalar multiple of a
linear combination of i and j

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.020
is again a linear
combination of i and j.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.700
So W satisfies the criteria
for being a subspace.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.340
In other words, W is not
only a subspace in this case.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.040
W is the xy plane.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:45.500
By the way, using the alpha and
beta of the previous example,

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.100
notice that if I let V again
be three-dimensional space

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.780
and pick alpha to be i plus
j, and beta to be 3i plus 2j,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.510
notice that if I take the set
of all linear combinations

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.010
of alpha and beta,
then W is also a plane,

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.340
and it's called the plane
spanned by or determined

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.750
by alpha and beta.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.530
In other words, it's the
plane that has alpha and beta

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.980
as consecutive edges
of a parallelogram.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.450
By the way, let me
make two comments here.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:19.250
First of all, if these d's
look funny to you, they should,

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.820
because just before the
lecture began, these were c's.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.230
And I changed these c's to d's
because the mathematician would

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:32.060
have no danger in confusing
the coefficients here

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.360
with the coefficients here,
but for the uninitiated I think

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.730
it's very important to
make this observation.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.920
Notice that alpha
and beta, being

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.720
linear combinations of i and
j, both lie in the xy plane.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.220
Consequently, the plane
determined by alpha and beta

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.740
is also the xy plane.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.690
This, in turn, means that, in
both of these two examples,

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.300
W is the xy plane.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.860
But, somehow or
other, you wouldn't

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.160
expect that W would be the same
linear combination of alpha

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.820
and beta as it is of i and j.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.940
And, therefore, I prefer to
use different letters here

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.210
to indicate that a
given vector in V

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.210
might require two
numbers c1 and c2

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.030
to be coefficients of i
and j, but, with respect

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.380
to alpha and beta,
two different numbers.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.550
OK?

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.550
That's one point I wanted
to make about this.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:29.470
The other point I wanted to
make about this, you see,

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.380
notice that alpha and beta
don't look like i and j,

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.750
and there's a danger--

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.630
that you may not even realize
when you see alpha and beta--

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:41.190
that alpha and beta determine
the same plane as i and j.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.830
Now, you see, that
leads to the problem

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.720
that we were talking
about before,

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.100
namely, given the same plane,
the representation of the plane

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.620
looks different if you use one
set of representative vectors

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.510
than if you use another set
of representative vectors.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.940
But, more importantly,
let me point out

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.580
that there was nothing sacred
about the xy plane here.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.040
Just to change this
problem ever so slightly,

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.440
let me add on a plus k,
say, to both alpha and beta.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.600
That makes this a
new example, you see.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.180
Let alpha be i plus j plus k.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.390
Let beta be 3i plus 2j plus k.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.660
Notice that alpha and beta are--

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.730
neither is in the xy plane.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.880
They are not parallel to one
another, because this is not

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.400
a constant multiple of this.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:35.010
Therefore, notice that alpha
and beta are still two vectors.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.970
W is still the set of all
linear combinations of these two

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:39.970
vectors.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.420
See, this part doesn't change.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.800
And W now is still the plane
spanned by alpha and beta,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.220
but now notice that the plane
spanned by alpha and beta

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.260
is the plane which has alpha
and beta as consecutive edges,

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.600
the parallelogram determined
by the plane that has alpha

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.670
and beta as consecutive edges.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:05.160
And this parallelogram clearly
is no longer in the xy plane.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.910
All right.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.890
And now, for a finale for
today, what I'd like to do now

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.530
is to point out, going
back ever so briefly

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.010
to our first key point, that
there are vector spaces which

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.100
aren't viewed as n-tuples,
namely, for example,

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.730
the set of all functions
defined on the closed interval

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:24.780
from a to b.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.630
Let me show you what
subspaces mean in terms

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.300
of this interpretation.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.270
My next example, again let V
be, as earlier in the lecture,

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:38.400
the set of all functions
having a common domain,

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.070
say the closed
interval from a to b.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:45.570
Let's look now at the set
W1 of all functions which

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.540
not only are defined on the
closed interval from a to b,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.210
but they happen to be
continuous on the closed

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.070
interval from a to b.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.020
You see, notice that,
originally, I never had

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.790
to assume continuity here.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.590
As long as the
function is defined

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.450
on the closed
interval from a to b,

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.180
I can add any two
members of this family.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.275
I can scalar multiply any
member of this family.

00:28:06.275 --> 00:28:11.040
So I do not need continuity to
have this be a vector space.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.650
However, suppose I now
look at all functions which

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.100
are continuous on the
closed interval from a to b.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.090
Well, in particular,
it should be

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:24.330
trivial to see that this set W
sub 1 is a subset of V, namely

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.950
every function which is
continuous on the closed

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.480
interval from a to b, in
particular, must be defined

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.400
on the closed
interval from a to b.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.790
Consequently, every
function in this set

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.490
certainly belongs to this set.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.010
On the other hand,
notice that we already

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.770
know that the sum of
continuous functions

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.720
is again a continuous function.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.850
A scalar multiple of
a continuous function

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.070
is again a continuous function.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.120
Consequently, according to
our definition of subspace,

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.640
W1 is not only a subset
of V. It's a subspace of V

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.250
because it's closed
with respect to--

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.940
excuse me-- addition and
scalar multiplication.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.060
As another example,
let V be the same

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.620
as it was in the
previous example,

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.890
namely the set of all
functions defined on the closed

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.420
interval from a to b.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.120
And now let's take
that subset consisting

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.270
of all functions which are
differentiable on the closed

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.370
interval from a to b.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.100
In other words, this is
an even stronger condition

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.388
than being continuous.

00:29:27.388 --> 00:29:29.430
We say not only must the
functions be continuous,

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.580
but now we want it to be
differentiable as well.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.520
Remember, differentiability
implies continuity,

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.600
but continuity does not
imply differentiability.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.020
All I'm saying now is
that, since the sum of two

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.940
differentiable
functions is again

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.050
a differentiable function,
and since a scalar

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.900
multiple, a constant times
a differentiable function,

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.940
is still differentiable, not
only is W2 a subset of V.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:04.210
It's a subspace of V. In fact,
W2 is also a subspace of W1.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.390
Recall, W1 was what?

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.600
The set of continuous functions
on the interval from a to b.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.950
That was also a vector space.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.380
And now what we're
saying is that

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.890
the differentiable
functions are a subspace

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.540
of the continuous functions.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.910
Again, I'm going to emphasize
all of this in the exercises,

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.660
and we'll pick this up
in more detail next time,

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.410
but what I wanted to close with
is simply the following remark.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.900
If you have studied
calculus in the past

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.090
and have been away
from it for a while,

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.060
and you pick up an
ultra-modern calculus book,

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:40.440
you may be surprised to find
that even elementary calculus

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.940
begins with a preface
to emphasizing

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.970
what's called linear
algebra or vector spaces.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.450
And the reason for this is
the fact that all of calculus,

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.400
going back to part
1 of our course,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.560
does deal with continuous
and differentiable functions.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.490
And, in particular, continuous
and differentiable functions,

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:03.210
as we've just shown, obey the
structure of a vector space.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:06.540
And, consequently, that's
why many modern authors

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.870
prefer to unify the
approach to calculus

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.810
and introduce vector spaces
right at the very outset.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.750
But we'll talk about this
more gradually as we go along.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.760
And until next
time, then, goodbye.

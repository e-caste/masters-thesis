00:00:25.168 --> 00:00:26.620
PROFESSOR: Once again
to put this in the

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.830
context of where we are.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.530
We're talking about
producer theory.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.660
And we're talking
about how firms

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.230
decide how much to produce.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.810
We started with a perfect
competition, and that nailed

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.100
down the fact that with under
perfect competition we got the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.920
zero profit long run perfectly
elastic supply curve.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.940
We then, last time, talked
about monopoly as another

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.440
extreme and talked about how
monopolists choose both their

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.000
price and their quantity.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.750
They set margin around or equal
to marginal cost. That

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.790
gives them a quantity.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.620
And then they choose the price
off the demand curve and how

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.370
that leads to profits and how
that leads to monopolists

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.960
producing less than the
competitive level.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.640
And we also ended by talking
about a perfectly price

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.520
discriminating monopolist, one
that can actually charge each

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.540
consumer their willingness to
pay and therefore, absorb all

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.430
the social surplus.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.480
Now, I want to come back and
start, this morning, by

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.620
talking again about price
discrimination and realizing

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.430
that, in some sense, we know
that there's no such thing as

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.680
perfect price discrimination.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.410
There's no monopolist out there
charging us literally

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.650
exactly what we're
willing to pay.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.090
But there are lots of examples
of price discrimination in the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.340
real world.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.150
And sometimes they're
kind of obvious.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.670
Sometimes they're not.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.020
But what they all have in common
is the notion of trying

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.430
to find some signal of our
willingness to pay and using

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.200
that to set the price.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.070
So instead of being like our
original monopolist, just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.130
setting one price.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.790
Monopolists are forever trying
to find some signal, some

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.870
underlying signal of our
willingness to pay and using

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.420
that to set the price.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.930
OK.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.970
So for example, a classic
example we know is airlines.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.450
OK.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.000
What airlines do--

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.480
Airlines charge you more, for
example, if you book your

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.370
ticket the last minute.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.300
And the notion of course-- or
towards the last minute.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.370
At the very last minute they may
end up charging you less.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.740
But as you get close to the date
when you want to leave,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.900
the price goes up.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.100
The notion, of course, is that
who is going to buy tickets

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.523
close to the date they want to
leave. It's largely going to

00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:31.400
be business people, not
the vacation traveler.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.050
The vacation traveler is
going to plan ahead

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.120
and buy far in advance.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.110
The one that's going to buy a
week before is the business

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.460
person who just got a
meeting scheduled.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.830
Business people are going to
be less price sensitive.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.100
They're going to have a higher
willingness to pay.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.920
They've got to get
to the meeting.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.750
They're not paying anyway.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.230
The company's paying.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.210
And they're just to
do what they need

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.080
to get to the meeting.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.250
So that's a less price
sensitive population.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.620
So that's the population
you want to hit

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.165
with a higher price.

00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:59.630
So you want to price up tickets
that you buy towards

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.270
the end because those are more
likely to be the people who

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.440
are least price sensitive.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.360
So let's ask another question.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.220
Somebody tell me why do movie
theaters charge less for

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220
matinees than for
movies at night?

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.540
Why do movie theaters
charge less?

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.280
If you go see the first movie
of the day-- and you guys

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.900
probably don't anymore.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.000
But when you were
kids you did.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.170
And when I take my take
my kids, I do.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.230
And that afternoon matinee
movie costs less.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.480
Why is that?

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.410
Yeah.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.590
Anyone want to take
a chance at that?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.130
And related to it, you can
also ask the question.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.570
Why do restaurants have
early bird specials?

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.400
Why, when you go to restaurant,
often will they

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.660
charge you less if you go there
in the early hours as

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.780
opposed to later?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.560
So what's going on with that?

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.054
Someone tell me.

00:03:43.054 --> 00:03:43.511
Yeah.

00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:45.150
AUDIENCE: They're not
using up all their

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.560
seats in the afternoon.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.440
So they might as well
lower the price.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.960
PROFESSOR: In the afternoon
they're not.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.390
Although the truth is, a lot
of the time they're--

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.370
If you look at a movie theater
today, it's almost never full,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.640
except for like the opening
night of a very popular movie.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.530
So that's part of it.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.800
But let's talk about
the demand side.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.800
What else is special about
the type of people?

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.990
Why don't you go on what's
special about the type of

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.480
people who want to see movies or
go to restaurants at those

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.460
different times?

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.741
They're not willing
to pay as much.

00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:12.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah, they're
basically people with a lot of

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.400
free time on their hands.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.940
Right?

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.149
The people who are going out
to dinner early, the people

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.690
who see movies in the afternoon,
these are people

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.089
who are unemployed or
have little kids.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.990
And they're just looking
to kill time.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.660
And so basically, these
are people who

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.590
are willing to shop.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.330
These are people who are going
to say look, I've got to fill

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.340
in some time.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.310
I don't have to go right now.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.480
I can go any time.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.070
So I'm going to be more
price sensitive.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.715
The people who are going to
dinner later, who are going

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:39.410
out to the movie at night,
they're working all day.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.230
They have no choice.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.180
They have to see the
movie at night.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.050
Or they're in school all day.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.410
They have to see the
movie at night.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.280
They're less price elastic.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.830
So that's why you want
to set the movie

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.740
price higher at night.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.470
Alternatively, another
reason could be--

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.270
One signal of willingness to
pay is price sensitivity.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.520
What's another signal?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.000
It's going to be income.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.830
Who's going to be seeing the
movies during the day and

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.520
going to the dinner early?

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.520
It's elderly individuals and
families with small kids who

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.320
are the most resource
strapped.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.840
People who have plenty
of disposable income

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.540
are going at night.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.980
They're working.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.500
They're young.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.920
They're singles and
young couples.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.120
They work all day or are
in school all day.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.920
They go at night.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.710
They have more disposable
income.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.300
The people going during the
day are the elders and the

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.640
people with young kids who have
less disposable income.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.750
And as a result they're going
to be more price sensitive.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.690
So you want to charge
them a lower price.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.240
So that's another example
of price discrimination.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.390
OK, why does Disney World charge
you less if you live in

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.360
the area than if you do not.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.310
This is true fact.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.830
Disney World charges you less if
you're from Orlando than if

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.300
you're not from Orlando.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.550
Why is that?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.830
Someone tell me.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.060
Yeah.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.445
AUDIENCE: I think the Disney
can go any time.

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:53.976
So you might as well you
might as well take

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:56.600
them to other places.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.480
PROFESSOR: I mean, basically
the idea is look, if I just

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.210
spent a grand on a plane ticket
to take my kids to

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.150
Orlando to Disney World, I'm not
going to kvetch over $10

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.980
either way, getting in
or not getting in.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.550
But if I live in the area,
I may or may not go.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.620
I can go to a park, instead.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.820
I can go do something
else, instead.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.110
It's just one of many
choices for me.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.000
The point is, having paid the
fixed cost of getting to

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.820
Orlando, I'm going to be much
less price sensitive about

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.090
getting into the park than other
people who live there,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.450
who have lots of
other choices.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.390
Likewise, having paid the money
to get there, I have

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.270
shown I have more disposable
income because I paid the

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.980
money to get there.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.660
I've shown I have enough
disposable income that I'm

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.440
willing to drop money on a plane
ticket to take my kids

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.340
to Disney World.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.942
So I'm going to have
more income that we

00:06:35.942 --> 00:06:37.330
are willing to pay.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.560
OK, so basically the point
is companies are

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.510
forever doing this.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.090
The ultimate example was,
briefly, Amazon.com started

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.470
pricing by IP address.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.820
For a while, it was a
controversy over Amazon

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.940
started literally charging,
getting people's IP addresses

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.337
and literally adjusting prices
based on saying, oh, this

00:06:58.337 --> 00:06:59.660
person is from a university
library.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.200
University libraries aren't
price sensitive.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.440
We'll charge them
more, et cetera.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.490
That got shut down.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.480
But that was the ultimate form
of trying to be price

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.980
discriminatory.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.725
That was as close as we'll
come to perfect price

00:07:10.725 --> 00:07:11.120
discrimination.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.020
The point is, in general, people
with market power,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.840
people that set the price above
marginal cost will in

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.900
general be looking for parties
which are high income and low

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.730
elasticity to which they can
charge a higher price.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.010
Yeah.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.562
AUDIENCE: Another example, like
MIT, they actually ask

00:07:26.562 --> 00:07:27.258
for your income statement.

00:07:27.258 --> 00:07:29.186
And then, based on that, they
give you their price.

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:31.420
PROFESSOR: Well, see that's
very interesting.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.060
That's very interesting.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.480
MIT--

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.780
What's tricky about that is--

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.660
Is that about exploiting
price sensitivity?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.990
Or is that about equity?

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.810
That's a bit harder because
MIT could claim--

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.770
And probably, actually,
it's true.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.500
They're not doing it.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.840
Because the truth is,
MIT could charge

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.530
whatever they want.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.400
They'd still fill the class.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.020
Right?

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.570
So it's not really about--

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.530
I think in MIT's case, it's
not really about price

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.450
sensitivity.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.990
It's about income redistribution
and some notion

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.540
of making sure low income
people can come and

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.540
afford to be here.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.700
But that is a good point.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.140
The difficulty with empirical
economics is often,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.480
correlation versus causation.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.580
The same fact can have many
different descriptions, many

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.440
different explanations.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.420
OK?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.980
So just wanted to give you some
brief examples to think

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.460
about the fact that we see
price discrimination in

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.590
reality all the time.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.060
Nonetheless, we do our classic
monopoly model.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.010
We assume there's one price.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.370
And the truth is the one price
monopolist is probably closer

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.180
to the truth than the perfectly
price discriminating

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.800
monopolist. But the truth, as
often in this course, is going

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800
to be somewhere in between.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.580
OK, questions about that.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.230
What I want to focus on
primarily, for this lecture,

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.299
is where do monopolies
come from.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.539
How do monopolies arrive?

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.789
How do we end up in this
situation, where instead of

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.810
many firms competing to sell
a good, we only have one?

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.570
And there's basically two
sources of monopolies, two

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.600
sources that give birth to

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.260
monopolies in modern societies.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.505
The first source is
cost advantages.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.260
The first source is
cost advantages.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.790
Some markets come with natural
cost advantages, natural

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.970
reasons why there's a
benefit to being one

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.950
player in the market.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.040
So for example, it could be
that there's, essentially,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.260
only one usable input.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.940
So let's say there's a
rock quarry in town.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.130
You've got to get rocks from.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.720
And there's just one
rock quarry.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.360
And rocks are really expensive
to transport.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.160
So basically, if you live in
that town, the person who owns

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.620
that rock quarry is going to be
the monopolist. No one else

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.390
is really going to compete
because it would cost them so

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.290
much to transport rocks
from another

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.210
quarry in another town.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.270
OK?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.080
Basically, the point is.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.340
Sometimes, there are
these fixed costs.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.420
And whoever has paid the fixed
cost has an enormous natural

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.040
advantage over other
players, over other

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.740
entrants to the markets.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.315
And we call those natural
monopolies.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.470
Natural monopolies--

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:18.300
Natural monopoly is a firm where
for all the relevant

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.580
quantities over any relevant
range, the average cost for

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:29.190
one firm is always below the
average cost of a new entrant.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.230
The average cost for the one
firm that's in the market is

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.490
already always going to be below
the average cost for any

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.670
new entrant.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.580
And that is going to be true
in markets with very large

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.140
fixed costs and very small
marginal costs.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.440
A natural monopoly will occur
when there's very large fixed

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.340
cost and very small marginal
cost. In that case, what we'll

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:59.650
see is average cost is
always declining.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.160
Natural monopolies arise
when average

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.680
cost is always declining.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.990
If average cost is always
declining, it's never going to

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.330
make sense for another entrant
to come in the market.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.400
And an example we
could think of--

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.400
The best example I could think
is like a water utility, the

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.210
folks who deliver water
to our houses.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.570
The fixed costs of delivering
water are enormous.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.490
You've got to lay the pipe
to deliver the water

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.790
all through the town.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.890
Those are enormous
fixed costs.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:28.965
The marginal costs
are trivial.

00:11:28.965 --> 00:11:29.930
I mean, water is cheap.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:30.440
You get the water.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.380
You send it through the pipes.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.280
OK?

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.360
It would never make sense to
have two companies deliver

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.896
water throughout the town.

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:40.900
It wouldn't make sense to have
another company come in, rip

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.750
up the roads, lay a competing
set of pipes all through the

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.840
town to compete.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.040
It just wouldn't make sense
because those fixed costs are

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.990
so huge relative to the
marginal costs.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.350
They could never make money.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.700
That first company--

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.390
If a second company came in and
threatened to do that, the

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.100
first company could always keep
the price low enough that

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.350
that second company could never

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.510
recover their fixed costs.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.740
Because the first company has
already paid the fixed cost,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.350
they're already in.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.980
A second company could
never come in and

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.280
cover those fixed costs.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.380
So if we see figure 15-1.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.380
Here's an example of a firm,
of a water utility, low

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.180
marginal cost. There was a
high fixed cost. So the

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.410
initial average costs
are very high.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.930
But the average costs are
declining constantly because

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.020
the marginal costs are low,
relative to fixed costs.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.950
OK?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.340
So if demand for the good goes
up, over some relevant range--

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.840
If demand gets to be infinite,
it may make sense to lay

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.830
another set of pipes.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.350
You know, the first set of pipes
may get overwhelmed.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.760
But as long as demand can be met
by the set of pipes that's

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.070
been laid, there's absolutely no
reason for another firm to

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.510
enter this market.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.000
If another firm ever threatened
to do so, the first

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.236
firm would just lower price and
say, look, you're going to

00:12:55.236 --> 00:12:58.010
have to spend so much money
putting that set of pipes in

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.590
through town you'll never
be able to make it up.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.500
Because having laid those
set of pipes--

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.730
Remember what the shut
down condition is.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.320
As long as that first firm can
charge price greater than

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.060
marginal, can charge price above
average variable cost,

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.460
which is marginal cost
in this case.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.060
As long as that firm can charge
price above marginal

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.760
cost, it will always
stay in business.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.560
And that second firm can't make
any money at a price near

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.100
the marginal cost because they
can't cover their fixed cost.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.470
So they'll essentially
chase them out.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.920
So essentially, the fact that
they've had that set of pipes

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.910
already laid down gives them a
threat, a credible threat,

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.270
that that second firm
cannot enter.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.380
Thus, we call natural monopolies
are places where

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.920
other firms face barriers
to entry.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.630
Natural monopolies are where
there are barriers to entry,

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.630
where other firms cannot enter
because they'd have to pay

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.930
those enormous fixed costs.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:56.180
And it would never make economic
sense to do so.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:56.660
OK.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.050
And in that case, you're going
to get a monopoly.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.840
And we call it a natural
monopoly because, in some

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.910
sense, the monopoly is the
right thing to do.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.660
It is actually economically
efficient for there to be only

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.260
one provider of water
in the town.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.380
That's the economically
efficient outcome.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.020
It is economically inefficient
to pay a second set of those

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.930
enormous fixed costs.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.410
Now, then you say, well what
about the fact that monopolist

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.220
will under produce water,
charge too much.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.360
We'll get to that in a minute.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.090
But when there's natural
monopolies, the goods should

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.080
be delivered by a monopoly.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.050
That's the right thing to do.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:36.330
But there's a second reason why
monopolies arise, which is

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.040
a little more pernicious, which
is government actions.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.680
Sometimes monopolies are
unnatural and created by the

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.940
government.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.510
So a classic example is when
governments actually decide

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.350
that they're going to deliver
a good and only they'll

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.980
deliver the good, like
the postal service.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.040
When a government decides look,
we are just going to

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040
deliver this good.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.040
We're just going to have
the postal service.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.450
And for many, many years, if you
wanted to send a package

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.000
from one place to another, you
had to do it through the

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.980
postal service.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.160
Well, it turned out
of course, that

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.870
wasn't a natural monopoly.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.220
As we know through the growth of
FedEx and others, there was

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.820
actually quite a good distance
to compete in that market.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.290
And eventually, those other
folks delivering packages came

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.420
in and competed in
that market.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.470
And in fact, in the US, it's
very rare to have a government

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.630
provided good, a purely
government provided good.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.900
It's very rare.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.300
Historically, it wasn't.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.100
And in many other parts of
the world, it's not.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.790
In many other parts of the
world, governments run the

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.860
banks, the airlines,
all utilities.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.560
So in many other parts of the
world, governments will

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.830
actually set up these
monopolies

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.180
through government action.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.350
And basically, that is something
which is not done

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.080
much in the US but
done elsewhere.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.520
Now however, one place we do set
up monopolies in the US,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.210
which is pretty important,
is through

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.663
the issuing of patents.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:16.220
If you invent, say a new drug,
and you patent it.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.760
You then have the exclusive
right to sell that chemical

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.110
compound for 17 years.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.860
So if you come up with some new
chemical compound to treat

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.380
whatever, you have the exclusive
right to market that

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.830
chemical compound
for 17 years.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.430
That is a government sanctioned
monopoly.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.480
Now, is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.610
Are patents--

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.820
The government has just
created a monopoly.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.020
Could someone tell me why that
might be actually a good thing

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.400
for the government to do?

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:50.600
Yeah.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.025
AUDIENCE: Schumpeter talks about
how it's a way to cause

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:53.246
innovation.

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:54.916
Because no one would put that
many dollars into drug

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.392
research, if they weren't
going to be

00:16:56.392 --> 00:16:57.130
able to make money.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.082
Because the marginal cost was
so low that other people--

00:17:00.082 --> 00:17:02.050
The cost of establishing a
pharmaceutical company

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.018
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
is really low.

00:17:04.018 --> 00:17:06.314
So other people would come
and cut out all their

00:17:06.314 --> 00:17:06.970
profits that they had.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.829
PROFESSOR: Exactly, if you put
all these resources into

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.550
inventing a drug, it's not
like laying pipes.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.670
Once you invented it, someone
could just copy it the next

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.069
day and produce it at the
same cost you can.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.930
So why would you ever do that?

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.660
Why would you, as someone who,
even if you cared about the

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.819
benefits to the world, still
want to make some money.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.170
Why would you spend billions
and millions of dollars

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.230
inventing these new drugs?

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.760
If the next day, someone
else can just say,

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.260
that's a great idea.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.190
I'll produce that for $0.47 a
pill, just like you will.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.300
And you won't make
any money off it.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.550
And you'll have lost all this
money you invested.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.060
So the argument for patents is
you want an incentive for

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.040
innovation, which suggests
there's a trade-off here.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.170
On the one hand, you want an
incentive for innovation.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.210
On the other hand, once you
create this monopoly, they can

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.510
charge outrageous prices.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.480
There is a drug.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.270
There are drugs.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.290
Genzyme is very big company
started here in Massachusetts.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.510
And the whole reason they exist
is to create drugs for

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.250
very, very rare diseases.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.950
Diseases that strike like
100,000 people a

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.410
year but are deadly.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.100
Like Gaucher's disease is a
famous example of this one.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.270
So they create these drugs.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.190
They put billions of dollars
into research,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.960
create these drugs.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.100
And then, having created them
and gotten a patent, charge

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.350
like $100,000 a year
to use the drugs.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.310
Drugs that cost, you know,
$500 a year to produce.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.770
Now on the one hand, if these
drugs didn't exist,

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:26.930
people would die.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.060
These are literally
lifesaving drugs.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.930
These are people who used to
die, who now live because of

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.060
these drugs.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.710
And these drugs never would have
been invented if Genzyme

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.660
couldn't have made some
money off them.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.910
On the other hand, you've got
a product which costs $500 a

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.500
year to make, and they're
charging $100,000 a year to

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.200
people to use.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.100
And in particular, when it
comes to drugs like for

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.250
treating AIDS in the developed
world where people cannot--

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.240
There's no way they can afford
that kind of money.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.030
That's a problem.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.529
Yeah.

00:18:55.529 --> 00:18:58.148
AUDIENCE: But aren't you not
only paying for them to

00:18:58.148 --> 00:18:59.521
produce the drug but
paying for all the

00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:01.180
research that went into--

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.860
PROFESSOR: Exactly,
that's right.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.690
You're paying for all
the research.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:04.570
That's why they never
would have

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.760
invented it if they couldn't.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.350
So you're paying for
the research.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.460
They also take home a nice,
hefty profit at

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.350
the end of the day.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.480
But that is true.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.390
You are also paying for the
research that goes into that.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.120
And people wouldn't put
that money up front.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.090
That research is funded
by investors.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.303
And investors would not invest
in Genzyme and give them money

00:19:19.303 --> 00:19:21.590
to do research if they weren't
going to get a return.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.660
So if Genzyme--

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.920
Of that $99,500 Genzyme makes
on that Gaucher's disease

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.260
drug, most of it is going back
to pay the people who funded

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.040
the research.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.170
But a healthy chunk is not.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.750
A healthy chunk is market
power monopoly profit.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.070
Yeah.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.320
AUDIENCE: Could the government
then have subsidies for some

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.570
types of licensing to ensure
that the consumers are not

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.902
affected because everyone
cannot afford the

00:19:44.902 --> 00:19:45.570
drug without it.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.500
PROFESSOR: I'm going to come
to that in a second.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.770
Now actually, let me just hold
that thought for a second

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.710
because I want to actually show
you how we think about

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.490
whether patent is a
good idea or not.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.320
So let's go to figure 15-2.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.400
I just want to, sort of, show
you how what you guys seem to

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.980
understand intuitively, we can
illustrate in the kind of

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.850
graphs we've been using.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.580
Once again, we want to think
about going back and forth

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.230
between the intuition and the
graphical and mathematical

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.050
aspects of this stuff.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:15.120
So here we have a monopolist.
Imagine that you have a good

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.700
where the original demand
curve is D1.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.470
A good where the original demand
curve is D1 and the

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:26.490
original consumer surplus is
that dotted area C plus 1 plus

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.990
that slashed triangle.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.960
So it's based on the area above
the competitive price PC

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.900
under the demand curve D1.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.050
So you have a good.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.480
It's some drug, which
people like.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.910
And there's some
demand for it.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.890
And it's produced competitively
at a price PC

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.340
with the consumer surplus
of that triangle.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.730
Now, let's say a monopolist
comes along and says, we can

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.290
make this drug way better.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.070
We could make a much better
drug, but we're going to need

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.260
a patent for it.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.510
Well, two things happen.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.530
On the one hand, the demand
curve shifts way out.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.360
Now you've got something which
people value a lot more.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.430
They're much more willing to
pay for this better drug.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:05.240
OK?

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.540
And that's the benefit.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.100
That's the innovation
effect on demand.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.370
On the other hand, the
price goes up to the

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.930
monopolist's price.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.386
Where marginal revenue equals
marginal cost, they're going

00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:21.930
to produce at Q sub m and charge
a higher price P sub m.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.770
Whereas, if this is a perfectly
competitive firm,

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.930
they produce much more, where D2
hits the marginal cost and

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.260
consumer surplus would
be much larger.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.830
So the trade off is, on the
one hand, you end up here.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.750
In this case I've drawn, you end
up with a larger consumer

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.890
surplus, even with monopoly.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.300
But you could imagine drawing
the same graph, in the case

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.110
where consumer surplus falls.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.540
You can imagine demand doesn't
go up that much.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.380
But the monopolist gets
the monopoly price.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.390
And you could imagine drawing
this triangle such that the

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.330
new consumer surplus triangle
is smaller than the old

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.010
consumer surplus triangle.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.080
OK?

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.790
So it's not obvious which
way this goes.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.580
You have two effects.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.900
On the one hand, you have the
effect that demand shifts out.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.110
That creates a potential for
more social surplus.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.400
On the other hand, you have the
case that the monopolist

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.500
artificially prices too high.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.670
That causes a reduction
in social surplus.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.120
In this case, the former
dominated the latter.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.170
But I hope you can see you can
draw this in cases where that

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.750
wouldn't be true.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.520
And that's the tricky
thing with patents.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.800
It's going to depend.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.230
If you're patenting something
which is really demand

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.480
increasing, that's great.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.070
But if you're patenting
something which is just a

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.090
copycat of something that exists
and all you're doing is

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.130
turning a competitive market--

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.430
In the limit, imagine I
somehow snookered the

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.570
government into giving me a
patent for something which

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.690
literally does no more
than what's existed.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.830
But somehow I could fool--

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.840
In that case, have to do a
little more or people wouldn't

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.945
buy it, just a little more
than what existed.

00:22:48.945 --> 00:22:50.350
It wouldn't increase
demand much.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:57.830
But I would then have these
monopoly rents.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.430
OK?

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:02.250
So that's basically the trade
off with patents.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.430
All right, question
about that.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.830
Now, let me move on then
and talk about--

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.030
The question was
raised about--

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.090
Well, couldn't the government
do something about this, in

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.520
terms of trying to address
this problem.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.100
And we just talked about the
government as bad guy in

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:16.960
creating this problem.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.170
Although, it's not necessarily
a problem

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.740
in the case of patents.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.890
But there's also the role of
government as potential good

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.990
guy, which is can the government
help in this case

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.480
of natural monopoly?

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.780
So natural monopoly, we've got
this awkward situation where

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.150
clearly a monopoly
makes sense.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.980
It doesn't make sense to have
competitive people delivering

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.330
water in town.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.990
But once you've got one person
delivering water, they'll

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.400
charge you a fortune for it,
well above marginal cost. And

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.090
that's inefficient.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.700
That lowers social surplus
relative to the optimal level

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.650
of provision.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.600
So can the government
solve this problem?

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.730
Could the government, for
example, come in and say look,

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.340
we recognize there's
a natural monopoly.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.410
We recognize that you, Rubrico,
are the only company

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.690
that makes sense to
deliver water.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:05.210
But we are going to regulate you
in a way to maximize the

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.890
social surplus, given that
natural monopoly.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.450
So to see that, let's
go to the highly

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.510
complicated figure 15-3.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.870
OK, we'll have to walk
through this slowly.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.040
It's a lot of stuff going
on here at once.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.340
OK?

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:17.800
15-3.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.750
We're back to the usual curves
we were using last time.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.080
The demand curve is P
equals 24 minus Q.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.510
The cost curve is 12
plus Q squared.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.160
So the marginal cost
is just 2Q.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.980
The competitive outcome was
to produce eight units

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.170
at a price of 16.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.450
The monopoly outcome was
to produce six units

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.210
at a price of 18.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.210
OK?

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.130
And you ended up with the
monopolist causing a

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.670
deadweight loss of C plus E.
That was where we were last

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.362
time in this example.

00:24:53.362 --> 00:24:55.980
And let's say this was
a natural monopoly.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.610
So that's why there's
a monopolist there.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:04.460
Now, what if the government came
in and mandated that the

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.540
monopolist can charge no more
than the competitive price?

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.550
Let's say the government
knew what the

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.300
competitive price was.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.490
The government says,
look, I took 14.01.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.320
I see this graph.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.560
I know the competitive
price is 16.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.000
So I'm going to say,
monopolist--

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.390
You're the monopolist.
You go ahead.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.180
And no one else can
deliver water.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.350
It makes sense for
you to do it.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:26.510
But I'm going to regulate that
you cannot charge consumers a

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.670
price above 16.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.730
What you can see in that case,
is the government will turn

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:38.580
the monopolist from a price
maker to a price taker.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.620
And in doing so, the government
will undo the

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.810
poisoning effect we talked about
last time and cause the

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.720
monopolist to behave as if it
was a competitive firm.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.860
So to see that, we have to ask,
well what's the marginal

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.310
revenue curve now for the
monopolist, given this

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.930
government mandate that it can
charge no more than 16?

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:06.650
Well, the marginal revenue
curve, up to the point it

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.790
sells six, is the old marginal
revenue curve.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.570
So we're working down this
marginal revenue curve.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.540
And up to that point, where
marginal revenue intersects

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.910
marginal cost, that's the
marginal revenue curve.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.480
And that's where the monopolist
would stop.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.980
But the problem is the
monopolist isn't actually able

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.290
to charge more than 16.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.570
So now, if it's charging 16,
now it asks itself well,

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:32.130
should I produce that
seventh unit.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.210
Remember last time
we did the math.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.770
The monopolist should not
produce the seventh unit.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.590
Because last time we showed
that, because of that

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.785
poisoning effect, profits would
fall if it produced that

00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:42.840
seventh unit.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.910
But now it's not true because
now it's only charging 16.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.300
So if it's charging 16, and if
it produces that seventh unit,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.380
it's still going to charge 16.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.270
The poisoning effect
has gone away.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.620
There's no more poisoning
effect.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.990
There's no loss to producing the
seventh unit because the

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:00.040
most it can get is 16.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.240
It would like to price
it much higher.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.470
It can't.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:11.780
Since the most it can price at
is 16 he says, well gee, then

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.640
there's no poisoning effect.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.390
I might as well produce at
the competitive level.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.900
And basically, what you can
see is if you tell the

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.130
monopolist they can't charge
more than the competitive

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.810
price, then they will produce
at the competitive level.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.820
And you'll end up at that
competitive outcome, even with

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.240
a monopolist, because that will
be the profit maximizing

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.770
thing for the monopolist
to do.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.130
So sounds like we've got a
pretty good solution here.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:38.720
Right?

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.020
If there's a natural monopoly,
we just come in and say you

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.470
can't charge more than the
competitive price.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.520
So in theory, government
can fix this.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.250
We've been talking about
government as a bad guy.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.590
Here's government
as a good guy.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.160
Government can come
in and fix this.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.180
What's the problem with that?

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.890
What's the problem, in practice,
with carrying out

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.588
what I just laid out
here in theory?

00:27:58.588 --> 00:27:59.084
Yeah.

00:27:59.084 --> 00:28:00.696
AUDIENCE: How does the
government know what the

00:28:00.696 --> 00:28:01.068
competitive price is?

00:28:01.068 --> 00:28:02.458
PROFESSOR: How does the
government know what the

00:28:02.458 --> 00:28:03.170
competitive price is?

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.590
How does the government know
what these curves look like?

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.590
Now, let's think about
both curves.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.170
OK, first the government
needs to know--

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:11.630
If it wants to know the
competitive price, it's got to

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.260
know the demand curve and
the supply curve.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.910
Well the demand curve, in
principle, the government

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:17.370
could learn.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.010
The government could go out and
survey people and get a

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.820
sense of kind of, could collect
some data, could run

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.670
some experiments and try to
find out from people.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.200
Gee, how much are you willing
to pay for another unit,

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.460
another unit, another unit?

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.250
So in principle, the government
could actually

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.160
measure demand curve by
doing market research.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.020
Although in practice,
this is quite hard.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.100
It turns out in practice--

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.580
The first rule of economics is
believe what people do, not

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.670
what they say.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.760
Turns out, if you ask people
what they're willing to pay,

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.640
you get very silly answers,
relative to actually do it.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.470
So for example, this comes up
a lot in when the government

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.930
needs to value environmental
damage.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.590
So if we need to ask how much
should we charge BP for the

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.830
damage they did to the Gulf, we
need to value how sad are

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.820
people that the wetlands
are ruined.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.100
Well, the only thing to
do is to ask people.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:07.930
And it turns out when
you do that, you get

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.510
incredibly silly answers.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.815
Things like, for example, if you
ask people how sorry are

00:29:11.815 --> 00:29:14.820
you if 10 ducks died, they'll
say I'm this sad.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.560
Say how sad are you if
a million ducks died?

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.290
They'll say, I'm the
same amount sad.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.820
OK, that doesn't make sense.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.240
You ask people what's it
worth to save a duck

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.790
versus saving a whale.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.660
And you ask in that order,
they'll say saving a duck is

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.460
worth $100, saving a whale
is worth $100.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.830
Or it's worth $150.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.650
You ask the other order.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.870
You say, how much is
it worth to save a

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.940
whale and then a duck.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.310
Well then, saving a whale
is worth $300.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.690
And a duck's only worth
$50, same question

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.640
just a different order.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.900
People do not give sensible
answers when you ask them what

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.760
things are worth.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.640
The best way to know is to
actually vary the price, is to

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.770
actually run experiments where
you actually say, OK, we have

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.580
to actually give people
different prices and see how

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.460
they behave, actually trace
out the demand curve.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.210
That turns out to be very hard
to do, especially for things

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.960
like valuing damage
to wetlands.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.380
But even for things like valuing
prescription drugs,

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.550
you've got to literally--

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.480
It's hard to run the experiment
where, literally, I

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.710
give you a different price
than you for a

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:09.890
prescription drug.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:10.900
That's a little bit tricky.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.080
So it's hard to get
the demand curve.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.870
So that's the first problem
the government faces.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.740
But in some sense, that's the
less difficult problem.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.230
It is tracing out the
demand curve.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.720
In principle, there
are ways to do it.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.450
In principle, you could run
experiments where you vary the

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.620
price and you get that
demand curve.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.860
In practice, the difficulty
is firm supply

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.060
curves are much harder.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.520
And why is that?

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.195
Because let's say the government
comes to you and

00:30:34.195 --> 00:30:35.300
says, look I'm doing great.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.570
I've nailed down the
demand curve.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.340
I just need to know your supply
curve, so I can set

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.210
your price.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.290
What's your supply
curve again?

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:42.055
OK, what are you going to say?

00:30:42.055 --> 00:30:43.262
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:43.262 --> 00:30:45.490
PROFESSOR: Aw, this stuff
costs a fortune to make.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.550
You would not believe what it
costs this stuff to make.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.450
My supply curve--

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.360
12 plus Q squared?

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:50.850
Ha!

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:51.280
That's a joke.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.480
It's 30 plus 18Q squared.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.050
Are you kidding?

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.720
My supply curve is crazy high.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.340
And the problem is, the
government doesn't know.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.950
Because with consumers, at least
I can run experiments to

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:03.480
get the demand.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.800
With the firm, I can't get
inside their books.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.650
I can't really know.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.840
And if I get inside the books,
they can cook their books and

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.240
make it look like stuff
costs more.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.010
How can I really know?

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.340
Just like it's difficult for
the board of directors to

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.900
figure out whether the CEO of a
company needs his own plane,

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.640
it's very difficult for
government regulators to

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.845
figure out what it actually
costs to produce these drugs.

00:31:21.845 --> 00:31:26.570
And as a result, it's very
hard to get this right.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:31.700
And the problem is if the
government gets it wrong, it

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.200
can make it worse than not
regulating at all.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.180
So for example, if the
government came in, and let's

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.750
say, the government said look,
I can't believe this firm.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.370
12 plus Q squared sounds way
too high for cost. I think

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.930
marginal costs are much
lower than that.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.060
And I think the competitive
price should be 10 because I

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.470
know the firm is going
to lie to me.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.740
I know they're going to tell
me numbers too big.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.795
So I'm going to say that
equilibrium should be

00:31:54.795 --> 00:31:57.740
competitive, should
be a price of 10.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.500
And at a price of 10, the firm
is now operating off the

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.130
marginal revenue curve
at that low price

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.940
because it's below 16.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.660
So at a price of 10, the firm
is going to set marginal

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.790
revenue equal to marginal cost.
Well, marginal revenue

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.560
at a price of 10 is the price.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.490
That's all they can
charge is 10.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.450
So they're going to set price
equal to marginal cost. The

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:27.040
marginal cost with a
production of 10--

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.010
The marginal cost is 2Q.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.090
So set price equal to 2Q.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.490
Or 10 equals 2Q.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.280
Or Q equals five.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.230
They'll produce five units.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.520
They'll say look, if you're only
going to let me charge

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.020
10, I'm only going to
produce five units.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:41.750
That's what I'll produce.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.450
That's what's optimal for
me at a price of 10.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.030
What you see is--

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.240
Now if you look at this graph
and you look at the firm

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.585
producing five units.

00:32:53.585 --> 00:32:56.540
What you see is the firm
produces five units.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.540
Now, the total surplus
has fallen.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.670
It's just A plus B plus D. The
consumer surplus is very high.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.320
We don't have the horizontal
line of 10 here.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.360
But draw yourself that
horizontal line of 10, which

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.120
is where the dashed line of five
intersects the marginal

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.870
cost curve.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.430
You could see there's a
big consumer surplus.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.980
It's A plus B plus half of D and
a little producer surplus,

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.800
which is that triangle that's
the lower half of D. But look

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.550
what's happened to
social surplus.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.550
Before the government got
involved, the deadweight loss

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:30.190
was just C plus E. Now the
government, by misregulating

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:33.210
the price, has created
deadweight losses of C plus E

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.840
plus F plus G plus H. The
government has just increased

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.240
the deadweight loss a lot,
by getting involved and

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.710
misregulating.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.150
And in particular, that area
that increases it--

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.150
Here's the interesting thing.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.490
Falling from eight to six caused
that little triangle.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.650
Falling from six to five, just
one more unit, causes a

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:59.280
trapezoid, which is probably
bigger than that triangle.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.250
Why?

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.770
Because we're moving
farther and farther

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.170
away from the optimum.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.890
We're losing more and more
trades that were socially

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.199
beneficial.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.929
Remember at the optimum,
deadweight loss is very small.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.190
But as you move farther and
farther away, that deadweight

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.190
loss gets bigger and bigger.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.760
So this government
misregulation, instead of

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.280
moving us to what's optimal,
by just moving us one below

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.870
where we were as a monopolist
has caused all this huge extra

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:29.120
deadweight loss and
made things worse.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.280
Indeed, it could be worse.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.630
Imagine the government chose a
price so low the firm just

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.100
said, forget it.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.000
I'm going to shut down.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.699
You could lose all surplus
in this market.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:39.360
If the government came
in and said, no, we

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:39.880
don't believe you.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.130
The price should be whatever.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.300
It wouldn't be, in this case,
because in this case, price is

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.580
always greater than
marginal cost.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.445
But let's say the government
came in another case and set a

00:34:47.445 --> 00:34:48.239
price that was too low.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:49.650
It could just cause the
firm to shut down.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:53.090
Then all social surplus in the
market would disappear.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.190
OK?

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.540
So basically, there's these
difficulties with the

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.720
regulation, which is it's hard
to know how to set the price.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.620
Now in practice, of course, what
happens is governments

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.570
set the price too high.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.740
In practice, the government
would much rather err on the

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.160
side of letting monopolists make
a little money than err

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.720
on the side of there being
too little of the good.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.170
So government, facing
uncertainty about what the

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.410
right level to set is, will
typically end up erring on the

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.460
side of monopolists, partly
because of the way of the

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.990
nature of regulation.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:26.700
So let's say you are
president whatever.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.310
And you want to regulate
this new good.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.660
OK, somebody made the new good
and you want to regulate it.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.630
Well who are you going to hire
to be the regulator?

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.700
Well clearly, someone who knows

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.740
something about the market.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.930
So there's a new good.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.020
My favorite example
of an outdated

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.420
technology is the umbrella.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.490
I really think we've
got to figure out a

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:44.360
better way to do umbrellas.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.030
They suck.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.410
In the wind, they blow up.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.110
They're useless, right.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.490
There's got to be a better
umbrella out there.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:52.050
Let's say somebody finally
figures out a better umbrella.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.150
But they've got a
patent on it.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.720
And so you want to
regulate it.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.480
It's got some natural monopoly
producing it.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.950
It uses unobtanium.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.750
And the only can find it
in one place, Pandora.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.090
So they've got to--

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:02.835
They're the only guys--

00:36:02.835 --> 00:36:04.640
Isn't that the stupidest name
ever for a material?

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.300
How could they have not come
up with a better name than

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.250
unobtanium?

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.570
Anyway, so it uses unobtanium.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.320
And basically they have
this natural monopoly.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.950
So you want to regulate it

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.770
Well, who are you going to
find to regulate it?

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.540
Well you know, once there was an
expert in making umbrellas

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.510
with unobtanium.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.220
That person who you're
going to hire.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.370
That's the right
person to hire.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:22.630
Unfortunately, that probably
means they're probably

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.270
friendly with all the guys
that make umbrellas with

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.900
unobtanium.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.790
And they're not going
to want to be too

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.100
tough on their buddies.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.110
So the natural person who's
going to regulate, by their

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:35.560
nature, is going to tend to be
someone who's going to think

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.070
sort of on the industry's
side.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.970
Moreover, what are they going to
do after they're done being

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.050
the regulator?

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.190
They're going to go back into
the business of making

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.440
umbrellas with unobtanium.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.910
So they're not going to want to
be too mean to the business

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.000
because they're going to
be making money off

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.550
it five years hence.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.340
So you've got this problem that
regulators are going to

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.390
have a natural tendency to be
sort of friendly towards

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.700
industry they're regulating.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.280
And that's going to lead
to an upward bias.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.970
The question is, how much is
that upward bias in the price

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.160
relative to what the monopolist
would actually do.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.860
And much like a patent,
it depends.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.850
You can draw examples where
the government regulation

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.180
would improve things and
examples where the government

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.730
regulation would make
things worse.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.490
You can do examples
either way.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:14.170
And what, at least, is
interesting here is this is

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.623
the first example we've seen
or one of the few examples

00:37:15.623 --> 00:37:16.670
we've seen where the government,
at least, could

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.270
possibly make things better.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.730
Even though it's not
clear they will.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.600
At least, they could possibly
make things better.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.710
And that's because--

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.365
Why is that?

00:37:23.365 --> 00:37:24.910
This is a very important
insight.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:25.740
Why is that?

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.530
That's because everything we've
dealt with so far, the

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.710
market does everything well.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.280
We haven't needed
a government.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.290
What natural monopolies do is
they say, wow, here's a case

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.970
of what we call a
market failure.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.480
The market has failed to
maximize social surplus.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.860
And that opens the door for
potential gains for government

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.220
intervention.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.130
Basically, as long as markets
are functioning well in a

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:52.650
competitive manner, there's no
door open for the government

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.270
to make things better.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.590
The government can just
make things worse.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.640
It's only when there's market
failures, of which natural

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.720
monopoly is one example, can
the government come in and

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.730
potentially make
things better.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.170
It won't necessarily do so.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:09.210
But at least there's a door
open to doing so.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.840
Questions about that--

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.990
OK, the last thing I want to
talk about, today, is an

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:20.160
example that's in between a
natural monopoly and no

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.200
natural monopoly, which
is what we call

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.460
a contestable market.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.610
A contestable market--

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:36.080
A contestable market is one
which says that there is a

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.180
natural monopoly, but it's not
so big that someone couldn't

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.860
come in and compete if the
profits got too large.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.960
Or another way of saying this
is, just because there's a

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.020
monopoly doesn't mean there's
a whole lot of market power.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.800
Just because there's a monopoly
doesn't mean there's

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.750
a whole lot of market power.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.740
So imagine a natural monopoly
market with a very modest

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.030
fixed cost, a fixed cost
that's, you know,

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.440
real but not enormous.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.700
As long that monopolist who
gets in first keeps their

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.940
price near marginal cost,
no will ever enter.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.770
As long as they get their price
near marginal cost, no

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.700
one will enter, even if they're
making a small profit.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:21.090
No one will enter because no one
could ever make money then

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.690
and pay the fixed.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.340
No one could ever come in,
pay the fixed cost,

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.940
and still make money.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.720
So no one's ever
going to enter.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.370
But if that price ever got too
far above marginal cost, then

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.210
someone would say, ah, there's
so much profit to be made.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:33.210
That'll cover my fixed costs.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.960
I'm coming in.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.260
That's what we mean by
contestable market, a market

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.010
which can exist with a monopoly
and can exist with

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:41.880
someone making money.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:47.630
And yet ultimately, there's
sufficiently easy entry that,

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:52.100
basically, the monopolist is
forced to behave almost like a

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.250
competitive firm.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.410
So it's sort of like market
pressure on monopolists.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.080
It's a weird outcome where you
get a monopoly market but

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.670
pricing close to competitive
levels because of

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.290
this threat of entry.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.910
Now the most famous example
of this is in airlines and

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.620
airline deregulation.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.900
Until the 1970s, the way
airlines worked in the US is

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.400
there were private airline
companies.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.750
Many of them don't exist
anymore, Eastern, Pan Am.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.290
Ones you don't know about,
don't exist anymore.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:24.010
And they were regulated.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.650
It was a regulated oligopoly.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:26.940
We haven't really talked
about oligopolies yet.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.150
It was a few firms competing.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.490
But think of it as a monopoly.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.540
It's basically regulated
monopoly.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.380
In particular, they
had monopolies

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.570
on different routes.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:35.630
So what happened is the
government would

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.120
say New York to Boston.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.740
That is the route that Eastern
Airlines owns.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.930
And they fly that without
competition.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.940
But in order to make sure they
don't rip off the consumer,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.200
we're going to regulate
their prices.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.950
So Eastern Airlines, you fly
this without competition.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.260
But we're going to
regulate what you

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.750
can charge the consumer.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.350
And this was because the
government viewed airlines as

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:58.050
a natural monopoly.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:01.750
It said, look, airplanes are
really big and expensive.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.720
There's huge fixed cost to
becoming an airline.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.990
So we think this is a
natural monopoly.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.650
And we're going to
regulate it.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.750
However, economists started
pointing out, and experts

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.580
started pointing out that no,
in fact, this was actually a

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.150
very contestable market.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:17.400
That it turned out
it wasn't that

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.360
expensive to produce airplanes.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.610
There were a lot of older
airplanes you could

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.960
refurbish, et cetera.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.620
And that basically this is
a market where, if the

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.120
government opened it up to
competition, you could

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.680
actually get some--

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.720
That threat of entry
eventually could

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.620
drive prices down.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.535
And so basically, after a lot of
debate, the government, in

00:41:34.535 --> 00:41:37.960
the late 1970s, did deregulate
airlines.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.965
One of the most important
changes in government policy

00:41:39.965 --> 00:41:42.880
in the 1970s was they
deregulated airlines.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.390
And what happened?

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.270
Well, three things happened.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.520
First of all, prices
fell enormously.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.790
Prices fell by about a third.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.980
Flying from point A to point B
fell by a third, other places

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.050
more extreme.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:59.040
When I was an undergraduate at
MIT, I could fly from Boston

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.000
to Newark for $19 each way.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.490
There was this airline called
People's Express that was

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.880
introduced in the wave of
deregulation in the 1980s.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.590
People's Express--

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.680
It was fascinating.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.440
I don't know what their planes
were held together by.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.510
And the thing was, you didn't
even buy a ticket.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.920
You just went and
waited on line.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.830
They let you on the plane.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:18.240
And when the plane was
full, they took off.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.350
And they made you pay
on the plane.

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:21.740
I still, to this day, don't
know what happened if you

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.350
didn't have the money, if they
like threw you off, get

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:24.070
parachutes or something.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.320
I don't know what they did.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.880
But literally, they'd come down
the middle of the aisle

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.720
with a little credit
card thing.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.030
And they'd make you
pay on the plane.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:33.065
I mean literally, it was cheaper
than taking a bus.

00:42:33.065 --> 00:42:37.400
It was incredible,
$19 each way.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.240
So prices came way, way down.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.640
The second effect was
many more routes

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.200
were offered to consumers.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.040
Suddenly, routes which the
government had said, no that's

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.740
not profitable.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.140
You shouldn't fly that.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.910
New entrants said, no, in
fact, it is profitable,

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.220
government.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.040
You just had the cost
structure wrong.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.070
And it is profitable to fly from
Pittsburgh to Akron, or

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.670
whatever, wherever
they now fly.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.140
There are hundreds more places
you can fly now than you could

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.520
in the 1970s.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.220
Hundreds and hundreds of routes
that just didn't exist

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.350
because the government
regulators assumed they

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:09.250
weren't profitable.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.210
But in fact, they were.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:13.180
Once there was competition in
these contestable markets,

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.430
they did turn out to
be profitable.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:20.200
And the final thing that
happened was that quality of

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.870
airline travel deteriorated
massively.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:25.920
When I was a kid, and
you flew on planes.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.580
It was really nice.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.420
I mean there was tons
of leg room.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.820
You got tons of free food,
free movies, free drinks.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.690
And I didn't do that
when I was a kid.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:35.640
My parents did.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.120
Basically, it was an
unbelievably nice experience.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.490
It's not so nice now.

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.680
I think as any of you who have
flown will attest to.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.920
Now they're charging
you for everything.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.650
And you can barely fit your legs
in if you're over 5'2".

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:51.490
Now, why did this happen?

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:52.100
Somebody tell me.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.080
Why did this happen?

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.260
Why did deregulation lead from
a world where flights were

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.890
unbelievably comfy to a world
where flights are uncomfy?

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.155
Yeah.

00:44:01.155 --> 00:44:04.408
AUDIENCE: It's more profitable
to have more people taking it.

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:04.906
And--

00:44:04.906 --> 00:44:06.490
PROFESSOR: Sure, but that
was always true.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:07.800
It was always more profitable
to have

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.650
more people on a plane.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.070
It was always more profitable
to not give them nice stuff.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:12.080
That hasn't changed.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.000
What has changed?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:13.340
Yeah.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.663
AUDIENCE: You have-- there's
competition.

00:44:14.663 --> 00:44:16.380
So they need to reduce
their cost more.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.253
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:44:17.253 --> 00:44:18.702
AUDIENCE: There's more
competition.

00:44:18.702 --> 00:44:21.120
So they need to reduce
their cost.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.300
PROFESSOR: There is
more competition.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.620
But there was some competition
before.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.470
But you're right.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:26.440
Your about halfway there.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.063
What else?

00:44:27.063 --> 00:44:29.485
AUDIENCE: Consumers aren't
willing to pay for leg room

00:44:29.485 --> 00:44:29.970
and all that stuff.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:33.260
PROFESSOR: Basically before, if
there was a route with two

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.730
airlines on it--

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:35.970
A lot of them, I said there's
two airlines.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.320
And you wanted to compete.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.490
How did you compete?

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.210
You couldn't compete on price.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.285
Right?

00:44:41.285 --> 00:44:44.660
If Eastern and Pan Am were
flying New York to Boston,

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.900
they couldn't compete
on price.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.720
The price was regulated.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.960
So how did they compete, by
being as nice as possible on

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.600
everything else, even though
consumers didn't

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.170
really value it.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.080
Well, once they competed on
price, they said, look,

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.650
consumers don't really care
so much about this

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.650
crappy airline food.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.380
We're going to get rid of
it and charge 20% less.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.960
And lo and behold, they did.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.180
What's ironic, of course, is
everyone bitches about how bad

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.050
airlines are.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.800
But they don't bitch about
how cheap they are.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.990
It is so cheap to fly now,
compared to when I was a kid.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.080
Based on what happened is they
went from competing on

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.240
non-price factors to
competing on price.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.570
There's always competitive
pressure.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.760
There's always competitive
pressure.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.610
It's just before, the
competition had to be on

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:26.160
things which consumers
didn't like.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.030
But they liked it enough
that you might as

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.770
well compete on it.

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:30.130
Because it was not that
consumers didn't like it all.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.050
Obviously they liked
it some, or they

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.750
wouldn't have bothered.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.250
Now they've moved to a more
efficient form of competition,

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:38.770
which is to compete on price
rather than on quantity.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:39.251
Yeah.

00:45:39.251 --> 00:45:41.014
AUDIENCE: When you said the
government regulated the

00:45:41.014 --> 00:45:43.580
price, only wasn't that just
on the upper level

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.542
that you got that?

00:45:44.542 --> 00:45:45.790
PROFESSOR: No.

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:48.560
The government just regulated
the price.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.680
Now, so this is a big victory
for economists.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.370
Yay for economists--

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.220
We did a great job.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.430
But we whiffed on one thing.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:01.130
We whiffed on one thing, which
we did not foresee, which has

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.620
led deregulation to be much
less beneficial than we

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.150
thought it was going to be.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:08.990
What we whiffed on was the
hub and spoke system.

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:12.780
We whiffed on the fact that,
while building airplanes is

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:18.200
contestable, building slots
at airports is not.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.190
That there's a limited number
of slots at airports.

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.020
And it's incredibly hard to
build a new airport because of

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.320
environmental regulations
and other things.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.770
What that meant was there is
still a natural monopoly in

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.780
airport slots, even if
there's not much of a

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.970
natural monopoly in planes.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:36.920
The result is that now what
airlines do is funnel everyone

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.570
through their hub and then
out to the spokes.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.990
And as a result, because of that
they have developed new

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.440
quasi monopolies.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.820
So to fly from point A to point
B, for many A's and B's,

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.150
only one airline flies it.

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:51.670
Because it's economical
for them because

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:53.210
point A is their hub.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.460
But airline B can't
get into that hub.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.830
They can't get a gate
at that hub.

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:01.060
So as a result, they can't
effectively fly from A to B.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.940
So my wife is from
Minneapolis.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.960
We had to go to Minneapolis.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.420
Northwest had a monopoly on
going to Minneapolis.

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.890
So I could fly from Boston to
LA for half the price of

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.410
Boston to Minneapolis.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:15.680
Why, because Northwest
controlled all the gate slots

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.560
in Minneapolis.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.790
They had a natural monopoly
on that resource.

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:20.160
And that's what economists
missed.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.170
So deregulation worked in some
markets with a lot of

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:23.550
competition.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:27.180
Like the New York to LA market
is very competitive.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.740
It did not work in other
markets, where there was this

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.030
natural hub.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:35.590
And so one airline
could dominate.

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.040
Or a few airlines
could dominate.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.660
And that's why you could
see some crazy pricing

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.180
differentials.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.490
That's why, for example,
I could fly to

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.510
Baltimore for $127.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:48.480
But to DC, it cost me $500, even
though they're less than

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.640
an hour apart by car.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.800
This is because the constraint
on slots has limited the

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.420
amount of competition
that can go on.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.730
And so that's sort of an example
of where competition

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.040
can work and where it can't to
try to deal with these natural

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.460
monopoly problems.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.670
All right, let me stop there.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.690
And we'll come back
on Wednesday

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:09.930
and talk about oligopoly.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:12.550
Good luck tomorrow night
on the exam.

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:13.400
It's tomorrow night?

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.430
Yeah, tomorrow night.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:15.150
Good luck.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.030
Everyone looked confused
for a second.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:18.100
Next week--

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.750
Oh--

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.570
OK, just joking, April fools,
Halloween fools.

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:24.820
Good luck next week
on the exam.

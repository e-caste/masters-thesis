00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:23.300
PROFESSOR: So let's get started.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.980
Today we're going to be
talking about preflop, which

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.570
is the last thing
I definitely want

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.350
to cover before the
[? Sakuna ?] tournament.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.892
As you know, this is going to
be one of my last lectures.

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:33.850
I'm teaching one or to
over the next two weeks,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.224
but we're primarily
going to have

00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:37.970
guest speakers talking
about more the macro poker

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.280
environment.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.490
So why are we doing preflop?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.215
So in tournaments,
most of your value

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.940
is going to come from
what you do preflop--

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.400
playing it close to optimally.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.430
And the reason is
because a lot of people

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.220
don't do this good at all.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.990
Like they really,
really play preflop

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.910
badly because it's
very counter intuitive.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.050
Especially live.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.320
Like people have a
much tougher time

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.300
doing this because
either they're

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.390
afraid of getting knocked
down on a bad hand,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.610
or their afraid of
showing down a bad hand,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.400
or live players are
just worse in general.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.800
So for whatever reason,
people screw this up online.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.911
A little bit on live a lot.

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:16.660
In addition, one of
the reasons that we're

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.720
spending an entire day on it is
it's relatively easier to solve

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.340
from a mathematical standpoint.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.190
Like we get close to
a Nash equilibrium

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.130
because there aren't
that many variables.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.365
Whereas postflop, there
are a million variables.

00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:30.740
It's more related to kind of
putting things into patterns

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.812
that you might be close to.

00:01:32.812 --> 00:01:34.020
So that's why I'm doing this.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.680
And then let's start
with a scenario

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.138
that we're going to be analyzing
for the rest of the class.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.922
There we go.

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:43.880
So here's our scenario.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.680
So I'm-- how it works heads up
is the dealer button is a small

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.360
blind.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.560
That's a slight
break in the rules

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.276
because you assume I'm
button, he's small blind,

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:55.400
I'm big blind, but they
change around a little bit.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.860
This way, the button isn't the
last one to act every round.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.280
So here, I'm first one to
act preflop and then last

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.240
to act every round thereafter.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.710
If I were big blind, I'd
be less every single round.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.039
So it's a minor variation that
you guys should just know.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.800
So situation-- I'm
small blind for 125,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470
he's big blind for
150, and there's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.840
a 25 ante, which is why
there's 50 in the pot.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.790
And the question is
what do we do here?

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.581
OK, so we have 9-6
offsuit with 2 1/2 m.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:26.330
We're in the small
blind, and we're trying

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.780
to figure out what do we do.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.920
So the answer here might
not be that intuitive,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.730
and I don't think I'd
give it to you right away.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.120
But how we figure it out is
just with a normal semi-bluffing

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.050
equation.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.000
We take a look at-- OK,
so everything preflop

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.880
is a semi-bluff because we
have some chance of winning,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.680
and we're virtually
never less than 30%.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.710
So we just use this
semi-bluffing formula

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.900
that we've seen before
where our EV is just

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.770
going to be the pot times
the chance he folds,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.029
plus the chance he doesn't fold
times our EV when he calls.

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.070
We need to figure out some
sort of calling range.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.700
I just made up one
here that seemed

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.020
like about at the pro level,
and this is pretty wide.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.220
Like him calling with like
Ace-2 or Jack-10 or 2-2.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.701
This is a wideish range.

00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:15.700
I think a lot of players
for the tournament life

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.830
might not call this
wide, but it ends up

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.715
being like 27.6% of
hands he's calling.

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:23.340
So we're going to
use it as a baseline,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.260
and then later we'll show
why that doesn't matter.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.090
So our question is, what's
our equity versus range here?

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.580
And what we can do there is
just plug into PokerTracker.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.120
So the idea is we
don't know what

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.144
hand he has and we don't care.

00:03:38.144 --> 00:03:40.060
It's unrealistic to think
that we can get down

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.950
to any sort of hand
he'll be calling with,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.241
but we can get down to a range.

00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.970
We can say he's
equally likely to have

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.200
any assortment of the hands in
that range because if he calls,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.050
that means that he has
one of those hands.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.850
So we can compare our equity
versus any one of those hands

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.100
to get our equity
versus range, and we

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.930
can do that in PokerTracker.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.138
So what you're going to do
is you're going to open up

00:04:01.138 --> 00:04:04.290
the equity calculator, you're
going to put in 9-6 off,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.160
and then you're
going to put in this.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.750
I actually just
drew it in there,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.500
but that's the same
thing I showed before,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.850
which is pocket 2s are better.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.990
Ace-2, King-2 , Queen-- sorry.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.500
King-10, Queen-10,
Jack-10, and then the same

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.279
for offsuit, which
is the representation

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.200
of this entire thing.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.470
I just need to separate
offsuit or suited,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.470
and then I assumed by jack-10,
it meant that entire corner,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.480
although PokerTracker
likes specifying.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.350
Anyway, so this is
our equity versus.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.382
This is saying that
if we go in with 9-6

00:04:36.382 --> 00:04:40.070
and he calls with
anything in that range,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.310
we are 34% to win this hand.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.090
So I don't know if that's
about what you'd expect.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.450
It seems higher than I would
have thought initially,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.940
but that's our
equity verses range.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.280
If we go all in and
he calls, we can

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.650
assume we're a 35-65
underdog without even

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.610
knowing what he has.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.940
And then once we
find out what he has,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.273
we will find out whether we're
slightly better or worse,

00:05:00.273 --> 00:05:02.900
but that doesn't really matter.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.230
So we can calculate our EV
in this hand in the same way

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.730
that we're used to
calculating semi-bluffing.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.770
The EV of the push
is going to be this.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.700
The chance of him
folding times 425.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.410
If he calls 27%
of the time, that

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.200
means he folds whatever this
is like 73% of the time.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.920
So that's our value from him
folding-- the fold equity.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.770
And then 20% of the time
we're in a showdown situation

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.460
where of that [? push ?]
time that he calls,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.260
we're 35 to win 1250 and
we're 65 to lose 950,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.170
resulting in a
total equity of 253.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.130
So that's a lot of
chips for what might

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.729
seem like a very marginal move.

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.270
By going all in
here, you're actually

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.750
making that many chips.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.410
And in fact, a more
provocative way

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.480
to describe it is if
you don't do this,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.570
you are losing 250 chips.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.750
You only need 1,000 to
win this whole tournament,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.920
and by folding what seems
like a very weak hand

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.800
in this position, you are just
giving him 250 chips of value.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.400
So that's a lot, and that shows
how counterintuitive this is.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.970
That a situation where
you have really bad cards,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.030
you don't realize that
these are actually really,

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.090
really good cards
in the situation.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.660
In fact, no matter
what, your cards

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.040
are basically good
in this situation.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.980
Because this situation makes
any two cards good enough.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.907
So let's talk about-- so we
made one assumption, which

00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:34.990
is what his call range is.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.662
Did you have a question?

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:38.020
Oh, OK.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.890
So we made some assumption about
what his call range is, and I

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.990
said it didn't matter.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.590
Why?

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.130
Because what we can do here is
make the call range a variable.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.560
So this fold percent
is a variable,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.900
and then our win percent
is related to the percent

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.610
that he folds.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.859
Because if he calls a small
range of hands when we get

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:00.400
called, he's going
to be crushing us.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.880
Whereas if he calls
like 90% of the time,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.870
we're probably
ahead of his range

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.200
because he calls a
lot of worse hands.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.560
Anyway, so you can
take a graph and just

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.700
look, OK, he calls somewhere
between 0% of the time

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.560
in 100% of the time, and then we
can do this EV equation for all

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.140
those hands by
calculating OK, so what's

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.820
our equity versus calling range?

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.840
This doesn't change.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.010
We still win or lose the
same amount every time.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:32.570
And say so if we were
always pushing here,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.049
if he calls with whatever
range, this is our EV.

00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:36.590
And then one thing
that's interesting

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.070
about this graph is what?

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.730
It's always
positive, which means

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.060
that no matter what his calling
range is, this push is good.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.600
It might be more
intuitive this way.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.490
Like if he folds
100% of the time--

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.140
if he only calls 0% of
the time, we trend up

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.580
to a number around here.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.710
And what number's around here?

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.560
That's just this.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.760
It's the pot before
we do anything.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.160
So if he folds 100% of the
time, we just win the pot.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.610
Like that's our EV every
hand, and it just trends

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.700
based on this.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.440
Where the more he calls,
typically the better the worse

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.410
our EVs going to be.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:12.910
Yes?

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:23.350
[? Yes. ?] We'll get to that.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.380
And that's a good
question, although it's

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.960
going to take us half
the class to answer that.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.460
Anyway, so that's
a cool thing here.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.400
So it's always
positive, which means

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:40.740
I'm saying-- no matter what
his-- the villain does, always,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.850
always push all in with 9-6
offsuit in this position.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.980
So let's break it
down into components.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.420
So to explain
intuitively what drives

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.837
this graph is your equity
there is split into two parts

00:08:52.837 --> 00:08:53.920
because it's a semi-bluff.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.820
It's your fold equity
and your showdown equity.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.840
So let's turn this into lines.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.530
So you see your fold equity
just decreases the more

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.810
he calls in a linear fashion.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.250
So that should be
fairly intuitive.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.080
The proportion he calls
reduces your fold equity

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.860
by that amount, and then
your showdown equity

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.010
has a little curve
here where you

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.859
get more value from the showdown
on average the more he calls.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.900
The only reason there's
a little bit of curvature

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.899
is because it's multiplied
by the chances of him

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:25.220
calling in the first plAce.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.730
So it's tilting
in some direction.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.020
But anyway, these are curved.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.700
Makes this a very interesting
optimization puzzle.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.820
And the reason we're positive
at the end is for this reason.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.330
We're basically-- so this
line, the total equity,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.186
is just the sum of these two.

00:09:44.186 --> 00:09:45.560
Where our showdown
value is going

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.900
to be negative over
basically this entire range.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.320
Even when our fold
equity reaches zero,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.080
that's when our showdown
equity creeps just above zero.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.260
Regardless of what
his calling range is,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.840
your average is like
175 chips of EV.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.060
Like the 20% call--
or whatever we said.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.020
The 27% calling range
isn't necessarily optimal.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.110
He knows you have these cards.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.230
But on average, you're
getting-- whatever,

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.060
like 100 and something chips.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.500
And just to show
how bad is folding,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.160
if you just open fold
this for some reason,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.890
that's as bad as
purposely calling it all

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.010
in with 3-4 versus Ace-King.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.900
Like that's an equivalent
amount of EV loss

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.850
as folding this hand.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.540
So now let's talk about how
hard this is going to be.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.770
So push/fold
decisions are really

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.220
hard to kind of
intuitively figure out

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.050
just because of the curvature
and the steepness of those

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.670
graphs are moving
in weird directions

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.220
and they're both moving at
the same time with regard

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.780
to all the other variables.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.720
So it makes it so that
it's very hard to come up

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.950
with very quick rules.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.180
Some variables are going
to affect our decision,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.440
and the result is
either push or fold.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.350
Our result isn't
even as complicated

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.670
as betting a certain
amount, but the variables

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.540
you have to consider are our
cards, our position, our stack,

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.100
and the villain's
call range, which

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.570
results in this
five-dimensional ray that we

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.500
have to slice and dice so that
we have our push/fold decision

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.780
range.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.280
So what we want to do is
isolate for specific things.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:30.150
We want to say OK, let's take--
let's make this and this static

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.850
so that we can
solve for these two,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.570
or let's make these two static
so we can solve for these two.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.740
So we can end up with a chart
that looks something like this.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.448
And this is a little
bit more manageable.

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:41.570
We can just say this green
area is when you should push

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.240
and this yellow area is
when you should fold.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.410
That's our goal here.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.880
To be able to develop
that sort of chart.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.770
And then figure out what's
the best thing to isolate.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.220
So let's get to it.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.739
So range is the
postset of hands.

00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:56.780
This is how you write it.

00:11:59.262 --> 00:12:00.970
This is the assumption
that we're making.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.850
So we're doing it
for two reasons.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.680
Analyzing our opponent, which
we're not going to be doing.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.930
We're going to assume we
have no information about him

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.430
because it's preflop, and a lot
of it-- one of our assumptions

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.220
is that he hasn't
even acted yet, so we

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.550
have no information at all.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.860
But we're going to be using
it to determine our plays.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.350
Basically we're saying we
have some sort of decision

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.620
[INAUDIBLE] for our range.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.954
Like we certainly can't solve
this for every single hand

00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:25.411
or at least we can't remember
it, so what we're going to do

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.630
is come up with a line
where we say every hand

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.540
above that certain line, i.e.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.640
That range above
that line, is going

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.790
to be good for our
specific decision.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.540
And we're bringing
these into percentiles,

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.373
and that's how we're
going to describe them.

00:12:38.373 --> 00:12:40.620
And we're using
Sklansky-Carlson.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.880
His rankings for our
breakdown of percentiles.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.710
But here's his
original question,

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.780
and this is just to explain
where these come from

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.470
and why this is particularly
relevant to what we're doing.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.460
So his question is
you're the small blind

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.520
and you have a choice
between either folding

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.030
or open pushing a hand, or open
pushing here means you push

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.540
and you show your hand
before he makes a call.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.210
And the question is how
many chips is this good for?

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.820
If you have one chip, or
I guess we have two chips,

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.320
you have since they're 1-2
blinds, if you have two chips

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.950
and one is already in the small
blind, your pot odds are 25%.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.800
So even if he knows--
he's going to call

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.940
if he's anything more
than a 50% favorite,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.350
so you have the odds to do that
with at least a pretty bad hand

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.690
and a lot of good hands.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.570
So x here is how
big can your stack

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.560
be before this starts
becoming unprofitable?

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.590
And the answer for Ace-Ace
offsuit is about 70,

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.502
and to explain how
we got to that,

00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:38.210
we're going to make
a couple assumptions.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.820
And you can see
the clear relation

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.790
between this methodology
and what we're doing.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.620
So 1-2 blinds-- here a
small blind with whatever.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.834
Here are bets x all in.

00:13:47.834 --> 00:13:49.500
And we're going to
say big blind's going

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.410
to call when EV's more than 50.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.082
Which he might do pot odds,
which we're just going

00:13:55.082 --> 00:13:56.290
to ignore now for simplicity.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.123
We're just going to say
big blind is calling

00:13:58.123 --> 00:14:00.230
when he's more than 50% to win.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.105
It's actually zero when
he has the pot odds, which

00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:05.547
is this equation, but we're
going to forget about that.

00:14:05.547 --> 00:14:07.130
Let's just say he's
going to only call

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.880
with literal better hands.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.060
So here he's going
to call with Ace-8

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.210
or pocket 2's because
we have Ace-8.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.460
He's going to call with a
pocket pair, which is always

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.960
going to be better,
and Ace-8, which

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.730
is going to be equal or better.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.290
So that's his calling
range 13% of the time.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.030
So we win 33% for
this range, which

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.020
is you just plug-in
to the PokerTracker

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.290
and it'll give you that
you're a 30% underdog, which

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.650
is what I did here.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:35.540
That's how you do it.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.580
And we get our EV
from the situation,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.160
and we have to solve for x.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.610
So we want EV to be 0 because
we're finding the marginal EV,

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.820
and this is what we get.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:53.130
We get x, which is
all the chips we

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.190
had before we paid
the big blind,

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.080
and we lose x minus 1, which
is all the chips we have

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.154
after paying the small blind.

00:15:02.154 --> 00:15:03.820
So a little bit of
nuance there and only

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.030
changes our number by one, but
that gives us our break even.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.829
And our break even
here is like 62x.

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:10.370
So the reason it's
a little bit lower

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.390
is it doesn't factor in the
big blind doing pot odds,

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.600
but that's the idea.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.162
So what we're going to do
is we're going to solve this

00:15:17.162 --> 00:15:18.370
and we're not going to do it.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.441
Someone else did it.

00:15:20.441 --> 00:15:22.440
We're going to solve this
for every single hand,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.960
and this is what Sklansky did.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.620
So he figured what your number
here is going to be two things.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.190
The number of hands you
are slightly better than,

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.201
and why is this
factor important?

00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:35.700
What's he going to do it if you
have a better hand than him?

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.020
He's going to fold.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.050
So this determines
our fold equity,

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.140
and then chance of
winning when you're behind

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.370
determines our equity when
he actually does call.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.110
He just has perfect
information which

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.600
is why it's a little
bit of a change

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:57.310
and we're able to solve
it out perfectly here.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.380
So Sklansky didn't
know how to program,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.410
which is why Scott Carlson, or
Victor Chubukov a couple days

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.440
later-- apparently
later the same day-

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.440
came up with the answer.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.310
Where he said Aces have
infinity value here

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.040
where you can have an
unlimited amount of chips

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.430
and then show Aces and push
them, and it's plus EV.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.430
We're not saying it's the
most optimal decision,

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.090
but you won't actually lose
chips on average even if you

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.050
have an unlimited chip stack.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.880
Whereas King, it only
works for 1,290 chips.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.800
So we can solve it for
every hand to get down to,

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.210
you could do this with 3-2
off with 1.8 chips and so on.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.620
So this is our primary
way to rank hands,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.740
and we're assuming that at
least in a heads-up situation,

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.899
this is a pretty good
idea of what hands

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:46.690
will have the most
value especially when it

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.000
comes to going all in.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.100
One other method is going to
be equity versus three randoms,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.000
and it might be more
relevant for multi-way pots.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.150
You just rank them
by their expectation

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.759
against three callers who
haven't looked at their hand.

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:03.050
But we're not going to do
that especially because we're

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.240
assuming generally we're going
to get one caller, especially

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.819
heads-up where you
can only get one.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.419
But we're going to
expand it out later.

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:12.960
So just an example
of what these are.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.560
Top 1% is Aces, top 5%
is 10s and Ace-Queens.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.109
30% is this.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.589
And sorry to break
it to you guys,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:22.990
but you're going to
have to memorize these.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.916
So 5% you just remember
their premium hands, just ten

00:17:25.916 --> 00:17:28.260
or Ace Queens, and I'm
giving you little mnemonics

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.690
to help you remember it.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.796
Like Ace-10 or better
is 10%, and then

00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:35.420
like some sort of pocket pairs--
it's not even that big of deal

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.690
if you go down to 2s here.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.000
20% is Ace-2 or pocket 2's.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.730
That's how you're
going to remember it.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.510
And then 30% is Broadway, so
Broadway is any two fAce cards.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.580
And an intuitive way to think
about it is based on this.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:56.260
Broadway is just this corner
here, which is about 1/3

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.750
of the graph when you
count in pocket pairs.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.565
So that's how you just remember
30%-- it's that corner.

00:18:01.565 --> 00:18:02.440
So it's not that bad.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.870
Just remember top
20% is Ace-2 and 2s.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.990
30% is Broadway, and then
10% is Ace-10-- not that bad.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.330
So 50% is just going to be
the diagonal on the graph.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.560
It's any two cards
adding up to 15.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.060
This is what I mean
by the diagonal.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.930
Like this is your 13-by-13
graph where these are offsuit

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.240
and these are suited, which
is why we double count them.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.300
And then this hand
adds up to 15.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.130
Ace-two and so does King-3
and so does Queen-4.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.160
So this is your 50th
percentile hand.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.946
So that's how you're
going to remember that.

00:18:37.946 --> 00:18:40.070
And then you don't really
need to remember anything

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.810
more than that.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.190
So 100% is going to
be any two cards.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.430
It's going to be the
entire graph here.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.170
So we're going to be
talking about-- yeah?

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.150
Percentage is the
percent of hands

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.150
that that range represents.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.270
So like this is the
top 10% of hands.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.200
So if he calls--
if we assume he's

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.440
going to call 10%
of the time, we

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.410
are saying that he will
call with these cards

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.710
and these cards only.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.120
And we're going to be
talking about ranges

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:16.490
from now on because it helps us
understand what cards he has,

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.980
to some extent, but
also lets us use it

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.430
as an idea to get-- to figure
out exactly how often he's

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.252
going to call.

00:19:23.252 --> 00:19:25.210
So we're just going to
be talking about ranges,

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.190
and this is what I
mean when I say ranges.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.930
And to the extent that you're
just doing this at the table,

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.962
you just have to memorize
these three numbers.

00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:34.420
Because this is
easy, this is easy,

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.475
and then just remember
that tens are our 5%.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.810
When we're talking
about ranges in general,

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.460
a plus EV range--
a decision that's

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.380
good for a range means that
on average, your decision is

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.230
profitable for every hand
for that range in general.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.690
But an optimal range is
profitable for literally

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:58.654
every hand.

00:19:58.654 --> 00:20:00.070
So you can do a
lot of things that

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.970
are profitable
for any two cards,

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.390
but 3-2 off might actually
not be profitable.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.740
So it's not necessarily optimal.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.320
You want to make sure that
every [INAUDIBLE] you can,

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.090
every single card in
that range is optimal

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.370
and is profitable, which
gives you the optimal range.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:20.100
It's the most plus EV range
for that type of decision.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.620
An example of this
is-- so say you're

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.780
playing against Ace-Queen
and you call with this range.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.240
Pocket 5's and Ace-10 or better.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.630
So you are ahead of
this [INAUDIBLE] Queen

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.856
because you're 53% to win
the hand with this range.

00:20:36.856 --> 00:20:38.230
However, we know
it's not optimal

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.570
because we're calling
with two losing hands--

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.000
Ace-10 and Ace-jack.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.370
So a more realistic,
more optimal

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:49.529
range is going to be pocket
2s and Ace-King or better.

00:20:49.529 --> 00:20:51.320
So that's going to be
the difference there.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.200
So I want to make sure we're
not solving for something that's

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.490
a slight favorite when actually
missing out on something

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.450
a little bit more optimal.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.830
Here we go, so this
is a better range.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.420
5-5 or Ace-Queen,
actually 2s or Ace-Queen

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.530
would be a little bit better,
and we win 60% of the time.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.720
And then if a range
is optimal, then

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.420
we know for every
hand in that range,

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.010
we have a plus EV decision.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.240
And that's why this
is the action we're

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.550
going to use to prove that
if we solve for a range,

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.520
then we know that if you
have any card in that range,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.982
our rule is still good for it.

00:21:28.982 --> 00:21:30.440
So that's why I'm
showing you that.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.273
Right, so that's it.

00:21:31.273 --> 00:21:33.430
So that's all we're
going to do in terms

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.170
of defining what ranges are
and how we got those numbers.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.810
And from now, we're going to
talk about making decisions

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.540
based on a range.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.750
So let's talk about preflops.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.527
Our assumption is hero
has M less than 10.

00:21:45.527 --> 00:21:47.110
We're in that period
of the tournament

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.110
where your M is not
going to be that high.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.570
The villain is calling
some percentage

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.260
of hands that are presumably
the top whatever of hands.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.800
We're guessing he's not
calling with a worse hand

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.930
then-- and folding better hands.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.124
He might be a little
bit-- his view of what

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:07.540
are good hands and
bad hands might

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.490
be a little bit off of
ours, but we're just

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.440
assuming everyone has the same.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.300
[? ICM ?] doesn't
matter, so we don't care

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.420
about payout in tournaments.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.990
We're just trying to maximize
our chip-- our chip EV,

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.462
and we only have two
decisions-- push or call.

00:22:22.462 --> 00:22:24.670
So the way that we're going
to come up with this rule

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.540
here for heads-up is--
so what we're doing

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.140
is we want to figure out
what our push/fold range is

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.400
for heads-up in every scenario.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.290
And the way that we're
going to do this is first,

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.970
we need an equation that tells
us range for range equities.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:46.640
So everyone can figure out Aces
versus whatever is like 80-20,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.960
and then 2 over cards with
a pocket pair is 50-50ish.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.540
But we want to know what's
a range versus a range.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.550
Like if we push 70%
of the time and he

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.290
calls 30% of the time,
what does that translate to

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.440
in terms of our equity?

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.617
And it ends up being
like 60/40, but we

00:23:03.617 --> 00:23:05.950
want to get an idea of what
that trend is because that's

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.640
going to materially change
our ability to come up

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.200
with an optimal solution here.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.030
So we want to build a table
of range versus range,

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.020
and then we come up
with a formula that

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.440
will let us put in
two ranges and come up

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.536
with an equity calculation
for both of those ranges.

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:25.910
Then we're going
to develop an EV

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.090
model for semi-bluffs,
which we already did,

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.470
so that should be quick.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.600
For each m, find Nash
equilibrium if one exists.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.490
So a lot of people-- if you
Google "Nash equilibrium"

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.200
for a preflop, you'll find
something, it's wrong,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.240
and later I'll show you why.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.760
And therefore,
unstable equilibriums--

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.380
it pretty much always is.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.400
Find a reasonable
range and figure out

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.170
what kind of assumptions
we need to make

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:54.980
to make our push/fold
decisions correct.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.610
So let's do this first thing.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.590
So if we just-- for
each-- say that we

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.330
use a hero's range of 50%.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.340
So in PokerTracker, we
put top 50% of hands.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.010
And then for each range
of hands for the villain,

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.530
we calculate the
equity for that.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:13.590
And we do that for whatever I
did, like 15 different ranges.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:18.740
So if we push 50% of the time
and he calls 50% of the time,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.560
what's our equity?

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.520
What's our chance of winning?

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.400
50, right.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.160
So we have an even
equity because we

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.160
are pushing and calling the
same types of hands on average.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.260
Whereas if he calls
100% of the time,

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.480
our equity's actually
closer to 60.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.020
We are the favorite-- we are
a 60/40 favorite on that hand.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.960
Whereas if he calls with just
Aces, then we are like 17%

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.820
to win the hand.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.810
That's the idea.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:46.240
So our goal here is to come
up with some sort of equation

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.255
that we can just plug-in
to-- we can do math on.

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:52.130
Like we want to be able
to do calculus on it,

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.250
so we need an equation.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.960
So what type of
function does this look

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.500
like because we want to
try to fit a curve to it.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.090
Exactly.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.720
It seems like a
logarithmic function

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.470
and within r squared
of 99, it says

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.670
that that's the logarithmic
equation for it.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.930
So that works when
the range is 50%,

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.540
but let's take a look at when
we change the range to 30%.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.280
So what this is saying is we
are pushing 30% of the time

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.900
and he is calling x
percent of the time.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.710
And what this line is our chance
of winning when he does that,

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.450
and this is also logarithmic.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.200
So we're seeing a
little bit of a pattern,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.150
and then it also has a
really good r squared.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.350
And then if we push
10% of the time,

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:37.200
it still like, OK,
it's 98 and change

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.900
when we look at our equities
versus his calling range.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.060
But then it starts to get bad.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.170
If he calls 5% of
the time, our r

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:48.110
squared when we fit a
log normal function,

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.140
or a logarithmic
function, is only 95.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.100
And if he only calls 3% of
the time, our r squared is 89.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.280
Like this is not
really lot logarithmic

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.420
when we start getting
in very tight ranges.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.930
And in 1%, it sucks.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.710
It's not even close.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.480
So what we're trying to
do is develop an equation

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.180
for figuring out
range versus ranges,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.450
and we see that logarithmic
works some of the time.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.140
So the reason it
doesn't work, just

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.320
to give you kind of an
idea why it doesn't work,

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.940
is because the top 1%
of hands is three hands.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.260
It's Aces, Ace-King, and Kings.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.190
So it's materially changing
based on whether he's-- if we

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:33.790
push Ace-King, whether he calls
with only Aces or Kings or also

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.780
Ace-King jumps us
between here and here.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.180
So we have huge
gaps when it comes

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.280
to very tight
percentages, so that's why

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.410
we break a little bit up here.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.540
And when we turn it around, we
have the same type of thing.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.780
This is looking at OK,
say that we know he's

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.460
going to call 50% of the time.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.430
If we push x
percent of the time,

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:55.890
what is our chance of winning?

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:01.200
So if we 100% of the time
and he calls 40% of the time,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.420
then we are 40% to win.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.539
So that's what this
chart is telling us,

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:09.080
and you see the same
type of pattern.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.260
Where 50% range versus
this kind of range is good.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.130
If we push whatever and
he calls 30% of the time,

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.300
it's still good.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.059
But then if he calls 2% of the
time, it starts becoming bad.

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:21.600
So what are we taking
away from this?

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.580
And the whole plan is we want
to come up with an equation that

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.950
just gives us these numbers.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.440
I only got these from pushing
them into PokerTracker

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.080
and were trying to fit a
certain equation onto it.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.840
So our takeaways here
is that like range

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.800
versus range relationship
is probably logarithmic.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.380
That seems to be
a good estimate,

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.490
but it's definitely
not good in the top 5%.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.250
So with regard to
our model, we're

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.480
just going to say
this is probably not

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.310
that good when you're
talking about ranges in 5%.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.300
But realistically,
when m is less than 10,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.400
no one is do anything
in the 5% range,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.620
so it's not that big of
a deal just to ignore it.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.090
So what we did is we
populated this table just now.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.435
So we took a look at what's
the villain's range up here

00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:07.310
and what's our range?

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.790
So when we push 100% of the time
and he calls 30% of the time,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.940
we win 39% of the time.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.450
Where red means that we are
not likely to win and green

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.150
means that we are likely to win.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.140
Like when we push 5% and
he calls with anything,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.870
we're 73% to win.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.860
So that's what this
table is telling us,

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.380
and we want to do is we want to
come up with an equation that

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.360
lets us populate this table
without actually having

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.700
to do the range versus
range calculations by hand.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.950
So what I did was I
just ran a regression

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.000
based on logarithmic variables,
and I found something

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.460
that I found to be
really, really cool.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.890
So these seem to
be the coefficients

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.930
with an r squared of 98.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.430
So this equation seems
to basically nail

00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:00.780
these range versus range
equities, which is, I think,

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.880
really cool.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.330
So our guess is probably a
reason that it starts at 50%,

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.670
and it seems to be symmetrical.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.490
Which is-- I don't
know if there's

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.110
a statistical reason
for that, but that's

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.660
extremely fascinating.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.150
And it could make
sense intuitively

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.060
that-- so this is your
chance of winning.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.680
So would it make sense
that the wider he calls--

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.760
when we take the natural log of
the percentage of him calling,

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.542
our percent win goes up.

00:29:30.542 --> 00:29:32.000
So I think it does
because it means

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.210
he's calling with a worse hand.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.764
That's why it goes up
when he calls greater,

00:29:36.764 --> 00:29:39.180
but then goes down when we
push greater because this means

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.920
that we're pushing worse hands.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.670
So that's the equation
there, and that's

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.550
giving us something that we
can actually differentiate when

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.990
we're trying to solve this.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:49.400
And just in terms of
errors, it's not that bad.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.260
We have an r squared of 98.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.920
So I think this is
good enough to use.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.220
We can actually use
this to try to optimize

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.420
our decision making preflop.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.710
So we solved-- we came
up with an equation

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.540
that we can use for determining
our chance of winning

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.281
a hand compared to our pushing
range and his calling range.

00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:08.280
So let's go back to our
EV model for semi-bluff.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.825
So we already did that in
the fold equity portion,

00:30:14.825 --> 00:30:16.200
but we're going
to build this out

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.450
to be relevant to our
situation in particular.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.070
So we're assuming we're
talking about in terms of M,

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.040
so what's our-- so our blinds
are going to be equal to 1.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.440
Like this means this is 1 M and
our EV is going to be in terms

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.150
of M's.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.690
We're going to-- if our
EV ends up being 0.35,

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.630
it means 0.35 times all
the blinds combined just

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:38.950
to get rid of blinds here.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.450
So all the blinds
combined equals

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.770
M. Our showdown
value is just going

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.570
to be-- so our fold
equity is going

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.820
to be the pot times the
chance of him folding, i.e.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.100
1 minus calling.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.280
The chance of him--
our showdown value

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.650
is chance of calling times win
amount times win percentage

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.770
minus lose amount
times lose percentage.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.700
The win amount is going
to be stacked plus 2/3

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.850
because if the blinds are
1-2 or something where

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.890
the big blind is
double the small blind,

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.710
it means that you
win his big blind

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.840
and then you lose
your whole stack.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.900
Depending on when
we mark our stack,

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.120
it changes it a
little bit with regard

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.880
to whether we count it as before
we pay the blind or after.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.750
But it ends up not
making a huge difference.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:27.190
It just impacts whether
this is plus 2/3 or plus

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.060
1/3 or just your stack.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.880
But anyway, we also
have this equation,

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.700
which we just solve for.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.210
Where the chance
of us winning is

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:38.530
related to the
chance to him calling

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.970
and the range that
we're pushing.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.130
So what you might
see here is all

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.970
of these are related to the
same three variables, where it's

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.810
either the call
percentage, the push

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.545
percentage, or a stack size.

00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:54.170
So we combine this to one giant
equation, which obviously we're

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.510
not going to remember but we
can use to start solving this

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.530
mathematically.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.280
So this is what we
would end up with.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.560
So when M is 1, we end up
with this sort of graph.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.450
When the hero's push
range goes up to 100%

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:14.530
here and the villain's call
range goes up to 100% here.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.214
This is our equity,
which I just color-coded

00:32:17.214 --> 00:32:18.880
so we don't need to
look at the numbers.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.950
Where green means it's in
the hero's favor and yellow

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.960
means it's close to
zero and red means

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.270
it's in the villain's favor.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:30.720
So what we see here is
it's really green over here

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.220
and really yellow over there.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.010
And this is telling
us this is already

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.410
factoring in fold equity and our
chance of winning if he calls.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.750
This is saying that if
we call 100% of the time,

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.500
he should call 100%
of the time because he

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.340
wants the yellowest area and
we want the greenest area.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.220
So that's with 1 M, so it
shouldn't be surprising

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.900
that our equilibrium
at 1 M is going

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.580
to be everyone like getting
all in 100% of the time.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.720
We see when we switch to 10
M, it's pretty different.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.290
In fact, this 100 is one
of the yellowest areas,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:09.305
whereas our green area is
either up here or down here.

00:33:09.305 --> 00:33:10.680
So we're going to
use this to get

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.200
an idea of how our
value changes based

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.930
on these variables
changing to figure out

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:21.030
if we can isolate it to a corner
and make that our kind of rule.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.010
So first, let's find out when
we can get a Nash equilibrium.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:27.730
So the villain
gets to pick this.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.980
The villain gets to
pick his call range

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.390
and we get to pick
our push range.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:37.440
That's the flexibility
each person has.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.490
So if we push 100% of the time
and he calls 100% of the time,

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.760
this is a Nash
equilibrium for 1 M

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.430
because he can't do
any better by going up

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.400
here because a higher
number is worse for him

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.040
because this is our
equity in the hand.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.370
And the equity comes
directly from him

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.990
because it's a heads-up
situation whereas we can't

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.590
do better by pushing left.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.440
Like when we go down
here, the next number

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.580
is 0.32, meaning that
if we push any less,

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.360
we're actually losing
value because we

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.700
want the number to be higher.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.620
And when it comes to 2 M,
100% isn't that much off.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.320
We're talking about 0.01
M of a difference in EV,

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.275
but we do actually reach a
Nash equilibrium here-- 2 M--

00:34:15.275 --> 00:34:17.790
where we can't do anything
any better by moving

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.830
and he can't do any
better by moving.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.130
So when M is 3, we
have an unstable Nash,

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.260
and this is when stuff
is getting interesting.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.469
If we push 80, he
should call 100.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.860
If he calls 100, we
should push 65, and so on.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.310
So we end up in a
bit of a circle.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:35.280
It's a rock, paper,
scissors situation.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.340
What do we have?

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.431
M equals 3.

00:34:37.431 --> 00:34:39.639
So this lets us know that
this whole Nash equilibrium

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.170
thing is not going to work out.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.080
Like it only really
works for M of 2,

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.675
and that's not the most
important situation

00:34:46.675 --> 00:34:48.050
to figure out
because you're know

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.750
that you should be pushing
a very, very wide range when

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.340
M is 2.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.370
So we need to figure out
some sort of pattern.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:00.340
How do these colors move
when your M is more than 2?

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.999
So let's make-- let's
go to M equals 5

00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:04.790
and make the gradient
a little bit steeper.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.610
So these are the same numbers
except I just made it--

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.290
we're talking about very
slight changes in EV, where

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:16.350
the difference between yellow
here and green here is 0.1 M,

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.330
and this will help us
understand where this value is

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.610
going to come from.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:22.870
So let's see how this
changes over time,

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.110
because our goal here
is-- the villain's goal

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.550
is to cause this to
be in a yellow area,

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.950
and the hero's goal is to cause
this to be in a green area.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.880
And you can see
why we inherently

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.670
have this need to figure out
what they're going to do.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.890
Because say that
we're the villain.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.730
If we know the hero
pushes 100, we call 100.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:48.280
Whereas if we think the hero
pushes 30%, we should call 5%.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.650
So let's see how this
changes over time.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.840
So this is when M
is 2, and then this

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.290
is us increasing as M
is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:58.680
We're trying to
pick the box that

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.090
is kind of the yellowest area.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:03.490
Where can we
realistically come up

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:06.740
with a rule for ending up there?

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.210
Based on what this
x-coordinate is, what

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.100
should be our y-coordinate?

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.200
What should be our call?

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.450
Do we see any way to
figure this thing out?

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.460
So what I think we should do
is just draw a line right here

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.380
and say let's just figure out
what the equation of that line

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.280
is, and then come up
with an estimate of what

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:32.330
his pushing range is, and then
throw it into whatever function

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.560
we used to get that line.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.750
Which can't be very complicated
in order to make sure,

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.630
no matter what his pushing
range is that we read him for,

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.860
we end up in this yellow area.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.540
So what I did was for each M, I
highlighted what the lowest EV

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.670
decision is for the hero,
meaning the best decision

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:49.880
for the villain.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.120
And for 10 M, it's
this diagonal.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.320
But for 1 M, it's all
the way down here.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.910
Like best you can
do is over here.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:02.670
So are our function is we call
10 times his pushing range.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.380
So if we have 1 M and he
pushes 5% of the time,

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.560
we call about 50% of the time.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.160
If he pushes 20% of the
time, we're calling always,

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.870
and anything more than
20%, we're always calling.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.230
That's where M equals 1.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.720
In general, the rule is going
to be if M is 1, always call,

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.520
and if M is 2, you call
twice his pushing range.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.880
So if we think he's pushing 50%
or more, we're always calling.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.550
If we think he's pushing
20%, we call 40% of the time.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.740
Like that's the
optimal calling range

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.800
in this heads-up situation.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.930
So when M is 4-- so I
skipped one, but when M is 4

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.040
we have basically this
straight diagonal.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.250
We try to match
his pushing range.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.180
So when he pushes
60, we call 60.

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.470
When he pushes 100, we call 100.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:50.770
That's the best we can do
to dominate his range there.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.710
When M is 6, we
call 2/3 his range.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.307
And when M is 9, we
call half is range.

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:57.890
So those are the
rules that we're just

00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:58.973
going to have to remember.

00:37:58.973 --> 00:38:00.920
When you're in a
heads-up situation,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.960
if the stack is basically 1 or
2, you're always calling him.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.530
At 4, you're calling
him an even amount.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:11.880
At 6 and 9, you're calling him
like half of what he pushes.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.830
And that's the optimal move.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.670
That is how you will-- if you're
in a heads-up situation, which

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.100
you will be at the end of
every tournament to the extent

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.380
that you get there, you will
dominate his playing style

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.540
based on what you read
as his pushing amount.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.930
And you can just
count how many hands

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.840
did he push versus
how many hands

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.490
does he fold to get an idea
of what his range is here.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.150
And this also works
when it's folded

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.810
to you in the small blind.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.969
Like even if you're
10 handed, by the time

00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:44.010
you get to the small blind,
you're heads up again

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.100
and these rules apply.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.040
So to the extent
you can memorize

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.420
this thing will give you the
right move in that scenario

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.110
for Ms up to 10.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:59.040
So when you're the hero-- when
you're the small but, rather,

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.780
and you're pushing, it
requires you to estimate

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.180
what his calling range is.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:09.430
Because you end up all
over the plAce based

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.120
on making different estimates
of what you can call with,

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.530
and you really don't
have any information.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.210
But I'm going to
graph it out here

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.780
and then we can see what's
going to be a good estimate

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.460
in basically any scenario.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.260
So there are a couple different
ways I can think about this.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.690
So we're going to come up
with a bunch of numbers

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:30.050
based on the villains'
call range here.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:33.830
And we can either-- so
we're targeting a column

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.860
and then like the
row is going to be

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.550
information we don't have.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:41.870
So the question is do
we pick the column that

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:46.520
has the highest average
EV, the highest minimum EV,

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.880
or the highest EV versus
like a particular bad player

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.390
that we're going
to be targeting?

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:57.080
And the blue here is what
column maximizes your EV

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.510
for that scenario?

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.220
And your guess is
as good as mine

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.090
when it comes to what's the
best way to strategize it.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:09.400
Are we looking for-- maximizing
the min will help us make sure

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.410
that we're not dominated
by someone who's really

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.860
got our number, whereas
maximizing the average

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.960
might be better when
we're trying to figure out

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.650
against a player we know nothing
about what would be better.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.400
And maximizing versus
tight-- or loose--

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.740
will help us figure out some
sort of-- how to capitalize

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.340
on the reads that we're making.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.760
So when M is 1, he's over there.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.780
No matter what the
scenario, you should

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.469
be pushing 100% of the time.

00:40:34.469 --> 00:40:35.760
That's what this is telling us.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.790
It shouldn't be a surprise based
on all the stuff I told you

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.482
about 1 M situations.

00:40:40.482 --> 00:40:42.440
No matter what kind of
assumption we're making,

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.990
push 100%.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.700
So let me pick up to M is 10.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.630
So what's going on here?

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:53.430
So as M increases, they all
kind of move at the same time,

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:54.970
except what?

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:58.240
If we're talking loose or
we're targeting best/worst case

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.890
scenario or best
average, it starts

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.670
to trickle down to like 50%.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.780
But it's certainly-- they're
relatively near each other,

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.620
and what's good about
this is that means

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.490
that if we target any of these,
we're basically in the ballpark

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:16.030
where the difference between
this column and this column

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.450
for any of M is going
to be not that material.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.990
If you were just
in that ballpark,

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:25.810
you're fine, but which one of
them is completely different.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.350
Yeah, against a tight player.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.030
And it should make
sense intuitively

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.410
why if you read him as tight,
as someone who only calls

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.220
15% of the time,
even with 9 and 10 M,

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.040
you should push
100% of the time.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.470
Why?

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.840
It's because 85% of the time,
he's just going to fold,

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.240
and even when you're
called, the amount

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.730
of value you get from him
folding most of the time

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.230
just crushes him.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:54.360
So you should-- to the
extent that you can encourage

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.280
him to be tight, do it.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.710
But absolutely, if he's
tight, push every single hand.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:03.190
You're never in the scenario
where pushing less than top 50%

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.950
is good.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:07.310
So that's it for heads up.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.410
So now let's talk
about other positions,

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:15.300
and we end up in a lot of
complicated situations, which

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.899
we have to just
assume away here.

00:42:17.899 --> 00:42:19.440
So we can lose in
two different ways.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.490
We can lose if we
call and he beats us,

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.260
or we could also lose if we
call and then someone behind us

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:24.770
calls.

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:26.520
So we're estimating
that someone behind us

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.351
is only going to call if he has
a premium hand because if we're

00:42:29.351 --> 00:42:31.225
in a short stack situation
and someone pushes

00:42:31.225 --> 00:42:33.930
and then we call, someone is
only calling behind us when

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:35.162
they have a really good hand.

00:42:35.162 --> 00:42:36.870
And let's just assume
we're going to lose

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:37.960
if we get another caller.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.376
Like we are almost certainly
going to be dominated-- let's

00:42:40.376 --> 00:42:41.710
say we have 0 EV there.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.020
And because of our
equation here, we

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.370
can actually solve that.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.790
We can actually figure
out what range is going

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.780
to be 60% versus another range.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.750
So this is resulting in a really
cool rule of thumb here, which

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.924
is when you're in a
10 M or less situation

00:42:54.924 --> 00:42:57.340
and you're trying to decide
whether to call an all-in, you

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.930
just ask yourself,
are you calling such

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.660
that his range is three
times more than your range?

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.760
And some questions you
might ask yourself is

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.490
say that you have Ace-10, like
you have a 10% range here.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.790
Would he push all in into you
with King-Jack-- something

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.520
in a 30%?

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.820
If you have King-Queen,
which is like 30%,

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:22.800
would he push all in with 8-5,
which is 50% range, and so on.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.825
So when you're in a
[? full ring ?] situation

00:43:24.825 --> 00:43:26.990
and you're trying to
decide whether to call,

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.010
figure out in general
what do you think

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.540
his pushing range is there.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.920
And it's a good call
if your calling range

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.787
is 1/3 of his pushing range.

00:43:35.787 --> 00:43:36.620
Let's call it a day.

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.340
Thanks, guys.

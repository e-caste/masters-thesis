00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.250 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: All right,
so let's get started.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.355 align:middle line:84%
Are there any questions
from last time?

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So as you are no
doubt well aware,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:84%
this is the last lecture
I'm going to give.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:84%
The exam is a week from
yesterday, on Monday.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do today
is to review the material

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:90%
and see if there are questions.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So today, we're covering the
material from lectures 16

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:90%
on, 16 through 21.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And normally, the exam
would cover 16 through 21

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and I could have
written that in there.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I am just trying to
avoid confusion though

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:84%
because the course is
cumulative and one thing

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:90%
builds on another.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it will
focus on 16 onwards,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:84%
but you should be,
by now, very familiar

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:90%
with the early material.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:90%
And some of it may come up.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is just to prevent
me from misleading you.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
If I said it was only on the
last one third of the class,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
then you may get
lulled into thinking

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that it's quite narrowly
about only those things,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the things
on which it is building.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, just one word
of clarification.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's only
the third midterm.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't count anything
special in terms of your grade.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we
talked about money.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Bitcoin, in particular.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And I singled out two
questions, one of which

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I kind of mentioned
in class, but let's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:90%
get you guys engaged in this.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
A central banker, namely,
Dudley at New York Fed

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
is heard to say that
unlike Fiat money,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin's positive
value in markets

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:84%
is just a bubble and
with wild fluctuations.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So Bitcoin should be regulated,
if not banned altogether.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it says discuss this
statement using the tools

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:90%
you have learned in the class.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.725 align:middle line:84%
So could I get some volunteers
to answer that question?

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:37.662 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.662 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: To be honest,
I'm pretty unsure,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
but I do remember we
talked about how you can

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:90%
have equilibrium with bubbles.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So they're not
inherently something

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:90%
that you have to regulate.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to still have an
equilibrium, despite Bitcoin

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:90%
being overvalued.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Right.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The question actually
asks about Fiat money,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:90%
I kind of slipped that in there.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:84%
That unlike Fiat money,
Bitcoin is just a bubble.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Can you maybe
respond to that part?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Maria, or anyone
else for that matter.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: I mean, I guess
that is somewhat true,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:84%
as in it's not tied to a
tangible asset underlying it.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what exactly
you're looking for here though.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Fiat money is a bubble.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a bubble the way that
Bitcoin is potentially

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:90%
a bubble.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Fiat money used to
be backed by gold.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So there, if you didn't
want to hold the notes,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:84%
you could go to
the Federal Reserve

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and demand a real commodity, so
then it would not potentially

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:84%
be a bubble because it was just
a certificate for a commodity

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:90%
that would have real value.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But when Nixon broke
the link to gold,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
then Fiat money is
just pieces of paper

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:90%
and nevertheless, it has value.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So the point of the lecture was
that Fiat money is a bubble.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Now we use the word "bubble" is
almost deliberately provocative

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.135 align:middle line:90%
because it sounds bad.

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But Dudley, who made the
statement seem to have not

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
let's say, forgotten-- seems
to have forgotten that his

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:90%
domain--

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Fiat money-- is potentially
fragile, as well.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, the difference
is the Federal Reserve

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:90%
behaves itself, by and large--

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:84%
or not to jump in with some
parenthetical comments on that,

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%
but let's argue that
that's the case.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So then with forward
guidance and so on,

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
no one is expecting
high inflation,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.185 align:middle line:84%
which would lead to
speculations about how much

00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Fiat money is really
worth, and so on.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So whereas with Bitcoin, we
don't have a long history.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
We haven't set
expectations, and so on.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So there are differences
between the two.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
But in a model, it's pretty
hard to make a distinction

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
because they're both,
essentially, worthless

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:90%
even though they have value.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
was looking for.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
The second question, should
currency pay interest?

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Or more specifically,
what did we

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:90%
learn in the lecture about that?

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is it related to the
non-zero price of a currency

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
because I remember
we say that cash

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
has positive value because
it can be used to pay taxes.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's a cash advance.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So if the price is
equal to 0, then nobody

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:90%
will demand the currency, right?

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, you're
speaking to the levels.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So the point of having cash
in advance or taxes and so on

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
is that money would
always have value

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
because there's something
you need to do with it,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
either buy stuff
or pay taxes in it.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:84%
This question interest
implies something

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
about how the price of
money is changing over time,

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:90%
or that currency--

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:90%
how can I put this--

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:84%
the mechanical way
to bear interest,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
even though you can't take
it necessarily to a bank

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and exchange it
for more money is

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to have the thing that
money exchanges against be

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:90%
lowering in price.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a deflation
where the nominal price level

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
is going down means
that you can buy

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
more goods with money tomorrow
than you can buy with it today.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's effectively
like paying interest.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The way to remember
that is inflation

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
is bad, obviously, because
the purchasing power of money

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:90%
is going down.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
It takes more and more
money to buy goods.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:84%
With deflation, the purchasing
power of money is going up.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's effectively
a way to pay interest.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And what did we
learn in class about

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it's
optimal to engineer that?

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.290 align:middle line:90%
Any volunteers?

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sorry.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I know it's the end of the term
and you're all very, very busy.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So the answer was, in
that model of money

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
was spatially
separated agents, there

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:84%
was a monetary equilibrium
with a constant price level,

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.740 align:middle line:90%
but it was not Pareto Optimal.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:84%
And to get to one of the
Pareto Optimal allocations,

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:40.179 align:middle line:84%
it was necessary to engineer
this kind of deflation.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of
paying interest on money

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
is actually something the
Federal Reserve should

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:90%
be doing.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.655 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's coming
back to you now.

00:08:56.655 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, those were the
two main ingredients

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
of this very last
lecture on bubbles.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So I probably won't, if
history is any guide,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I won't have time to open up
lecture, this last lecture 21

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and review it, but those were
the two principal components.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:25.265 align:middle line:84%
Namely, money as a bubble
and this policy aspect.

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So again, the study guide should
help you prepare for the exam.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And now we're ready to
review the lectures.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:90%
There's only six of them.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So this material is probably
pretty fresh in your minds.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I think what I'll do rather than
obviously I wouldn't have time

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:84%
anyway to go over all
the individual slides

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:84%
of each lecture, I
will try to remind you

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
what we did and maybe
draw some connections

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to the other lectures and how
things are kind of fitting

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So this was the lecture on the
fundamental welfare theorems,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
namely, that
competitive equilibria

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
under certain assumptions
are Paretp Optimal.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And any optimum can be
supported with transfers.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So this lecture was about
sufficient assumptions

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and the corresponding proofs.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And it ended with extensions to
more general commodity spaces.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So you may remember
that I did this.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I showed this-- back to
the earlier lectures,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:84%
the first part of the
course on risk sharing,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I showed the income
movements of households

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
over time and
compared to each other

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and including the consumption,
we noted this gradient here

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that the average
level of consumption

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
is increasing as one moves
from landless households

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:90%
to larger landowners.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:84%
In the risk sharing
framework, that

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
was related to lambda,
the Pareto weight.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And very clearly, for
certain functional forms,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:90%
it was exactly that.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Pareto weight of one household
relative to the others.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But the motivation here was to
introduce the welfare theorems.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So then the issue was
whether the lambdas that

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
are implicit in that
diagram are related

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
to wealth, like landholdings
and the number of plow animals,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So I was anticipating a
connection between lambdas

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
as in the Pareto problem of
Pareto Optimal allocations

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:84%
versus the wealth
that may be needed

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:90%
in a competitive equilibrium.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that again, or be
reminded of it momentarily.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So the first welfare theorem
is that any price equilibrium--

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
competitive equilibrium,
including a price equilibrium

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
with transfers is Pareto
Optimal under minimal sufficient

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
assumptions, namely
rational preferences--

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
which we haven't reviewed for
a while but it was in lecture

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:90%
two--

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:84%
complete transitive and
continuous preferences

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:90%
and local non-satiation.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
With those two assumptions,
we get this sufficient

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:90%
for this theorem.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So this was a picture in
our familiar Edgeworth

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:84%
box of a competitive equilibrium
being Pareto Optimal.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And the proof, you
may remember, relied

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:84%
on starting with a given
allocation, the star allocation

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and then conjuring up, by
contradiction, that there might

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:90%
be something Pareto improving.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:84%
We prove this little Lemma, that
anything which is weekly better

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:90%
has to cost us at least as much.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we just went
through the math,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
summing up over
all the households.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if it's strictly
better for some households

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
i prime, then it must
have costed more,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise, they
would have chose it.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So we get, in equation
one, the statement

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
about total expenditures, the
value of total expenditures

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:90%
summing up.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
All the households--
I'm going quickly now--

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:90%
we used profit maximization.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We coupled equations one
and two to get a statement

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:90%
about resource constraints.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom
line, concluded

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
that this alternative Pareto
dominating allocation would not

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
be feasible in contradiction
to what we assumed.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:90%
So that was QED.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
That was the end of the proof
of the first welfare theorem.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Now later, even today,
we'll review it.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
This thing fails with if
these sums are infinite sums

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and don't have finite value.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Then the second welfare
theorem was illustrated here

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have Pareto Optimum
characterized by tangency

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:90%
of indifference curves.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But that nevertheless,
it's not reachable

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:84%
if we start from the
endowment and start

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
drawing potential budget lines
through the endowment point,

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
as you would for
candidate budget lines

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:90%
in a competitive equilibrium.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So this was meant to
illustrate that to get

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
to this particular
Pareto Optimum that's

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
in the second welfare
theorem, we're

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:19.010 align:middle line:84%
going to have to take some value
away from agent A over here

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and give it to Agent B.
And that's what this said.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:84%
The tax on A is equal to the
subsidy on B. T being transfer,

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:90%
so negative is a tax.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So then we could get, as in
the second welfare theorem,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
to any allocation along
that contract curve where

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
the indifference curves are
tangent by reallocating wealth.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Now to prove it, we went through
this constructive argument.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:90%
We defined an economy.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And this slide, or
a version of it,

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:84%
shows up at least three
times in these six lectures.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So an economy consisting
of preferences

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:84%
endowments production sets
and profit shares here,

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:90%
assuming a lot more.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Concavity and convexity in
preferences, production sets,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we get the
second welfare theorem,

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:84%
that any Pareto Optimum
can be supported.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
For some wealth, any of optimum
associated with some lambda

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
vector of maximized
weighted utilities

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:84%
can be supported by a suitable
redistribution of wealth.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
The way we prove this
was to go back to what

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:90%
you know about Lagrangians.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So this was, I think,
also in the second lecture

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:90%
of the class.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And you've used it
over and over again.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Maximizing concave
functions on convex

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:84%
sets, generating all
the shadow prices.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:90%
So we used it here three times.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:84%
First we use it for
the Pareto problem.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting with a
Pareto Optimal allocation.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So we know, again, from things
you did earlier in the class,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
when we introduced the
notion of Pareto optimality--

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
the lecture number--

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
we maximize weighted
sums of utilities,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
lambda's being these weights,
subject to resource constraints

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
and production constraints.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:90%
That's all written down here.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The solution to any one
of these Pareto problems

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:84%
is Pareto Optimal,
and all the Optima

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
can be described as
solutions for some Lambdas.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So we start thinking about
these so-called Pareto

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
problems as equivalent with
Pareto Optimal allocations.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Use the Lagrangian,
set it up this way

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and get the first order
conditions, including

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:84%
the primal, duel
feasibility on the shadow

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
prices, complementary,
slackness and all of that.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
The point is that with all
that concavity and convexity as

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
appropriate, these first order
conditions from differentiating

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
the Lagrangian are not only
necessary, they're sufficient.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So any solution to these first
order conditions, allocations

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and shadow prices that satisfy
the first order conditions will

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:84%
be Pareto Optimal, will be a
solution to the Pareto problem.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:90%
So we did that.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Then we went to the second
part, reminded ourselves

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:84%
of the definition of a
competitive equilibrium

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Namely, consumer optimization,
firm maximization of profits,

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and so on, along with a feasible
distribution of wealth, as I

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:90%
was just saying.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So here's the second
and third time.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use the
Lagrangian for the consumer

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:84%
optimization problem and
use it for the firm profit

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:90%
maximization.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Here is the consumer
maximization problem.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Maximizing utility
subject to a budget,

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
we get this first
order condition.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, with a
concavity in the constraint

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
setting in the objective
function and convexity

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.120 align:middle line:84%
in the constraint set, these
are not only necessary,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
but they're sufficient
condition for an optimum.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is find
the mu i at given prices, p,

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.175 align:middle line:84%
and in Xi*, and it will be
maximizing for the consumer.

00:17:58.175 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, for the
firm maximization,

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
we have necessary and
sufficient conditions

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
to find candidates for the
decentralized competitive

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And then all we did
was match them up.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Now I think the
tricky thing here

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:84%
is to remember what
the given is and what

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:90%
the objective function.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
The given was a Pareto
Optimal allocation.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So for the consumer,
we started out

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
with these conditions, which
are the necessary and sufficient

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
conditions from the Pareto
problem being satisfied.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So we have the gamma sub L
for commodity L as a given.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.120 align:middle line:84%
The lambdas were
given because we

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
had a given certain
candidate, Pareto Optimum.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:90%
These were all satisfied.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:90%
We're looking for this thing.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to see if consumers
are going to be maximizing.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So the candidate
for the price would

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:90%
be the Lagrange multiplier.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And the candidate for
the marginal utility

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:84%
of income, the shadow price
and the budget constraint

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:90%
would be one over lambda.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So here, I go back to
the slides of the Rocky

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Mountain and Kansas.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
This establishes a direct
relationship between the Pareto

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
weights and the Pareto problem
and the marginal utility

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:90%
of wealth.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And hence, the level of wealth.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
It's quite general.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:90%
It's super robust.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And so then the rest of this
was just the tedious part

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.770 align:middle line:84%
of constructing the wealth, has
the evaluation of expenditure

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that
they all add up.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We refer to this way
of finding the prices

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
from the second welfare theorem
as marginal utility pricing.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, more accurately, it's
the lambda weighted margin

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.590 align:middle line:84%
utilities which are equated
all over the households, not

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:90%
the levels.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you take ratios across
different goods, L and K,

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:90%
the marginal rates of--

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:90%
the lambdas cancel out.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So the marginal
rates of substitution

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:84%
are equated over
all the households,

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
as they are in this
picture, along this orange,

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:90%
green, orange, green?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:90%
A yellow, orange line.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And this made the
wealth's add up.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And we did a second proof of
the welfare theorem, which

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:84%
is namely one nuanced thing,
which is instead of just

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
maximizing utility
subject to budget,

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
we minimize expenditures
subject to achieving

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:90%
a certain level of utility.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:90%
That conjured up this.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is the target
and different curve,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:84%
as it were, as if it were
coming from one consumer--

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:90%
interesting comment.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's just the
aggregated better

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:84%
than set associated with the
Pareto Optimal allocation.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The other part of this diagram
is two production functions,

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
different from each
other, but aggregated up

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to an aggregated
production function.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see, as if
it were a Robinson Crusoe

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
representative consumer,
the optimum is characterized

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
by a maximal utility
level subject

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:90%
to the single production set.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And then my point is that we
get this separating hyper-plane.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So all these definitions
supporting hyperplane,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.800 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, that's really
where given all the convexity,

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:90%
that's all you need to do.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:84%
These convex sets are
separated from each other.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is a quite
general proof and it

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:84%
works in many spaces, not just
finite dimensional Euclidean

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:90%
spaces.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're about to review
the representative consumer,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
as I said, this
looks all the world

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
like a representative consumer
because I've seemingly added up

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:90%
the indifference curves.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But one should be aware
that it is not the Gorman

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:90%
consumer that's going on here.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
Pareto Optimum

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
is sensitive to the
distribution of wealth.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:90%
You just can't see that.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I did not go through that when
I gave this lecture because we

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:84%
hadn't gotten to Gorman and it
wouldn't have made any sense.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
But I might as well say it
now, if you don't have a Gorman

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
representative consumer, then as
you increase this guy's budget

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
line and decreases
this one, you may

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.482 align:middle line:84%
change the shape of this
seemingly aggregated

00:22:24.482 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
up in indifference curve
and, therefore, change

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:90%
the whole optimal allocation.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully that
helps you think

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
about the hidden way
in which heterogeneity

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:90%
is entering into this picture.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And this lecture, I finished
it off in an abstract way

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:84%
by saying the proofs
of the welfare theorems

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:84%
are quite general,
that does not require

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.720 align:middle line:84%
a finite dimensional
commodity spaces.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I gave you the sufficient
assumptions for the two welfare

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:90%
theorems and kind of quit there.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
If we'd had more time, I could
have gone into greater detail.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I only asserted
without proving it

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that if we took
what we did earlier

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
in the course
about Pareto Optima

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:84%
with obstacles to
trade with incentive

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:84%
constraints and potentially
non-convex consumption

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
sets because of
discrete choices,

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:84%
we could nevertheless
introduce lotteries.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And that would have
turned the space

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.110 align:middle line:84%
into a convex set and the
theorems, as in Debreu,

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:90%
would apply to that.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So although this lecture just
proves the welfare theorems

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
carefully for finite
dimensional commodity spaces

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and only asserted that
the theorems extend,

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:84%
it would cover
competitive equilibria

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.480 align:middle line:84%
in contract space
where households

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.940 align:middle line:84%
can buy whatever
contracts they want,

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:90%
granted at certain prices.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And firms as intermediaries
will create contracts

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:90%
that maximize profits.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Tying some of the
loose ends together,

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
but without actually going
through much of the details

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:90%
So that was lecture 16.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:09.637 align:middle line:90%
Questions about 16?

00:24:09.637 --> 00:24:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So we'll come back to
it again because we're

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
the failures,

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:90%
or review them quickly.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Then this was the
existence lecture.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
The point being
that, for example,

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
the first welfare
theorem assumes existence

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:84%
of an equilibrium and
then assures everybody

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that it would be optimal
under sufficient conditions.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But if the model could
be vacuous if there

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.730 align:middle line:90%
is no competitive equilibrium.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing
with things like that

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:90%
directly in this lecture.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And this was a listing
of the things covered.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So the main mathematical
object tool really

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:84%
was fixed point theorem,
this was an example

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that some function has
across the 45 degree

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:84%
line, in which case whatever
you put in, you get back out.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
The argument in the
range is the argument

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
in the domain under
the function, F.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was sufficient
for this to have

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.490 align:middle line:84%
the set of bases of values
in the domain and the range

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.390 align:middle line:84%
being non-empty convex and
compact and for the function F

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:90%
to be continuous.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's Brouwer's
Fixed Point Theorem.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I should say though, well, we're
about to get there, that this

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.650 align:middle line:90%
is all about existence.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not about how to find it.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And at least one of you has
asked me questions about that.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this is Brouwer's
Fixed Point Theorem.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It's paired with Kakutani's
Fixed Point Theorem.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And the way in
which they differed,

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.360 align:middle line:84%
primarily, was not the
set A, which is still

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
compact and convex and
non-empty, but the function

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:84%
F, which is no longer single,
necessarily single value.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:90%
It could be multiple values.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Or there are multiple
values in the range

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:84%
for any particular
input x in the domain.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, not
anything goes and had

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:84%
to be convex value and
continuous in a certain sense.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And then with Kakutani,
again, we have a fixed point.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So these are very
powerful tools and they're

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
used for competitive equilibria
in one way or another

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and used in games.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And we actually combined those
at the end of this lecture

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to have a game that would
be achieved under a Nash

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:25.440 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium as a
Walrasian equilibrium.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So here are what
happens if you don't

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:84%
assume continuity of the
function, you get these jumps.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So if the aggregate
demand for an economy

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.430 align:middle line:84%
somehow had jumps
like this, then you

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
could not be assured
that there would exist

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:90%
a competitive equilibrium.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking for the
existence of prices, such

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:84%
that you put prices in to each
of the agents maximization

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.940 align:middle line:84%
problems, look at
their demands, see

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.930 align:middle line:90%
if demands add up to supply.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we find the price
that makes that happen

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and all of this can be
formulated as a fixed point.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Now I did not go
through the math of this

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's
surprisingly tedious.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
However, let me say that
the existence proof is

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
the existence of a competitive
equilibrium as in at least one

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:90%
fixed point.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Herbert Scarfe did a lot
of work on this subject.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And in his proof of the
Walrasian equilibrium,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
he actually did more, which
was to go back to Brouwer

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and actually show how
to find the fixed point.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.150 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, in an
algorithm, take a guess,

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
look at directional derivatives,
formulate a new guess

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and iterate until you get to the
end or approximately the end,

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.540 align:middle line:84%
however close the
computer can make it.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And he would have constructively
found the Brouwer's fix point,

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:84%
which works much more generally
than just finding the existence

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.550 align:middle line:90%
of a competitive equilibrium.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.060 align:middle line:84%
This comes up later when we
talked about restrictions

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.550 align:middle line:84%
on data having to
do with algorithms

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and what the algorithms
actually look

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
like when computing solutions
to individual problems

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and defining a
competitive equilibrium.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I just wanted
to draw your attention

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
to the distinction
as an overview--

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:90%
that's my job today--

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.330 align:middle line:84%
between existence of a
competitive equilibrium

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and how to find the competitive
equilibrium, algorithmically.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
What we did do in
this lecture was

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:84%
to prove the existence of a
competitive equilibrium using

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:84%
the second welfare
theorem, which we just

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:90%
reviewed in lecture 16.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is instead of
iterating on candidate prices

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to find where supply
is equal to demand,

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.490 align:middle line:84%
we iterate on these
lambda weights.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is
very much, here's

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that economy again, I promised
you it would keep coming back.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:84%
The statement of the
economy with the convexity

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:90%
and concavity.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to go back
to the Pareto problems,

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:84%
this is now the
second time today

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
that the Pareto
problem has come up.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.500 align:middle line:84%
We just used it in 16 for
the second welfare theorem.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Here it is again,
stated rather succinctly

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to remind us of these lambda i
weights, such that when we max,

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:90%
we get Pareto Optimal.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So we start with
those lambdas and then

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:84%
we essentially look
at the solution

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.390 align:middle line:84%
to the Pareto
problem, these x hats,

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:90%
for those particular lambdas.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Look at the prices, which
you now know and remember

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
are the shadow prices on
the resource constraints

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and we generate the
wealth associating

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:90%
with this purchasing power.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to look
for to get a standard Walrasian

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium his
particular lambdas,

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:84%
such that the valuation of
privately owned resources

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.230 align:middle line:84%
for a given household,
I, is equal to the wealth

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.210 align:middle line:90%
coming from the lambdas.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Here this is a better
statement of it.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.040 align:middle line:84%
A particular lambda
star, the fixed point--

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:84%
find me, please-- the fixed
point would be such that when

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
we substitute lambda into the
Pareto problem and generate

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.050 align:middle line:84%
the optimal allocations, we'll
have some valuation at those

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:84%
shadow prices of
the expenditures,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:90%
which when we sum up over--

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and summed up over all
the commodities, L,

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
would be exactly equal
to the right hand

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.220 align:middle line:84%
side of the budget, the
valuation of purchasing power

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that the consumer has as a
result of owning the endowment

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and getting shares in
the profits of the firms

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:84%
when the firms are maximizing
at that same lambda star.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.100 align:middle line:90%
So this is the fixed point.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I think I mentioned in
a question and answer

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of lecture
18 when we reviewed 17,

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that I felt I hadn't done a
good enough job explaining

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.300 align:middle line:90%
the intuition for this mapping.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But it does come from the
second welfare theorem.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Start with a given guess about
the lambda that pins down

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:84%
which particular Pareto Optimum
were targeting and suppose that

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.420 align:middle line:84%
were the case that the
valuation of expenditure

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:84%
at that optimum for consumer
I were strictly greater

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:84%
than the valuation of his or
her privately owned resources.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Well in this case, we gave
this consumer too much.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:90%
They can't afford it.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.250 align:middle line:90%
So the obvious way to iterate--

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:84%
if indeed you were
even searching--

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:84%
is to reduce the lambda
for this household

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and increase the
lambdas for the other.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is very much like
that Edgeworth Box diagram

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:84%
for the second welfare theorem,
where I said household A has

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.360 align:middle line:90%
to give up stuff.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.910 align:middle line:84%
This would be household
A if the inequality

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.230 align:middle line:90%
is greater than or equal to.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And household B would
be the recipient

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and be getting the transfers.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:84%
For household B, you'd be
under valuing evaluation

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.730 align:middle line:84%
of the resources that the
assigned optimum could

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:03.150 align:middle line:84%
be less than the valuation
of their privately

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:90%
owned resources.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Now again, Negishi
didn't actually

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
show that one could
find the fixed

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
point by iterating
on the lambdas,

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:84%
but in practice,
it typically works.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So as a numerical
algorithm, you could just

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.800 align:middle line:84%
be trying out candidates,
lambda checking out

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.950 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of budget
equations and so on.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So here again, this links up to
lambda equal marginal utility

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:90%
of income.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the Kansas Rocky Mountain
pictures at the beginning

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and I reinforce that when we
went to the second welfare

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.610 align:middle line:90%
theorem.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So this proof of the
existence is working off

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:84%
the same equivalence
between the lambda

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and the inverse marginal
utility of wealth.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the computer
science part

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that it looks like it
might be hard to find,

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:90%
actually constructively.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So these guys
algorithmically want

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to find the Walrasian
equilibrium,

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.440 align:middle line:84%
not just be happy
with the notion

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that there's a fixed
point so that it exists.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And this literature works on the
same, they kind of discovered,

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.780 align:middle line:90%
again, Negishi.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
told you about it.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But you get a better
sense here and I gave you

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:84%
a hint of that, with respect
to Herb Scarf, that the way

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:26.850 align:middle line:84%
to find it is to periodically
look at the aggregate demand

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
oracle, as it were, and take
a local derivative of it

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.528 align:middle line:84%
to see which way
you ought to move.

00:33:33.528 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
bit harder than what

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I said about just iterating
on Negishi's algorithm.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But their point is that they
designed an algorithm that

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.220 align:middle line:84%
finds the competitive
equilibrium using Negishi

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's not that
hard in the sense

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.980 align:middle line:84%
that it's polynomial
of degree three

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and the number of
goods, which is N.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's polynomial, rather
than exponentially hard.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So then we went to the second
part of the lecture, which

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.000 align:middle line:90%
was Strategic Form Games.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.395 align:middle line:90%
This looks quite different.

00:34:05.395 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:84%
You have utility
functions again,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:84%
but they can be a function
of other people's strategies,

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:90%
not just your own.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Finite set of players,
that's kind of similar.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
strategy profiles.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.510 align:middle line:84%
What household i is
doing, or trader i,

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:84%
versus what all the
others are doing.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And we defined mixed
strategies, where the players

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:33.389 align:middle line:84%
are randomizing, potentially,
over a finite set

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:90%
of discrete actions.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.409 align:middle line:84%
So this is one place
in the course where,

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.159 align:middle line:84%
again, these lotteries
come up to convexity

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:90%
things in this case.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, the
convexification is

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:49.380 align:middle line:84%
what allows us to prove
the existence of this mixed

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.210 align:middle line:90%
strategy equilibrium.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.699 align:middle line:84%
A mixed strategy
equilibrium is a set

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of randomization routines
for each player stacked up

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.330 align:middle line:84%
in a vector, such
that given what

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.910 align:middle line:84%
all the other players
"I" are doing,

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.250 align:middle line:90%
minus "I", all the others.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But player "I" wants to do is
the I-star, signa-star vector

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:84%
component of that vector,
better than any other component.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is the definition of
a mixed strategy equilibrium.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we had this
interesting side note here.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is a third
related, but not identical

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.680 align:middle line:84%
statement, which is you have a
candidate for an equilibrium,

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:84%
how do it really
is an equilibrium?

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It's related to the
idea of the fixed point,

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:90%
momentarily I'll show you that.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But here, the question
is, how many things do you

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:84%
have to check at the candidate
mixed equilibrium Nash, mixed

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.410 align:middle line:90%
strategy Nash equilibrium.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out you only
need to check pure strategy

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:58.760 align:middle line:84%
deviations here, rather than
all possible mixed strategies.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness because
that would be hard.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is, if you

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.330 align:middle line:84%
can find a degenerate
action which

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
dominates the supposed
mixed strategy

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:90%
maximum, that's enough.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a particular
degenerate mixed strategy

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:84%
to show that you
could do better.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And if there were multiple
ones that were doing better,

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.360 align:middle line:84%
you pick the best
one that dominates

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:90%
to break up the solution.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And if there were
two or more that

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:31.180 align:middle line:84%
generated the same utility,
you could randomize over them,

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.040 align:middle line:84%
but there's no need because they
all generate the same utility

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:90%
so you might as well pick one.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
intuition for why it's

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.860 align:middle line:84%
enough to look to
check a given candidate

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:84%
profile against these degenerate
actions, not mix strategies.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:55.330 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it is remembering
exactly these kinds

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:56.290 align:middle line:90%
of responses.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The better-than sets, or best
response sets for each player.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So given the others
are doing, you

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.550 align:middle line:84%
want a best response
for player I, obviously

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.020 align:middle line:90%
is going to maximize.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, generating the same
mixed strategy as a candidate,

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:18.130 align:middle line:84%
but maybe not, if it's not a
mixed strategy equilibrium.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But all the other guys
are doing the same.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to look for
a fixed point in the space

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.960 align:middle line:90%
of best response strategies.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And the proof of the existence
of a strategy Nash equilibrium

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the convexity
of these best responses,

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.920 align:middle line:90%
as in Kakutani, for example.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.917 align:middle line:90%
In particular, all this stuff.

00:37:38.917 --> 00:37:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little worried
I'm going to get bogged

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:45.280 align:middle line:84%
down in the weeds, but I did
want you to, on the other hand,

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.090 align:middle line:90%
see the big picture.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.140 align:middle line:90%
So now we have two parts.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The Nash equilibrium
for strategic games

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and the Walrasian equilibria,
they're all using fixed points,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.580 align:middle line:84%
but the economic problem
looks kind of different.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So I finished this lecture
off by drawing the connection,

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.770 align:middle line:84%
like how do you actually set
up a market to find a Walrasian

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:90%
equilibria.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And we did that with respect
to these limit order strategies

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:84%
on the supply and demand
side and then wrote it down

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:90%
as the game.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So once we wrote this
down as the game,

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.970 align:middle line:84%
where players
decide what to bid,

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:84%
given what others are bidding
it is a strategic form game

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and we characterize
the equilibrium.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Turned out, you needed some
penalties, otherwise, they

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
would spend more than
they have and that

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.650 align:middle line:84%
can't be consistent with
maximization-- well,

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:84%
it would be maximization,
but there'd be no limit.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So it would not be consistent
with finding the Walrasian

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.700 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So we did have to find the
optimal penalty structure

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.440 align:middle line:84%
in order to prove the
theorem that any Walrasian

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.190 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium could be supported
as a mixed strategy equilibrium

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.840 align:middle line:90%
in this market game.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And the other
direction is also true.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:90%
So that was lecture 17.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Are there any
questions about what

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:90%
we were doing in lecture 17?

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:90%


00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.060 align:middle line:90%
18 was aggregation.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
getting more recent.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, a little
more fresh in your minds.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.640 align:middle line:84%
We want to do this
positive and normative.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And I would say the
content of this lecture

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is, what do we have to
assume, like it or not,

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.800 align:middle line:84%
in order to be in
the land of macro,

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:84%
where you have a
representative consumer?

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And is usable in the sense
that what the representative

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:46.940 align:middle line:84%
consumer would do, which from
a positive economic standpoint,

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.310 align:middle line:84%
generate aggregate
demand as if you

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:84%
had all the
underlying households,

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:51.917 align:middle line:90%
but you don't need to do it.

00:39:51.917 --> 00:39:53.850 align:middle line:84%
You just use the
representative consumer.

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very powerful tool.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But again, for you to decide
how strong or potentially

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.350 align:middle line:84%
unrealistic are the
underlying assumptions

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:05.610 align:middle line:90%
that allows us to do this?

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So we reviewed the notion of
the indirect utility function,

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:84%
which is the maximized
utility after solving

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.310 align:middle line:84%
max utility subject to budget,
given the parameters, the price

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:90%
and the wealth of a household.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And we quickly reviewed
some properties

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.560 align:middle line:84%
of the indirect
utility functions.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.340 align:middle line:84%
In particular, Roy's
identity, which miraculously

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:84%
says that if you
start differentiating

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.310 align:middle line:84%
the indirect utility function
with respect to prices

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and respect to wealth
and start taking ratios,

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:40.190 align:middle line:84%
you'll get the
underlying demands.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:90%
And this was a tool.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's heavily used.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, now for the
third time, it just

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:84%
came from the Lagrangian problem
for the individual household.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And Roy's identity
came from that.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we got to Gorman, which
is a particular representation

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:84%
of these indirect
utility functions

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.240 align:middle line:84%
as a function of
prices and wealth,

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.060 align:middle line:90%
namely, this thing in six.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's separable, it has an
intercept of the function of p,

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:12.170 align:middle line:84%
slope term on wealth
as a function of p.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I noted that the Cobb
Douglas would satisfy this.

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:16.700 align:middle line:90%
We actually did the math.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.890 align:middle line:84%
This math is never
very hard to do,

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:21.410 align:middle line:84%
as long as you remember that
when you have these Cobb

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Douglas utility function,
these coefficients represent

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.580 align:middle line:90%
expenditure shares.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So P1 times x1 is alpha
share of wealth, w--

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:middle line:84%
likewise, p2x2 is 1 minus
alpha share of wealth, W,

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.600 align:middle line:90%
for the second good.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So you can plop
them down right away

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and just substitute into
the given utility function

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and you end up with
this functional form.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I also noted that
although this is

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.400 align:middle line:84%
special in that the
intercepts are 0,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.170 align:middle line:84%
it also seemingly assumed
that the coefficients, B, are

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:57.950 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But no, this was a particular
indirect utility function

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.210 align:middle line:84%
for a household--
a given household.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to start putting "I" in
the utility function to decide.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And if these alphas
were different

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.870 align:middle line:84%
across different households, we
would need an alpha I on them

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and then this thing, the
Gorman form, would be violated.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So the first part of the
positive representative

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.400 align:middle line:84%
consumer was just saying a
definition of aggregate demand,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:84%
namely, it's the
sum of the demands

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.680 align:middle line:84%
over all the individual
households at price vector, p,

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.690 align:middle line:90%
and Wealth's WI.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Gorman part is
to find that demand--

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:43.160 align:middle line:84%
this guy here-- depends
on the vector of wealth's

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.480 align:middle line:90%
in a particular way.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Namely, it's just
the sum of them.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Or in other words, it's enough.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:84%
We should be able to
find a utility function

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and give this mythical
representative household all

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.180 align:middle line:84%
the wealth in the economy and
have that household maximize

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.810 align:middle line:84%
utility, generating
aggregate demand, which

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.670 align:middle line:84%
would be the sum of
the individual demands

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.580 align:middle line:84%
if we'd bothered to keep
track of the micro economy

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and the individual
wealth levels.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So this statement was
necessary, but it's

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.450 align:middle line:84%
about to be sufficient if the
individual households have

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.450 align:middle line:84%
this particular indirect
utility function of the Gorman

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:84%
form with the I only on
the A intercept piece,

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.250 align:middle line:84%
although w depends on I,
but that's because it's

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:90%
individual households wealth.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Then the utility
function we're looking

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.690 align:middle line:84%
for is just going to be
an aggregated version,

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:43.140 align:middle line:84%
aggregating up the
intercept terms

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and imposing the same
coefficient on the wealth

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:90%
across all the households.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Now do you like it or not?

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It is going to require that
we have these linear expansion

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.190 align:middle line:84%
paths, if we go back
to the micro economy

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:01.840 align:middle line:90%
and see how they're behaving.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.120 align:middle line:84%
But giving wealth
to one guy would

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.620 align:middle line:84%
increase utility and consumption
in exactly the same way

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.330 align:middle line:84%
that consumption would be
decreased for the other one.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So moving wealth around because
the slopes of these lines

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:84%
are the same, they're
parallel lines,

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:20.130 align:middle line:84%
moving wealth's around has no
effect on aggregate demand.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a restatement
of the positive part

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.690 align:middle line:90%
of the representative consumer.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:28.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're listening
to macro economists,

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.670 align:middle line:84%
worried a lot about
marginal propensity

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:34.630 align:middle line:84%
to consume out of wealth
and out of transfers.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:37.780 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to find transfers
to particular constrained

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.430 align:middle line:84%
households in a
way that they would

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:43.060 align:middle line:84%
eat a lot as if there was a
special virtue of pumping up

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.290 align:middle line:90%
aggregate demand.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Well they don't
have Gorman in mind

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.650 align:middle line:84%
because aggregate demand is not
determined by the distribution

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:51.820 align:middle line:90%
of wealth under Gorman.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.340 align:middle line:84%
It's determined by
the aggregate wealth.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So it wouldn't matter who
you gave the money to,

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:90%
if it were Gorman world.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Positive representative
consumer.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.660 align:middle line:84%
The proof of it I'm not
going to go through.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It's basically using Roy's
identity over and over again

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.450 align:middle line:90%
and exploiting the linearity.

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Adding up and then
taking it back down.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:84%
There's examples of Gorman
aggregate preferences,

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:21.080 align:middle line:84%
allowing variation
in the intercepts.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So households do not
have to be all alike.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And the normative
household, normative

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:31.700 align:middle line:84%
in addition to being positive,
there's another definition,

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.940 align:middle line:90%
namely we're looking--

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
we have the underlying micro
economy with the heterogeneity

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:90%
across all the households.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.650 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for this
fictitious utility function,

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:46.570 align:middle line:84%
U*, which we label the utility
function of the normative

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:50.530 align:middle line:84%
representative household
to satisfy two properties.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Namely, if we want to see if
something x and y is Pareto

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Optimal, then we can search
for alternative allocations

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.880 align:middle line:90%
that might Pareto dominate.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.360 align:middle line:84%
In the normal micro land of
all these different households,

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.040 align:middle line:84%
you have to check out
each and every one

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to see if they're better off
under the proposed alternative.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.660 align:middle line:84%
With Gorman normative,
you don't have to do that.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.410 align:middle line:84%
You just sum up all the
demands in the baseline

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and in the alternative and
evaluate that sum under this

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.360 align:middle line:90%
mythical utility function, U*.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So if something predominates,
then it has to have a higher

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.700 align:middle line:90%
return under U*.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So that makes the search
a whole lot easier.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And the flip-side is the same
with an important caveat.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:84%
We start with a baseline and
you find a prime allocation,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:84%
which is dominant under
U*, after you sum up.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Then we should be
able to do better.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is a way
in the micro space

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:57.430 align:middle line:84%
to assign allocations
that add up

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.490 align:middle line:84%
to the prime bundle
that are not necessarily

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:02.500 align:middle line:90%
the actual prime allocation.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:06.580 align:middle line:84%
A way to do that in such a way
that everyone is at least as

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:84%
well off and some
people are better off.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So the point of this is, it's
very strong when it works,

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.720 align:middle line:84%
it's a way of
evaluating allocations.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But is it is not to say
that you don't have to worry

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.640 align:middle line:90%
about the distribution.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.770 align:middle line:84%
You could make
people better off,

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.660 align:middle line:84%
as I've said
before, I think when

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I gave this lecture, free trade
could make everyone better off.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But you shouldn't stop there
because even under Gorman, you

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:38.470 align:middle line:84%
have to redistribute wealth
in such a way as to let it

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Pareto dominate the
tariff equilibrium.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's a less that
trade theorists kind of forgot

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.470 align:middle line:90%
to emphasize

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.420 align:middle line:90%
So we did this in--

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.510 align:middle line:84%
we actually did the proof in
the space of indirect utilities.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't want to
go through that too much.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So at the end, we
have the application

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
of those positive and normative
representative consumers

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.090 align:middle line:90%
to this slide.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the third time that
I've shown you this economy.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And at least maybe
the third time,

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.600 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the Pareto
problem in this economy.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.570 align:middle line:84%
This Pareto problem, of
course, has the lambda weights,

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:90%
as well it should.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But if we have a positive
and normative representative

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:23.520 align:middle line:84%
consumer, then amazingly, we
can drop the Pareto weights

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.740 align:middle line:90%
and just maximize U*.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if there's
a single representative

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.710 align:middle line:84%
consumer with an aggregated
production technology,

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:33.210 align:middle line:90%
like Robinson Crusoe.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is a much, much
easier problem to solve.

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Hence the power of it for
macro because we're solving it

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:40.800 align:middle line:90%
in the space of macros.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, typically,
people forget

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to think about the underlying
distribution and the underlying

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.915 align:middle line:84%
wealth distribution
of welfare gains

00:48:48.915 --> 00:48:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even losses so
stick with the aggregates.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So are there any questions
about lecture 18?

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:59.860 align:middle line:90%


00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:90%
19 went the other direction.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And I paired them deliberately.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, look
at all the special things

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:09.100 align:middle line:84%
you can do if you assume
special structure,

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.990 align:middle line:84%
like linear income
expansion paths,

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:15.790 align:middle line:84%
let's try to avoid any
restrictions whatsoever

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:19.630 align:middle line:84%
on utility and production
sets and so on and still see

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:23.345 align:middle line:84%
whether we can say
anything at all.

00:49:23.345 --> 00:49:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit of this
is very different

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:26.140 align:middle line:90%
from the previous lecture.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is about not
assuming Gorman aggregation,

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:35.260 align:middle line:84%
or not even assuming anything
much at all about expansion.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Could have given goods.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.540 align:middle line:84%
What, if anything, can
we say or given data,

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:43.660 align:middle line:84%
can we just always accept
that there's an economy that

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.730 align:middle line:90%
would have generated the data.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
this at the beginning

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.450 align:middle line:90%
of the following class.

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So we want to put as little
structure as possible.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And we did this a couple of
ways with an infinite amount

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.870 align:middle line:84%
of data, with a
finite amount of data.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.690 align:middle line:84%
We did it in partial equilibrium
under consumer choice

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and then we made
some connections

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.360 align:middle line:90%
to general equilibrium theory.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.240 align:middle line:84%
The Slutsky thing
came from a property,

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.060 align:middle line:84%
namely, that we
minimized the expenditure

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.180 align:middle line:84%
necessary to achieve a
certain level of utility.

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.270 align:middle line:84%
That expenditure
function is concave.

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the derivative of
the expenditure function--

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:26.071 align:middle line:84%
a bit like Roy's
identity, not quite--

00:50:26.071 --> 00:50:29.030 align:middle line:90%
is the hexane demands.

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So the second derivative of the
expenditure function, a matrix,

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.120 align:middle line:84%
really of cross
partial derivatives

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:38.440 align:middle line:84%
has to be symmetric and
negative semi-definite.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.280 align:middle line:84%
This statement is what led
to the Slutsky equation.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a version
of that equation.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I guess for the purposes
of the lecture in terms

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:51.970 align:middle line:84%
of what's the point of it all,
one is we get restrictions

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:53.620 align:middle line:90%
from the data.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Assuming preferences
are regular,

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:01.060 align:middle line:84%
we get restrictions on
something we never see.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Namely, these compensated
Hicksian demand functions,

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.390 align:middle line:84%
as I think we went
through in lecture 3.

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, we're able
to write out the left hand

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:15.280 align:middle line:84%
side, these Slutsky derivative,
cross partial derivatives,

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.500 align:middle line:84%
in terms of observables
on the right hand

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.530 align:middle line:84%
side, which are directly from
the consumers optimization

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:21.670 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:25.930 align:middle line:84%
How demand changes with prices,
how demands change with wealth.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
would be observing

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.740 align:middle line:90%
the actual allocations.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.160 align:middle line:90%
This is with infinite data.

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're
allowed conceptually

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to think about having
all these derivatives

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.690 align:middle line:84%
for infinitesimally small
changes available to us.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And again, as I went through
in class from lecture 3,

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:47.290 align:middle line:84%
when we did the income
and substitution effects

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:51.070 align:middle line:84%
we had written with the
S on the right hand side

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and DXDP on the left hand side.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.730 align:middle line:90%
So there was a negative sign.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's all the same.

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:59.350 align:middle line:90%
It's all equivalent.

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So then we're saying
Slutsky would be satisfied

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and a couple of other
things are satisfied

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:10.810 align:middle line:84%
if we have the premise of an
underlying rational consumer

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:12.460 align:middle line:90%
maximizing utility.

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And we reviewed this
in the discussion

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:16.600 align:middle line:90%
of the subsequence class.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We have homogeneity of
degree 0, and Walras law.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Spending your budget, no
price solution and spending

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and being on the budget
line that plus Slutsky are

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:34.030 align:middle line:84%
the restrictions implied by
having a utility maximizing

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.710 align:middle line:90%
rational household.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that it
goes the other way, as well.

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:43.390 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, if you had
data that satisfied these three

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:84%
properties, then there would be
an underlying utility function

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that's quasi-concave
increasing and so on that

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.750 align:middle line:90%
would have generated the data.

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So this seemingly bears
some similarity to Gorman

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:00.520 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of could we
generate the aggregate demand

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:03.250 align:middle line:84%
by maximizing a
utility function?

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Could we find the
utility function, U*,

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:08.290 align:middle line:84%
such that given the
household all the wealth,

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:11.230 align:middle line:84%
the solution to that problem
would be the underlying

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.100 align:middle line:90%
demands.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Here though, we're giving
the data, including demands,

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:20.140 align:middle line:84%
for a given household and
trying to find whether or not

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:23.800 align:middle line:84%
there exists a utility function
that will generate demands

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.090 align:middle line:90%
with all these properties.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
is, yes, that it's

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.500 align:middle line:84%
sufficient and necessary
to have these properties.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So the theory has
content, you just

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.530 align:middle line:84%
need to scroll through
this list in the data

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can
violate one of them.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And it could not have come
from a maximizing household.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Convexity was not testable,
not with this demand theory

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:50.440 align:middle line:84%
because you generate
the same data

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and we actually made a
connection to computer science.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So this part, this is
testing with finite data,

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.700 align:middle line:90%
not an infinite amount of data.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And the key here was
the beginning, at least,

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.850 align:middle line:84%
this Weak Axiom of
revealed preference, which

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:09.260 align:middle line:90%
you should all know--

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and again, we reviewed it
in the subsequence lecture

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.040 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning--

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:19.370 align:middle line:84%
that pairwise, if we have two
observations prices and demands

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and situation one and
situation two, then a price P2,

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:26.810 align:middle line:84%
if they're observed choosing
X2, it better be the case.

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And X1 was available
and not chosen,

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:31.880 align:middle line:84%
it better be the
case that it price

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.100 align:middle line:84%
is P1, where
they're choosing X1,

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.260 align:middle line:90%
they don't have X2 available.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they were
supposed to have chosen it.

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:40.430 align:middle line:84%
If it had been
interior in the budget,

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:42.020 align:middle line:84%
according to the
first statement,

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.170 align:middle line:90%
it would be utility maximizing.

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is putting
restrictions on data.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:50.615 align:middle line:84%
The Weak Axiom
Revealed Preference

00:54:50.615 --> 00:54:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is looking at
pairwise observations

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.620 align:middle line:84%
as we move prices and demands
around to see if it's quote,

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.190 align:middle line:90%
"rational".

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Weak Axiom of
Revealed Preference.

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.010 align:middle line:90%
And then we generalize that.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:09.630 align:middle line:84%
We call those Directly Revealed
Preferred pairwise comparisons.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we went on to talk
about Indirectly Revealed

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Preferred, or just
Revealed Preferred.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And the content of
this was, we never see

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:24.270 align:middle line:90%
all the pairwise comparisons.

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:30.300 align:middle line:84%
We never see XT
directly compared to XS,

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.510 align:middle line:84%
but we do see it
indirectly because we

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.970 align:middle line:84%
have XT, in this case, Reveal
Directly Preferred to XR1,

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:41.800 align:middle line:90%
XR1 reveal preferred to XR2.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And so on down the chain.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So under one of those properties
of a rational consumer,

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:53.370 align:middle line:84%
namely transitivity, if we had
a sequence of Reveal Directly

00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Preferred and under
transitivity, XT

00:55:56.730 --> 00:56:01.060 align:middle line:84%
should be revealed preferred,
directly preferred to XS too.

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you can do the
pairwise comparison, a TNS,

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.310 align:middle line:84%
it better be the case
they don't violate

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.110 align:middle line:90%
that XT is preferred to--

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:12.380 align:middle line:90%
weakly preferred XS.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So this second part is, assuming
underlying consumer rationality

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to set up a situation
where we can actually

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.170 align:middle line:90%
impose the test.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Then we did that in
computational economics,

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:32.950 align:middle line:84%
which I mentioned I elaborated
on in the subsequence lecture.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And we took it to
general equilibrium.

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So are there any questions
about risk sharing?

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Any questions about lecture 19?

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.790 align:middle line:90%


00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:46.950 align:middle line:84%
These reviews get
faster and faster

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:49.170 align:middle line:84%
as we approach the
end of the hour.

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, it's
more and more recent, so

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.420 align:middle line:90%
not so worried.

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.770 align:middle line:90%
21, we already did.

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:58.290 align:middle line:90%
So that just leaves us with 20.

00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And 20 is pretty familiar, which
was the failure of the welfare

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:03.330 align:middle line:90%
theorem.

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of covered
sufficient assumptions already.

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.540 align:middle line:90%
And then for the fourth--

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:10.560 align:middle line:90%
third or fourth time--

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing you this economy
again in all of its glory,

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:20.100 align:middle line:84%
with the convexity and concavity
in the appropriate spots.

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Statement of the
second welfare theorem,

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.290 align:middle line:84%
you actually saw this slide
before in the review today.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And the second
welfare theorem says

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that any Pareto Optimum
can be supported

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.690 align:middle line:90%
as of Walrasian equilibrium.

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So here's a case where
everything's working out fine.

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:40.950 align:middle line:84%
There is a Pareto
Optimum, obviously.

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:44.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the supporting
hyperplane, again.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be a
competitive equilibrium.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But the second welfare theorem
has sufficient assumptions

00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:53.660 align:middle line:90%
to convexity.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, I
think last time--

00:57:56.750 --> 00:58:01.150 align:middle line:84%
or in answer to this
second to last time--

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:03.340 align:middle line:84%
the starting point
here is something

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.630 align:middle line:90%
that's Pareto Optimal.

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to lose track of
the direction of the argument.

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:09.250 align:middle line:90%
Is this Pareto Optimal?

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it certainly is, or at
least you can imagine so.

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the indifference
curve that's tangent, locally.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And you could try to move
away from there, globally.

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But whatever you
do, it has to be

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.910 align:middle line:84%
on this production
set to be feasible

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to be
associated with a lower

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:30.530 align:middle line:90%
level of an indifference curve.

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is the best
level of utility

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.700 align:middle line:84%
achievable within and on the
production set, and likewise

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:37.600 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but then the
second, I'm forgetting

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.880 align:middle line:84%
the second part of the theorem
is, can it be supported

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.150 align:middle line:90%
as a competitive equilibrium?

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
no because given

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.360 align:middle line:84%
this imagine
supporting hyperplane,

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.040 align:middle line:84%
the household
would be better off

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.110 align:middle line:90%
moving away to some extreme.

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Have a higher utility.

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to be
consistent with utility

00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:57.070 align:middle line:90%
maximization.

00:58:57.070 --> 00:59:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And this one is not consistent
with profit maximization,

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.450 align:middle line:84%
even though it is still
a Pareto Optimal point.

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:08.190 align:middle line:84%
As you could
construct, graphically.

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So I showed you this
picture earlier.

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:13.500 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of an
aggregated version of it.

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It says those assumptions
are sufficient,

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.720 align:middle line:84%
they're not
necessarily necessary.

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.020 align:middle line:84%
The first welfare theorem
as a competitive equilibrium

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:22.770 align:middle line:90%
is optimal.

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:26.730 align:middle line:84%
This one assumes the existence
of a competitive equilibrium.

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:30.090 align:middle line:84%
All we need is rationality
and non-satiation.

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But this was a picture
showing that if we

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.340 align:middle line:84%
don't have
non-satiation locally,

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:38.700 align:middle line:84%
we're not necessarily
going to show

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that the competitive equilibrium
is Pareto Optimal because we're

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.430 align:middle line:84%
given the competitive
equilibrium we can find

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:46.980 align:middle line:90%
something Pareto dominating.

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Then we went through
this pollution example,

00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:53.260 align:middle line:84%
which is not allowing
trade in all the goods.

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, the intuition for
this miraculous price system

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.210 align:middle line:84%
when it works means
that households only

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.780 align:middle line:84%
have to evaluate things on
the margin at those prices.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:07.230 align:middle line:84%
They internalize
through the prices

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.390 align:middle line:90%
and make the right decision.

01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:12.510 align:middle line:84%
The prices reflect
the social trade off

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:16.510 align:middle line:84%
of increasing or
decreasing demands.

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
they're much aware

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.860 align:middle line:84%
of their utility consequences,
their marginal rate

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.340 align:middle line:90%
of substitution.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So if we get it right in
a competitive equilibrium

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:27.730 align:middle line:84%
in complete markets, and
the price system conveys

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:29.470 align:middle line:84%
all the right
things on the margin

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and all the people have to do is
take from God this price system

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:39.000 align:middle line:84%
from Adam Smith, you might say,
as if by an invisible hand,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.560 align:middle line:84%
namely, the price system
be guided to Pareto Optimal

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.880 align:middle line:90%
allocations.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.330 align:middle line:84%
But likewise, if we
screw up the markets,

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
then the whole
thing falls apart.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And the solution
example was where

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.690 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have a price
for all the goods,

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have a rate
of substitution of one

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
good for the other in the
market and households and firms

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.530 align:middle line:90%
make efficient choices.

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So we did that with the
pollution as a leading example.

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
We went to arrow
to generalize it,

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
where households care
about other's consumption--

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
either they're
altruistic or envious.

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
kind of works.

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the fourth
or fifth time today

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about
a Pareto problem

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and associated first
order condition generating

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:25.860 align:middle line:90%
shadow prices.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So we're following
exactly the same steps as

01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
in the second welfare
theorem and finding

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
a way, despite the externalities
and utility functions,

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
to support the Pareto
Optimal allocation

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.520 align:middle line:90%
as a competitive equilibrium.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
We already talked about
failure when we have

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.630 align:middle line:90%
an infinite number of goods.

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:51.420 align:middle line:84%
This was an example of how to
Pareto dominate an allocation

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
by, essentially, giving the
first household some goods

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
the second had and then the
third giving to the second,

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.060 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what's going on
in the overlapping generations,

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:07.200 align:middle line:90%
monetary economy of lecture 21.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Money is worthless.

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.310 align:middle line:90%
It's just pieces of paper.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
There's no intrinsic value, but
if household two here came up

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
with money and gave it to
household-- took money, sorry,

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
from household one and
exchanged it for goods,

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
then one gets the goods and
two gets the money and then two

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:32.400 align:middle line:84%
can pass the money along
to household three.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So there is a connection
between this artificial example

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that we get a
non-optimal autarky equilibrium

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
dominated by a monetary
equilibrium in the overlapping

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
generations model, which we
talked about at the beginning

01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:51.510 align:middle line:90%
of class.

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:52.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, that
was it for lecture 23.

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And we already
reviewed lecture 21.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.660 align:middle line:90%
So questions?

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:09.820 align:middle line:90%


01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed teaching the class.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed the
interaction with you guys.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:18.190 align:middle line:90%
You're really doing well.

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a great joy to me.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I hope you like this way
of learning economics

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and you're really
quite well trained now.

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:35.480 align:middle line:90%

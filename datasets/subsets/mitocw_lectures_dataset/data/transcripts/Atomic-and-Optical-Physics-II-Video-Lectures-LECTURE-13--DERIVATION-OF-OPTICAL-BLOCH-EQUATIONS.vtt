00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.960
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.190
The title here is the
topic for our class today.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.720
We want to discuss formally
the derivation Optical Bloch

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.290
Equations, but usually
when I teach you something,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.240
I have a general concept in mind
and the concept right now here

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.080
is, how can we get from unitary
time evolution of a quantum

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.740
system to rate
equations anticipation.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.250
And this is sort of the
subject of master equation

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.460
open system dynamics, and
this cartoon sort of tells you

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.489
what you want to do.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.990
We have a total system, which is
one part we are interested in,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.163
and the other one, often it has
many, many degrees of freedom,

00:01:14.163 --> 00:01:16.140
and we don't want to
keep track of them.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380
But they have one Hamiltonian.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.330
But we are only interested in
how our atomic system evolves,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.550
and we want to find
an equation, which

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.680
is no longer a
Schrodinger equation.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.950
How does an initial density
matrix describing our system

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.780
develop with time?

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.050
And as we will see, in general,
it follows a master equation,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.710
and we want to discuss
what are general principles

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.560
of such equations.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.080
But it's very important
here is that we are not

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.770
keeping track of what
happens in the environment,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.140
and that's associated here with
a little bucket or trash can.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.350
Every result photons
or such are measured,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.040
the environment is constantly
projected on a measurement

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.200
basis, and therefore,
re-introduce probabilistic

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.970
element into the part
we don't observe mainly

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.470
the part which
characterizes the atoms.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.690
So for that we need the
formalism of density matrix,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.065
and that's where
we want to start.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.540
At the end of last
lecture, I reminded you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.880
that the density
matrix can always

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.700
be written as an
ensemble where you

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.520
say you have a certain
probability for certain rate

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.160
function.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.660
This is always possible,
but it is not unique.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.580
So each of you could actually
create the same density matrix

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.460
by preparing a number
of quantum states

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.420
with a certain
probability and saying

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.960
this is my density matrix.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.700
And also each of you has
prepared different quantum

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.630
states.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.640
If you sum them up
in that same way,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.280
you get the same density matrix
and therefore, all observables

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.280
or measurements you will do
on your ensemble in the future

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.320
will be identical because
the density matrix is

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.890
a full description
of the system.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.705
So at that level, it may
look sort of very trivial

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:23.000
that we have
different unraveling.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.130
Unraveling means you
look microscopically

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.140
what is behind the
density matrix,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.640
but in your homework
assignment, you

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.970
will all show that you can have
a system which have very, very

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.990
different dissipation
mechanisms,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.290
but they're described
by the same equation.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.490
So therefore, it's
physically not possible

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.280
to distinguish by just measuring
the density matrix what

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.810
causes a dissipation.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.400
Of course, if you know
what causes a dissipation,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.990
fluctuating fields
or collisions,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.630
you know more than the
density matrix knows.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.900
Any questions about density
matrix or the agenda

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.240
we want to go through today?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.160
Just a quick reminder and
since this was covered in 8421,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.410
and most of you know about
it, I pre-wrote the slides.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.800
The density matrix
is a time evolution.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.160
There is one which is sort
trivial and covered in more

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.450
elementary takes, and this
is the Hamiltonian evolution,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.890
and I'm sure you've seen it.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.250
The time evolution, the
unitary time evolution

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.190
involves the commutative
of the Hamiltonian

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.600
with a density matrix,
and later on, we

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.900
want to specialize including
dissipation, including

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.170
the environment to the evolution
of a tool evolutionary system

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.120
driven by a monochromatic field

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:01.680
And this the famous
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.920
and we can characterize this
system by a density matrix,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.670
but will be very important
is that we distinguish

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.240
between populations,
the diagonal parts,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.350
and the coherences.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.080
And if you simply put
this density matrix

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:32.980
into this equation, you find the
time evolution of the system,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.630
and we will refer to
that result later on.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.470
Many of you have
seen it in 8421.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.470
we can parametrize
the density matrix

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.160
for the two-level system.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.015
So we can parametrize
the densities

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:49.080
of the two-level system
by a local vector,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.520
r, which is defined
by this equation.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.550
And then the equation
of motion is simply

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.730
the rotation of a Bloch
vector on the Bloch sphere,

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.770
and it has a
rotational axis, which

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.360
is given by-- the
undriven system

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.270
rotates around the z-axis.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.040
This is just e to
the i omega naught

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.280
t, the normal evolution
of the free system.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.440
But if you divide it with
a monochromatic field

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.060
rotation over the x-axis
and the x-axis, of course,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.545
can take your two-level system,
and flip it from the ground

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:26.970
to the excited state.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.770
So it's just a reminder of the
simple unitary time evolution,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.360
but now we want to add
dissipation on top of it.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:52.240
And what I've decided
that before I discuss

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.500
with you Optical Bloch Equation
and master equation in general,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.840
I want to give you
a very simple model.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.570
I really like
simple models which

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.080
capture the essence of what
you are going to discuss.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:12.750
So what I want to use is I
want to use a beam splitter

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:28.520
model I formulated for photons,
but it would also immediately

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.830
apply to atoms.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.210
And this model, what
I like about it,

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.910
it has all the ingredients
of integration of the master

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.990
equation we'll do later
on without the kind

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.640
of many indices and
summations and integration,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.370
but it captures every single
bit of what is important.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.640
And I usually like to present
exactly solvable, simple models

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.780
where you get it, and
then I can go a little bit

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.300
faster for the
general derivation

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.097
because you know exactly what
the more complicated equations,

00:07:58.097 --> 00:07:58.930
what they are doing.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:09.160
So in other words, what I
want to derive for you is

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.175
we want to have the
following situation.

00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:14.260
We have a beam splitter,
and we know everything

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.590
about beam splitters
because we talked about them

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.860
in the first part of
the course, and we

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.680
have a wave function,
which is the input,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.390
and this is a photon.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.260
And we want to understand
after the beam splitter,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.820
how has the system evolved.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.870
In general, it will
be a density matrix,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.464
and what you want
to find out is,

00:08:36.464 --> 00:08:39.200
what is the equation
for the density matrix.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.400
Maybe this density matrix goes
through the next beam splitter

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.510
and then we want to know
what comes out of it.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.950
And all we have to
apply is the formalism

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.680
we developed for the beam
splitter earlier in the course.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.750
Of course, the beam
splitter is not as harmless

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.970
as it looks like.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:03.710
There is another part
and another part one here

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.530
brings in the environment,
and for the environment,

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.300
we will use the vacuum.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.260
That's the simplest environment.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.810
It's actually
important environment

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.090
because it is the environment
we will use all the time when

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.970
we discuss spontaneous emission.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.330
We send photons into the
nirvana, into the vacuum

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.220
and they disappear, and
this is our modified.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.400
But the other one which
is often not so explicit.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.860
If you send your
photons away, you're

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.800
not keeping track
of what happens,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.510
but you could as well
perform a measurement,

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.360
and this is what we put in here.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.630
We say those photons
hit a bucket or detector

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.300
and measure them,
we observe them.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.140
There's nothing else
we do with them,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.040
so we can as well measure them,
and this being immediately

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.281
lead to the equation
for the density matrix.

00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:54.780
So this is what you
want to discuss,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.980
and it will have all
the ingredients later

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.390
on in a mathematically
simple form

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.270
for the derivation
of master equation.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:09.170
So let's consider a
similar photon for that.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.630
So the wave function,
this is superposition

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.950
of no photon and 1 photon,
and the coefficients

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.930
are alpha and beta.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.630
And just for
simplifying notation,

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.820
I pick alpha and
beta to be real.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:44.640
So what do we expect to
happen at the beam splitter?

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.175
Well, there's a probability
that the photon gets reflected.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.760
Probability to
reflect the photon

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.500
and therefore to
observe the photon.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.940
This probability is, of course,
beta square-- the probability

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.280
that we have a photon to
begin with-- and then the beam

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.560
splitter, remember we
categorized the beam

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.280
splitter with angle
sine theta cosine theta.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.720
Sine theta was the
reflection amplitude,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.470
cosine theta, the
transmission amplitude.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.940
So this probability,
which I call P1

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:37.660
is the probability for
reflection and for measurement.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.460
And now naively you
would think what

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.270
happens after the system
has passed through the beam

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:49.170
splitter, with a probability of
P1, we've measured the photon.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.980
We know for sure there
is no photon left.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.930
The system is in
the vacuum state,

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.980
but then you would say,
well, maybe with probability

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.030
1 minus P1, we have
not measured anything.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.480
Nothing has happened
to the wave function,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.760
and that means the wave
function just continuous.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.750
Well as we will
see, this is wrong.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.640
We are missing something.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.730
What we are actually missing
is that if you measure nothing,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.460
the wave function is not sine.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.540
The possibility that we could
have measured something,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.930
changes the wave function.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.260
I will comment on that in much
more detail in a few lectures

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.290
down the road when
I derive for you

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.040
quantum Monte Carlo
wave function.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.450
I will have a wonderful
discussions with you

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.530
about how does non-observation
change a wave function.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.190
So we will talk about
the physics behind it

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.580
in some more detail.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.150
Right now, I don't want to
get into this discussion.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.850
I simply want to use our
beam splitter equation,

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:02.310
so we can just take the beam
splitter equation and apply it.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:19.800
So our output state
is obtained by taking

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.510
the operator for
our beam splitter,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:29.230
and maybe you remember that the
propagation for beam splitter

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.580
was discovered by
an operator, which

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:37.020
had a dagger b dagger
a in the exponent.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.195
a and b are the two input nodes.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.540
And the angle of
the beam splitter,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.700
which interpolates between
0% and 100% reflection

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.180
transmission is theta.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.090
And we're now looking
for the output

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.010
state of the total system.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.190
We're not performing
the measurement yet,

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:08.330
and this is now acting on
the total system, which

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.110
is the cross product
of our photon system,

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.010
of our system of interest.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.940
And the other
input, which we call

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.430
the environment or
the vacuum, is 0.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:25.096
Well, look a few weeks
back, we have done that all.

00:14:25.096 --> 00:14:32.360
The output state is, well,
there was a probability, alpha,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.410
that we had no photon
in the state psi.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.340
And if we have no
photon in the state psi

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.500
and no photon in the vacuum,
this is the state 0, 0.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.240
What I denote here
with this second place

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.120
is the environment.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.510
And now we have one photon.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.920
We have exactly one photon
with the amplitude beta,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:06.810
and this photon is split
with cosine theta transmitted

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.850
and with phi theta reflected.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.350
If you transmit
it, we have 1, 0.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.210
If we reflect it, we have 0, 1.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.399
And again, this is
the environment,

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:25.065
and here is a photon
in the environment.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.330
So let me just be
clear that this

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.300
is where the
environment comes in.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:43.710
It is a vacuum
state, and here, this

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.030
is the output part
for the environment.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.110
This is where we
do the measurement.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:53.880
And I don't think it matters.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.010
I haven't really told you
which is mode A, which

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.770
is mode B. It doesn't
matter, but one, let's say

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.650
the environment is
mode B, and the system

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:18.260
evolves in mode
A. As you can see,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.110
I'm using a new
program, which has

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.620
some nicer features in
terms of handwriting,

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.770
but it is a little bit
rough in scrolling,

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.850
so I sometimes have to
scroll back and forth.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.500
So what is our output?

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.770
Now, we have two possibilities.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.382
The environment is 0,
or the environment is 1,

00:16:40.382 --> 00:16:41.590
and we perform a measurement.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:50.120
So we have to now go into a
probabilistic description.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.570
So with probability P1, we
have done a measurement,

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:04.700
and our output state is
now the vacuum state.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:20.050
With probability 1
minus P1, we have not

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.609
detected anything in the
vacuum, and therefore, our state

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:29.200
of the system is alpha 0
plus beta cosine theta 1.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:46.350
Is alpha 0, so it is not beta 1
as naively would have assumed.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.080
It's not the original state.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.060
There is a cosine theta
factor, which we got exactly

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.940
from the beam splitter from
the unitary evolution provided

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.130
by the beam splitter.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.660
And since these state
is no longer normalized,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:07.210
I have to normalize
it by alpha squared

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:13.250
plus beta square
cosine square theta.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.150
So now we have done our
measurement probability P1

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.430
to detect the photon.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.020
This projects the system
into the vacuum state

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.150
with the probability 1 minus P1.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.500
We have that state.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.370
Just one second.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.570
Scroll in the pictures.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.040
Write that down.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.140
In fact, millions
that our system is now

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:43.200
described by a density
matrix with probability P1

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.890
and 1 minus 1 minus P1.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:57.100
With probability P1, we
are in the vacuum state,

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.920
and with probability
1 minus P1, we

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.640
are in that state, the
denormalized state psi

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.360
naught, which I just hold down.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.870
Question?

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.680
AUDIENCE: Have you
considered theta

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.784
to be some like a dynamical
phase evolution system.

00:19:15.784 --> 00:19:18.760
It's very low order
like when you expand it

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.240
the first time it looks almost
identical to [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.224
quantum effect maybe.

00:19:23.224 --> 00:19:28.860
The environment is measuring the
state in some way, and I mean,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.120
it's the lowest order now.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.286
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I Quite
agree that random 0 is just

00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:33.110
an example of it.

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:37.100
Pretty much, it's all the same.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.550
Yeah.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.840
What we do here is, I
like the beam splitter

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.695
because the beam splitter
provides an exact formulation

00:19:44.695 --> 00:19:46.190
of the measurement process.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.780
You really can use
a beam splitter

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.440
to discuss what
happens fundamentally

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.450
when you perform a measurement.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:56.570
And the beams splitter is one
typical implementation of that,

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.000
but it has all the
features you'll

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.291
find in any measurement system.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.350
And especially what
you observe here,

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.470
let me just emphasizes is,
the fact that we you do not

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.970
make a measurement
is changing the way

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.910
function from the initial wave
function psi to psi naught,

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.760
we have a factor of
cosine theta here.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.170
And that's also very general.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:27.289
A measurement perturbs,
modifies your wave function

00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:29.330
no matter what the outcome
of the measurement is.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.460
So let me write
it down because we

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.400
want to take it
to the next level.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:52.830
So we have now found in terms of
the beam splitter, angle theta,

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:59.070
and the parameters of the
initial state, alpha beta.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.610
We found the density matrix
after the beam splitter.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.920
Yes.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.000
So what is the next step?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.250
Our goal is to derive the
master equation for the density

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.100
matrix, the time evolution
of the density matrix.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.950
So since we want to
discuss the time evolution,

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.620
we want to find a
differential equation.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.260
So what we want
to figure out is,

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.710
what is the difference
between the output density

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.720
matrix and the input
density matrix.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.730
The input was, of
course, pure state

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:48.130
characterized by the matrix
population alpha squared

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:54.170
and beta squared of diagonal
matrix element of alpha beta.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.030
The difference between
the density matrix

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.660
is can just calculate
the difference.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:19.640
You can simplify
things by applying

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.760
some trigonometric
identities, so this

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:40.710
is an exact result,
cosine theta minus 1.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:48.450
Here we have alpha beta
cosine theta minus 1,

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:53.850
and on the diagonal,
we have cosine

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:58.870
2 theta minus 1 divided by 2.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.530
Anyway this is an
intermediate result.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.760
We're interested in the
differential equation.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.610
We want to sort of find out
what happens when we observe,

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.190
when we have the density
matrix interacting

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.600
with the environment
all the time.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.850
And this can be simulated
by beam splitters

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:22.220
by using many beam splitters
with a small degree

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.650
of reflection.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.810
So we want to simplify
this result now

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.550
for the case of many beam
splitters, and each of them

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:44.040
has a small tipping
angle, theta,

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:53.620
and for later convenience, I
defined theta to be gamma times

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.460
delta t over 2.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.390
That's just my
definition of theta.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:07.510
So what we have in mind now is
that we start with the system

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:15.230
psi, and we have many such beam
splitters with an infinitesimal

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.840
tipping angle.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:29.160
Each beam splitter has the
vacuum at its input state.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:38.023
And we always perform
the measurement.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.320
If I take the
equation above, which

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.740
I know you can't see anymore,
we find a differential equation

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:05.740
for the density matrix, which is
we find an infinitesimal change

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:11.390
delta over the density
matrix, which looks like this.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:24.480
So all I've done is, I've
used the equation above,

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:30.120
and I've done a Taylor expansion
in the small angle theta.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.820
And the reason why I brought
in the square root, well,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.630
we get cosine theta.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.430
The first order Taylor expansion
or the lowest order Taylor

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.020
expansion from cosine is
1 minus theta squared.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.630
So I get the square
root squared.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.610
So I get gamma,
which appears here,

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.240
and then I divide by delta t.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.800
So this is just an exact
mathematical expression,

00:25:52.800 --> 00:26:00.350
and the next step is to form
a differential equation.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:04.830
But before I do that, I want
to emphasize the two features

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.520
we are using here.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.140
They sort of enter
automatically,

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.280
but these are the
two big assumptions

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.360
we make when we derive
a master equation.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:25.850
The first one is that we
always have a vacuum state

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.820
as the input.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:35.460
So in other words,
the environment

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:43.900
is always in the same state,
which is a vacuum state,

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:48.860
and this is sort of called
a Bohr approximation.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.700
What it means is that we
do a measurement here,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.860
but the vacuum is not changing.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.600
In other words, we are
not overloading the vacuum

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.830
with so many photons
that suddenly the vacuum

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.760
Is no longer in
the vacuum state.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.770
Or in the case of
spontaneous emission,

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.500
the vacuum can just take as many
photons as you dumping into it.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.120
They disappear so quickly that
for all practical purposes,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.380
the environment stays
in the vacuum state.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.300
So this is called the
Bohr approximation.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.390
The environment is not changing.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.851
It has enough capacity you to
be modified by the measurement

00:27:25.851 --> 00:27:26.350
process.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:42.260
And the second thing
which is related

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:49.540
is, the vacuum is always
in the same state,

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:56.120
and there are no correlations
from here to here to here,

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.990
there is no memory effect.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.690
Everything is
completely uncorrelated.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.240
So the environment
is uncorrelated.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.380
It has no memory.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.100
It's correlation function
is a delta function,

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.985
and this is called
Markov approximation.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.040
So these are the two
effects which are important.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.820
One is no memory
for the environment,

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.020
Delta function correlation,
Markov approximation,

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.290
and the two, of
course, are related

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.680
in the environment is all
of this in the same state.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:59.100
So remember this is a change
for the density matrix,

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.480
and alpha beta where
the original parameters

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.460
of the density matrix
for the input state.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.256
So I can now rewrite everything
as a differential equation.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:19.130
The density matrix
has a derivative

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:26.370
for the diagonal matrix
elements and for the coherences.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.700
Here we have plus gamma.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.950
Here we have minus
gamma 0, 1, 1,

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.640
makes sense because
we conserve the trace.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.290
We have unity probability
that we have a stellar system.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.830
And therefore the two
diagonal matrix elements,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.160
the population, the sum of
them cannot change with time.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:00.120
And for the coherence,
we have gamma over 2.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:10.010
And if you're familiar with
Optical Bloch Equations, which

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:13.460
we derive next, we
can say that these

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:20.970
means if 0 is the ground state
that the ground state changes

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.050
because-- call it spontaneous
emission from the excited

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.480
state.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.940
This equation would say that
the excited state decays

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.620
with the rate gamma,
and sometimes you

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.430
may have wondered about
that there are factors

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.800
of two appearing,
which also appears here

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.790
that when the excited state
decays with a rate gamma,

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.310
we have a factor here
for the coherences, which

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.380
is gamma over 2.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.950
So what we have
accomplished in contrast

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.430
to let's say Einstein's
equation with the Einstein

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.500
a and b coefficient,
which lead to rate

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:10.080
equations for the population,
we have now a new feature.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.450
We have an the equation
for the coherences,

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.685
and we find a decay
of the coherences

00:31:17.685 --> 00:31:20.535
with half the rate as a
decay of the population.

00:31:24.921 --> 00:31:25.420
Questions?

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:41.400
So if you want you could rewrite
this model for photon, which

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.180
goes through beam splitters,
undergoes measurement.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.840
You can rewrite it from
atomic wave function

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.620
and you measure
whether the atomics

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:52.390
in the excited and ground
state and the equation

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.490
for the measurement
performed on the atom

00:31:54.490 --> 00:32:01.060
is exactly as the equation by
which the beam splitter acts

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.460
on the photon state.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.150
So what I've shown
here it's very

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.450
specific for a single
photon because I

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.000
could use simple
equations, but everything

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.535
is what you find in a much
more general situation.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:23.100
So before I give you the
general derivation of the master

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:33.490
equation, let me talk
about what we have learned

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:41.080
from this example and what
the general procedure is.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:53.650
The first thing is our goal
is to find a differential

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:58.760
equation for the density
matrix of the system.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.690
I just remember.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.940
There was one thing
I wanted to mention.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.370
In the previous derivation
with the beam splitter,

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.250
I started with a purer
state, and the purer state

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.930
developed into a
statistical mixture,

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.350
and this statistical
mixture would then

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.490
transform the next
beam splitter into

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.610
another statistical mixture.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.550
I derived the differential
equation for you

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.530
for the first state
from the pure state

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.340
to the statistical mixture.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.210
But if you would
spend a few minutes,

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.100
you could immediately
show that you

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.950
can start with an
elementary density matrix,

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.300
look how it evolves
through the beam splitter,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.750
and you get exactly the
same differential equation.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:52.260
So the general procedure is,
we want a differential equation

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:57.490
how the density matrix
evolves with time.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:03.360
And this will be obtained
by finding an operator which

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.925
acts on the initial
density matrix.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.949
This operator is not
a unitary operator

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.100
because we are
performing measurements

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.530
through the environment,
even if you don't actually

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.750
perform them.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.429
Once we dump something
into the environment,

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.750
it's out of our
control and anybody

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.260
could go and perform
a measurement,

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.330
and so we should assume
that this measurement has

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:27.790
been taken.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:29.581
It's one of those
quantum mechanical things

00:34:29.581 --> 00:34:32.380
that you don't even have to
care whether somebody does it.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.790
The environment does it for you.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:42.699
So this operator is called
a Liouvillian operator.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.120
It's sometimes called--
and I haven't really

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.389
traced down why-- it's called
sometimes super operator.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.730
I know what
superconductivity is,

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.070
but I don't know what the super
powers of this operator are,

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:06.080
but that's just a name
which you will find.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.010
The second thing
which we have used

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:14.390
is that the evolution
of this system

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:23.050
can be obtained from the time
evolution of the total system

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:28.430
by performing a trace over
the degrees of freedom

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.870
of the environment.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.750
This was exactly
what we actually

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:36.070
did when we said the system
continues with probability P

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.480
naught in one state
and probability

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.810
P1 in the other state.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.620
The operation which lead
to this density matrix

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.060
was exactly the partial trace.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:57.385
So this is the second
general feature

00:35:57.385 --> 00:36:00.630
which we have to implement.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:05.510
Thirdly, if we could
do one and two exactly,

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.100
we would have an
exact formulation

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.220
for a small part
of a quantum system

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.030
no matter how complicated
the environment is.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:17.800
In practice, we can
solve the equations only

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.350
when we make
simplifying assumptions

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.740
about the environment.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:34.350
One is, it is large,
and more important,

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:42.010
therefore, it's unchanging, and
this is the Bohr approximation.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:47.080
And the second feature is,
it has a short correlation

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:55.690
time, tau c.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:58.160
In the beam splitter, I
have made the assumption

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.490
that there is no correlation
between different beam

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.460
splitters in the
derivation, which

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.240
I want to walk you through.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.130
Right now, you
will see explicitly

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:11.170
where the correlation
times enter.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.355
And this is called the
Markov approximation.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:26.920
And finally, this is number
four, the whole possibility

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:33.850
to derive a master
equation hinges on the fact

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:37.780
that we have different
time scales which

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.120
are very different.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:58.100
We are interested in the
evolution of our system.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.680
We want to know how it relaxes,
and this is on a time scale

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.700
1 over gamma.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.670
So we call this slow.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:13.130
We are interested
in the variation

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:18.100
of our system, the atomic
system or the photon state,

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.510
which passes through
the beam splitter,

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.270
and this time scale
has to be much slower

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.600
than the fluctuations
of the environment.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:45.440
So therefore, if the
environment has fluctuations,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.110
which in the beam
splitter model where

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.510
assumed to be 0, it was
delta function of time,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:55.880
if that correlation time is
much smaller than the time

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.480
it takes for the system
to relax and to evolve,

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:06.300
that opens a window
delta t, and this

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.370
is the time scale of
the master equation.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.650
Just to give you one example
for the spontaneous emission,

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.910
the correlation
time, tau c, would

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:27.920
be the time it takes the photon
to disappear from the atom.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.610
And the photon has
disappeared from the atom

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.140
when it is one wavelengths away.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.490
So typically, the
correlation time

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.330
f the vacuum for
spontaneous emission

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:44.070
is one cycle of the
optical frequency.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.840
It's very, very fast.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.490
Whereas typical decay times
of the excited states,

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.180
a nano second.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.400
It's six orders of
magnitude slower,

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.160
and this is what we describe.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.892
But on a time scale
of a femtosecond

00:39:58.892 --> 00:40:04.460
of one optical cycle, the photon
has not detached from the atom

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.980
and it could go actually
back to the atom.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.440
During that time, we talked
a little bit about it

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.770
when we did this diagrammatic
discussions of resonance

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.090
scattering for very,
very early times.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:21.130
You don't have exponential
decay because you cannot do

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:24.130
the approximations where
we approximated the kernel

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.860
by something which was
completely energy dependent.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.030
And so what happens
at such short times,

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:32.994
we encounter here again
in such short times,

00:40:32.994 --> 00:40:35.160
we will not have a simple
description of the system.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.120
So the last point,
let me summarize.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:57.310
Our goal is that we describe the
density matrix of the system,

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:00.420
and we want to find
the Liouville operator

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:04.470
or some matrix which acts on it.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:11.490
And because we will integrate
over time steps, which

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.910
are larger than the
correlation time of the system,

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:21.520
we can also call it, it will
be a coarse-grained evolution.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:30.400
Any questions about that?

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.550
I really like the discussion,
the derivation of the master

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:53.490
equation, how it is presented
in atom-photon indirection.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:57.230
But it is presented
on more than 50 pages

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.470
with many, many equations.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.640
So after giving you all
of the principles, all

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.030
of the concepts, I
want to go with you now

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:09.820
over those equations
and point out how

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.430
the principles, which we
encountered with the beam

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.120
splitter, how they
are now implemented

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.520
in a very general context.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.890
I will not be able to give you
all of the mathematical aspects

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:27.920
of it, but I think by now you
know that the book atom-photon

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.660
interactions are
actually wonderful.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.400
You can get a lot of conception
information out of it

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.150
by looking at the equations
without understanding

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.830
every technical detail.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:42.670
So I would really encourage
you, if there is something which

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.800
piques your interest and I
hope there will be things which

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.840
you'll find very interesting,
that you go to the book

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.070
and read it.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.950
So I'm exactly following
that actually I

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:53.960
used copies of the book.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.550
So we have a
Hamiltonian, which is

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.730
describing the atomic system.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.521
It describes the reservoir and
then there is an interaction.

00:43:06.521 --> 00:43:09.020
We keep it very general here,
but you may always think well,

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:13.340
the atom is your favorite
two-level system.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.350
The environment is
maybe the vacuum

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.030
with all its possible
modes, and the interaction

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:22.670
is the dipole interaction
or the a dot p interaction.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:41.060
So we start out
with an equation,

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.630
which is nothing else
than Schrodinger's

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:52.400
equation for the density matrix.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.360
The time derivation
of the density matrix

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.670
is commutative
with the Hamilton.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:01.320
But it is often useful and
you've seen it many times,

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.880
to go to the interaction
representation,

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:08.370
that the time dependence
due to the unperturbed part

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:12.810
of the operator is absorbed
in a unitary transformation,

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.850
so therefore, this density
matrix in the interaction

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:22.030
representation evolves not with,
h, because h naught is taken

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.396
care of, it only involves due
to the coupling between the two

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:27.395
systems, between the
system and the environment.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.580
So now this equation, we are
interested in a time step delta

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.000
t.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.700
And this time step,
delta t remember,

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.040
we want to coarse
grain, will be larger

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.230
than the correlation
time of the reservoir,

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.660
and you will see exactly
where it comes about.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.390
So we want to now do one of
those coarse-grain steps.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:57.180
We take this equation and
we integrate from time t

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.580
to time t plus delta t.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.560
So this is exact here.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:19.815
But now we want to iterate,
and that means the following.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.750
We have expressed the time
step in the density matrix

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.570
by having the
density matrix there.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:36.080
But now we can do in a
first-order perturbation

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:40.260
theory, we can do one step and
we get the second order result

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.640
by plugging the first order
result into this equation.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.490
It's the same we have seen
with our diagrams and such.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:49.950
We have an exact equation.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:53.090
It's useless unless we do
something, and what we do is,

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:56.630
we realize that
we can iterate it

00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:00.630
because the part we don't
know involves one more

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.840
occurrence of the
interaction potential.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.740
And when you plug the nth
order solution in here,

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.647
you get the n plus
first order solution.

00:46:07.647 --> 00:46:09.230
And this is exactly
what is done here.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.370
And I skipped a
few equations here.

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.990
This is what he's
done here, number one.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.160
And number two is, we are
interested in the system,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.380
not in the reservoir,
so therefore we

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.910
perform the trace
over the reservoir.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.920
And the trace of the reservoir
for the photon beam splitter

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:38.370
mend, we say we have
two possible states,

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.240
we detect a photon or not.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.540
And for the system, we
have now a density matrix

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:47.680
which is probability P naught
in one state, probability

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.750
P1 in the other state.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.590
And this is exactly what the
operator partial trace does.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.030
Remember also I want
to really make sure

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:59.190
that you recognize
all the structures.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:04.550
The time evolution of a density
matrix was a commutator with h,

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:08.350
but in the interaction picture,
it's a commutator with v.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:13.010
But since we are putting the
first order result in here,

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:16.610
the second order result
is now the commutator

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.910
of v with the
commutator of v and o.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:22.430
It's just we have
iterated one more time.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:40.290
So the sigma tilde, the
density matrix for our system,

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:43.470
tilde means in the
interaction picture

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:48.180
is now the partial
trace over the reservoir

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.570
of the total density matrix.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:52.630
Tilde means in the
interaction picture.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:01.840
And the important part
here is that it is exact.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.982
We have not done any
approximation here.

00:48:06.982 --> 00:48:07.565
Any questions?

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.510
Of course, now we have to
make approximations because we

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:31.870
cannot solve an interactive
problem exactly.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:37.080
The first one is-- and what
do we want to do in the end?

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.790
We want to keep the
first non-trivial term

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:44.910
but to the extent possible, we
want to factorize everything.

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:47.490
We want to get rid of the
entanglement of the environment

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:51.260
in the system and only get
sort of the minimum which

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.370
is provided by the coupling.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:55.790
So this evolves as follows.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:49:01.640
The interaction we assume is
a product of two operators.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.380
One operator acts on
the system, one operator

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.390
acts on the environment.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:10.115
So this could be the dipole
acting on the atom, the vacuum

00:49:10.115 --> 00:49:13.730
field, e, interacting
with the environment

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:16.160
or it could be p dot a.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.440
Or maybe your system has
a magnetic moment, m,

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:25.870
and the environment consists
of fluctuating magnetic fields.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:29.382
So we'll pretty much find
in every kind of measurement

00:49:29.382 --> 00:49:33.460
that a measurement involves
the product of two operators.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.700
One is an operator
for your system

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.200
and one is an operator for the
reservoir of the environment.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:50.600
And so this is one
thing we want to use,

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.700
and now there is one
thing which the moment we

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.390
will set in our equations,
there is one thing

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:01.560
which will naturally appear.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.414
Let me scroll back.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:10.520
What we have here is the
interaction operator, v,

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.240
at two different times.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.410
So this means if something
happens at different times

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:18.150
and we integrate over times.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:21.000
This is a correlation function,
a correlation function

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.360
between v at the time t prime
and the time t double prime

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:33.450
and since the reservoir
part of this interaction

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:37.690
is the operator, r, so
what we have here now is,

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:41.650
we have a correlation
between the operator, r,

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:46.220
at two times, which
characterizes the environment.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.690
And now comes an
important approximation.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:54.630
You remember I said we want to
assume that the environment has

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.600
a very short correlation time.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.150
Whenever a photon is emitted,
it appears dramatically fast.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.470
It disappears in
one optical cycle,

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.220
and the environment
is sort of reset,

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.500
it's back in the vacuum state.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.100
So this is now expressed here
that this product over which

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:17.120
we take the partial trace has
a very short coherence time.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.900
And the fact is
now the following.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:29.380
We are integrating over a
coarse-grained step delta t,

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:33.910
but this correlation function
goes to 0 in a very short time.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:39.810
So therefore it will
not contribute a lot.

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:40.900
Let me write that down.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.080
What we are going to approximate
is our total density matrix

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:08.870
is now approximately
factorizing in a density matrix

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.420
describing the atomic system.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.500
Well, we describe
the atomic system

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.570
when we trace out
the environment.

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:24.190
We describe the environment when
we trace out the atomic part.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:26.820
And if we now form
the direct product,

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.990
we are back to the
total system, but we

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:32.500
have factorized the total
density matrix into two parts.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:42.140
What we neglect here is a part
which cannot be factorized

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.700
which is the
correlated part of it.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:52.390
But what happens is, since we
are integrating over time steps

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:55.790
delta t and the
correlation decay

00:52:55.790 --> 00:53:00.920
in a very, very short
time, the result is

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:05.200
that this complicated part,
which we could never calculate,

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:12.230
is smaller than the first
part by the ratio of the time

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:16.590
where the correlations
contribute over the time delta

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:20.100
t, the time step we
are going to take.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.720
So this is a very
critical assumption.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.900
There is a whole page
or two in the book where

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.250
an photon-atom
interaction they discuss

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:34.270
the validity of this
assumption, but I've given you

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:38.810
the physical motivation that we
indicate over much larger time,

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:41.330
and if this time is large
and the correlation is

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:48.284
lost for short time,
they only contribute

00:53:48.284 --> 00:53:49.950
with this small
parameter to the result.

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:56.950
So in other words,
this means after-- we

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:59.750
have an interaction between
the environment and the system.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.690
We write it down
in second order,

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:07.080
but the second
order result is now

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:11.810
we evaluated by
factorizing the density

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:17.180
matrix into our system
in the reservoir.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.810
So that means in that sense
if you factorize something,

00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:21.550
it looks as if it's
not interacting,

00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:23.050
but the trick is the same.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:25.870
You write down something
to first and second order,

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:29.190
and once you have factored
out the important physics,

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.820
now you can evaluate
the expression

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:36.760
by using an approximation,
which is now the approximation

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.910
that the density
matrix factorizes.

00:54:51.850 --> 00:55:00.430
So with that, this
is the approximation

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:05.080
that we have made that the
correlation time is very short.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:09.170
And now we have a
differential equation

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:11.870
for the density matrix
sigma, which describes

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:12.960
or atomic system.

00:55:18.612 --> 00:55:21.170
We have traced out the
degrees of the reservoir.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.900
And now we want to insert B.17.

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.000
You probably don't
remember what B.17 is.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.950
It says that the
interaction operator

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:36.940
is a product of a, the
operator a for the atoms

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.130
and r for the reservoir.

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:44.280
So the reservoir part, tau
prime tau double prime,

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.340
gives a correlation function.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.690
This is the correlation
function between the operator,

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:54.290
r, at two different
times and the part

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:59.009
which acts on our system, the a
part, is explicitly kept here.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:07.510
So this is now a
general master equation.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:10.200
It tells us the time
evolution of the density

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:16.270
matrix in this form.

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.370
It looks very
complicated, but this

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:20.990
is because it's very general.

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:31.600
In order to bring it
into an easier form,

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:38.590
we want to now introduce a basis
of states, energy eigenstates

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.960
of the unperturbed
system, and write down

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:45.920
all of these operator into
such a basis of states.

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.080
But anyway you saw here how
we had an exact equation,

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.120
and the main
approximation we made

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.680
is that the operator
acting on the environment

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.460
has a very short
correlation time.

00:57:07.907 --> 00:57:08.490
Any questions?

00:57:11.676 --> 00:57:13.850
Well, you're only
a few minutes away

00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:17.040
from producing this result
to Fermi's golden rule, which

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.810
you have known for
a long, long time.

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:21.350
It's just we have made
very general assumptions.

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:25.770
You see sort of how the
assumptions propagate,

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:31.730
but now if you write it down
for an energy eigenbasis,

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:35.550
you will immediately see
results you have probably

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:39.310
known since your childhood.

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:41.330
So we want to have
energy eigenstates

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:42.940
of the atomic
operators, so this is

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.650
sort of ground and
excited state if you

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:48.060
think about a two-level system.

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:53.100
The previous equation,
I have to go back to it.

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.130
Our previous equation is
a differential equation

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:08.730
for the density matrix here,
and here is the density matrix.

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:12.340
So now we formulate
this equation

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:16.230
into an energy eigenbasis,
and what do we get?

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:18.850
Well, we get an equation
for the matrix elements,

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:21.290
and what matrix
elements are important?

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:24.160
diagonal matrix elements
which are population

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.870
of diagonal matrix elements
which are coherences.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.190
So we pretty much
take this equation,

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.800
use the energy
eigenbasis and look,

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.327
what do we get for
the populations

00:58:34.327 --> 00:58:35.910
and what do we get
for the coherences.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:57.140
So the structure is
now the following.

00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:59.860
That we have our
matrix elements ab.

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:09.030
There is one part which looks
like a unitary time evolution.

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:11.180
This is what comes from
the Hamilton operator.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:15.420
This is sort of the-- we'll
see that in a moment--

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:19.020
but this is the time
evolution without relaxation

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:21.330
and now we have
something here which

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:24.650
are generalized
relaxation coefficients.

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:26.960
And you will find if
you go further above

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.450
that those relaxation
coefficients are directly

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:34.440
related to the correlation
function of the reservoir.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:42.260
So we can now specify what
happens between populations.

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.580
Population means that we
have a differential equation,

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.770
let's say between
sigma aa the puller,

00:59:48.770 --> 01:00:01.410
and sigma cc, so we
have a rate coefficient

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:04.900
which connects the
population in state A

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:10.370
with the population in state C.

01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:14.910
And if you take this expression,
you find several things.

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:18.180
Well, you find
Fermi's golden rule,

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.510
in a generalized
way-- that's always

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:25.590
nice-- you find
Fermi's golden rule.

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:29.530
When you integrate over time,
you often get data function,

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:32.200
and you expect to get a
delta function because

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.040
of energy conservation.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.710
So you get that, of
course, naturally.

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:42.040
Secondly, we have second
order matrix element,

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.920
which you know from
Fermi's golden rule,

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.710
but now we have the
following situation

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:51.770
that the matrix element
in Fermi's golden rule

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:57.190
may actually depend on the
state, mu, of the environment.

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:59.360
So you have maybe 10
different possibilities

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.550
for the environment,
and Fermi's golden rule

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:03.610
gives you spontaneous
emission, which

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:05.810
is different for
those 10 states.

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:08.940
And naturally, since we have
performed the partial trace

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.000
over the environment,
we have all those rates

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.460
weighted with the probability
that the environment

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.850
is in one of those states.

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:20.560
So what you find here is
a simple generalization

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.950
of Fermi's golden rule.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:36.980
And if you look at the
off-diagonal matrix elements,

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.260
for instance, you
want to know what

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:44.540
is this rate, what is the rate
coefficient, which gives you

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:48.130
the time derivative
of the coherence,

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:51.360
and it's multiplied
with the coherence.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:56.640
You'll find now that in general,
this rate coefficient has

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.640
a damping term, but it may
also have an imaginary term.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.320
And I hope you remember when we
played with diagrams, that we

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.040
had something similar.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.300
There was something which we
called the radiative shift.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.800
I called it the AC stock
effect of a single photon,

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.170
and here it is a
level shift which

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:19.940
comes because the environment
interacts with your system

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.960
and it shifts the
levels a little bit.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.940
So in addition to
just relaxation,

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.950
spontaneous emission,
and damping,

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:29.940
there is also a dispersive
part, a level shift,

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:35.950
and it has exactly
the same structure.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:40.240
Let me add that delta
ab is the difference

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:46.470
between the shift of state
b and the shift of state a.

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:51.100
And those shifts have
exactly the same structure.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:55.010
You have to take the principle
part of something which

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:58.070
has 1 over the
difference of energies,

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:02.390
and we discussed that
this has to be understood

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:07.930
by somewhere adding an
infinitesimal imaginary part

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:10.120
and doing the right thing
with complex function.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.360
It's actually related to
Laplace time difference

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.590
between Laplace transformation
and Fourier transformation.

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:21.110
So anyway what I find
sort of beautiful

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.780
is that we started with
a most general situation.

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.400
We perform the partial trace.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.190
We made one assumption of
short correlation times,

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:31.880
and a lot of things we have
known about quantum system

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.310
just pops out in a
very general form here.

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.130
Any questions about so far?

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.160
Well, the coherences are,
of course, more interesting

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.140
than the population.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.780
Coherence is always something
physicists get excited about it

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.000
because it captures
something which goes often

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.200
beyond classical
system that we have

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.170
quantum mechanical coherences.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:14.610
And what happens is the
coefficient here, which

01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:18.700
provides the damping
of the coherence,

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.460
just comes out of the
formalism, has two parts.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:34.040
And one part is
an adiabatic part

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.090
and the other one is
a non-adiabatic part.

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:39.940
Well, and that makes sense.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.710
If you have two quantum
states and there

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:45.886
is a coherence, some
phase between the two,

01:04:45.886 --> 01:04:49.750
the phase can get lost if you
do a transition between the two

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:53.890
states or one state undergoes
a collision and is quenched.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:58.480
So you definitely have one
part which is due to the fact

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.760
that the quantum states
or the population

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.660
changes, and you find that there
is this state-changing part,

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.760
which is pretty much
the sum of all the rate

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.030
coefficient leading
out of state,

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:16.310
leading to the decay
of state a and leading

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:18.810
to the decay of state b.

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:21.560
In other words, if you have
a two-level system, which

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:29.510
has a coherence and you
have decay of the excited

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:31.640
state and decay of
the ground state,

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.430
you would expect that those
decay terms appear also

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:39.950
in the decay of the coherence
between the two levels

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:46.070
and they do, and they appear
with the correct factor of 1/2.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:49.580
But there is another possibility
and this is the following.

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:54.540
You can have no [INAUDIBLE] of
the population of the state,

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.450
but you can still
lose the coherence.

01:05:57.450 --> 01:05:59.360
The model you
should maybe make is

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.500
that you have spin
up, spin down.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.920
You are not perturbing
the populations

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.650
in spin up and spin
down, but the environment

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:09.930
provides fluctuating
magnetic field.

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:13.680
Then due to the
fluctuating magnetic field,

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.240
you no longer can keep
track of the phase,

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.430
and that means in
your identity matrix

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:21.150
the off-diagonal
matrix elements decay.

01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:25.670
And we find that here this
is the second part which

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:28.840
in this book is called
the adiabatic part,

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.090
and the physics behind it
is now pure de-phasing.

01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:37.880
So it's an independent
way for coherences

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:42.275
to decay independent of the
decay of the population.

01:06:56.374 --> 01:06:56.873
Questions?

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.400
Collin.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.700
AUDIENCE: Where does the
Markov approximation come in?

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.730
PROFESSOR: The Markov
approximation is, so to speak,

01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:10.040
the delta function
approximation,

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.740
which would say that-- I mean,
I introduced the correlation

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.710
function between the
reservoir operator

01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:20.320
and said the correlation time
tau c is very, very short.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.050
The Markov approximation
would actually

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:25.670
state that it would actually
say in a more radical way

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:29.360
the correlation time is 0.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.440
And the Bohr
approximation, the fact

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.940
that the reservoir
is unchanged came

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.190
in when we said
the total density

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:43.320
matrix for the second order
expression just factorizes.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.690
It factorizes into
the environment,

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.850
which is just this density
matrix of the environment.

01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:52.100
It's not changed by the
interaction with the system.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.820
And this is the
Bohr approximation.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:58.650
We just use the same expression
for the reservoir independent

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.610
of the measurements
the reservoir has done.

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:06.320
Other questions?

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:06.834
Yes, Nancy.

01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:07.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.020
PROFESSOR: This is
something very general.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.990
Thank you actually
for the question.

01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:30.140
Whenever we have some
damping of the population,

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:33.170
the coherence is only
damped with a factor of 1/2.

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:40.479
One way to explain it
in a very simple way

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:57.750
is, that if you have an
amplitude alpha excited

01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:06.260
and alpha ground, the
population in the excited state

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:09.180
is this squared.

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:13.470
So you sometimes make the
model that the amplitude decays

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:17.319
with gamma over 2,
but the population

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:22.290
is-- because you take the
product, decays with gamma.

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:27.580
So you would say alpha
e and alpha g both decay

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.200
with half the rate,
but the probability

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.689
is for the total rate,
and the coherence

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:37.109
is the product of
the amplitudes.

01:09:37.109 --> 01:09:39.750
So therefore when you
look at the coherence,

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:42.680
this decays with 1/2 gamma e.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.350
This decays with 1/2 gamma g,
and this is what you get here,

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:51.120
1/2 gamma in state a,
1/2 gamma in state b.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.160
Whereas the probability
to be in this state

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.370
decays with twice that because
the probability is squared.

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:03.190
So you find that pretty much
in any quantum mechanically

01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:05.420
corrects derivation,
which you do

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.515
about the decay of
population coherences.

01:10:26.654 --> 01:10:27.320
Other questions?

01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:33.590
So we have done two things.

01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:36.580
We have done the very,
very simple derivation

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:39.440
using the beam splitter
model where you may not even

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.680
notice where I did the Markov
approximation because I jumped

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.320
from beam splitter
to beam splitter

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.890
and left all the
correlations behind.

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:49.940
Here in the most
general calculation,

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.720
you have seen exactly
where it enters,

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.140
but maybe now you have the
full forest in front of you,

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.480
and you don't recognize
the trees anymore.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.910
So let me wrap up this
lecture by now focusing

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:06.550
on the system we want
to discuss further on,

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:13.930
namely a two-level system
interacting with a vacuum

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:15.690
through spontaneous emission.

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:19.590
But I also want to make
some generalizations.

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:27.040
I want to give you some
generalizations about what

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.385
kind of environments are
possible in quantum physics.

01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:38.480
Let me just see how I do that.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:45.960
So this part I actually owe to
Professor [? Ikschuan ?] who

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.430
wonderfully compiled that.

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:50.740
So what I want to
do now is, I want

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.640
to call your attention
to the operator

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.550
form which, is rather unique.

01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:01.680
Remember when we did second
order perturbation theory,

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:08.350
we had sort of the
commutator of v

01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:11.020
with the commutator
of v and rho.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:15.670
This came from iterating
the exact equation of motion

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:17.890
for the density matrix.

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:21.567
And you want to specialize that
now to Jaynes-Cummings model.

01:12:21.567 --> 01:12:23.400
I mean, in the end, at
least in this course,

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.400
we always come back to
the Jaynes-Cummings model

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:29.360
because it captures a lot
of what we want to explore.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:33.120
So the Jaynes-Cummings model in
the rotating wave approximation

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.360
is very simple.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.160
It raises the atom from
ground to excited state

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.680
and destroys a photon,
or it does the opposite.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:45.280
So this is our
simple interaction

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.390
between our system,
the two-level atom

01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:53.210
and our reservoir which is just
the vacuum of all the modes.

01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:56.680
And you, again, recognize
what I said in general.

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.380
You usually always
find it by linear form,

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:02.580
an operator which
acts on the modes,

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.770
on the reservoir on the
vacuum, and an operator which

01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:06.628
acts on the vacuum.

01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:13.990
Now, we want to make
the explicit assumption

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:18.291
that the initial state of the
reservoir is the vacuum state.

01:13:18.291 --> 01:13:18.790
It's empty.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.755
And I want to show you
what is the structure

01:13:25.755 --> 01:13:29.540
of the operators we obtain.

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:32.600
And so if you put
v into here, you

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.100
have first the commutator with
rho, which I write down here,

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:40.790
and then we have to take
another commutator with v.

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:47.680
And the result of
that is the following,

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.090
that when it comes
to relaxation pauses,

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.940
based on the general
structure of the time

01:13:55.940 --> 01:14:01.450
evolution of quantum mechanics,
we have this double commutator.

01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:16.180
And the operator which, couples
our system to the environment

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.740
is erasing and
lower an operator.

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.560
I mean, the atom because it
interacts with the environment

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.820
either absolves the photon
or emits the photon.

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:29.420
But those operators, sigma
plus and sigma minus,

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:34.100
appear now always as
products because we

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.860
have two occurrences
of the interaction,

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:41.410
v. But if you look at the
double commutator structure,

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:44.790
the operator sigma plus
sigma minus appears.

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:46.370
This is just the
general structure

01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:48.900
of this double
commutator appears

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.930
to the left side of the
atomic density matrix

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:54.390
to the right side of the
atomic density matrix

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:57.430
and then there is the coarse
term where the atomic density

01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:59.210
matrix is in the
middle of the two.

01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:11.770
So this is actually
something which

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:15.540
is very general
and very important

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:19.550
in the theory of
open quantum system.

01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:26.050
What I'm discussing with you now
is this famous Lindblad form.

01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:30.030
And the story goes like that.

01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:34.960
You want to know what are
possible environments, not just

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.587
empty vacuum.

01:15:35.587 --> 01:15:36.920
You can have fluctuating fields.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.320
You can have, you name it.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.470
But if you are saying that
your environment interacts

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:47.330
with your system
through an operator,

01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:53.130
and our operator is now the
operator sigma minus, which

01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:58.800
is a spontaneous emission,
you need heavy t.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.740
The mathematical structure
of a valid quantum field

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:06.490
remains that if your system
interacts with an environment

01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:09.280
by emitting a
photon sigma minus,

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.050
this is now the structure
of the master equation.

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:16.910
This is the structure of the
time evolution of the density

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:17.730
matrix.

01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:21.120
So the operator
sigma minus and its

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.920
and its Hermitian conjugate
sigma plus, all of this

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.330
have to appear in
this combination.

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:28.830
Yes, Collin.

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:31.716
AUDIENCE: This is still
in my interaction picture.

01:16:31.716 --> 01:16:32.216
Right?

01:16:32.216 --> 01:16:34.696
There's no dynamical
phase evolution

01:16:34.696 --> 01:16:38.144
that we put back in there.

01:16:38.144 --> 01:16:38.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:39.570
OK.

01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:43.460
What we do in general if the
system is driven by a laser

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.230
beam, for instance,
Rabi oscillation,

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:49.460
we simply add up the dynamics
of the Rabi oscillation

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:54.294
of the unitary time evolution
to the time evolution

01:16:54.294 --> 01:16:55.210
done by the reservoir.

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:58.654
AUDIENCE: So this form is always
in the interaction picture?

01:16:58.654 --> 01:17:00.340
PROFESSOR: Well, this
is, you would say,

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.540
this form is what is
the relaxation provided

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:05.890
by the environment.

01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:07.980
And if you drive the
system in addition

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:11.450
with the coherent field,
unitary time evolution,

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:15.250
you would add it to it.

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:17.970
So in other words,
what I'm telling

01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:21.340
you here is that this is
the general structure,

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:23.400
and if you have a
system which interacts

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.180
with an environment in
five different ways,

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.090
with a dipole wand, with a
magnetic moment and such,

01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:32.320
you have maybe five
interaction terms

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.920
and then you have to perform
the sum over five operators,

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.150
and here one of them is
a sigma minus operator.

01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:42.410
So in other words,
if you want to know

01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:46.550
what is the whole world of
possibilities for quantum

01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:49.950
system to relax and dissipate
with an environment,

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:52.610
you can pretty much
take any operator which

01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:55.990
acts on your system,
but then put it

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:59.060
into this so-called
Lindblad form

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.380
and you have a
possible environment.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.410
And I mentioned
I think last week

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:11.060
that people are now in
our field actively working

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.260
on environmental engineering.

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:16.870
They want to expose a system
to an artificial environment

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:20.070
and hope the system is
not relaxing, let's say,

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:23.690
to a broken ground state, but
to a fancy correlated state.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:32.160
So what this Lindblad form,
if the operators appears

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:37.770
in this way, what it
insures is the following.

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:40.800
Just imagine if we
have an equation,

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.020
a derivative of
the density matrix,

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.310
which depends on
the density matrix,

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:48.080
you could write down a
differential equation and say

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.430
is it possible?

01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:52.240
Well, it has to be consistent
with quantum physics.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.980
You have certain requirements.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:58.660
One requirement is that
rho, the density matrix,

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:01.870
always has to be
the density matrix.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.270
The trace equal 1
has to be conserved.

01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:09.190
A density matrix always must
have non-negative eigenvalues,

01:19:09.190 --> 01:19:10.740
otherwise, what
you write down, it

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.200
might be a nice differential
equation, but quantum

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.290
mechanically, it's nonsense.

01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:20.940
But now there is one more
thing, which is also necessary.

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:26.380
This time evolution of the
system's density matrix

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:31.370
must come from a unitary time
evolution of a bigger system.

01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:35.190
So you must be able to extend
your system into a bigger

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:36.890
system, which is
now the environment,

01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:40.710
and this whole system must
follow a Schrodinger equation

01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:43.760
with a Hamilton as a
unitary time evolution.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.030
And this is where
it's restrictive.

01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:49.050
You cannot just write down a
differential equation and hope

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:51.140
that this will fill
some requirement,

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:56.350
and what people have shown is
under very general assumptions,

01:19:56.350 --> 01:20:01.320
it is the Lindblad form
which allows for it.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.360
So some operator always
has to appear in this form.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:13.310
So often in this
Lindblad form, you

01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:18.070
have an operator, which is
called a jump operator, which

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:20.390
is responsible for
the measurement, which

01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:22.610
the environment
does on your system.

01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:24.820
The jump operator is
here, the operator

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.740
which takes the atom from the
excited to the ground state.

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:32.480
With that you need a photon,
and the photon can be measured.

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:37.910
So often you can describe a
system by a jump operator,

01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:41.130
and if the jump operator is
put into this Lindblad form,

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:49.760
then you have a valid master
equation for your system.

01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:53.610
So let me wrap up.

01:21:05.924 --> 01:21:10.320
If you take now the definition
of the raising and lowering

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.540
operator, and you take the
form I showed you, the Lindblad

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:21.052
form, you'll find now
this differential equation

01:21:21.052 --> 01:21:22.135
for your two-level system.

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.930
And this is one part of
the Optical Bloch Equation.

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:30.420
Now, coming to
Collin's question,

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:32.280
if you include
the time evolution

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.600
of the classical field,
this is a coherent evolution

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.610
of the Bloch vector,
which I showed

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:39.790
at the beginning of
the class, and we

01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:44.620
add this and what I wrote down
at the beginning of the class.

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:48.792
Then we find the famous
Optical Bloch Equations

01:21:48.792 --> 01:21:50.000
in the Jaynes-Cummings model.

01:21:55.610 --> 01:22:00.730
So these are now the
Optical Bloch Equations,

01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:03.760
and I hope you enjoy now after
this complicated discussion,

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.910
how simple they are.

01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:07.700
And it is this simple
set of equations,

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.650
which will be used in
the rest of the course

01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:13.480
to describe the time
evolution of the system.

01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:22.630
Just because I did
some generalizations

01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:26.020
about the Lindblad equation,
I copied that into the lecture

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.230
notes from Wikipedia,
and probably now you

01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:33.680
sort of understand what is the
most general Lindblad equation.

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.760
It has a Hamiltonian
part and then it

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:41.070
has jump operators like
you sigma minus operator,

01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:45.100
but it has to come in
the form that the jump

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:49.130
operator and its complex
conjugate, emission. conjugate,

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:53.310
is on the left side, on the
right side, and left and right

01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:55.130
of your density matrix.

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:57.210
So this is the generalization
I've mentioned.

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.720
Yeah. with that I think with
that we've derived the master

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.250
equation, and on
Wednesday, we will

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:13.270
look at rather simple solutions,
transient and steady-state

01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:16.830
solution of the
Optical Bloch Equation.

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:20.110
Any questions?

01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:22.410
One reminder about the
schedule, this week

01:23:22.410 --> 01:23:25.300
we have a lecture on
Friday because I will not

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.120
be on town next
week on Wednesday.

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.700
And of course, you know today
in a week, next week on Monday.

01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:32.890
It's [INAUDIBLE] day.

01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:35.260
So we have three
classes this week,

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.890
no class the following week,
and then the normal schedule

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:41.040
for the rest of the semester.

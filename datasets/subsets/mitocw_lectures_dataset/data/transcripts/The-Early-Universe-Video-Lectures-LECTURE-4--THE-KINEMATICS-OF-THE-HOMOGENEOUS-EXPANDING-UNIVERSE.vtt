00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.880
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.370
I think it's time
for us to start.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.590
Last time we talked about the
Doppler shift and a little bit

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.350
of special relativity.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.480
Today we'll be going on to talk
more about cosmological topics.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.190
We'll be talking
about kinematically

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.240
how one describes a
homogeneously-expanding

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.950
universe like the
one that we think

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.510
we're living to a very
good approximation.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.670
In that case, let's get started.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.920
What I want to do today
is talk about some

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.720
of the basic descriptive
properties of the universe

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.100
as we will describe it.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.360
The universe is, of course,
a very complicated place.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.065
It includes you and
me, for example,

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:09.590
and we're pretty
complicated structures.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.630
But cosmology is not really
the study of all that.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.890
Cosmology is the study of
the universe in the large,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.260
and we'll begin by discussing
the universe on its largest

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.450
scales in which you view
approximated by a very

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.570
simple model, which
we'll be learning about.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.645
So in particular on
very large scales,

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:33.270
the universe is pretty well
described by threes properties,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.360
which we will talk
about one by one.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.490
The first is isotropy,
and that just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.230
comes from some
Greek root, which

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.735
means the same in
all directions.

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:05.830
Now, of course, as we look
around say the room here,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.640
the room doesn't look the
same in all directions.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.009
The front of the room looks
different from the back

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.190
of the room.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.080
And looking towards
Mass Ave looks

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.550
different from looking
towards the river,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.940
and looking further
out into space,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.370
looking towards the
Virgo cluster, which

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.842
is the center of our
local super cluster,

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.300
looks rather
different from looking

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.870
in the opposite direction.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.970
But when one gets out
to looking at things

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.600
on the very large scale
where in this case very large

00:02:32.600 --> 00:03:00.390
means on the scale of a few
hundred million light years,

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.610
things begin to
look very isotropic.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.140
That is no matter what
direction you look,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.550
as long as you're averaging
over these very large scales,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.100
you find that you see
pretty much the same thing.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.730
This becomes most
emphatic when one looks

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.730
at the cosmic background
radiation, which is really

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.660
the furthest object
that we can look at.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.540
It's radiation that was admitted
shortly after the Big Bang.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.720
The history of the cosmic
background radiation

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.170
in a nutshell is worth
keeping in mind here.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.685
I'll refer to it as the CMB for
cosmic microwave background.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.970
And in a nutshell, the
things to keep in mind

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.020
in thinking about
this history is

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:17.620
that until about 400,000
years after the beginning,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.200
the universe was a
plasma, or maybe I

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200
should say more accurately
that the universe was

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.290
filled with plasma.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.690
And within a plasma, photons
essentially go nowhere.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.870
They're constantly moving
at the speed of light,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.490
but they have a very large
cross section for scattering off

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.530
of the free electrons
that fill the plasma.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.050
And that means that the
photons are constantly

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.660
changing directions and the net
progress in any one direction

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.490
is negligible.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.754
So the photons are
frozen with the matter,

00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:19.660
I'll say frozen inside
the matter, which

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.480
means that the net velocity
relative to this plasma

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.550
is essentially zero.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.230
But according to
our calculations,

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.720
and we'll learn later how
to do these calculations,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.900
at about 400,000 years
after the Big Bang,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.470
the universe cooled enough
so that it neutralized

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.680
and then it became a neutral
gas like the air in this room.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.055
And the air in
this room you know

00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:43.370
this is very
transparent to photons,

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.700
and that means that light
travels from my face

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.895
to your eyes on straight
lines and allows

00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:51.100
you to see an image of what my
face looks like and vice versa,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.020
by the way.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.810
And it's a little dicey
to extrapolate something

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.419
from the room to the universe.

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.210
The orders of magnitude
are very different.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.793
But in this case,
the physics actually

00:06:02.793 --> 00:06:04.440
ends up being exactly the same.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.190
Once the universe becomes
filled with a neutral gas,

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.260
it really does become
transparent to the photons

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.810
of the cosmic
microwave background.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.150
So these photons have for
the most part been travelling

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.670
on perfectly-straight lines
since 400,000 years after

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.360
the Big Bang.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.530
And that means that
when we see them today,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.620
we are essentially
seeing an image of what

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.262
the universe looks like at
400,000 years after the Big

00:06:32.262 --> 00:06:32.762
Bang.

00:06:36.538 --> 00:06:57.120
So at 400,000 years,
gas neutralized

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.970
and became transparent.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.090
This by the way has a
name, which is universally

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.924
what is called in
cosmology, nobody actually

00:07:22.924 --> 00:07:24.798
understands why it's
called this, by the way,

00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:26.116
but the name is recombination.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.130
And the mystery is what
the re is doing there

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.550
because as far as we
know, the gas is combining

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.130
for the first time in
the history of universe,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.720
but that's otherwise
what everybody calls it.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.290
I did actually once
ask Jim Peebles who

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.754
might be the person who first
called it this why it was

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:53.295
called this, and he
told me that this

00:07:53.295 --> 00:07:54.990
is what the plasma
physicists called it,

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.565
so it was natural to just
pick up the same word

00:07:57.565 --> 00:07:59.840
when he was doing
cosmology, so maybe

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.256
that's how the word originated.

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:02.880
But coming from the
point of cosmology,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.010
it is a misnomer in
that for the theory

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.380
that we're discussing
the prefix re here

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.140
has absolutely no
business being there.

00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:15.730
So what do we see when we
look at the cosmic microwave

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.540
background?

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.900
We see that it is
unbelievably isotropic.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:28.865
What we find is that
there are deviations

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:30.365
in the temperature
of the radiation.

00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:33.900
The intensity is measured
as an effective temperature.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.670
There are deviations in the
temperature of the radiation

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:43.520
of a fractional amount of
about 10 to the minus 3,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.430
which is a very small
number, but it's

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.260
even stronger than that.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.370
This deviation of one
part in 10 to the 3

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.565
has a particular
angular pattern,

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:55.480
and it's not the
angular pattern that you

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.770
would expect if the
source system were moving

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.330
through the cosmic
microwave background,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.180
and that's how we interpret
this 10 to the minus 3 effect.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:19.026
Motion of solar system
through the CMB.

00:09:24.305 --> 00:09:33.760
And after removing the
effect of the motion.

00:09:37.814 --> 00:09:39.230
Now actually when
we move it, it's

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.580
not like we have an independent
way of measuring it.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.180
We don't really, not
to enough accuracy.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.920
So we're really just fitting
it to the data and removing it.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.480
But when we do the
split to the data,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.210
it's a three-parameter
fit, that is,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.235
we have three components
of a velocity to fit.

00:09:53.235 --> 00:09:55.320
We have a whole angular
pattern on the sky,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.754
and we only have three
numbers to play with.

00:09:57.754 --> 00:09:59.670
So it's strongly constrained
even though we're

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.980
using the data
itself to determine

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.240
what we think our
velocity is relative

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.590
to the cosmic
microwave background.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.290
And after removing
it, then what we find

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.620
is that the residual
deviations, delta t over t,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.985
are only at the level of
about 10 to the minus 5,

00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:22.170
1 part in 100,000, which
is really unbelievably

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.370
isotropic, unbelievably uniform.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.140
One time I decided
to think about how

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.505
round that is, how much
the same in all directions

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:35.890
it is by asking
myself the question,

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.920
is it possible to
grind a marble that

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.187
would be spherical to an
accuracy of 10 to the minus 5.

00:10:43.187 --> 00:10:44.770
And you can think
about that yourself.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.610
The answer I came up with was
that yes it is, but it really

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.340
strains the limits
of our technology.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.410
It correspond to sort
of the best technology

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.470
we have for building
highly-precise lenses

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:59.890
basically fractions of
a wavelength of light.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.320
So to round to 1
part in 10 to the 5

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.657
is really being unbelievable
round, unbelievably isotropic.

00:11:06.657 --> 00:11:08.240
And that's the way
the universe looks.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:16.175
Next item in our description
of the universe is homogeneity.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.860
Homogeneity is harder
to test with precision

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.410
because it means
looking out into space

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.210
and trying to see, for example,
if the density of galaxies

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.782
is uniform as a
function of distance.

00:11:40.782 --> 00:11:42.990
We always talked about as
a function of angle, that's

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.683
isotropy, and it's
very uniform where

00:11:46.683 --> 00:11:48.510
one could make very
precise statements

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.020
about the cosmic
microwave background.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.120
But to talk about
homogeneity, one

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.150
has to be able to talk about how
the galaxy distribution varies

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.920
with distance, and
distances are very

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.060
hard to measure cosmologically.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.230
So as far as we could
tell, the universe

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.920
is perfectly compatible with
being homogeneous, again,

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.630
on length scales of a few
hundred million light years,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.550
but it's hard to make any
very precise statement.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.290
There is, of course,
relationships

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.860
between isotropy
and homogeneity.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.735
Homogeneity, by the way
I didn't define that.

00:12:23.735 --> 00:12:25.109
I assumed you know
what it meant,

00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:27.110
but I should
definitely define it.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.280
Isotropy means the
same in all directions.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.060
Homogeneity means the
same at all places.

00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:41.870
So sometimes these are just put
together and called uniformity

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.590
because they are very
similar concepts.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.980
They are, however, distinct
concepts logically,

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.720
and it is worth spending a
little time understanding

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.760
how they connect to each
other, in particular

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.290
how you can have one without
the other is the best way

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.470
to understand what
they individually mean.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.220
So suppose, for example,
we had a universe

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.390
that was homogeneous
but not isotropic.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.590
Is that possible,
and if so, what

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.630
would be an example
of a feature that

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.810
would be described that way?

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.810
Let me throw it out to you.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.750
We want to be homogeneous,
but not isotropic.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.250
Yes.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.363
AUDIENCE: It would be parallel
universes like a cylinder

00:13:25.363 --> 00:13:27.998
pointing in a z
direction, and I mean,

00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:29.914
matter is all homogeneous
with a cylinder

00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:32.310
but there is preferred
directions for isotropic.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.893
PROFESSOR: A preferred
direction fixed

00:13:33.893 --> 00:13:35.580
by the direction
of the periodicity?

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.470
That is an example.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.259
That's right.

00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:37.800
That's right.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.640
Let me ask if there are other
examples people could think of.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.140
Yes.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.080
AUDIENCE: There are
galaxies everywhere

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.343
with constant density,
but they're all

00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:51.970
aligned in a
particular direction.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.720
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.261
That's right.

00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:55.850
Galaxies have a
shape, in particular

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.269
they have an angular momentum.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.810
The angular momentum
could be a line,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.300
and that would be an
example of a universe that

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.350
would be homogeneous
but not isotropic.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.870
Very good.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.660
Very good.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.310
Another example that I'll just
throw out, which I think maybe

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.590
is simple to think about
is the universe is filled

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.330
with this cosmic microwave
background radiation.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.440
suppose all the photons
going in the z direction

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.670
were more energetic
than the ones

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.961
going in the x and y direction.

00:14:18.961 --> 00:14:21.229
That would be a
possible situation

00:14:21.229 --> 00:14:22.770
that could be
completely homogeneous,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.230
but would be an example of
something that would not

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.445
be isotropic.

00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:28.445
So there are many examples
you can come up with.

00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:30.632
I'm very glad you came
up with the ones you did.

00:14:30.632 --> 00:14:32.330
That's great.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.794
Going the other way it's harder.

00:14:34.794 --> 00:14:36.710
Suppose we try to think
of the universe that's

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.686
isotropic but not homogeneous.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.560
Isotropic, by the way, does
depend on the observer, so

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.320
let's first talk about
isotropic relative to us.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.440
I was just going to say
imagining a universe that

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.070
would be isotropic
relevant to us,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.369
but would not be homogeneous.

00:14:53.369 --> 00:14:53.868
Yes.

00:14:53.868 --> 00:14:56.520
AUDIENCE: Could it be like
if we lived in some shell.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.520
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.085
A shell structure.

00:14:58.085 --> 00:14:59.676
AUDIENCE: In all direction,
the shell would be there.

00:14:59.676 --> 00:15:00.900
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.500
That's right.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.416
I think I'll even draw
that on the blackboard.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:18.223
Example of isotropy
without homogeneity.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:28.290
So we would be
here, and the matter

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.390
could be distributed in a
perfectly spherically-symmetric

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.320
distribution with
us at the center.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.095
And that would be an
example of something

00:15:36.095 --> 00:15:41.050
that would be isotopic to
us but not homogeneous.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.450
Now, things like
that, of course,

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.140
are considered weird because
we don't think of ourselves

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.080
as living in any special
place in the universe,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.790
and that's basically what
the Copernican Revolution was

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:51.850
all about.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.810
And the Copernican Revolution
is sunken very deeply

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.390
into the psychology
of scientists.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.730
So I think scientists would
be very loathed to imagine

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.680
the universe that
look like this,

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.480
but it does help to understand
what these words mean.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.370
If a universe is going to be
isotropic to all observers,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.400
then it does have
to be homogeneous,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.912
and that's part
of the reason why

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:21.120
we're pretty confident that
our universe is basically

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.380
homogeneous, because we just
decided that's isotropic to us,

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.890
and we decide we're
not special then it

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.959
has to be isotropic to
everybody and then it

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:30.875
has to be homogeneous.

00:16:37.262 --> 00:16:58.350
If the universe is
isotropic to all observers,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:10.596
it is homogeneous

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:11.970
Now, a thought
which I will leave

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.980
for you to think about between
now and the next lecture

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.190
is whether or not really
knowing that a universe is

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.027
isotropic with respect
to two observers

00:17:21.027 --> 00:17:22.735
is enough to prove
that it's homogeneous.

00:17:25.032 --> 00:17:26.865
That turned out to be
a more subtle question

00:17:26.865 --> 00:17:28.339
than it might sound.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.300
I don't know if it
sounds subtle or not.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.820
I should maybe just tell you
basically what the answer is

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.760
and then you can try to think if
you can understand the answer.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.890
In the Euclidean space, isotropy
about two distinct observers

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.096
is enough to make
it homogeneous,

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:46.617
which is kind of
what you visualize.

00:17:46.617 --> 00:17:48.200
But if you can allow
yourself to think

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.679
about non-Euclidean
spaces, and I

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:51.720
know we haven't talked
about non-Euclidean spaces

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.950
yet so you might not have in the
way of tools to think about it.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.994
But think, for example, about
surfaces in three dimensions.

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.410
Surfaces are very
good examples of

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.310
non-Euclidean
two-dimensional geometries.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.580
And see if you can invent a
two-dimensional geometry that

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.330
would be isotropic
about two points,

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.800
but would not be homogeneous.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.670
So that's your thought
assignment for next time,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.596
not to be handed in just to
be talked about in the lecture

00:18:19.596 --> 00:18:22.230
next time.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:28.610
So isotropy and homogeneity are
two of the key properties that

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:34.180
define the simplicity of our
universe on very large scales.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.220
The next thing I
want to talk about

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.390
is the expansion of the
universe, which is basically

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.240
characterized by Hubble's law.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.490
Last time I think
I said I was going

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.948
to call it the
Lemaitre-Hubble law.

00:18:59.948 --> 00:19:01.950
I decided I'll probably
call it Hubble's law.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.370
Now, Hubble, I
think, really does

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.840
deserve credit for
demonstrating observations

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.164
that the law is true,
and that's really

00:19:08.164 --> 00:19:10.080
what he is getting credit
for and that was not

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.530
believed until he discovered it.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.540
So it really did have
a tremendous effect

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.362
on the course of cosmology.

00:19:17.362 --> 00:19:21.140
So Hubble's law says that
on average all galaxies

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.640
are receding from us
with a velocity which

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.320
is equal to a constant, H,
called the Hubble constant--

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.770
Hubble called it K,
by the way, capital

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:37.070
K-- times the distance
to the Galaxy, r.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.110
And so it's not true
exactly for our universe,

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.460
but it's true in
some average sense,

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.300
just as isotropy
and homogeneity are,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.090
we're only true on
an average sense.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.170
I want to tell you about the
units in which it's measured

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.910
and that leads me to the parsec.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.320
Let me write this on the board.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:06.260
But astronomers always
measure the Hubble constant

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.810
or I will sometimes call
it the Hubble expansion

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:22.483
rate in kilometers per
second per megaparsec.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.660
And it's a relationship between
a velocity and distance,

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.330
so kilometers per
second is velocity

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.530
and velocity per
megaparsec is the velocity

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.007
per distance, which
is what it should be.

00:20:38.007 --> 00:20:39.465
Notice, however,
that I wrote that.

00:20:39.465 --> 00:20:42.760
A kilometer and a megaparsec
are both units of distance.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.400
So they actually just
have some fixed ratio.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.510
So in the end, this
Hubble constant really

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.535
is just an inverse
time, and obviously,

00:20:50.535 --> 00:20:52.740
if you multiply an inverse
time times the distance

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.900
you get a distance per
time, which is the velocity,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.940
so that works.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.660
But it's very seldom quoted
as simply an inverse time,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.340
instead it's quoted by the units
that astronomers like to use.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.390
They measure velocities
as a normal person would

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.510
in kilometers per
second, but they

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.956
measure distances
in megaparsecs,

00:21:13.956 --> 00:21:16.980
where a megaparsec
is a million parsecs,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.095
and a parsec is defined
by that diagram.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.380
The base of this triangle
is one astronomical unit,

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.340
the mean distance between
the Earth the sun.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:35.540
And the distance at
which the angles attended

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.820
by one astronomical unit
is one second of arc

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.960
is what's called a parsec
and abbreviated pc.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.940
And a parsec is about
three light years.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.840
I'll write these
things on the board.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:22:04.990
One parsec equals
3.2616 light years,

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.970
and a megaparsec is
a million of those.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.600
Another useful number to
keep in mind for converting,

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.500
if you want to think
of H as inverse years,

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:33.290
then the useful equality is
that 1 over 10 to the 10 years

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:41.560
is equal to 97.8, and it's
suitable to remember this

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.560
as being 100-- you can look up
the exact number when you need

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:54.510
it-- and these funny things
kilometers per second

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.625
per megaparsec.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.500
So what is the value
of Hubble's constant?

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:17.260
It actually has a
very interesting and

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.750
historically-significant
history.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.180
It was first measured in
this paper by George Lemaitre

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.620
and in 1927, published
only in French

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:31.700
and ignored by the rest of
world, at the time at least.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.850
It got discovered later.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.460
And Lemaitre was
not an astronomer.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.470
He was a theoretical
cosmologist.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.150
I mentioned a few times I
think he had a PhD from MIT

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.740
in theoretical cosmology
in physics, in principle.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.290
And the value that he got based
on looking at other people's

00:23:52.290 --> 00:24:14.500
data, in 1927, had the
value of-- I guess actually,

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.910
I'll give you the range.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.140
He gave two different
methods of calculating it.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.260
We've got two slightly
different answers.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:28.192
So we had 575 to 625 of these
[INAUDIBLE] units kilometers

00:24:28.192 --> 00:24:29.275
per second per megaparsec.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:43.120
And two years later
in his famous paper

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:53.302
"Hubble," got the
value of 500 kilometers

00:24:53.302 --> 00:24:54.385
per second per megaparsec.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.986
I have a picture of Hubble too.

00:24:59.986 --> 00:25:00.486
Yes.

00:25:00.486 --> 00:25:04.101
AUDIENCE: That last in
the board right there

00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:11.537
where you have 1 over 10 to
the 10 amperes, is that H?

00:25:11.537 --> 00:25:13.370
PROFESSOR: That's just
an equality of units.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.670
AUDIENCE: Quality of units.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.900
PROFESSOR: That's just
the unit equality.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.930
It's relevant to H, because
H is measured in those units.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:25.060
But it really is just
an equality of units.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.110
1 over 10 to the 10th years
has units of inverse time,

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.820
and kilometers per
second per megaparsec

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.850
has units of inverse time
also because kilometers

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.940
is distance and megaparsec
is inverse distance.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.860
So both sides have the same
units and the same dimensions,

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.500
I should say, and it's
just two different ways

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.620
of measuring the same
thing, inverse times.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.560
So in 1929, Hubble
published his famous paper

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.750
which he got the value
of 500, and there's

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.317
an important difference really
between the papers by Lemaitre

00:25:56.317 --> 00:25:56.820
and Hubble.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.410
First of all, Hubble was
using largely his own data.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.430
Lemaitre was using other
people's data mostly

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.210
Hubble's actually.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.510
And furthermore,
Hubble made the claim

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:12.010
that the data justified
the relationship

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.940
that v is equal to
a constant times r.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.150
Lemaitre knew that
relation theoretically

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.170
for a uniformly-expanding
universe,

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.000
which we'll be
talking about shortly.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.710
But he did not claim to be
able to get it from the data.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.260
The data he had he decided
was not strong enough

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.840
to reach that
conclusion, but he was

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.550
still able to get a value for H
by taking the average velocity

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:42.470
dividing it by the average
distance and got a number.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.290
I think I have
Hubble's data next.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.860
Yeah, here's Hubble's data.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.160
The data obviously
was not very good.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.580
It only goes up to about 1,000.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.130
One curiosity of this
graph that you might notice

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.940
is that the vertical axis
is a velocity meaning

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.390
it should be measured in
kilometers per second,

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:08.210
but nonetheless Hubble
wrote it as kilometers.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.164
Not getting his units right,
so minus 10 or something

00:27:11.164 --> 00:27:15.880
like that on the graded sheet.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.646
But somehow it did
not stop the paper

00:27:17.646 --> 00:27:20.020
from getting published in the
proceedings of the National

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.930
Academy of Sciences
and had become,

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:27.420
of course, a
monumentally-famous paper.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.240
But you can see that
the data is scattered,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.230
and it has those nice
lines drawn through which

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.640
guide your eye, but if you
imagine taking away the lines,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.350
it's not that clear
on the data itself

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.790
that it really is a
linear relationship.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.139
But it's suggested,
at least, and Hubble

00:27:44.139 --> 00:27:46.180
thought it was pretty
convincing and later Hubble

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.845
gathered more data
for this project,

00:27:48.845 --> 00:27:50.720
and it did become quite
convincing that there

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.040
is a linear relationship,
and today there's

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.930
no doubt that there is a linear
relationship between velocity

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:57.929
and distance.

00:27:57.929 --> 00:27:59.720
At very large distances
there's deviations,

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.450
which we can
understand and we'll

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:06.100
be talking about later,
but basically, at least

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.821
for moderate distances, one
has this linear relationship.

00:28:10.821 --> 00:28:13.070
I should mention that the
velocity of the solar system

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.660
through the CMB is also the
velocity of the solar system

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.840
through this pattern
of Hubble expansion,

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.560
and both Hubble and Lemaitre
had to make estimates

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.230
of the velocity of
the solar system

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.705
relative to these galaxies
and subtract that out

00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:27.950
to get things that
resemble a straight line.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.900
Lemaitre estimated the
velocity of our solar system

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:39.290
as 300 kilometers per second,
and Hubble estimated it

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.204
as 280 kilometers per second.

00:28:41.204 --> 00:28:43.120
So it was a relevant
feature because remember,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.298
the maximum velocity there
is only 1,000 kilometers

00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:48.126
per second, so the correction
that he's putting in

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:51.350
is about a third of the
maximum velocity seen.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.744
So it's a very important and not
that it was easy to determine.

00:28:55.744 --> 00:28:57.712
AUDIENCE: What were
they using to determine

00:28:57.712 --> 00:28:58.696
the [INAUDIBLE] CMB?

00:28:58.696 --> 00:29:00.370
PROFESSOR: I think
they were just

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.520
looking for what
they could assume

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.640
that would make the
average expansion

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.936
in all directions
about the same.

00:29:06.936 --> 00:29:08.606
To be honest, I'm
not sure about that.

00:29:08.606 --> 00:29:10.980
But that's the only thing I
can see that they would have,

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.890
so I think that must be
what they were using.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.466
Now since these
ancient times, there

00:29:22.466 --> 00:29:24.840
have been many measurements
of the Hubble expansion rate,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.540
and they changed a great deal.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.910
So in the '40s
through '60s, there

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.290
was a whole series of
measurements dominated

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:43.130
by people like Walter
Baade and Allan Sandage.

00:29:52.764 --> 00:29:54.180
And generally
speaking, the values

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.052
came down steadily
from the high values

00:29:58.052 --> 00:29:59.760
that were measured by
Hubble and Lemaitre

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.320
in the very early days.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.790
When I was a graduate
student, if you asked anybody

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:09.050
what the Hubble constant was,
you always got the same answer.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.640
It was somewhere
between 50 and 100,

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.730
still uncertain
by a factor of 2,

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.200
but much lower by a factor
of 5 or 10 from the values

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.860
that Hubble was talk
about, and was still

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:28.100
a major source of uncertainty
in talking about cosmology.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:38.880
Values started to become
more precise around 2001.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.854
So in 2001, there was
the Hubble Key Project

00:30:40.854 --> 00:30:42.020
that released these results.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.550
The word Hubble here refers
to the Hubble satellite,

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.140
which was named after
Hubble-- Hubble, Edwin.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.160
And they were able to use
the Hubble telescope to see

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.140
Cepheid variables and galaxies,
that was significantly further

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.800
than Cepheid variables
can ever be seen before

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.225
and thereby make a much better
calibration of the distance

00:31:04.225 --> 00:31:05.440
scale.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.100
As you'll learn about
when you do your reading,

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.370
Cepheid variables are
crucial to determining

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.950
the cosmological distance scale.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:20.200
So the value that they
got was much more precise

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.380
than anything previous, 72 plus
or minus 8 of these [? quad ?]

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.260
units kilometers per
second per megaparsec.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.240
Meanwhile things were
still controversial.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.090
I should have added that when
people said it was 50 to 100

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.920
when I was a graduate student,
it wasn't that people really

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.910
understood the error
bars to be that large.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.510
The real situation is that there
were a group of astronomers

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.992
that claimed
adamantly it was 50,

00:31:43.992 --> 00:31:45.950
and there were other
groups of astronomers that

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.980
claimed adamantly
that it was 100.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.530
Anyway On person is shouting
in your ear saying it's 100,

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.113
another person is
shouting in your ear

00:31:52.113 --> 00:31:55.740
saying it's 50 the conclusion
is that it's 50 to 100,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.120
and that's the situation when
I was a graduate student.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:05.730
So this was a somewhat high
value relative to the argument.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.240
The people who are
arguing on the low side

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.360
were still in business at this
time and still in fact also

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.190
using Hubble telescope data.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:17.700
So Tammann and
Sandage, the same year

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:22.090
using the same instrument--
let me put the year here,

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:27.450
and it's 2001-- Tammann
and Sandage were estimating

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.240
60 plus or minus they
said less than 10%.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.380
so these didn't quite mesh.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:09.312
Coming to more modern
times, in 2003, WMAP,

00:33:09.312 --> 00:33:21.130
the satellite called the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:26.890
Probe, a satellite
dedicate to measuring

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.140
these minute variations of the
cosmic microwave background

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.755
at the level of 1
part in 100,000,

00:33:32.755 --> 00:33:34.290
it turns out that
those measurements

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.700
are estimated at the
Hubble expansion rate

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.950
by fitting the data to
a theoretical model.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:51.440
And their initial number
was 72 plus or minus 5.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.590
And that was based
on one year of data.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:20.650
And in 2011, the same
WMAP satellite team

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.440
was based on seven
years of data,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.270
came up with a number
of 70.2 plus or minus

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:32.429
1.4, so to very precise.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.380
And the most recent number
comes from a similar satellite

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.659
to WMAP but more recent
and more powerful

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:44.000
satellite called
Planck, which just

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.765
released its data last March.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:54.319
And it came up with a somewhat
surprisingly low number 67.3

00:34:54.319 --> 00:35:01.201
plus or minus 1.2.

00:35:01.201 --> 00:35:01.700
Yes.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.520
AUDIENCE: The other
measurements there

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.971
are kind of inconsistent
with one another

00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:11.422
and then with one measurement
sort of 20th century

00:35:11.422 --> 00:35:13.065
make this big jump
down suggesting

00:35:13.065 --> 00:35:15.314
those early guys were making
the same kind of mistake.

00:35:15.314 --> 00:35:15.860
What was it?

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.080
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.380
The early guys were
making a big mistake

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.710
in estimating the
distance scale,

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.590
and I'm not sure I understand
the details of that,

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.130
but I think it had something to
do with misidentifying Cepheid

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.540
variables, equating two
different types that should not

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.265
have been compared
with each other.

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:36.507
But I'm not altogether
sure of the details,

00:35:36.507 --> 00:35:38.840
but it was definitely the
distance scale they had wrong.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.100
The velocities are pretty
easy to measure accurately,

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.234
and they were very wrong.

00:35:43.234 --> 00:35:43.734
Yes.

00:35:43.734 --> 00:35:46.700
AUDIENCE: There's two
types of Cepheids,

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.360
one has a certain period
of velocity relation

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.264
that would give it, and it's
like a completely different

00:35:52.264 --> 00:35:54.406
type of star, and
so we got mixed up,

00:35:54.406 --> 00:35:57.678
and we got completely different
absolute magnitudes, which

00:35:57.678 --> 00:36:00.642
will give you two completely
different distance estimates.

00:36:00.642 --> 00:36:03.359
So I don't know how
far, but measuring

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:06.552
Cepheids and Andromeda was
way off the distance scale

00:36:06.552 --> 00:36:08.052
because we thought
they were Type 1,

00:36:08.052 --> 00:36:09.534
but they were actually Type 2.

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:11.492
AUDIENCE: I think the
difference between Type 1

00:36:11.492 --> 00:36:13.849
and Type 2 are a factor of
4, so that would make sense.

00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:14.474
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:14.474 --> 00:36:16.944
It's like two completely
different linear relations.

00:36:20.402 --> 00:36:21.880
PROFESSOR: An
intensity goes like 1

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.270
over the distance squared,
so I think that, I mean,

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:29.115
a factor of 4 in intensity I
think would mean a factor of 16

00:36:29.115 --> 00:36:32.090
in distance estimates.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:32.590
Yes.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.760
AUDIENCE: I'm following
so much that these

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.820
are like, they both
have error bars,

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.937
but they're not within
error of each other.

00:36:38.937 --> 00:36:39.645
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:39.645 --> 00:36:42.830
AUDIENCE: Well, this
is like current data.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.900
PROFESSOR: So what's going on?

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.880
Nobody knows for sure.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.905
One thing I should
mention though

00:36:46.905 --> 00:36:48.863
is that these are what
are called 1 sigma error

00:36:48.863 --> 00:36:51.520
bars, which means
that you don't expect

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.100
them to necessarily agree.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.240
You expect the right answer to
be within one sigma error bar

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.330
2/3 of the, time
but 1/3 of the time

00:36:58.330 --> 00:36:59.900
it should be outside
the error bar.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.731
The questions is, the
error bar is on both.

00:37:01.731 --> 00:37:03.230
But the comparison
of this, and this

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.170
is usually viewed
as something like 2

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:08.984
and 1/2 sigma effect,
which naively, I think,

00:37:08.984 --> 00:37:10.400
means the probability
of something

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.108
on the order of 1% or
something like that

00:37:12.108 --> 00:37:14.650
of getting errors
that large at random.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.590
And it's debated whether or
not it's significant or not.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:22.840
It's the abstract of
the Planck paper use

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.680
words something like there's
a tension between their value

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.915
and other recent values.

00:37:31.355 --> 00:37:32.980
When somebody does
see things like that

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:36.410
happen more frequently than
the probabilities indicate,

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.290
which I think it
proves a theorem

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:42.250
that experimenters always
underestimate their error bars.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:46.390
But there's no absolute
proof of that theorem.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:48.580
So these thing were
early debatable.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.022
People don't know-- there
are many things that turn up

00:37:51.022 --> 00:37:52.605
in experimental
physics and especially

00:37:52.605 --> 00:37:57.150
in cosmology that turn up
regularly where people have

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.565
different opinions about
whether or not it's pointing

00:37:59.565 --> 00:38:01.420
to something very
important or something

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.530
that's going to go away.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.060
So very often they go
away, that's a fact.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.889
But you never know
in any one case,

00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:08.430
whether it's something
important that

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:12.340
will become more definite as
for the measurements are made

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.980
or whether it's just
a spurious effect that

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.951
will disappear in a few years.

00:38:16.951 --> 00:38:17.450
Yes.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.887
AUDIENCE: So I
imagine in the 1940s

00:38:20.887 --> 00:38:23.577
when people started
saying yes, that Hubble,

00:38:23.577 --> 00:38:25.993
for whom the constant is named,
was off by a factor of 10.

00:38:25.993 --> 00:38:27.076
That's very controversial.

00:38:27.076 --> 00:38:29.234
Was there any kind
of sloping trend

00:38:29.234 --> 00:38:31.689
where people may have changed
their data to make it seem,

00:38:31.689 --> 00:38:35.126
oh, we're not that far
off the Hubble standards.

00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:37.090
Has this happened a
couple of times before?

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.820
PROFESSOR: Question is did
people perhaps try to fudge

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.800
their data during a period in
the middle to make it look more

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.020
like Hubble's.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:50.720
I think, I don't
know, and there were,

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.737
as I said, pretty much through
the middle of the 20th century

00:38:53.737 --> 00:38:55.820
two groups, one of which
was getting a high value,

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.790
and one of which was
getting a low value.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.820
The high value is where, in
fact, disciples of Hubble,

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.890
rather directly-- wait a minute.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:05.600
That's not right.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.344
The most direct disciple of
Hubble was Allan Sandage,

00:39:08.344 --> 00:39:10.260
and he was, in fact,
abdicating the low value.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.600
So the sociological
trends are not that clear.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.050
What is clear is that
they were way off.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.620
I was going to add
concerning the way offness,

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:28.060
that it really does have or did
have a very significant effect

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:33.470
on the history of cosmology
because when one looks at a Big

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:37.180
Bang model and tries to use that
model to estimate when it all

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.030
started, what you're doing is
you're trying to extrapolate

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.530
backwards, ask when
was everything on top

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:46.892
of each other given that things
are moving at the speed now.

00:39:46.892 --> 00:39:48.725
There is more that goes
into the calculation

00:39:48.725 --> 00:39:52.570
then just H. It depends on your
model, the matter, and things

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:53.680
like that.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.400
But nonetheless H is obviously
a crucial ingredient there.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.837
The faster things are
moving now outward

00:39:58.837 --> 00:40:00.920
when you extrapolate
backwards, the faster they're

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.140
moving inward and the
younger the universe is.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.100
And to a very good
degree of reliability,

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:15.510
any age estimate-- and we'll
make age calculations later--

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.900
but any age estimate
is proportional to 1

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:24.230
over the Hubble parameter, 1
over the Hubble expansion rate.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.460
So if you're off by now
we would say a factor of 7

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:34.090
between Hubble's value and the
current value, 70 versus 500,

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:35.560
if you're off by
a factor of 7, you

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.450
get ages for the universe,
which are factors of 7

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:42.130
smaller than what you
should be getting.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.890
And this was noticed early on.

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:47.940
People were calculating ages
of the universe and Big Bang

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.430
models and getting numbers
like 2 billion years

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:54.800
instead of 14 billion
years, a factor of 7.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.990
And even back in
the '20s and '30s,

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.810
there was significant
geological evidence

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.019
that the Earth was much
older than 2 billion years,

00:41:03.019 --> 00:41:05.560
and people understood something
about the evolution of stars,

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.893
and it would seem pretty clear
that the stars were older

00:41:07.893 --> 00:41:10.700
than 2 billion years,
so you couldn't tolerate

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.100
a universe that was only
2 billion years old.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:18.060
And it led to very
significant problems

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.990
with the development
of the Big Bang theory,

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:26.010
and in particular, it
certainly gave extra credence

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:28.160
to what was called the
steady state theory, which

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.451
you may have heard of, which
held that the universe was

00:41:30.451 --> 00:41:32.780
infinitely old and
as it expanded,

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.190
more matter was created
in the steady state theory

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:37.670
to fill in the gaps so
the density of matter

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.630
would be constant.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:44.130
And Lemaitre himself
in his 1927 paper,

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.910
built a very complicated,
from my standards,

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:51.680
theory in order to get
the age to be compatible.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.300
Instead of having
a Big Bang model,

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.890
his 1927 model was
not a Big Bang model.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:42:00.640
His 1927 model started out
in a static equilibrium

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.970
where he had a positive
cosmological constant which

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:04.690
produces a repulsive
gravity, like what

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:08.500
we talked about in
my opening lecture,

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.230
balancing against the
normal attractive gravity

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.830
of ordinary matter,
producing what was almost

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:15.490
a static universe
of exactly the type

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:18.440
that Einstein had
been advocating.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:23.610
But Lemaitre's universe started
out with just a slightly less

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:27.210
mass density than
Einstein would have had,

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:30.040
so it gradually started
to get bigger and bigger.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.130
The force of ordinary
gravity wasn't quite enough

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.130
to hold it together,
but when it did

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:36.360
that, it starts to get
bigger and bigger very slowly

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.822
initially and then
picks up speed

00:42:37.822 --> 00:42:39.280
and allows you to
have universities

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.140
that are much older
than what you would get

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.640
in a straightforward
Big Bang model.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.370
Let's go on.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:54.270
What I want to talk about next
is what this Hubble expansion

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.810
is telling us
about the universe,

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.692
and I want to go through
this a little bit

00:42:59.692 --> 00:43:01.775
carefully because it's a
very important point even

00:43:01.775 --> 00:43:04.402
though it's possible you've
already figured it out

00:43:04.402 --> 00:43:05.110
from the reading.

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.360
I don't know for sure.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.837
Naively, Hubble's
law makes it sound

00:43:10.837 --> 00:43:13.170
like we're saying that we are
the center of the universe

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:14.730
after all.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.830
Copernicus was really wrong.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:21.300
Everything is moving away from
us, so we must be the center.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.311
But that's actually
not the case.

00:43:23.311 --> 00:43:25.560
It turns out that when you
look at things a little bit

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.420
carefully, and that's what
we'll do in this diagram,

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:31.280
if Hubble's law looks like
it holds to one observer, it

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.307
in fact, also looks like it
holds to any other observer

00:43:34.307 --> 00:43:36.140
as long as you recognize
that there's no way

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.540
to measure absolute velocity.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.480
So we think that we're
at rest, but that's

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.340
really just our definition
of the rest frame.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.690
If we lived on
some other galaxy,

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:49.200
we would equally well
attribute the state

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.840
of being at rest to
that other galaxy.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.800
And that's what's being shown
in this picture, which I Xeroxed

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.670
from Steve Weinberg's book so
this might seem familiar to you

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.370
if you've read that chapter yet.

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:03.960
It shows just expansion
in one direction,

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.450
but that's enough to
illustrate the point.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:10.380
And the top diagram
we imagine that we

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.140
are living on the
galaxy labeled A.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.670
The other galaxies
are moving away

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:18.525
from us with velocities
proportional to the distance,

00:44:18.525 --> 00:44:23.350
and we've spaced these galaxies
from the diagram evenly,

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.429
so the other galaxies
are moving away at v,

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:27.220
and then the next one
is moving away at 2v.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.494
And if we continue, it
would be 3v, 4v, et cetera,

00:44:30.494 --> 00:44:31.660
all the way out to infinity.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:38.735
And what we want to do
in going from A to B

00:44:38.735 --> 00:44:42.690
is to ask suppose we were
living in exactly this universe

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.770
as described on line A.
But suppose we were living

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:49.010
in galaxy B and considered
galaxy B to be at rest.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:53.710
So we'd describe everything
from the rest frame of galaxy B.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:55.440
Then galaxy B would
have no velocity,

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.120
because that would
defined the rest frame.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.900
When you change
frames, this was all

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:06.160
done in the context of
Galilean transformations.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.941
We'll build more
relativistic models later.

00:45:09.941 --> 00:45:11.940
Then the context of the
Galilean transformation,

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.490
if you go from one
frame to a frame moving

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.780
at a constant velocity,
the only thing you have

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.020
to do to transform velocity
is you add to each velocity

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.110
a fixed velocity, that
velocity difference

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.060
between the two frames.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.150
So to go from the top to
the bottom picture, what

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.990
we do in all cases is just
add a velocity, v, to the left

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.810
to each velocity, and that
takes the velocity of v

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.820
here when we move it
with v to the right.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.825
When we add a v to
the left, we get 0.

00:45:38.825 --> 00:45:40.407
It does the right
thing there, which

00:45:40.407 --> 00:45:42.270
is what defines the
transformation we're

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.050
trying to make.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.883
We're trying to make
the transformation that

00:45:44.883 --> 00:45:47.540
brings B to rest.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.000
And that means
that when we add v

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.390
to the left to
the velocity of z,

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:56.540
where we already had a v to the
left, we get 2v to the left.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.230
When we add v to the left to
y, which had 2v to the left,

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.480
we get 3v to the left.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.310
Going the other
direction, when we add v

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:08.240
to the left to c, which had
a velocity 2v to the right,

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.910
we're left with the
velocity of 1v to the right,

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:14.394
and that gives us what we
have on the second row.

00:46:14.394 --> 00:46:15.810
And if we look
from the second row

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:19.144
from the point of
view of v, the galaxy

00:46:19.144 --> 00:46:21.435
is one way or each moving
away from us with a velocity,

00:46:21.435 --> 00:46:23.811
v. The velocity is two
way and moving away

00:46:23.811 --> 00:46:25.810
from us with velocities
2v, et cetera.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.240
That's exactly the same.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.810
So even though the
Hubble expansion pattern

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.180
is phrased in a way that makes
it look like you're talking

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.360
about yourself as the center
of the universe, in fact,

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.180
it does describe a completely
homogeneous picture.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.610
And it's a picture
that, in fact,

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.940
has a very simple description.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.670
It's a picture of just
uniform expansion,

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.760
and I think I have my favorite,
at least the best picture I've

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.320
every drawn of uniform expansion
on the next slide here.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.020
The idea is that if you look
at some region of the universe,

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.170
the claim-- and
the claim is just

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:04.800
called homogeneous
expansion-- is

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.330
that each picture at successive
times would look identical,

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:13.390
but it would look like
a photographic blowup.

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.450
Each picture would
just be a bigger image

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:19.210
of the same picture with
one important exception,

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.200
and I did try to
draw this correctly,

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.439
the positions of the
galaxies-- this little

00:47:23.439 --> 00:47:24.980
lob there is supposed
to be a galaxy,

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:29.160
by the way, in case you
can't tell my great artistry.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:33.365
The positions of each galaxy
is just expand uniformly,

00:47:33.365 --> 00:47:36.680
the pattern of positions,
but each individual galaxy

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.560
does not expand.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.300
The individual of the
galaxies maintain their size

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.687
as the universe undergoes
this public expansion.

00:47:43.687 --> 00:47:45.770
Now if we're talking about
the very early universe

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:48.311
before there were any galaxies,
you would just have basically

00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:51.440
a uniform distribution
of matter of gas,

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.565
and that would just uniformly
expand every molecule

00:47:53.565 --> 00:47:58.530
and move away from every
other molecule on average.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:02.560
So this is the picture
of Hubble expansion.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.550
And now what I'd like to
do is provide a description

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.550
of how we're going to
treat this mathematically.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.515
If we have this
uniformly-- I'm sorry.

00:48:40.515 --> 00:48:41.015
Yes.

00:48:41.015 --> 00:48:42.638
AUDIENCE: I'm still
getting confused

00:48:42.638 --> 00:48:46.041
whether like the expansion
is the galaxies expanding

00:48:46.041 --> 00:48:50.934
into the universe or if the
universe itself is expanding.

00:48:50.934 --> 00:48:51.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.800
The question in case you
didn't hear it was there's

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.220
some confusion here about
whether we should think

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.600
of the galaxies as
moving through space

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.930
or whether we should think
of space itself as expanding.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.280
And the answer really is
that both points of view

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.260
should be right.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:10.490
If space were like
water, then you

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.030
could imagine
putting little dust

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.110
in the water, little
grains of salt or something

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:20.020
you can see and see if they are
carried by the water or apart.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.640
But there's no
way to mark space.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.530
It's intrinsic to the
principle of relativity

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.020
that you can't tell if you're
moving relative to space

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.090
or not.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:31.435
There's no meaning to
moving relative to space.

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:33.810
And there's no meaning for
you to move relative to space.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:36.440
There is also no meaning for
space to move relative to you.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.770
they do the same thing.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:42.390
So you can't really tell,
and both points of view

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:44.250
should be correct.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:46.860
There are cases where
you can tell, however,

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.480
which is not locally
but if, for example, you

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.820
had a closed universe, which
we'll talk about later how that

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.616
works exactly,
then you could ask

00:49:54.616 --> 00:49:57.100
does the volume of a closed
universe get bigger with time

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.700
as this Hubble
expansion takes place.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.020
And the answer there is yes.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.513
AUDIENCE: That
would mean actually,

00:50:01.513 --> 00:50:02.596
the universe is expanding.

00:50:02.596 --> 00:50:04.640
PROFESSOR: The actual
universe is expanding.

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.880
So we will normally think
of it, globally at least,

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.310
as the actual
universe expanding.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.470
That is how we will
think about it.

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:16.210
But locally, there's not really
any distinction between that

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:20.830
and saying that these galaxies
are just moving through space.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:21.330
Yes.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:24.753
AUDIENCE: So given that
the galaxies are actually

00:50:24.753 --> 00:50:27.687
two points, why
can it be claimed

00:50:27.687 --> 00:50:30.621
that the galaxies themselves
are not expanding?

00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:31.470
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:33.886
How do we understand the fact
that the galaxies themselves

00:50:33.886 --> 00:50:35.990
are not expanding is
what you're asking.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:41.230
And I'll give you
a nutshell answer,

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:44.930
and we might be talking
about it more later.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:49.180
One should imagine that
this starts out shortly

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:52.840
after the Big Bang as an almost
perfectly uniform gas, which

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.760
is just uniformly expanding,
everything moving away

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.860
from everything else.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.250
But the gas is not
completely uniform.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:05.207
It has tiny ripples in
the matter density, which

00:51:05.207 --> 00:51:07.540
are the same ripples that we
see in the cosmic microwave

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.486
background radiation today or
at least the cosmic ripples

00:51:10.486 --> 00:51:12.860
that we see in the cosmic
background radiation are caused

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.300
by the ripples in the mass
density of the early universe.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.730
These ripples
eventually form galaxies

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:23.530
because they're
gravitationally unstable.

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:26.290
Wherever there's a
slight excess of mass,

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:29.050
that will create a slightly
stronger gravitational field

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.360
in that region pulling
in more mass creating

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.160
a still stronger gravitational
field pulling in more mass,

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.300
and eventually instead of having
this nice uniform distribution

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.910
with just ripples at
1 part in 100,000,

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:45.680
you eventually have huge clumps
of matter which are galaxies.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.280
And as you go from this
transition of things

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:53.500
being almost completely
uniform and uniformly expanding

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.390
to these lumps
that form galaxies,

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:58.010
the ones that are being formed
by extra gravity pulling

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.130
in the matter.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:01.800
And what happens is
that extra gravity

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.120
that forms the galaxy
overcomes the Hubble expansion.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.920
The matter that
makes up the galaxy

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.410
had been expanding
in the early days,

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:13.430
but the gravitational
pull of the matter that

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.370
forms the galaxy
pulls it back in.

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:19.067
So the galaxy actually reaches a
maximum size and then, in fact,

00:52:19.067 --> 00:52:20.650
starts to get smaller
and then reaches

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:24.400
equilibrium, an
equilibrium where

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.450
the rotational motion
keeps a finite size.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:28.950
Yes.

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:31.280
AUDIENCE: So the
diagrams that you're

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.319
applying up here that all the
distance relations have been

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:35.735
galaxies that are
being preserved.

00:52:35.735 --> 00:52:37.924
Is that a potential or is
it exactly [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:37.924 --> 00:52:38.840
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.673
It's supposed to be
just a photographic blow

00:52:40.673 --> 00:52:42.760
up as far as where the
relocations of dots are.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:42.850
Yeah.

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:44.340
I mean is that
what you're asking?

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.064
AUDIENCE: Well,
like will there be

00:52:46.064 --> 00:52:48.564
equal distance between galaxies
as a sub [INAUDIBLE] member?

00:52:48.564 --> 00:52:49.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.860
I think the picture
shows that, doesn't it?

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.700
AUDIENCE: Well, the
notches basically

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:54.160
are spaces between [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.530
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's right.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.895
That's right.

00:52:56.895 --> 00:52:59.041
I haven't talked
about the notches yet.

00:52:59.041 --> 00:53:01.540
The diagrams are supposed to
show actual physical distances.

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.160
So the physical distance between
this galaxy and this galaxy

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.377
is a little bit there
and much more there.

00:53:07.377 --> 00:53:09.710
So that's how you're supposed
to interpret that picture.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:12.860
But what I was about to
get to and you've got there

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:15.580
so I'll continue,
is that the best

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:19.170
way to describe this
uniformly-expanding system

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:22.630
is to introduce a coordinate
system that expands with it,

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.470
and that's what
these notches are.

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:29.320
The notches are artificial
things that we create,

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:33.230
and we could think of them as
just being labels on a map.

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:36.375
Once we know that the
expansion is uniform this way,

00:53:36.375 --> 00:53:38.000
we could take any
one of these pictures

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.950
and think of it as a map of
our region of the universe.

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:50.450
And we can then get to any
other picture on the slide

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:55.300
simply by converting units on
a map to physical distances

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.700
with a different scale factor.

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.590
So if Massachusetts was forever
getting bigger and bigger

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:04.420
and we had a map
of Massachusetts,

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.730
we would not have to throw
away that map every day

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:08.690
and buy a new map.

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.680
We could handle the expansion
of Massachusetts keeping

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.810
the same map just crossing
out the place in the corner

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:17.500
of the map where it says
1 inch equals 7 miles,

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.520
and the next day 1
inch equals 8 miles,

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:24.210
and 1 inch equals 9 miles, and
1 inch equals 10 and 1/2 miles.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.540
So by changing the scale
factor on the map and the use

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.240
of the word scale factor here is
exactly the same meaning as it

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.530
would have for a
map, you can allow

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:37.830
yourself to describe
an expanding system

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:40.300
without ever throwing
away the original map.

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.110
And that's the kind
of coordinate system

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:44.910
that we will be
using, and these are

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.125
called comoving coordinates.

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:05.824
And the idea here
is that galaxies

00:55:05.824 --> 00:55:09.920
are at-- I'm
sticking in the word

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.381
approximately here because
none of this is exact,

00:55:13.381 --> 00:55:18.036
but we'll be thinking in a
toy model as it was exact.

00:55:18.036 --> 00:55:28.215
So galaxies are at
approximately constant values

00:55:28.215 --> 00:55:42.986
of the coordinates, and
the scale factor, which

00:55:42.986 --> 00:56:06.550
means the physical distance per
coordinate distance increases

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:07.060
with time.

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:21.100
So that describes this
all-important comoving

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.840
coordinate system
that we'll be using

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.740
for the rest of the course
to describe the expanding

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.050
universe.

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:28.550
Yes.

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.912
AUDIENCE: Do we have to do
anything funny to the Lorentz

00:56:31.912 --> 00:56:35.848
transform to come to the
fact that coordinates are now

00:56:35.848 --> 00:56:38.800
not moving at the same velocity
relative to each other?

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.090
PROFESSOR: It depends on
what questions you ask.

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:43.540
There are questions where you
do have to think carefully,

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.660
and we'll have one of
those shortly as probably

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.744
an extra credit problem.

00:56:47.744 --> 00:56:50.160
But for most things, it actually
makes things very simple,

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.400
and you can ignore most
of the complications

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.830
of special relativity.

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:57.310
And we'll try to think as we
go along where we need to worry

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:00.100
about special relativity and
where we don't, and usually we

00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:00.600
don't.

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:40.920
So the key relationship is
that the physical distance

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:45.120
between any two points on the
map, by physical distance,

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.570
I mean what it is
in the real world,

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:49.450
miles if we're talking
about Massachusetts,

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:53.630
and this is miles between
the real physical points,

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:56.830
is equal to a
time-dependent scale

00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:01.500
factor times the
coordinate distance.

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.210
Now, here I'm going
to use conventions

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.220
for defining things that are
slightly different from what

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.210
are often used.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:38.330
A common procedure where I think
it's done in most of the books,

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:40.940
is to think of both
the coordinate distance

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.620
and the physical distances being
measured in normal distance

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:48.130
units, meters, and then the
scale factor is dimensionless,

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:49.680
and it just tells
you how much you

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.940
have to blow up the
map to be able to make

00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.750
it the physical map.

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:59.230
I find it significantly
easier to know

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:01.280
what you're doing
as things go along

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.430
to label the map in units that
are not centimeters, but are

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:08.780
what shown on the
picture as notches.

00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.640
One advantage of
that logically is it

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.852
means that if you have
different copies of the map

00:59:12.852 --> 00:59:14.310
that you've made
on a Xerox machine

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:17.290
with different scalings, you
have a big copy of the map

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:19.040
and a little copy of
the map, that they're

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.580
marked off with notches.

00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.720
The notches grow with the
physical size of the page,

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.650
the scale factor is
the same no matter

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:28.570
which copy of the
map you're using.

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:30.600
But most importantly, it
allows you to, I think,

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.820
do dimensional tests.

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:34.620
The size of the map
is clearly something

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:38.250
that's unrelated to the
actual length of a meter,

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:41.580
it's just how many units
you put on your map.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:45.050
So there's a clear
and logical separation

00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:48.180
between what is meant by
a certain number of units

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:53.540
and distance here and a
real meter by any standards.

00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.860
So you can keep that
straight by just imagining

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.870
that your map is calibrated in
some new arbitrary unit which

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:03.250
is just special to the map, and
I'm going to call that a notch.

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:14.960
So notches are just
arbitrary units

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.145
that you use to
mark off your map.

01:00:18.145 --> 01:00:20.020
And then the physical
distance is, of course,

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:26.640
measured in meters or any other
standard unit of distance.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:33.380
And then the scale
factor is measured

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:39.400
in units of meters per notch
instead of being dimensionless.

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:49.682
And the basic advantage of this
is that when you're all done,

01:00:49.682 --> 01:00:51.390
nothing had better
have any notches in it

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.840
as you're calculating something
physical, that is physical

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.630
why you should not depend
on the size of your map.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.570
So you have a nice
dimensional check

01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:00.220
to make sure that
the notches drop out

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.810
of any physical calculation
that you try to do.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.920
What I want to do
next is to show you

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.910
that this relationship
leads me to Hubble's law

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:19.960
and furthermore will allow us
to figure out what this Hubble

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.396
expansion rate is in terms of
what the scale factor is doing.

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:39.610
So it's an easy
enough calculation

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:41.720
if we're looking at
some object out there

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.030
and it's physical distance l
sub p is given by that formula,

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.200
and we want to know
what its velocity is.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.900
It's velocity is
by definition, just

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:52.560
a time derivative
of that quantity.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.780
So the velocity of some object,
some distance out in space,

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:08.263
is just equal to d
dt of l sub p of t,

01:02:08.263 --> 01:02:17.226
and that will be da
dt times l sub c,

01:02:17.226 --> 01:02:19.290
because l sub c is constant.

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:21.590
On average, all our
galaxies are at rest

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:24.290
in this coordinate system,
in this expanding coordinate

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:26.640
system.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.550
Now this could be written
in a way that ends up

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:34.276
being more useful by dividing
and multiplying by a.

01:02:34.276 --> 01:02:37.060
So I could write it
as 1 over a times

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:41.800
da dt times a of t times lc.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.840
And the advantage of multiplying
and dividing by a this way

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.510
is that this quantity
is again just l

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:57.450
sub p, the physical distance.

01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:01.710
So now we say that the
velocity of any distant object

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:06.070
is equal to 1 over a da dt times
the distance to that object.

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:09.040
And that is Hubble's
law, and it tells us

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.320
that the Hubble expansion
rate, which is itself

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.670
going to be a
function of time, is

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:19.010
equal to 1 over a times da dt.

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:29.060
And this allows us to
illustrate the unit check

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:32.750
that I talked about
for the first time.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:37.005
Notice that a is measured
in meters per notch,

01:03:37.005 --> 01:03:39.380
so the meters per notch here
cancels the meters per notch

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.005
here, and you just
get inverse time,

01:03:41.005 --> 01:03:42.380
and the really
important thing is

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:44.560
that the notches have gone away.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.805
And again, notches
have to go away

01:03:46.805 --> 01:03:48.684
in any calculation
of any physical,

01:03:48.684 --> 01:03:49.850
and that makes a nice check.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.084
And once you know how
a of t is behaving,

01:04:05.084 --> 01:04:07.650
you know exactly how the
Hubble expansion rate behaves.

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:12.040
It's determined by a of t.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.580
You might mention
one notational item.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:19.640
Nowadays almost everybody calls
this scale factor little a.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.380
In the early days,
it was very first

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.885
introduced by Alexander
Friedmann who first invented

01:04:24.885 --> 01:04:26.785
the equation describing
expanding universe

01:04:26.785 --> 01:04:28.430
in the early 1920s.

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:31.440
He used the letter R,
capital R. Lemaitre also

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.570
used the letter capital R,
and I guess Einstein probably

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.940
used the capital
R. I'm not sure.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.050
And going into
more modern times,

01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:43.060
Steve Weinberg wrote a book
on gravitation and cosmology

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.780
which still used the
letter capital R,

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.040
but that was sort of
the last major work that

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.760
used the capital R
for the scale factor.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.890
The disadvantage of
it is at the same time

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.930
this capital R means something
else in general relativity.

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:57.530
It's the standard
symbol for what's

01:04:57.530 --> 01:05:00.270
called the scalar curvature
in general relativity.

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:04.320
So to avoid confusion between
those two quantities, nowadays

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.720
almost everybody calls
the scale factor little a.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.450
If you look at old
A286 notes, I used

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:14.350
to follow Steve Weinberg's
textbook on gravitation

01:05:14.350 --> 01:05:16.390
and cosmology and
call it capital R,

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.760
but now it's hopefully
all switched to little a.

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:22.090
OK.

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:24.370
Next item.

01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:26.070
If we're going to
understand what

01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:28.240
it would look like to live
in a universe like this,

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.906
we're going to need
to know how to trace

01:05:29.906 --> 01:05:33.010
light rays through our
expanding universe.

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:34.720
And that turned out to be easy.

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:14.530
If I let x be equal
to a coordinate, that

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:24.600
means it's measured in
notches, and if I imagine

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.100
I have a light ray moving
in the x direction,

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:31.880
I can describe how that
light ray is going to move.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.025
If I can write down a
formula for the dx dt.

01:06:34.025 --> 01:06:35.775
Tells me how fast in
the coordinate system

01:06:35.775 --> 01:06:36.705
the light ray travels.

01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:49.540
Well the basic principle
that we're going to use

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.530
here is that light,
in fact, always

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:55.670
travels at the speed of
light at some fixed value c,

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:58.760
but c is the physical velocity
of light, the velocity measured

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.890
in meters per second.

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:05.080
But dx dt is the velocity
measured in notches per second

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.180
because our coordinate
system is marked off

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.660
not in meters, but in notches.

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.070
And that really
is very important

01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:12.486
because meters are going to
be constantly changing lengths

01:07:12.486 --> 01:07:14.474
relative to our
notches, and we want

01:07:14.474 --> 01:07:15.890
to keep track of
things in notches

01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:19.690
so we have a nice picture within
our coordinate description

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:23.310
of the universe that
we can think about.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:25.370
So we're going to want
to know what dx dt is,

01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:27.430
but it's just a unit
conversion problem.

01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:30.620
dx dt is the speed of light
in notches per second.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.740
We know the speed of light
in meters per second, c.

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.110
So to convert is just a matter
of multiplying by the scale

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:41.145
factor to convert the
units of meters to notches.

01:07:41.145 --> 01:07:45.010
And here again it helps to
have this meters versus notches

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:47.430
because it guarantees that
you can't get it wrong

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.260
if you just check your units.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.090
So this is not really
a question mark.

01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:56.880
It is just c divided by
a of t, the scale factor.

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:04.750
And we can make sure we got it
right by checking our units.

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:08.230
I'm going to use brackets
to indicate units of.

01:08:12.343 --> 01:08:14.217
So we're going to work
out what the units are

01:08:14.217 --> 01:08:16.976
of c over a of t, trivial
problem, of course,

01:08:16.976 --> 01:08:19.010
but we'll make sure we
got the right answer.

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:24.800
The units of c are, of
course, meters per second.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.325
a of t we said is
meters per notch.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:38.310
So the meters cancel, and
we get notches per second.

01:08:40.608 --> 01:08:42.649
Now, I told you that you
should never get notches

01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:45.190
in the physical answer because
this is not a physical answer.

01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:46.970
This is a coordinate
velocity of light,

01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:48.689
so it does depend
on our coordinates

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:50.130
depending on what
coordinates we've chosen.

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:52.090
So it should certainly
be notches per second

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:54.790
because x is measured in notches
and t is measured in seconds.

01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:56.582
So we put in the a of
t in the right place.

01:08:56.582 --> 01:08:57.956
It does belong in
the denominator

01:08:57.956 --> 01:08:59.040
and not the numerator.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:08:59.540
Yes.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:03.040
AUDIENCE: Why aren't we
worrying about the fact

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.540
that as the universe
expands, there's

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:11.040
also a velocity component with
a light rate from its position

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.040
moving according the
Hubble expansion?

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.229
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:17.140
The reason we don't
worry about that

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.850
is that special
relativity tells us

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:24.229
that all inertial
observers are equivalent

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:27.700
and that the speed of light
does not depend on the cannon

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.240
that the light beam
was shot out of.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:36.600
So if I'm at rest in this
expanding coordinate system,

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.224
I'm not really an
inertial observer

01:09:38.224 --> 01:09:40.140
because there is gravity
in this whole system,

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.030
but we're going to ignore that.

01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:44.529
If we're really
being rigorous here,

01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:46.700
we have to do the full
general relatively thing.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.910
But I think the intuitive
explanation is pretty obviously

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:50.410
valid.

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:52.620
It is, in fact,
rigorously valid.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:56.440
If I'm standing still in this
expanding coordinate system,

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.820
I am an inertial observer.

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.883
And if a light
beam comes by me, I

01:10:00.883 --> 01:10:03.216
should measure it's B and C,
no matter where it started,

01:10:03.216 --> 01:10:05.940
no matter what's
happened in the past.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.170
So the conversion between
my units of distance

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:12.070
and physical units of distance,
my coordinate distances

01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:16.750
and physical distances,
is just a of t.

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:19.410
So that's the only
factor that appears

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:21.040
and this is completely rigorous.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.570
One can drive this in
a more general context

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:25.530
in general relativity.

01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:28.519
Here we're starting
out with a premise

01:10:28.519 --> 01:10:30.060
that the light pulse
travels at speed

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.720
say if one had the full
theory of general relativity

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.200
coupled to Maxwell's
equations we

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.220
could really derive the
fact of exactly how rays

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.895
travel and would give us this.

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.435
So we have a very
simple equation

01:10:47.435 --> 01:10:49.180
for how light rays travel.

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.080
Now I want to spend a little
bit of time, and this, I guess,

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.830
will be the last topic I'll
talk about today discussing

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:06.010
the synchronization of
clocks in this world system,

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:10.900
in this cosmological
coordinate system.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.400
In special relativity,
you know that it's

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.130
hard to talk about synchronizing
clocks at large distances.

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.727
The synchronization
of clocks depends

01:11:24.727 --> 01:11:26.060
on the velocity of the observer.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.820
That was one of the
principles we learned

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.610
about when I wrote
down those three

01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:33.180
kinematic properties
of special relativity.

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:36.620
So in general, in the context
of special relativity,

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.156
there is no universal way
of synchronize the clocks.

01:11:40.156 --> 01:11:42.530
You could synchronize clocks
with respect to one observer

01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:45.310
but then they would not be
synchronized with respect

01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:49.690
to another observer moving
with respect to that observer.

01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:52.435
In this case, we have perhaps
even a further complication

01:11:52.435 --> 01:11:54.770
although in the end
everything is simple,

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:57.840
but we have the further
complication that the different

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.770
clocks that we're talking
about, which are clocks carried

01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:03.520
by these observers that are
stationary in our comoving

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.120
coordinate system-- clocks
carried essentially by galaxies

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.050
that are uniformly
expanding-- all these clocks

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:12.860
are moving relative
to each other.

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:15.460
because the Hubble
expansion tells us that.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.900
So the notion of trying
to synchronize clocks

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.080
seems a bit formidable.

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.920
Turns out however that
we can synchronize clocks

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:29.880
and one can develop a notion of
what we call cosmic time, which

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.180
is the time that would be
right on all these clocks

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.054
where all these clocks,
I mean all the clocks

01:12:34.054 --> 01:12:37.630
that are stationary with
respect to the local matter,

01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:40.270
in other words stationary
with respect to this comoving

01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:44.040
but expanding coordinate system.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.280
So why can't we
synchronize clocks?

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.560
What we're using as our
core assumption, which

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.860
is what makes
everything simple, is

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:57.830
that the model universe that
we're building this homogeneous

01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:01.940
and that means that what I
would see if I was living

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:06.400
in this universe would
not depend on where I was.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.510
So if I were living
on galaxy number one

01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:15.820
and took out my
stopwatch and timed

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:22.020
how long it took before say
the Hubble parameter changed

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:26.390
from Hubble's value
to the current value

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:30.650
say, as an example,
any two numbers,

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:33.904
if I were living any place
else and timed the same thing,

01:13:33.904 --> 01:13:35.820
how long it took for the
Hubble expansion rate

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.490
to change from A to B, I
would have to get exactly

01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:41.675
the same time
interval, otherwise, it

01:13:41.675 --> 01:13:43.190
would not be homogeneous.

01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:47.370
Homogeneous means everybody
sees exactly the same thing.

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:49.050
So we all have,
no matter where we

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:53.010
live in this universe,
a common history,

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:56.510
and that means that the
only thing we don't know

01:13:56.510 --> 01:14:01.140
is how to synchronize our
clocks what time on my watch

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.827
might correspond to
what time on your watch.

01:14:03.827 --> 01:14:05.660
But if we imagine that
we could send signals

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.470
or that we're some
global observer watching

01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:11.790
the whole thing, then we could
just tell each other let's

01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:14.935
all set our clocks to noon
when the Hubble expansion

01:14:14.935 --> 01:14:18.570
rate is 500 kilometers
per second per megaparsec.

01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:21.420
And then we would have a
well-defined synchronization.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:25.510
And once we synchronized
our watch that way,

01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:28.890
if we each looked at how the
Hubble expansion rate changed

01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:32.350
with time, we would get exactly
the same function of time

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.525
by this principle
of homogeneity.

01:14:34.525 --> 01:14:36.320
None of us could see
anything different

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.070
as long as we're
measuring time intervals,

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:40.215
and we've fixed it so now
we're measuring nothing

01:14:40.215 --> 01:14:43.430
but time intervals because
we've arranged to all

01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:46.790
set our clocks to the same
time at some particular value

01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:49.420
to the Hubble parameter.

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.920
So to synchronize, we can
ask what are the options.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.330
I mentioned the
Hubble parameter.

01:14:54.330 --> 01:14:55.870
That's certainly
one parameter that

01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:59.040
can be used in principle
to synchronize clocks

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.770
throughout our model universe.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.810
You might wonder if we
can use the scale factor

01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:08.712
itself to synchronize times.

01:15:08.712 --> 01:15:10.170
And the answer
there I would say is

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:14.440
no because of this
ambiguity of the notch.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:20.230
I have no way of comparing
my notch to your notch.

01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:21.780
We can compare
physical distances

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:25.070
because they're related
to physical properties

01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:27.680
as the size of a hydrogen atom
is a certain physical size,

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.340
no matter where it
is in this universe.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:32.450
So we could use hydrogen
atoms to measure meters,

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:35.670
and we would all be talking
about the same meters.

01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:37.792
And we could use those
meters to define seconds

01:15:37.792 --> 01:15:40.000
by how long it takes light
to travel through a meter,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.530
and so on.

01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:43.290
So meters and
seconds, we can all

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:46.216
agree on because they're
related to physical phenomena

01:15:46.216 --> 01:15:47.590
that we can all
see and that will

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:51.740
be the same everywhere in our
homogeneous model universe.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:56.180
But notches, not so, everybody
gets to make up his own notch.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.470
It's just the size of the
map he happens to draw.

01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:02.691
So we cannot compare
scale factors and say,

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.690
we'll set our clocks to
a certain time when both

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.745
of our scale factors
have a certain value.

01:16:06.745 --> 01:16:08.370
We would get different
synchronizations

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:10.200
depending on what
choices we've made

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.960
about having to find a notch.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.440
So the scale factor does not
work as a synchronization

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.630
mechanism, Hubble
expansion rates does.

01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:23.840
Also we haven't really talked
about an ideal cosmic microwave

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.090
background, but we
certainly talked about it,

01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:28.381
the cosmic microwave background
has a temperature which

01:16:28.381 --> 01:16:30.010
is falling as the
universe expands,

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:34.270
so that could be used to
synchronize clocks as well.

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:36.680
Might mention in
the last 30 seconds

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.012
one interesting phenomenon.

01:16:41.012 --> 01:16:43.157
For our universe, the
Hubble expansion rate

01:16:43.157 --> 01:16:44.740
is changing with
time, the temperature

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:45.830
is changing with time.

01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:49.269
There's no problem talking
about this synchronization.

01:16:49.269 --> 01:16:51.060
But if you're talking
about different kinds

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.360
of mathematical models
of the universes,

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.650
you can imagine a universe
where the Hubble expansion

01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:58.480
rate is just
constant, and in fact

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.670
that is a space that
was studied very

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:02.610
early in the history
of general relativity.

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:03.842
It's called de Sitter space.

01:17:03.842 --> 01:17:06.050
And it's approximately what
happens during inflation,

01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:08.400
so we'll even be talking
about de Sitter space

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.330
later in the course.

01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:12.765
In de Sitter space,
the Hubble constant

01:17:12.765 --> 01:17:14.899
is absolutely constant,
so at least one

01:17:14.899 --> 01:17:17.190
of the mechanisms I mentioned
to synchronize the clocks

01:17:17.190 --> 01:17:18.615
goes away.

01:17:18.615 --> 01:17:21.240
There's also, in fact, no cosmic
microwave background radiation

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.230
in pure de Sitter space,
so that goes away.

01:17:24.230 --> 01:17:26.660
You could ask, is
there anything else,

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.330
it turns out there
is not, so you really

01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:32.730
can construct a well-defined
model of the universe,

01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:35.120
the so-called de Sitter
space, where there really

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.879
is no way of
synthesizing clocks.

01:17:36.879 --> 01:17:39.420
And you could really show that
you could make transformations

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.735
so that if you synchronize
the clocks one way,

01:17:41.735 --> 01:17:44.760
you could make a symmetry
transformation if we take

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.534
all those clocks out
of synchronization

01:17:46.534 --> 01:17:48.200
and otherwise the
space would be just as

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.845
good as what you started with.

01:17:49.845 --> 01:17:51.220
So the synchronization
is subtle,

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.261
and it depends on having
something which actually

01:17:53.261 --> 01:17:55.050
changes with time,
but that will be

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:57.830
the case where our real
universe and for the model

01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.750
universes that we'll
be talking about.

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:01.310
So I'll stop there.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.840
See you folks on Thursday.

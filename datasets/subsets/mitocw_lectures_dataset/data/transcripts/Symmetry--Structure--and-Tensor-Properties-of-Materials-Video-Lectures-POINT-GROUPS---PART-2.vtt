00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.890
PROFESSOR: --questions about
what we've done.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.460
I think it's been fast, but
hopefully if you understand

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.500
the principles, we didn't
go too fast.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.190
But any questions on
what we've done?

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.720
I guess you haven't had
a chance to think

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.980
of questions yet.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.240
Let me take care of our oddball
symmetry at the end of

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.150
the chart that I handed
out-- and this 4 bar--

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.110
and ask what we can do there.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.060
Having discovered the four bar
operation in 2, 2, 2 with

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.960
diagonal mirror planes, we can
consider that as a new type of

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.650
symmetry element.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.450
And this is the symbol for it.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.430
And this would take a pair of
objects and repeat them by a

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.440
180 degree rotation.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.640
And then another pair of
opposite handedness, opposite

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.980
chirality would be rotated 90
degrees and inverted, rotated

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.210
90 degrees and inverted.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.110
And I mentioned last time that a
solid that has this shape is

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.130
something called a sphenoid.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.580
And the 4 bar axis takes a pair
of faces that are up and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.940
a pair of faces that are down
and skewed by 90 degrees.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.890
Now what can we do?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.780
If we add a mirror plane that's
perpendicular to the 4

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.850
bar axis, the right-handed
one goes down, the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.480
left-handed one comes up.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.200
And it becomes simply 4 over
m, which we've already got.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.725
If we add a vertical mirror
plane through the 4 bar, if

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:18.040
you look a bit earlier at 4 bar
2m, now we've got the 4

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.420
bar, now we've got
the mirror plane.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.070
Not surprisingly, we get
the two mirror planes.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:41.200
And so S4v is going to be
the same as 4 bar 2m.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.400
And that's something we
already have D2d.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.030
So that exhausts the
possibilities.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.595
4 bar just stands by itself.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.790
At a vertical mirror plane,
it's D2d 4 bar 2m.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.920
At a horizontal mirror plane,
it becomes 4 over m.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.300
The diagonal mirror plane
is not possible.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.500
There's nothing to place the
mirror plane diagonal to.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.290
And if you add inversion, it
changes into 4 over m.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.100
So this one is an odd group.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.330
It sits by itself.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.860
Except that we could start
there, and add a vertical

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.070
mirror plane, and get
4 bar 2m once more.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.160
That leaves the cubic ones,
which are really easy to deal

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.490
with because a cube has
such high symmetry.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.450
We all know what cubes
look like.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.210
But when you show arrangements
of motifs, it gets a little

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.070
bit confusing.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.295
So let's take a look at the
tetrahedral groups.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.360
T is a combination of twofold
axes coming out in directions

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.670
corresponding to face
normals to a cube.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.865
So these are the twofold axes.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.140
And then there are threefold
axes coming out of directions

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.760
that correspond to the
face diagonal.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.060
So this is the jack-o'-lantern
stereographic projection,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.410
which is something I love to
draw at this time of year.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.360
What will the pattern
look like?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.760
Well, it's going to
look like 2, 2, 2.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.200
So that's a subgroup.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.050
So let's draw in a pair of
objects on either side of the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.774
twofold axis, and that's
the pattern of 2, 2, 2.

00:04:45.774 --> 00:04:50.420
Now this guy here is lurking
off of a threefold axis.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.570
So that threefold axis is
going to repeat it three

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.800
locations that are 120
degrees apart.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.700
And so there's going to be a
triangle of objects up above.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.660
This threefold axis is going
to reproduce this into a

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.660
triangle of objects that
are down below.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.100
The twofold axis will take this
triangle of objects and

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.390
move it over to here.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.090
Also, up.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.110
And the twofold axis that's
vertical will take this

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.450
triangle and move it down
to three that are below.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.540
So it looks very complicated
in projection.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.700
But it's simply a planar
triangle of atoms here rotated

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.740
180 degrees.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.330
So you've got one like
this, one like this.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.925
And then down below, two other
planar triangles of objects.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:58.050
Remembering what the symmetry
of a tetrahedron looks like,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.150
you can draw this arrangement of
symmetry elements relative

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.510
to a tetrahedron.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.890
And the threefold axes
now are coming out

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.365
normal to the faces.

00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:14.160
The twofold axes coming out
normal to the edges.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.800
And imagine that we put a
triangle on this face, a

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.700
similar triangle on the face
behind, and a triangle

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.300
pointing in the other direction
down this way.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.830
These are the three below.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.960
So that's the pattern of 2, 3.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.400
Take a tetrahedron, smack a
triangle on the two upper

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.130
faces, and an equilateral
triangle on

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.590
the two lower faces.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.880
And the threefold axis that
comes out here comes out of

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.000
the center of this triangle
and out of the

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.250
center of this triangle.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:06.230
The next one that you can
get from this is Th, the

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.530
tetrahedral arrangement
of axes with a

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.470
horizontal mirror plane.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.290
If you put in a horizontal
mirror plane, it's going to

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.850
take this triangle and
reflect it down.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.540
It's going to take this triangle
and reflect it up.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.336
And they will overlap
in projection.

00:07:26.336 --> 00:07:30.440
And so that's the
pattern for Th.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.470
There's a mirror plane
perpendicular

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.880
to a twofold axis.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.920
That creates an inversion
center.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.200
So we can call this
a 3 bar axis.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.360
So that's Th 2 over m 3 bar.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.715
So just have triangles on the
upper and lower faces as well.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:11.970
The one remaining one is Td.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.850
Here are the twofold axes.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.620
Here are the threefold axes.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.780
And now if we put a diagonal
mirror plane in, diagonal with

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.690
respect to what?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.390
Well, diagonal with respect
to these twofold axes.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.140
So this mirror plane goes down
like this, passes through a

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.110
twofold axis.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.799
There must be a mirror plane
90 degrees away.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:50.170
And the threefold axis is going
to repeat these mirror

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:58.270
planes so that we get mirror
planes that are at an angle

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.210
with respect to the vertical
twofold axis.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.100
And this is Td.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.800
And this, in the international
notation, is called-- if we

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.320
can figure it out--

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.470
the diagonal mirror planes with
respect to these twofold

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.250
axes have changed them
into 4 bar axes.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:26.740
So this is called 4 bar
3m, which doesn't

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.230
look cubic at all.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.555
So that's a little
bit deceptive.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.960
I am foolhardy for even
trying to do this.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.280
And so I don't think
I'm going to do it.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.930
4, 3, 2, we know what
that looks like.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.930
That is fourfold axes coming
out in directions that

00:09:53.930 --> 00:10:01.115
correspond to the face
normals to a cube.

00:10:01.115 --> 00:10:06.110
A threefold axis coming
out of body diagonals.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.460
Twofold axes between all of
the fourfold axes that are

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.170
normal to the edges
of the cube.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.830
So all sorts of rotational
symmetry.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:24.020
That, if you want a pattern, has
a triangle that's on about

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.600
each of the threefold axes.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.970
But the one that is up, points
in the opposite orientation of

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.760
the one that's on the threefold
axis coming out of

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.860
the other end of the cube.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.280
So you have one triangle
that's like this, up.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.810
And another triangle like this
that's on the other end of the

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.570
threefold axis that points
down into the blackboard.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.440
What can you add as
other extenders?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.890
You can put in a mirror plane
that is perpendicular to the

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.480
fourfold axis.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.973
And that leaves everything
unchanged.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.720
Now we've got a mirror plane
passing through a fourfold

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.370
axis, so we have to
have mirror planes

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.420
at 45 degree intervals.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.650
And that will create mirror
planes there.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.050
This horizontal mirror plane
goes through this fourfold

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.370
axis, so there must be mirror
planes at 45 degree intervals.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.040
So there's another one
like this and 90

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.930
degrees away as well.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.680
The fourfold axis is
perpendicular to a mirror

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.650
plane, as are these other
twofold axes, so there's an

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.140
inversion center.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.600
Here's a fourfold axis with a
vertical mirror plane going

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:42.930
through it.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.885
And it has to have a vertical
mirror plane going like this

00:11:45.885 --> 00:11:47.090
at 45 degrees away.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.400
So that's the symmetry.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.910
This is the regular symmetry
of a cube or an octahedron.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.880
And I will not, even if
pressured, try to draw a

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.870
pattern that conforms to that.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.990
We've got the fourfold axis

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.990
perpendicular to a mirror plane.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.820
And this is called
O sub h, O with a

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.030
horizontal mirror plane.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:17.590
The fourfold axis in 4, 3,
2 has got a mirror plane

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.670
perpendicular to it.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.860
The twofold axes all pick
up mirror planes

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.230
perpendicular to them.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.270
There's an inversion center at
the point of intersection.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.520
So we label this axis
a 3 bar axis.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.840
So that's O sub h, 4 over
m, 3 bar, 2 over m.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.655
And this, as I say, is the
symmetry of a regular cube or

00:12:37.655 --> 00:12:40.280
an octahedron.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.580
Nothing else we can do here.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.730
There's so many symmetry axes
all over the place that

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.730
there's no way we can snake in
any diagonal mirror plane.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.070
Because there is no second axis
of the same kind adjacent

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.360
to either the twofold,
the threefold, or

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.400
the fourfold axis.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.230
So we can't put a mirror plane
in here between the threefold

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.680
and the twofold.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.245
We can't put a mirror plane in
here between the fourfold and

00:13:03.245 --> 00:13:04.130
the twofold.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.060
So we're done.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.250
And this is the final and
30 second combination.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:14.082
So there are 32 crystallographic
point groups.

00:13:14.082 --> 00:13:14.570
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.280
PROFESSOR: Yes, sir.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:22.084
AUDIENCE: So if m3m is a regular
operation, are there

00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:23.334
symbols [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.190
PROFESSOR: O is the symbol
for 4, 3, 2.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.690
And what we added as an extender
is a mirror plane

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.550
perpendicular to the
fourfold axis.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.000
That is just one way of
adding an extender.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.800
This is also Oi.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.690
If we add an inversion center,
we get all this.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.090
And if you look at the ones
have been honored by being

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:51.250
designated by a symbol, the
horizontal mirror plane takes

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.230
the precedence.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.510
So for example, for 2 over m, 2
over m, 2 over m, you've got

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.930
two different vertical mirror
planes, and you've got one

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.360
horizontal mirror plane.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.820
But it's called 2 over m,
2 over m, 2 over m.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.670
You can call it 2,
2, 2, m, m, m.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:12.050
That's also a possible symbol,
but much more of a mouthful.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.720
There's some arbitrariness
to the symbol because the

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.900
arrangement of symmetry elements
is what's real.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.180
And we decide how we
want to devise a

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.730
notation to label them.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.660
And as we've seen, there are
two different people who

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.690
adopted a different code
for giving them names.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.870
So if it's rational and

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:38.610
informative, it's a good notation.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.650
Interestingly, the international
notation, on the

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.520
one hand, and the Schoenflies
notation, on the other,

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.090
complimentary.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.280
The international notation
tells you

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.260
unambiguously what you have.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.310
So 2, 2, 2 over m, m, m tells
you three orthogonal twofold

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.400
axes if you remember what
came out of [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.320
construction.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.480
And perpendicular to each of
them is a mirror plane.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.170
And that's what you've got.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.590
Schoenflies tells you
how you derived it.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:13.120
You took D2, and that's the
dihedral group 2, 2, 2, and

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.340
you added an h, a horizontal
mirror plane.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.490
And all hell broke loose.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.130
And you got mirror planes
perpendicular to all the

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.320
twofold axes.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.950
So there's a certain
complementarity to the two

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.950
different notations.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.870
And the people who do
diffraction and

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.760
crystallography for the most
part follow the international

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.520
notation, the Hermann-Mauguin
notation.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.810
The people who do condensed
matter physics use the

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.340
Schoenflies notation.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.490
Because it's more inscrutable.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.670
And condensed matter physicists
like to be

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:52.190
inscrutable because it's
how you gain respect.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:58.080
So both notation survive, but
are more prevalent in some

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.930
disciplines than in others
and vice versa.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.590
Let's take a brief look ahead.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.610
What remains to be done?

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.465
We now have the 32
crystallographic point groups.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.410
These are the way things can be
arranged by symmetry about

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.420
a fixed point in space.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.230
If we were to proceed in the
same way that we did for the

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.620
two-dimensional space groups,
what we should do next is

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.960
decide what sort of
three-dimensional space

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.760
lattices these symmetries
will require.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:49.110
And then proceed to drop each of
the point groups into each

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.660
of the lattices that can
accommodate them.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.060
And then use the tricks that
we've used in two dimensions,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.920
take mirror planes and replace
them by glide planes.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.130
And then having done that, we
would take the mirror planes

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:08.160
and the rotation axes
and interweave them.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.060
And lest that job seem too
daunting, let me point out

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.760
that we already have 17
of the space groups.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.089
All we have to do is take
the plane groups, take a

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:21.579
translation that's perpendicular
to the plane of

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.914
the plane group, and let all the
rotation axes and mirror

00:17:24.914 --> 00:17:28.054
planes extend up indefinitely
in three dimensions parallel

00:17:28.054 --> 00:17:30.600
to that translation.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.740
So we already have 17 of the

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.360
three-dimensional space groups.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.430
They look just like the plane
groups except they extend in a

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.020
direction that's perpendicular
to the plane of our original

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.030
two-dimensional group.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.260
So we're already a long
way towards deriving a

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.020
three-dimensional space group
without really knowing it.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.130
But what I would like to
consider next is the lattices

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.870
that are required for
three dimensions.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.160
And I've already given you how
one can approach this problem.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.360
Take the lattices that have
been required in the

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.190
two-dimensional plane groups.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.280
And if the presence of a
threefold axis and the base of

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.510
the cell require, say, net
that is hexagonal with a1

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:29.160
equal to a2 identically in
magnitude and exactly at 120

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.945
degrees with respect
to one another.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.770
Let's let the third translation
be perpendicular

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.170
to the base.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.430
If it's hexagonal, we have
to have at least a

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.690
threefold axis here.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.270
And we've found that adding a
threefold axis to that net

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.830
gave rise to two other threefold
axes in the center

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.200
of the triangle.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.740
So one lattice would be one in
which the third translation,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.850
which we'll label c,
is straight up.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.670
In other words, perpendicular to
the net that we derived in

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.010
two dimensions.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.320
What we will have as a
constraint is that if we pick

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.180
a certain translation that is
not normal to the plane group,

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.080
and let's say it terminates
here in projection.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.130
So the third translation
goes up and over.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.380
If there's a threefold axis at
this end of the translation,

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.010
there must be a threefold
axis at the end of that

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.280
translation.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.200
And that mucks everything up,
and we no longer have a group.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.880
We can't have another threefold
axis poking down

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.520
through the plane of this
two-dimensional plane group.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.300
But it is perfectly OK if the
third translation moves this

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.830
threefold axis and puts down
a lattice point and another

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.590
threefold axis directly
over this one.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.270
Or alternatively, another
choice for T3

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.580
would be this one.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.980
That would put the lattice
point in a threefold axis

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.120
directly over this one.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.790
So again, we have threefold axes
extending normal to the

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.123
plane of my drawing.

00:20:11.123 --> 00:20:14.370
And I've created no
threefold axes.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:19.220
So with a threefold axis, there
are three potentially

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.770
different space lattices, one in
which the third translation

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.760
is normal to the plane of the
plane group, another one where

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.900
the translation terminates
over the

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.200
other two twofold axes.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.290
And so this is the way in which
one would proceed to

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.950
derive the space lattices.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.710
Buerger does not
do it this way.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.180
He doesn't look at
the plane groups.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.150
He looks just at where the
axes sit in the nets.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.150
No mirror planes whatsoever.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.610
And I'll return to the point.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.490
And the place where I think he's
wrong is that if you add

00:20:52.490 --> 00:21:00.410
a twofold axis to a centered
net, you get twofold axes in

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.131
all of these locations.

00:21:04.131 --> 00:21:06.620
These are the twofold
axes in C2mm.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.970
And if that's all you look at,
there's no reason why this

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.100
should be the plane group.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.800
And it looks as though you can
make T3 terminate over this

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.220
twofold axis.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.710
And that would give you a
peculiar triple cell with

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.680
three lattice points along
the long diagonal of

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.720
a rectangular net.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.490
And you say, wow, 15
space lattices.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.970
We're going to be famous,
if not rich.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.620
You can't do that because this
plane group can exist only if

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.330
there are mirror planes
in here like this.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.590
And then through these twofold
axes, these have to be glides.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.820
So you can't take 2mm and
put it on top of 2gg.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.830
It's impossible.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.050
So there are 14 space
lattices.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.500
The 15th doesn't exist.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.000
But it looks as though it's
possible in Buerger's

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.040
treatment when he looks just
at the placement of the

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.180
rotation axes alone and not
the location of any mirror

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.040
planes that are in
the plane groups.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.010
So that is where we're
going to go next.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.000
And that is a process
that actually is

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.670
surprisingly simple.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.120
And we will get the space
lattices very quickly.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.430
We'll get a number of space
groups along the way,

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:28.740
as we've just seen.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.100
And then we will cut to the
bottom line and just look at

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.700
how this information is
tabulated in tables for you in

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.230
a fashion that's analogous to
the representation of the

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.420
plane groups.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.260
So we're pretty close.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.325
We'll be wrapping things up in
another two or three meetings.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.590
What I would like to do in the
time that remains though, the

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.496
point groups are very difficult
to visualize unless

00:22:54.496 --> 00:22:59.130
you look at real crystals.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:03.640
So what I'm going to do is pass
around a collection of

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.360
models of actual crystals.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.870
I'm not sure I can tell you what
every one of these models

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.120
represents.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.740
These are curious things.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.980
I would beg you not to
drop them on one

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.030
of the sharp corners.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.210
These are made out of wood.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:25.200
They're made out of pear wood in
the Black Forest by elves.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.230
No, that last part
is not true.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.700
But they are incredibly
expensive.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.880
Because the angles in
these things have

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.780
to be exactly right.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.140
So they are made on the same
sort of machine that you use

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.480
for faceting diamonds.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.380
It's something that has two
degrees of freedom, so you can

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.220
get a surface that you want on
the material exactly parallel

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.690
to a grinding surface.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.150
And then you have a provision
for advancing it normal to

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.010
that direction by a
controlled amount.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.130
If it were not precise, you
would not see sharp edges and

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.200
sharp corners.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.000
So these are incredibly
expensive.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.310
I, therefore, ask it
that you hold them

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.625
tightly with both hands.

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:08.170
Don't drop them on the floor.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.420
And I'll take around a couple
of handfuls of these.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.660
I don't know if I have
enough for everyone.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.570
With the tables of the point
groups in front of you, why

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:19.040
don't you try to identify the
point group that's possible in

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.290
each of these models.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.640
This is a big one.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.487
So I'm sure you won't
drop that one.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.770
I don't think I have enough for
everyone, so I'll start

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.530
passing them out to every
other person.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.820
Maybe you can look on with the
person adjacent to you.

00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:01.519
Take one of these.

00:25:18.658 --> 00:25:19.908
Pass those over.

00:25:28.598 --> 00:25:29.848
Here you go.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.970
I gave you that just
to be mean.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.167
That is an example of something
that's called a

00:25:48.167 --> 00:25:50.010
twinned crystal.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.770
You can't have reentrant
faces.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.140
Yeah, that's actually two
crystals that are intergrown.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.840
AUDIENCE: So we can't identify
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.090
PROFESSOR: You can look.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.470
Block one of them out in your
mind, and try to imagine what

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.310
it would look like.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.990
Here's an example
of another one.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.220
That's actually gypsum.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.110
And that's a very common
twin in gypsum.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.580
And if you could take
this and rotate it--

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.810
this one doesn't rotate--

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.660
rotate it 90 degrees, then you
would have a crystal that had

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.382
a parallelogram shape.

00:26:34.382 --> 00:26:37.490
And actually that's
been rotated by 90

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.790
degrees about an axis.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.040
That's within the base.

00:26:45.635 --> 00:26:50.366
AUDIENCE: No, no, I think that's
just 4m or 4 over m.

00:26:50.366 --> 00:26:52.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah, there's
no mirror there.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.720
That's a 4 bar, I think.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.570
AUDIENCE: Oh, is that
the inversion?

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.940
PROFESSOR: There's
no-- neither.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.330
I am a touchy-feely guy.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.000
If I see something up here, I
look down here and try to feel

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.020
something that's
parallel to it.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.350
But you're right,
you're right.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.520
If I rotate 90 degrees--

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.650
remember rotoinversion is the
same as rotoreflection.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:15.730
So I could rotate to here
and then reflect down,

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.980
and I get this one.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.210
AUDIENCE: So it's 4 bar.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.080
PROFESSOR: It's 4 bar, yeah.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.470
And you see in the cross
section, it is square.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:28.260
There's a little square on top
here, so there is a fourfold

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.440
aspect to it when you look
at planes in a special

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:30.915
orientation.

00:27:30.915 --> 00:27:33.290
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about 4 bar.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:38.050
4 bar in planes are
twofold rotation.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.870
PROFESSOR: A twofold
pure rotation.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.520
Probably the best example of
4 bar is a tetrahedron.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.350
Two faces on top, two faces
twisted 90 degrees, and

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.110
inverted down.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.006
AUDIENCE: So that means
an 8 bar would be a

00:27:50.006 --> 00:27:50.954
fourfold proper rotation.

00:27:50.954 --> 00:27:53.798
So why cannot I put an 8
bar in the point group?

00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:57.510
Because it's only a fourfold
rotation, and that's allowed.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.720
PROFESSOR: The reason is that
there's no origin to

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.650
translations.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:06.160
So if you had translations in
an 8 bar crystal, you would

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.940
have four translations that were
repeated by rotation and

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.920
then another translation 45
degrees and inverted down.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.760
But you can assemble those
at this same point.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.710
So you would have eight
translations 45 degrees apart.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.240
And that's impossible
in a lattice.

00:28:30.657 --> 00:28:31.480
Need another one?

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.980
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.475
PROFESSOR: Do you need another
one to look at?

00:28:34.475 --> 00:28:35.327
AUDIENCE: No, I'm good.

00:28:35.327 --> 00:28:36.577
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.770
I can't have you just sitting
there doing nothing.

00:28:46.153 --> 00:28:50.049
AUDIENCE: So is this half of
this [INAUDIBLE] material?

00:28:50.049 --> 00:28:52.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's twinned
by a 180 degree

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.872
rotation on the 1, 1, 1 plane.

00:28:54.872 --> 00:28:57.332
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, the
1, 1, 1 [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:00.776 --> 00:29:02.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.960
That is actually half
of an octahedron.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.660
This is a-- whoops,
no, it's not.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.910
Yes, it is.

00:29:25.716 --> 00:29:28.520
No, I think that's just
the threefold--

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.090
3, 3, 3.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.950
3 bar, 2 over m.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.730
And it's been rotated by 180
degrees, which is not a

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:41.450
symmetry transformation.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:45.535
So the 3 bar is rotated
180 degrees.

00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:47.500
AUDIENCE: That's a
3 bar, 2 over m?

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:47.920
PROFESSOR: I think so.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.460
I think it's a 3 bar here, a
face here, and a face down

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:56.100
below, inverted, 60
degrees away.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.970
And they're mirror planes.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:04.785
And there two full axes
perpendicular to those mirror

00:30:04.785 --> 00:30:08.110
planes, I do believe.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.490
AUDIENCE: I don't see
the twofold axes.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.830
PROFESSOR: You're only seeing
half the crystal, and I think

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.080
that's the reason why.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.050
This is the mirror plane here.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.585
And this edge is parallel
to that mirror plane.

00:30:26.585 --> 00:30:29.060
And there's a twofold axis that
comes out of the middle

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.230
of that edge.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.350
You can't see it.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.940
That edge.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.360
And the mirror plane is exactly
parallel to that.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.868
It's tough to see because you're
only seeing half of it.

00:30:39.868 --> 00:30:40.836
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:40.836 --> 00:30:41.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.760
AUDIENCE: This [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.840
This is a fourfold axis

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.015
perpendicular to a mirror plane.

00:30:49.015 --> 00:30:52.420
There's a threefold axis coming
out here and a twofold

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.110
axis coming out here.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.740
And there is a mirror plane
perpendicular to the fourfold

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:01.180
axis and perpendicular to the
twofold axis also under the

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:01.490
mirror plane.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:05.876
So this is 4 over m,
3 bar, 2 over m.

00:31:05.876 --> 00:31:07.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.780
PROFESSOR: That's the
rotational symmetry.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.335
But you get all sorts
of mirror planes

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:12.120
coming through here.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.870
So really, it's this one.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.490
Mirror plane this way, mirror
plane this way,

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:19.996
mirror plane this way.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:30.200
So if we set it up relative to
this, there's the fourfold

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.700
coming out here, here's the
fourfold coming out here.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:40.650
And there are mirror planes this
way and also this way, 45

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.900
degrees away.

00:31:50.915 --> 00:31:52.165
Nothing to do?

00:31:57.125 --> 00:31:58.930
Can I steal one that you're
not working with?

00:31:58.930 --> 00:31:59.480
There's a--

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.730
AUDIENCE: This one
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:18.710
PROFESSOR: That's 2, 3 with
no mirror planes.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:22.790
Oh, no, no, that's not true.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:29.224
No, that is 4 bar, 2m,
believe it or not.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.483
Look at the three different
directions.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.620
These two corners
are the same.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.790
There's a little, tiny
line segment there.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:52.192
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so there is
a mirror plane right here?

00:32:52.192 --> 00:32:54.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but there's no
mirror plane going through

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.010
the other edges.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:00.990
So there's a mirror plane
here, mirror plane here.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.390
And then there is twofold axes
coming out of this little

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.970
straight line segment here.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:07.466
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:33:07.466 --> 00:33:07.962
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:10.120
And that's different
from this.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.544
So these two edges
are the same.

00:33:13.544 --> 00:33:17.265
AUDIENCE: Where is the
principle axis?

00:33:17.265 --> 00:33:19.550
PROFESSOR: The principle
axis would be this one.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.240
AUDIENCE: This one?

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.606
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:21.606 --> 00:33:27.820
AUDIENCE: So basically, I have
this mirror plane right here.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:35.220
Then twofold axis in the
middle of the circle.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:44.625
So now here, where is it?

00:33:44.625 --> 00:33:46.305
PROFESSOR: Well,
it's hexagonal.

00:33:46.305 --> 00:33:47.890
So you want to back
up a little bit.

00:33:53.236 --> 00:33:55.180
Right there.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.124
AUDIENCE: This one?

00:33:57.124 --> 00:33:58.374
PROFESSOR: No, sorry.

00:34:02.956 --> 00:34:04.920
This one.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.590
Threefold axis, twofold.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.538
That's perpendicular
to a mirror plane.

00:34:09.538 --> 00:34:11.410
AUDIENCE: So here's
my mirror plane.

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.730
PROFESSOR: Coming right out
of this little edge here.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.554
AUDIENCE: Let's say like this.

00:34:18.554 --> 00:34:19.466
No mirror plane?

00:34:19.466 --> 00:34:21.750
PROFESSOR: No.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.630
AUDIENCE: Which one
is this one?

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.679
It's like this one.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.900
PROFESSOR: Let's put
it right here.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.726
Here is--

00:34:29.726 --> 00:34:30.699
AUDIENCE: Like this?

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:34.219
PROFESSOR: No, you've got
to get it up like this.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.290
OK.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.830
There is a mirror plane.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.400
AUDIENCE: No, this is not.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.211
No, the mirror plane
is right here.

00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:45.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.584
It goes up like--

00:34:48.584 --> 00:34:50.500
oh.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.969
Let me get it set up here.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:54.300
OK.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.830
There is the mirror plane.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.620
This face is different
from the others.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.452
AUDIENCE: And the twofold
axes are on the edges.

00:35:03.452 --> 00:35:04.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:07.437
AUDIENCE: So basically,
there are three

00:35:07.437 --> 00:35:09.345
for one mirror plane.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.420
PROFESSOR: Here are the mirror
planes coming through this

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.760
way, this way, this way.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.080
They're 60 degrees apart.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.520
AUDIENCE: You say there are
three mirror planes?

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this one,
this one, and this one.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.470
AUDIENCE: I don't agree.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.696
This one is no mirror plane.

00:35:28.696 --> 00:35:30.055
PROFESSOR: You're right.

00:35:30.055 --> 00:35:31.751
You're right.

00:35:31.751 --> 00:35:35.030
AUDIENCE: There is only one
when you look from above.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.445
But there are two for
just [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:40.870
45 degrees-- or,
not 45 degrees.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.120
That's a triangle.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.410
PROFESSOR: It's a
terrible one.

00:36:17.218 --> 00:36:19.450
AUDIENCE: Because if we decide
that the top is one, the

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.020
principle--

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.420
PROFESSOR: There's
a twofold axis.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.220
That's a mirror plane, and
that's a mirror plane.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.140
And it looks like it is 2nn.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.761
I think it's 2nn.

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:39.647
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:39.647 --> 00:36:40.609
There's nothing further?

00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:41.859
PROFESSOR: Nothing further.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.090
Got that one?

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:49.440
AUDIENCE: 4 bar 2m?

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.320
I had to look to find
a twofold axis.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.270
That was the tricky part.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.388
PROFESSOR: No, no
threefold axis.

00:36:54.388 --> 00:36:55.296
AUDIENCE: Well, twofold.

00:36:55.296 --> 00:36:57.112
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:57.112 --> 00:36:59.904
AUDIENCE: Finding those
was [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:59.904 --> 00:37:00.840
PROFESSOR: That's it.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.480
AUDIENCE: I can see
the mirror planes.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.790
PROFESSOR: That's the
twofold axis.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.710
PROFESSOR: And this two on top
and two underneath skewed by

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.730
90 degrees, that's a 4 bar.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.090
So that's 4 bar 2m.

00:37:19.382 --> 00:37:22.300
You have nothing to do?

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.680
Oh, you're talking
with them, OK.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.650
AUDIENCE: What is this
one actually?

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:41.030
There is 4, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 3.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.465
PROFESSOR: Right,
so it's cubic.

00:37:43.465 --> 00:37:49.540
And mirror planes are going down
through the twofold axis.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.190
So that's enough to tell
you that it is this.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.810
So let's set it up here.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.860
Fourfold axes are coming
out of the points.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.210
So you've got mirror
planes this way,

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.260
mirror point 45 degrees.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.240
Here is this twofold axis.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.710
Here is this twofold axis.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.360
And here are the twofold axes
that are in the same plane.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.810
And here's the other
fourfold axis.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.060
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.590
That one's not fair.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:34.180
This is actually two crystals
that are grown together by an

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.780
operation that is
not a symmetry

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.320
element of the crystal.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.430
And actually these
two crystals have

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.300
symmetry 2 over m.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.460
And they are rotated relative
to one another by

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.780
a 180 degree rotation.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.360
It's not a symmetry element.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.440
So this is something that's
called a twinned crystal.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:54.740
AUDIENCE: Twinned?

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.960
PROFESSOR: Twinned crystal.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.170
So it's really two of them.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:02.580
And if I could twist this one
around so that the crystal

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.500
continued on in that direction,
it would be

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.890
something that had a
lozenge-like shape.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:09.340
So I should put that one away.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.170
That's only confusing people.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.250
AUDIENCE: Professor Wuensch?

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:12.620
PROFESSOR: Yes, sir.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.870
AUDIENCE: Is that
a 6 over mmm?

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:21.090
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's 6 over
m, 2 over m, 2 over m.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.410
Six folds.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.730
Two kinds of twofold,
one out of the edge,

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.880
one out of the corner.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.810
And a mirror plane

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.810
perpendicular to each of those.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.650
6 over m, 2 over m, 2 over m.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:36.386
AUDIENCE: So that's the same
thing [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:40.494 --> 00:39:42.979
So the 6 over m comes
from this way.

00:39:42.979 --> 00:39:45.464
And then the 2 over
m is there.

00:39:45.464 --> 00:39:47.452
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:47.452 --> 00:39:48.702
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.150
PROFESSOR: Let me put
that one away.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.700
It's just confusing people.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.460
AUDIENCE: Oh, that
one was easy.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.800
PROFESSOR: That's a
twinned crystal.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.240
It was easy?

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:57.920
You found it easy?

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
3 over m, right?

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I guess.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.850
This looks as though it might be
the corner of an octahedron

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:13.920
because you don't
see much of it.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.490
But these two faces and these
two faces are not related by a

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.740
fourfold rotation.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.370
AUDIENCE: Well, either way,
there wouldn't be anywhere to

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:23.330
put a fourfold rotation.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.590
So if you look at the whole
thing, this is actually two

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.690
intergrown crystals when
you see this sort

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.110
of reentrant angle.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:36.570
This is two crystals grown
together by an operation which

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:39.252
is not a symmetry operation.

00:40:39.252 --> 00:40:40.797
So this is something
that's called a

00:40:40.797 --> 00:40:42.420
twin, a twinned crystal.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.830
AUDIENCE: But the symmetry is

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:45.650
nevertheless 3 over m, correct?

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:46.330
PROFESSOR: Of the whole thing?

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:47.550
Yeah, yeah, of the
whole thing.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:50.100
AUDIENCE: And this is just 3.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.750
PROFESSOR: No, this is 3mm.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.075
There's a mirror plane
down there and a

00:40:59.075 --> 00:41:00.210
mirror plane down here.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.020
AUDIENCE: You're right.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.980
PROFESSOR: No twofold axis
because this end is different

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.100
from this end.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.580
AUDIENCE: So this is a
regular solid, right?

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.050
What is it called?

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:12.188
PROFESSOR: This is a rhombic
dodecahedron.

00:41:12.188 --> 00:41:14.164
AUDIENCE: Oh, the one you were
talking about the other day.

00:41:14.164 --> 00:41:14.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:19.640
This is 4, 3, 2.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.890
And then mirror planes too
all over the place.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:23.630
AUDIENCE: So all of these
solids do not have to be

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.840
members of this list, right?

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.460
Because these are
finite objects.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.610
They can be [? twelvefold ?]
and--

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:31.290
PROFESSOR: They could be.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.110
These actually, in fact,
are models of

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.820
real crystalline materials.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.490
And they're made with the faces
and the relative sizes

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:41.835
that these minerals
actually have.

00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:43.760
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.020
PROFESSOR: So somewhere floating
around is something

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.830
that's very characteristically
quartz.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.095
And there's one that's a flat
one with a reentrant angle in

00:41:52.095 --> 00:41:53.345
it, that's gypsum.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
fourfold.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.560
Twofold here.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.900
This goes into this.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.740
No mirror planes because these
things are inclined.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.942
So it's 4, 2, 2.

00:42:15.942 --> 00:42:17.192
Good.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.430
It's easy when you know
what to look for.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:24.010
When you say, they are only
a few possibilities.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:27.630
And if I see a fourfold axis in
it, that narrows it down to

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:28.880
two or three.

00:42:43.385 --> 00:42:43.870
AUDIENCE: Like that.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:48.525
That's an inversion center
running through here.

00:42:48.525 --> 00:42:51.614
And there's no rotation
there [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:51.614 --> 00:42:53.606
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] here?

00:42:53.606 --> 00:42:55.598
Here through this way?

00:42:58.586 --> 00:43:02.072
AUDIENCE: No, because this
doesn't map [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:09.044
Does that map that
by a mirror?

00:43:09.044 --> 00:43:11.036
The mirror [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:11.036 --> 00:43:13.526
AUDIENCE: It cuts
across this way.

00:43:13.526 --> 00:43:16.514
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
could buy that.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:23.070
PROFESSOR: You've reached
a consensus?

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.690
AUDIENCE: We've got a mirror,
and we've got an inversion.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.240
But we're not sure what
else we've got.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.471
AUDIENCE: While I like
the inversion, I'd

00:43:30.471 --> 00:43:31.721
also like the mirror.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.240
I don't see the mirror.

00:43:49.492 --> 00:43:51.977
All I see is a really an
inversion axis there.

00:43:51.977 --> 00:43:55.960
I think I'm missing that mirror
that you're saying.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.610
PROFESSOR: There's a mirror
that goes down this way.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.800
And there's a twofold
axis here.

00:44:03.395 --> 00:44:04.790
AUDIENCE: OK, that was
the one we missed.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:06.570
PROFESSOR: So that's 2 over m.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:09.340
AUDIENCE: Over m.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.860
And the inversion
just falls out.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
in there too.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.980
Inversions are nice.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.340
You can feel inversions.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.160
You put your finger on one face
and your finger on the

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.380
other face.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.630
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:39.092 --> 00:44:39.584
PROFESSOR: Get it?

00:44:39.584 --> 00:44:40.950
AUDIENCE: So this is
this one, right?

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.890
PROFESSOR: Yes, very good.

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:47.865
And that is a silicate mineral
called garnet.

00:44:47.865 --> 00:44:48.820
AUDIENCE: What's that?

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.060
PROFESSOR: Garnet.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.030
It's actually a silicate
mineral, which is used as a

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.280
gemstone sometimes.

00:45:08.526 --> 00:45:10.490
AUDIENCE: So this should
be a 4, 3, 2 face.

00:45:13.436 --> 00:45:14.418
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:45:14.418 --> 00:45:15.891
AUDIENCE: But I don't know
if it's the end of the

00:45:15.891 --> 00:45:17.141
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:21.783 --> 00:45:24.238
Could be m3m.

00:45:24.238 --> 00:45:25.488
AUDIENCE: Where are the--

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.610
it doesn't an inversion
center.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:30.296
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:45:30.296 --> 00:45:32.470
AUDIENCE: It doesn't have an
inversion center here.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:33.140
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah, it does.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:33.790
PROFESSOR: Oh yes, it does.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:36.060
Yes, it does.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.430
Actually, the thing to
look for are the

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.290
high symmetry things.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.350
Your eye spots them.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.720
That's got a fourfold
axis in it.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.440
OK

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.140
So are there other
fourfold axes?

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.720
Yes, yes.

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.930
So that has to be based
on 4, 3, 2.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.970
Because you have three
orthogonal fourfold axes.

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:54.710
Threefold is here.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:55.860
Twofold axis is here.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.110
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:06.045 --> 00:46:07.295
PROFESSOR: OK, thanks.

00:46:09.588 --> 00:46:11.049
AUDIENCE: There are--

00:46:11.049 --> 00:46:12.742
oh, I already saw those ones.

00:46:12.742 --> 00:46:14.370
PROFESSOR: You want to
look at some more?

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.170
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:16.420
PROFESSOR: Enough for one day?

00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:23.687
AUDIENCE: Professor Wuensch,
I've been staring at this one

00:46:23.687 --> 00:46:24.735
for such a long time.

00:46:24.735 --> 00:46:28.400
And I couldn't match it
with anything on here.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:34.090
PROFESSOR: This looks like a
tetrahedron except the face is

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.340
puckered up into this
little thing.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.810
So the way I would start with
saying, OK, this is

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:41.880
tetrahedral in which case if I
make these things flat, that's

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.130
a perfect tetrahedron.

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.500
Four sides.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.590
But what's happened is
that this face is

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:47.840
not quite 1, 1, 1.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.740
The 4 bar axes come out these
three directions.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:00.220
And they have got twofold
symmetry, mirror planes

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.550
running through the
twofold axes.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.940
This is the 4 bar axis with
mirror planes running this

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.490
way, this way.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:12.603
So this is actually 4 bar.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.840
This is still further.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.090
It's a cubic crystal.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:31.360
This is based on the tetrahedral
symmetry.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.115
Here is the 4 bar axis.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:43.460
Mirror plane this way, mirror
plane this way.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.260
Another 4 bar coming out
of these two edges.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:50.020
And then these are the diagonal
mirror planes.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.635
So this is it.

00:47:53.635 --> 00:47:56.373
AUDIENCE: I think I was looking
for a threefold axis

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:57.100
in the center.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:02.720
PROFESSOR: No, the 4 bar comes
out of the edge of the

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.970
tetrahedron.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.690
And this is the other 4
bar coming out here.

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:13.270
Threefold like this and mirror
planes going through the

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.312
threefold axis like that.

00:48:15.312 --> 00:48:18.230
AUDIENCE: I see it.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:19.860
PROFESSOR: It's hard when
you look at this thing.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.060
I never saw this thing before.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.020
What's here?

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:25.410
But if you know the results
have to be 1 of these 32

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.580
possibilities, and this is
obviously cubic, and it's

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.580
based on the tetrahedron, that
means there are only three

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.350
possibilities.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:33.820
No mirror planes.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.110
If you find one mirror plane,
you ask yourself, does the

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.590
mirror plane go through the
threefold axis, or does it

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:41.110
miss the threefold axis?

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:43.930
It goes through the threefold
axis, so it's got to be this.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:47.500
And then you know just
what to look for.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.650
AUDIENCE: Is it just
[INAUDIBLE] m?

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:53.120
PROFESSOR: This is
a dirty one.

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.130
This is a dirty one.

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:58.140
If you look at this very
carefully, this face is the

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.265
same as this face, but it's
not the same as that one.

00:49:01.265 --> 00:49:02.850
It's a little bigger.

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:07.760
So if you say, what's in here,
these two things do not come

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.400
together at a common vertex
like these two.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.250
There's another little line
segment between these faces.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.380
So there are no threefold
axes coming out of this.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.230
Looks like it might
be tetrahedral.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:23.070
Clearly, a mirror plane
going this way.

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:30.180
And then there is also a twofold
axis coming out here.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:37.430
So there's a 2 over m and
another 2 over m.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.890
I did this once before with
somebody, and this is the

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.678
hardest one in the whole set.

00:50:02.305 --> 00:50:03.780
So a mirror plane this way.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.570
There's got to be another mirror
plane because there's a

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.820
twofold axis.

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.162
4 bar.

00:50:19.162 --> 00:50:24.940
Up, down, up, down.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:31.878
So this is 4 bar, 2 over m.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.810
4 bar, 2 over m.

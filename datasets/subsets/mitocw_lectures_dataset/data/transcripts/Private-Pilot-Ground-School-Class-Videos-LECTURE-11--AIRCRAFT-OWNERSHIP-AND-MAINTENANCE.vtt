WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
[SOUND EFFECTS]

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.890
PHILIP GREENSPUN: All right.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.800
Let's talk about aircraft
ownership and maintenance.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.710
Some of this stuff actually,
oddly enough, is on the test.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.458
What does it cost
to own an airplane?

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:33.000
Most people say, I
can't afford that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.250
But then you see them
buy a brand new car

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.588
or renovate their
kitchen for $200,000.

00:00:39.588 --> 00:00:41.130
So I don't know what
their excuse is.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.000
It's actually not expensive
to own a four-seat airplane.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.890
There's so many out there.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.780
There were more pilots
in the '70s and '80s,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.320
when these airplanes were
built in large quantities.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.050
The owner of East
Coast Aero Club, Mark,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.190
he says that, in the '80s,
there was a waiting list even

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.630
for a tie down at Hanscom.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.330
Now there's ample parking.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.410
The hangar space is
still a little bit tight,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.980
but if you just want to
get a Cessna and pay,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.460
it's actually a lot cheaper to
tie a Cessna down at Hanscom

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.490
than it is to park
a car in Cambridge.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.870
And there's plenty of room.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.110
He said every
firefighter, every teacher

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.970
used to have a family airplane.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.160
So the airplanes are
relatively inexpensive to buy--

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.660
$20,000, $30,000 for something
that's airworthy for VFR use,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.140
for basic VFR use.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.700
And you can see the prices here.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.690
The depreciation would
be pretty close to zero

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.890
for those lower-end airplanes.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.030
Anyway, all that said,
it's still cheaper

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.240
to rent from a flight
school if you're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.480
going to fly 100 hours a year,
paying $150 or $200 an hour

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.170
to a flight school is still
cheaper, and it's a lot easier.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.300
For people for whom
owning may actually

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.270
make a little bit
of rational sense,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.740
it never truly
makes sense compared

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.390
to just getting everywhere
in your Toyota Camry.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.830
That if you fly a whole ton,
more than 100 hours a year,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.010
and the fixed costs of
insurance and storage and stuff

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.180
won't kill you, if you
have to use the airplane

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.840
to make regular long trips
somewhere and then just park it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.110
away from the home airport,
then it makes sense.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.870
And a lot of people,
also, you know

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.720
you can't fly, if you
have multiple airplanes,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.540
you can't fly them
all at the same time.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.730
And even one airplane,
it's a little bit hard

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.000
to use everyday the way
you would use a car.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.650
So partnerships with two to
four people are pretty common.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.560
And that cuts the
cost dramatically

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.650
without really
impairing the utility.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.750
I shared an airplane
for years with a guy,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.690
and I don't think we
ever conflicted on when

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.700
we wanted to use the plane.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.680
All right.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.770
This is some stuff that you
want to know a little bit.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.850
If you're an owner,
it's really critical.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.470
And if you're a renter, some
of the stuff is still relevant.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.760
So the owner or operator, if
you think about a leaseback

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.450
airplane to the flight
school, the leaseback owner

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.420
is any individual, perhaps.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.647
And the flight school
becomes the operator.

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.230
And they're the ones
who are primarily

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.420
responsible for making sure
the airplane is airworthy,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.510
that it gets its
annual inspection,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.660
and that it has a logbook.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.610
However, the pilot
is also responsible.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.780
And if the pilot knows that
something's inoperative,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.250
and it's not required,
then it's still

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.700
legal to fly the airplane
in a lot of circumstances

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.320
as long as that piece of
equipment is placarded inop.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.940
And maybe the breaker
is pulled, for example,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.240
on a GPS unit
that's not working.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.040
After maintenance,
then a private pilot

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.580
with no passengers
can make entry

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.790
in the logbook saying that
the test flight was done.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.773
The core inspection
is every 12 months.

00:04:20.773 --> 00:04:22.190
For a privately
owned airplane, it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.403
has to have an
annual inspection.

00:04:24.403 --> 00:04:25.820
Typically it won't
fly a whole lot

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.970
more than 100 hours during that
year if it's just one person

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.960
flying it.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.080
But the 100-hour
requirement only

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.580
becomes necessary
when the airplane

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.120
is operated commercially,
like at a flight school.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.010
So that's 100 hours of flight
time, not engine running time.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.720
So if it's taxiing
around the airport,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.920
the engine might be running
for 120 or 130 hours

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.030
to build up 100
hours of flight time.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.860
You say, well,
god, these airlines

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.920
must have to tear
the airplane apart,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.850
open all the inspection
panels every week or two.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.070
Jets have their own
maintenance schedule that

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.250
supersedes this FAA guidance.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.725
Even modest-sized
jets often have a 300

00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:12.530
or a 600-hour service Interval.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.930
The Pilatus PC-12, it was
recently extended to 300 hours,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.210
for example.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.080
OK, Tina covered this before.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.910
The transponder has to
be inspected and sort of

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.850
recertified every
couple of years.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.830
Emergency locator transmitters--
if it's a civil airplane,

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.950
91.207 says it
has to have an ELT

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.490
except in certain circumstances.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.820
So gliders, helicopters, things
like that don't really need it,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.783
I don't think.

00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:43.700
Maybe the glider does.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.408
I don't think so.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.907
So the FAA really
wants to ensure

00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:57.990
that every aircraft that's
flying around in the US

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.360
has a comprehensive
logbook going back

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.190
to the birth of the aircraft,
the birth of the propeller,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.110
and the birth of the engine.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.480
Engines, when they get
remanufactured by somebody

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.380
like Lycoming or Continental,
they get a zero-time logbook.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.010
So that logbook might only
go back four or five years.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.130
But the logbook for the
airframe should go back

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.990
to when it was made.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.830
If the logbook ever
gets lost, the airplane

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.590
is significantly
devalued, because stuff

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.120
has to be reconstructed.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.450
And you can never really be
sure what's happened to it.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.380
OK.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.370
There are airworthiness
directives that legally

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.120
have to be applied to aircraft.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.970
If the manufacturer
issues a service bulletin,

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.030
you don't have to do that,
especially if you're not

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.575
operating the
airplane commercially,

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:55.140
like as an airline or a charter.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.750
But airworthiness
directives are mandatory.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.660
So let's see if I can
think of an example.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.620
I think there were some Cessna
seats that were sliding back,

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.400
so people were trying
to fly their Cessna

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.927
and the seat wasn't really
locked into position.

00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:14.010
So that's the kind of thing
where an airworthiness

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.600
directive would be negotiated
between Cessna and the FAA.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.360
And it would be issued, and they
might say, within the next 10

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.350
flight hours, you have to
go and get new seat rails

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.680
for your Cessna to make sure
that it doesn't slide back

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.090
inadvertently.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.705
If there's a plane--

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:34.320
if there's something
really serious,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.260
they may issue an emergency
airworthiness directive

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.360
and say, everything's
grounded until you

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.400
apply this fix or change.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.830
Here is just an
example, actually.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.747
What did we find here?

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.110
This was for Cirruses.

00:07:53.876 --> 00:07:55.740
Ah.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.070
In-flight cabin
door separation--

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.760
that's not good.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.660
[LAUGHS] One was
total separation.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.330
One was retained
by the door strut.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.110
We're issuing this AD to prevent
in-flight failure of the cabin

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.160
door.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.720
OK, well, it's nice to
have two doors, I guess.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.613
That's the takeaway
from this one.

00:08:18.613 --> 00:08:21.280
I don't know what they said that
you have to do-- yeah, threads,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.810
leaves, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.430
Oh, but it says within 50 hours.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.290
See that?

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.020
Within the next 50
hours time in service.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.330
So they don't consider
that an emergency.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.480
And actually, if you
ever do take off,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.789
don't slam an aircraft door.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.870
They tend to be fragile.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.830
The latches, various techniques
have been tried over the years

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.150
by various manufacturers.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.000
None of them are as
foolproof as car doors,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.970
because they don't have the
weight budget that a car has.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.310
So if a door does
pop open in flight,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.460
it's actually not
hazardous as long

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.100
as you're not so
startled that you

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.660
do something crazy on takeoff.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.180
They'll usually pop open
just as you're climbing out,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.300
and you're like, whoa,
what's that noise?

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.170
Anyway, just remember, as Tina
said, keep flying the airplane.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.970
And don't over-focus
on something

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.050
that's not related to the
aircraft attitude and power.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:22.510
OK, part 43 is mostly stuff
that certified AMT mechanics

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.570
need to know.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.320
It's illegal, actually for--

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.500
this is one reason
why owning an airplane

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.730
is better than owning a boat.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.000
It's illegal for you to
work on your own airplane,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.720
more or less.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.110
[LAUGHS] So you have to have an
FAA-certified mechanic do it.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.980
You can't spend every weekend
monkeying with your airplane.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.660
There are a handful of things
pilots are allowed to do.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.010
You can replace a tire.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.290
You can add oil.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:56.945
You can-- there's an
enumerated list, 31 items.

00:09:56.945 --> 00:09:58.320
A lot of those
are kind of more--

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.010
you can change a spark plug--

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.540
related to bush pilots.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.840
If you're up in Alaska, or
northern Minnesota, or out

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.890
in the middle of Maine, and
you want to change something,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.460
instead of being stuck, you can
carry a spark plug and a wrench

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.640
and get yourself
back to the hangar.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.490
But it's unconventional for
people with certified airplanes

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.460
to do much in the
way of maintenance.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.290
One exception is
owner-assisted annuals.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.340
Some people who are very
mechanically inclined

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.540
like to work with
an AMT and help out.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.350
If you do this stuff,
you have to sign it off

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:46.320
by making a logbook entry
with your certificate number

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.640
and what kind of certificate.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.478
So if you change
the oil, you still

00:10:49.478 --> 00:10:51.520
have to log it even though
you're not a mechanic.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.937
You just say, I'm a pilot, and
here's my pilot certificate

00:10:53.937 --> 00:10:54.840
number.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.550
All right, if that's
too much work,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.092
and you still really just want
to own an airplane because you

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:01.680
want to say that
I own an airplane,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.588
you can buy an airplane.

00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:05.880
And then if you're not going
to fly it 200 hours a year

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.010
or more, you can lease
it to a flight school

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.410
and let the flight
school be responsible

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.120
for the maintenance.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.570
A lot of people do this to
take advantage of depreciation.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.600
Let's say they're
a medical doctor.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.590
They start a side business
working with a flight school,

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.080
and they're now in the
aircraft rental business.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.380
And they take a 100%
deduction for their airplane.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.960
It hasn't really been
completely tested by the IRS.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.090
Leasing is supposed
to be a passive loss,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.590
and you're not
supposed to offset it

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.320
against active income.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.290
So people come up with various
gimmicks where the flight

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.750
school is marketing
their aircraft for rental

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.270
to other people.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:50.310
Anyway, they're taking
$700,000 or $800,000 write-off

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.820
in one year against their
million dollar income

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.200
as a physician.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.180
And now they have
a free airplane.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.250
And that's why you can
go to the flight school

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.962
and rent one of these beautiful
new airplanes for $250 an hour.

00:12:02.962 --> 00:12:04.920
It sounds like a lot,
but take advantage of it,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.490
because they're basically giving
you the airplane for free.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.980
OK, what if that's
not enough work?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.110
Well, go to Oshkosh in July.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.070
I'll be there.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.490
And we can go check out
all the kit airplanes,

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.320
and you can meet
people who say they've

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.870
spent 13 years building
their airplane,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.680
and now they're
finally flying it.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.860
So in theory, the airplane
has to be built by this--

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.140
the intent was some
person who was then

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.360
going to fly it had
to build half of it.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.420
But you know, LLCs
are also people,

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.030
as far as the regulations
are concerned.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.350
So basically, the LLC becomes
the builder of record.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:51.690
And the LLC is formed between
somebody who actually knows

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.300
what he or she is
doing and the pilot who

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.030
just wants to fly the cool
experimental airplane.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.830
And then when the
builder's finished,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.560
the pilot buys out the builder.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.830
There are a lot of
limitations on experimentals.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.860
Oh yeah, another technique
is the factory-assist build.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.290
So to show that people
have done a lot of work,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.320
they'll go down to the
factory, and they'll change

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.890
their clothing every two hours.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.190
And they'll have all these
pictures of themselves doing

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.747
various work on the aircraft.

00:13:19.747 --> 00:13:21.330
And then they can
show that to the FAA

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.240
and say, look, I was
putting on the wings.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.960
I was doing this.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.592
I was doing that.

00:13:26.592 --> 00:13:27.900
[LAUGHS]

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.150
All right, you can't use
the aircraft commercially.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.990
And if your passenger
gets into the airplane,

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.210
right in front of
the passenger will

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.330
be this scary-looking sign that
says, this is experimental,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.530
doesn't meet FAA standards.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.060
So the passenger is warned
that there's a lot more risk

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.590
than flying a Cessna.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.370
So you might say,
well, why is it riskier

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.860
than a Cessna or a Cirrus?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.460
And I talked to Alan
Klapmeier about this,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.710
one of the founders of Cirrus.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.418
I said, how come these
experimentals have

00:14:04.418 --> 00:14:07.800
so much better numbers
for payload or speed

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.730
than certified planes
like the Cirrus?

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.410
So part of it is
that they're relieved

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.870
of a lot of the
forgivingness requirements

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:16.980
of certified airplanes.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.080
So they're a little
bit trickier to handle.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.810
You might have a
higher stall speed.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:28.320
They're just not as
idiot-proof and as stable

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.620
as a Cessna Piper or Cirrus.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.930
The other issue is
that they don't have

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.220
as much redundant structure.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.500
With an experimental,
you're allowed

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.110
to assume that the construction
process was perfect,

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.960
that there were no defects,
there were no missing screws,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.040
that nobody dropped a tool and
damaged part of the structure

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.560
during construction.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.495
But a certified airplane,
you have to show to the FAA

00:14:51.495 --> 00:14:53.580
that even if all
kinds of bad stuff

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.417
goes on during manufacturing,
and then the airplane's

00:14:57.417 --> 00:14:59.250
buttoned up so that
those parts can't really

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.500
be inspected
afterwards, it still

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.600
meets all of the
structural requirements.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.820
That's why you see
these crazy YouTube

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.380
videos of wings being tested.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.260
The transport category
aircraft are only

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.870
supposed to be
certified to 2.5 Gs,

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.440
and the wings don't break
until they put 9 Gs on them.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.230
Partly they're over-designing
because it's good engineering

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.290
practice, but also
because they have

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.970
to over-design to
some extent because it

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.330
has to do 2.5 G's even
if a lot of mistakes

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.555
were made during
the manufacturing.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.400
So experimentals-- there's
not really a free lunch.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.200
It's not like they're better
than a Cessna or Piper.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.430
They're subject to kind
of different rules.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.730
The one element where
they are arguably better

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.680
is that, with composites,
you're allowed to--

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.510
it becomes practical to
make arbitrary shapes.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.290
If you're fabricating
sheet metal,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.950
there's a limit
to how exotic you

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.940
can get at a reasonable price,
whereas planes like the Cirrus

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.843
and then some of these
experimentalists,

00:16:05.843 --> 00:16:07.510
you can have a nice
smooth skin, and you

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.610
can make any shape you want.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.600
It's closer to an ideal airflow.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.250
But otherwise,
there's no free lunch.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.500
If it has better payload,
that's because they took out

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.220
all the redundant structure
that makes a certified airplane

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.750
a little safer.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.810
All right, renter pilots
are still responsible,

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.660
to some extent, for this stuff.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.950
You've got to make sure
the aircraft is airworthy.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.260
You can't pin it all
on the flight school.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.460
If you see something hanging
loose, or there's no oil in it,

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.870
then it's your responsibility
to call the mechanic over

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.220
to re-secure the panel
or put some oil in.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.230
You want to make sure
that the airplane has

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.800
airworthiness certificate.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.430
The registration
used to last forever.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.060
Now it expires
every three years.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.390
So I guess if you're in a
brand new flight school,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.100
and you don't know
everybody there,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.690
it's worth at least paying some
attention to the registration.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.190
The AFM/POH, or owner's
manual, if you want

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.630
to be colloquial about it--

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.208
that has to be
onboard the aircraft.

00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:11.500
Usually the weight and balance
is not a separate thing.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.190
It's just inside the POH.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.200
And you have to also
report accidents.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.302
We'll talk about that more in
the seaplane lecture, [LAUGHS]

00:17:20.302 --> 00:17:24.550
since sloppiness in
the seaplane tends

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.280
to be more likely to
lead to an accident.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.810
All right, so you are
responsible for the operation

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.280
of the aircraft.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.450
And with responsibility comes
the authority and ability

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.520
to deviate from the
rules in an emergency.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.660
You can just say,
you know, Cirrus

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:49.540
707 whiskey tango emergency
landing at this nearby Air

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.440
Force base.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.160
And they can't really
bust you for that.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.010
If later they come
and say, well, we

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.470
want to know why you landed
at the Air Force base,

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:04.105
then you have to you
respond with what

00:18:04.105 --> 00:18:05.230
led you to want to do that.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.670
But if they don't request you to
do that, then there's no need.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.460
So basically, you can
just read the slide.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.240
But abort the mission
if you see something

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.520
broken during the pre-flight.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.560
All right, here's a standard
airworthiness certificate

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.560
there on the bottom right.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.540
When was it issued?

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.443
1995.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.360
So I think that's when
the airplane was built.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.750
The airworthiness
certificate should tell you

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.860
when the manufacturing
process terminated.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.070
Start shopping.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.070
So if you look at
Controller.com,

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.630
that's where your
higher-end aircraft are.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.620
And Trade-a-Plane is
that big yellow book

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.020
that some of you guys may
have seen at flight schools.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.980
Barnstormers.com is
the homebuilt center.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.710
Before we take
questions, I'll just

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:12.887
close by telling
you all that's fine.

00:19:12.887 --> 00:19:14.095
But it's not really rational.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:21.300
Having done one aileron roll
and one loop in my life,

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.280
do I need a GameBird?

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.870
No.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.880
But it's only $400 grand,
and I want a GameBird.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:33.055
[LAUGHS] And wouldn't it be
cool to arrive in a GameBird?

00:19:33.055 --> 00:19:34.180
Look at that luggage space.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.951
You could put in probably three
packs of crush-proof cigarettes

00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:48.640
[LAUGHS] and a
spare pair of socks,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.400
like Charles Lindbergh
used to travel with.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.190
So anyway, yeah that
ownership stuff--

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:59.180
it's never a rational
decision to buy an aircraft

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.180
unless you're planning
on dying rich.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.900
Why not?

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.510
Actually jetAVIVA
has this thing.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.375
Their whole tagline for
this airplane brokerage

00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:08.745
is life is short, fly a jet.

00:20:08.745 --> 00:20:10.870
[LAUGHS]

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.840
Does anyone have any exciting
questions about maintenance

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.235
and your responsibilities
as a pilot?

00:20:16.235 --> 00:20:17.860
OK, there's a little
bit of interaction

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.605
there between the
pilot and the mechanic.

00:20:21.605 --> 00:20:23.230
You can't practically
check everything.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.750
You have to rely
on mechanics, who

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.470
are generally quite reliable.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.225
And they're FAA-certificated.

00:20:30.225 --> 00:20:31.600
But you have to
have a little bit

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.530
of common sense about not
accepting a broken airplane

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.445
or helicopter.

00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:37.070
Oh, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
build your own airplane

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:42.945
how [INAUDIBLE] does the process
of [INAUDIBLE] certification

00:20:42.945 --> 00:20:43.538
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:43.538 --> 00:20:45.580
PHILIP GREENSPUN: If you
build your own airplane?

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.532
PHILIP GREENSPUN: My friend
Christian can answer that.

00:20:49.532 --> 00:20:50.740
There may be a YouTube video.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.420
But anyway, I think
the FAA is supposed

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.080
to inspect at one or two
points during the construction.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.620
I'm not 100% sure
about that, But I

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.890
think that they may come in.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.050
More importantly,
there is, like,

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.410
40 hours of flight testing
that has to be done.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.400
And you can't go
over populated areas

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.110
during that flight testing.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.100
And you get cut loose, I
think, after 40 or 50 hours

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.785
in the experimental world.

00:21:16.785 --> 00:21:18.160
It's never been
attractive to me.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.590
I mean, if you talk to the
people who do experimentals,

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.040
they're really passionate
about building and tinkering.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.550
They actually have very
few hours of flight time

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.720
accumulated.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.000
And that becomes a problem,
because their pilot--

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.790
even if they were a good
pilot when they started,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.080
after spending 13 years
in a garage building,

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.580
their pilot skills
are pretty rusty.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.350
[LAUGHS]

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.120
TINA SRIVASTAVA: I
would also recommend

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.960
that you ask Sebastian.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.560
If you guys remember, Sebastian
came yesterday afternoon

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.580
from the flying club.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.560
And he was discussing
how they're

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.360
getting that plane refurbished.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.240
He had a picture with
the wing not attached,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.110
and now the wing is attached.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.600
So I believe that he's going
through that airworthiness

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.930
process right now.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.948
So definitely recommend
you talk to Sebastian.

00:22:01.948 --> 00:22:03.490
And then the other
thing I would just

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.830
add to aircraft
ownership in general

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.190
is that there are also a lot of
opportunities where there are--

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.010
basically, you can become
part of a group that

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.110
partially owns an airplane.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.110
So there's a bunch
of clubs around here

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.990
where, for example, there
are three planes that

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.630
are owned by 60 people.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.840
And so you kind of
timeshare those planes.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.870
And a number of the other
instructors of this course

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.900
have done that.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.400
So you might have heard Luke
or Marissa talk about that.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.582
And so they have some
planes, for example,

00:22:36.582 --> 00:22:38.290
in Beverly, where
there are three planes,

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.520
and a bunch of people own it.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.100
And so you can
timeshare the plane,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.610
and they have to be very
mindful about these types

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.540
of maintenance aspects, as well.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.270
So it's kind of an in-between
cost of renting versus owning

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.120
your own airplane by yourself.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.830
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah,
and if you want to--

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.660
the Experimental
Aircraft Association,

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.233
which runs Oshkosh, they
have chapter meetings

00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:02.650
all over the country
all the time.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.400
They're kind of the most social
folks in the aviation world.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.700
So if you want to find out what
it's like to build your own kit

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.007
airplane or design your
own airplane from scratch,

00:23:12.007 --> 00:23:13.590
those people will
be happy to hang out

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.130
with you, at least every
month, all over the country--

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.680
EAA.

BARTON ZWIEBACH: Do
normal wave analysis

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.820
to demonstrate that indeed these
things should not quite happen.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:24.610
So for that, so ordinary waves
and Galilean transformations.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.190
So when you have a wave,
as you've probably have

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.760
seen many times before,
the key object in the wave

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.810
is something called
the phaze of the wave.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.820
Phaze, the phaze.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.760
And it's controlled by this
quantity kx minus omega t.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.070
k being the wave number, omega
being the angular frequency

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.960
and we spoke about.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.390
And the wave may be sine of that
phaze or cosine of that phaze

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.930
or a linear combination of sines
and cosines, or E to this wave,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.580
any of those things
could be your wave.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.840
And whenever you have
such a wave, what we say

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.370
is that the phaze of this
wave is a Galilean invariant.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.913
Invariant.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.620
What it means is that two
people looking at this wave,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.790
and they look at the
point on this wave,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.390
both people will agree on
the value of the phaze,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.290
because basically, the
reality of the wave

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.270
is based on the phaze, and if
you have, for example, cosine

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.800
of this phaze, the place
where this cosine is 0

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.500
is some of the phaze, and if
the cosine is 0, the wave is 0,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.230
and everybody should agree that
the wave is 0 at that point.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.030
So if you have a place where the
wave has a maximum or a place

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.960
where the wave is 0,
this is an ordinary wave,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.470
everybody would agree that at
that place you have a maximum

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.570
and in that place you have a 0.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.390
So observers should agree
on the value of this phaze.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.140
It's going to be an invariant.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.060
And we can rewrite this phaze
in a perhaps more familiar way

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:58.310
by factoring the k, and then
you have x minus omega over kt,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.710
and this is 2 pi over
lambda, x minus--

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:11.880
this quantity is called
the velocity of the wave,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.820
and we'll write it this way.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.340
And I'll write in one last way--

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:35.440
2 pi x over lambda minus
2 pi V over lambda t.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.390
And this quantity is omega
and this quantity is k.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.900
So this is our phaze.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.460
And we've said that it's
a Galilean invariant, so I

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.540
will say that S should see--

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:10.090
the observer S prime
should see the same phaze--

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:19.690
phaze-- as S. So phi prime,
the phaze that S prime sees,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.720
must be equal to phi when
referring to the same point.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:37.495
When referring to the same
point at the same time.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.500
Let's write this.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.740
So phi prime should
be equal to phi.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.960
And phi, we've written there.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.130
2 pi over lambda x minus Vt.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.810
And this is so far
so good, but we

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.800
want to write it in
terms of quantities

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.750
that S prime measures.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.320
So this x should
be replaced by 2 pi

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:35.330
over lambda x prime plus
Vt minus Vt like this.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.650
And I could even
do more if I wish.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.090
I could put t prime
here, because the t and t

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.890
primes are the same.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:51.960
So phi prime, by the condition
that these phazes agree,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.260
it's given by this,
which is by the relation

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.430
between the coordinates and
times of the two frames, just

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.060
this quantity.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:12.020
So we can rewrite this as 2
pi over lambda x prime minus 2

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:24.860
pi over lambda V 1 minus little
v over capital V t prime.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.500
I think I got the algebra right.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.640
2 pi over lambda, the sine--

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.330
yes, I grouped those two
terms and rewrote in that way.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.310
So that is the phaze.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.160
And therefore, we
look at this phaze

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.990
and see, oh, whenever
we have a wave,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.800
we can read the wave
number by looking

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.940
at the factor
multiplying x, and we

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.130
can read the
frequency by looking

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.200
at the factor multiplying t.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.580
So you can do the same
thing in this case

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:12.000
and read, therefore,
that omega prime,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.940
this whole quantity
is this, omega prime.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.940
And this is k prime,
because they can

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.840
respond to the frame as prime.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.830
So omega prime is
equal to this 2 pi

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.660
V over lambda, which
is omega, times 1

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:46.090
minus V over V. And
k prime is equal to k

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.790
or, what I wanted to show, that
lambda prime for a normal wave

00:07:50.790 --> 00:08:02.415
is equal to lambda for ordinary
wave moving in the medium.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:13.310
So at this moment, one
wonders, so what happened?

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.540
What have we learned?

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.160
Is that this wave function
is not like a sound wave.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.290
It's not like a water wave.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.200
We're doing everything
non-relativistic.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.070
But still, we're
seeing that you're not

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.159
expected to have agreement.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:37.710
That is, if somebody
looks at one wave function

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.799
and you look at the
same wave function,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:45.680
these two people will not
agree on the value of the wave

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.740
function necessarily.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:56.070
So the things that we conclude--
so the conclusions are

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.010
that waves are surprising.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:05.700
So size are not
directly measurable--

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:15.780
measurable-- because if you had
a quantity for which you could

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.830
measure, like a sound
wave or a water wave,

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.660
and you could measure
aspects to it,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.630
they should agree between
different observables.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.940
So this is going to
be something that

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.830
is not directly measurable--
not all of psi can be measured.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.210
Some of psi can be
measured, and you're already

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.590
heard the hints of that.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.630
Because we said any
number that you multiply,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.230
you cannot measure, and in
the phase that you multiply,

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.550
you cannot measure.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.410
So complex numbers
can't be measured,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.820
you measure real numbers.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:54.060
So at the end of the day, these
are not directly measurable,

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.930
per se.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:05.950
The second thing is that
they're not Galilean invariant,

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.130
and that sets the stage
to that problem 6.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.620
You see, the fact
that this phaze that

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.280
controls these waves
is Galilean invariant

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.390
led you to the quality
of the wavelengths,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.850
but these wavelengths
don't do that.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.520
The de Broglie wavelengths
don't transform

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.800
as they would do for a
Galilean invariant wave.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.220
Therefore, this thing is
not Galilean invariant,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.890
and what does that mean?

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.640
That if you have
two people and you

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.840
ask, what is the value of the
wave function here at 103,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.960
the two observers might give
you a different complex number

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.120
for the wave function.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.350
They will just not agree.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.480
Not all is lost,
because you will

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.380
find how their measurements
can be compared.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.210
That will be the
task of the problem.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.350
How-- if you have a wave
function, how does your friend,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.960
that is moving
with some velocity,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.160
measure the wave function?

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.750
What does this other
person measure?

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:17.540
So the end result, if you have
a point here at some time t,

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.190
the wave function
psi of x and t is not

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.650
going to be the same as
the wave function measured

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.930
by the prime
observer at x prime t

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:34.510
prime, so this point is the
point x and t or x prime and t

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.060
prime.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.437
These are two different
labels for the same point.

00:11:38.437 --> 00:11:40.020
You're talking about
the wave function

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.950
at the same point
at the same time.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.400
You still don't agree.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.220
These two people will not agree.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.800
If they agreed,
this wave function

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.710
would have a simpler
transformation law

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.070
with a wavelength
that this can serve.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:03.210
So by simply discussing
the Galilean properties

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:08.940
of this wave, we're led to know
that the de Broglie waves are

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:14.070
not like normal matter
waves that propagate

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.970
in a medium or simple.

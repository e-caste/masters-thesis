00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:23.460
PROFESSOR: Please settle
down and take a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:45.790
look at this question.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:01:10.170
OK, let's take 10 seconds.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.630
I think that it's a simple math
mistake is between one

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.170
and two at least. So, the trick
here is you know the p h

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.880
and the p k a and you want to
find the ratio so you can

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.350
subtract and do the log.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.000
So maybe we'll have this
question later or something

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.910
similar and we can try
this one again.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.490
So we're going to talk about
buffers again today.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.360
I just feel the need to take
a moment and reflect on the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.200
historic events of the last 24
hours, and talk about how it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.130
will affect chemistry.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.400
So some of you may have voted
for the first time.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.640
Some of you may have worked on a
campaign for the first time.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.650
Some of you may have been very
active in a campaign for the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.050
first time, either for
Obama or McCain,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.640
that you got involved.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.250
And I thought just to put this
election in a little bit of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.270
the historic perspective in
terms of about being an

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.560
undergraduate student or a
student and working on a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.610
political campaign or being part
of a political movement.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.110
So, my father was very active
as a political student

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.830
activist. But the difference
between some of you and my

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.090
father was that he was a
political activist at the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.970
University of Hamberg in Germany
in the 1930's in

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.780
Hitler's Germany.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.370
So he was the leader of
the left wing student

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.430
organization.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.630
That was something that put
one's life at risk to take on

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.690
that role at that time.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.050
So, things were heating up a
little bit and the gestapo

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.370
were discussing some of the
activities with the left wing

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.210
student leaders at college
campuses in Germany.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.930
And some of them, after the
discussions, no one knew where

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.980
they went, they seemed
to disappear.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.590
Now my father was very concerned
about this and he

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.130
decided to lay low for a while,
and so he thought I'll

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.320
do a semester at another
university.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.970
And he told his parents that
if the gestapo came looking

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.390
for him, that they should send
him a telegram saying "Your

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.390
Aunt Millie is sick." Since he
did not have an Aunt Milly, he

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.740
knew that that would
mean get out now.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.920
So he went to another university
and he was doing a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.370
semester there, and someone he
knew told him you really need

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.350
to go into hiding.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.680
But he didn't really trust this
person, so we packed a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.340
bag with a few clothes and some
toiletries, but he didn't

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.500
actually leave. Then the next
day he came home and there was

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.570
a telegram under his door.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.910
So, you can guess what
the telegram said.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.220
He grabbed the bag that was
already packed and headed down

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.500
the stairs.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.250
The gestapo was coming
up the stairs.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.530
My father's name was Heinz
Leopold Lushinski and the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.670
gestapo said to him, "Do you
know Herr Lushinski?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.470
And my father said, "Yes, of
course, he lives on the top

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.420
floor." The gestapo went up,
my father went down, and he

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.560
didn't go back to Germany
for 30 years.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.510
So he came to the United States
as a political refugee

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.350
and became a citizen.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.190
He voted in every election,
every possibility, he was

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.460
very, very active.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.120
My family was very, very
active in politics.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.690
He gave money every year to the
American Civil Liberties

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.310
Union to protect civil
liberties, and he also gave

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.570
money to the American
Rifle Association.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.320
He always liked to
have a plan b.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.420
So, it was sometimes a little
humbling to be the only child

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.510
of this man.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.290
He was in his 50's when I was
born, and I thought how can I

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.710
live up to something
like this?

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.460
Am I ever going to risk my life
for what I believe in.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.820
If given that choice would
I do the right thing?

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.720
And I don't know if I'll ever
get an answer to that

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.210
question, but I talked to my
father about this and he said

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.940
all I need to do is work hard,
find something that I love

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.020
doing, some way that I can
contribute, and that's what's

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.040
really important --

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.300
contributing is really important.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.770
So I was drawn to teaching, and
I love teaching here at

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.230
MIT because you all are so
talented and smart, and it is

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.160
really an honor and a privilege
to be involved in

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.970
your education.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.010
But I feel that in the last 24
hours, we have all received an

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.010
additional call to service.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.910
That president elect Obama said
in the campaign that his

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.310
top priorities are going to be
scientific research, coming up

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.420
with clean energy technologies,
and improving

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.390
healthcare.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.780
He called to scientists
and engineers.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.120
And last night the American
people said yes, we like that

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.870
vision, and they elected
him president.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.000
So we have been called, you
have been called, he has

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.500
reached out to students and
said, students of science and

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.880
engineering, you need
to contribute.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.590
And it's been a while since
any president has really

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.160
called to action, scientists
and engineers.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.380
And last time that happened,
a man went on the moon.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.890
So let's see what we
can do this time.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.210
The next challenge is clean
energy, healthcare.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.220
It's going to be really
important for sciences and

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.460
engineers to get involved,
and at the core an energy

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.270
technologies, and at the core
of medicine is chemistry.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.450
So you are in the right
place right now.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.430
You are going to be the
generation that needs to solve

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.360
these problems, because if you
don't solve the energy problem

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.850
and don't come up with clean
alternatives, there isn't

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.800
going to be much of a planet
left for another generation to

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.910
try to solve those problems. So
it's going to be your job

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.270
and your job is starting right
now with the education that

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.830
you can get at MIT.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.770
So, it's actually somewhat
interesting that today, the

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.300
day after this election, we are
going to talk about one of

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.070
the units that students in this
class have had the most

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.930
difficulty with over the years,
acid based titrations.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.760
This has been the undoing of
some chemistry individuals.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.440
It has been the undoing of some
grades of A. It has been

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.580
the undoing, perhaps, of some
interest in chemistry.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.600
But I would like to say today,
at this moment, it will not be

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.910
your undoing, it will
be your triumph.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.310
Every year I challenge students
to do the best job on

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.350
acid based titration ever, and
people have been doing well.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.090
This might be the last time
I teach in the fall.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.320
You have actually had the
highest grades so far in this

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.160
class, in the history of the
class that I know of, and so

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.740
this is the challenge.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.600
So right after this election,
your challenge is to conquer

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:18.570
chemistry starting one acid
and one base at a time.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.730
So, ready to do some acid
based titrations?

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:31.360
Who are the naysayers
in this crowd?

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.050
Just a few people up there.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:46.310
All right.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.380
I have to tell you that what
I'm going to tell you about

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.650
acid based titrations will seem
like it makes pretty good

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.520
sense as I'm saying it.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.740
But often, people inform me that
when they actually go to

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.750
work the problems on the test,
it's a little less clear on

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.390
what they're supposed
to be doing.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.750
So the key to acid based
titrations is really to work

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.100
problems. And so we have, for
your benefit, assigned

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.470
problems for the problem-set
due Friday.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.800
And so after today, you should
be set to do all of the

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.070
problems on the problem-set.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.490
And in terms of acid based
titration, you will need a lot

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.900
of this knowledge again
in organic chemistry,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.180
biochemistry, if you go
to medical school --

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.910
I used to TA medical students,
they didn't

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.280
know how to do this.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.450
And I said "Who taught you
freshmen chemistry?" So it's

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:38.240
good to learn to this now here
today, work problems, take the

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.190
next test, and guaranteed it'll
be on the final again.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.490
So you'll learn it now, you'll
get lots of points, both on

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.810
the final and the third exam.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.390
All right, so acid based
titrations, they're not that

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.300
hard, but there are not a lot
of equations to use, and I

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.460
think that people in chemistry
are used to what

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.140
equation do I use.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.600
No, it's really about thinking
about what's going on in the

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.270
problem, and as the problem
proceeds, as more, say, strong

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.680
base is added, the
problem changes.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.010
So it's figuring out where you
are in the titration and

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:17.800
knowing what sort of
steps to apply.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.640
So here are some titration
curves, and one thing you may

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.440
be asked to do is draw a
titration curve, so you should

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.360
be familiar with what
they look like.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.330
So we talked last time about
strong acids and strong bases.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:38.210
So if you have a strong base,
you're going to have a basic p

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.720
h, and then as you add the
strong acid, you will go to

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.430
the equivalence point,
equivalence point when you've

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.520
added the same amount of moles
of acid as there is base or

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.560
base as there is acid, equal
number of moles.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.970
And when you mix a strong acid
in a strong base, you form a

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.880
salt, and the salt is neutral in
p h, because the conjugate

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.700
of a strong acid or a strong
base, is ineffectual, it

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.830
doesn't affect the p
h, it's neutral.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.030
So we have p h 7, and then you
continue to add, in this case,

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.580
a more strong acid, and
the p h goes down.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.970
So for the other titration it's
pretty much the same,

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.150
except you start at acidic p
h's, go up to neutral p h, and

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.100
then go basic.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.460
So we talked about these last
time and we worked a couple of

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.360
problems, but now we're going to
move into the slightly more

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.180
difficult type of problem, which
has to do with when you

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.400
have a weak acid or a weak
base being titrated.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.620
So let's look at the difference
of the curve to

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.190
start off with.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.500
So here we have the strong acid
and the strong base, and

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.120
here we have a weak acid
and a strong base.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.530
One thing you may notice right
off is that the equivalence

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.220
point has a different p h.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.440
So, a strong acid and strong
base again, mix, you form a

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.410
salt that's neutral, p h 7.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.755
But if you're titrating a weak
acid in a strong base, the

00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:03.520
conjugate of the strong base
will be ineffective, but the

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.450
conjugate of the weak acid
will act as a base.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.460
So the p h then, at the
equivalence point, when you've

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.730
added equal number of moles of
your strong base as you had

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.370
weak acid, then you'll have the
conjugate base around, and

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.320
the p h will be greater
than 7.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.750
So in working the problems, if
you get an answer with this

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.620
type of titration problem that's
different than that for

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.070
p h at the equivalence point,
you're going to know that you

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.590
did something wrong,
you need to go back

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.650
and check your math.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.530
Another big difference has to
do with the curve shape down

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.760
here, and so you notice
a difference over

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.410
here than over there.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:50.060
And in a titration that involves
a weak acid in a

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.490
strong base, you have a part of
the curve that's known as a

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.950
buffering region, and the p
h is fairly flat in this

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.930
buffering region as
shown down here.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.520
So that's in contrast, there's
no such buffering

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.230
region on this side.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.580
So here the p h will go
up, it'll level off,

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.900
and then go up again.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.240
And this, for some of you, is
probably the frustration in

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.510
doing acid based titrations in
lab, because you're adding and

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.350
nothing's happening and
nothing's happening and

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.700
nothing's happening, and you're
in this region, then

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.090
all of a sudden you add
just a little more

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.740
and you're up here.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.930
So notice how steep
that is over here.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.940
So sometimes when you're in the
buffering region, it seems

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.170
like you're never going to reach
the end of the titration

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.480
and then it'll happen
all too quickly.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.690
So buffering region, remember a
buffer is something that has

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.980
a conjugate, weak acid and weak
base pair, and then in a

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.730
buffering region, the p h
pretty much stays fairly

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.530
constant in that region.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.840
It acts as a buffer,
neutralizing the p h,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.670
maintaining the p h by being a
source or sink of protons, and

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.010
so here the p h then is staying
constant in that

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.360
buffering region.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.720
So those are some of
the differences

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.710
between the type of curves.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.230
Another point that I will
mention or term I will mention

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.805
that has to do with weak acid in
strong base or a weak base

00:14:09.805 --> 00:14:14.060
in strong acid is this 1/2
equivalence point concept.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.370
So 1/2 equivalence point you've
added 1/2 of the amount

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.030
of strong base that you need
to get to the equivalence

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.940
point, and that's right
in the middle of

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.290
that buffering region.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.090
So that's another point where
you'll be asked to

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.410
calculate the p h.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:34.970
So now let's look at different
points in a titration.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.790
So, first let's walk through
and just think

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.340
about what is happening.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.710
So when we start in this
titration of a weak acid in a

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.540
strong base, before we've added
any of the strong base,

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.370
all we have is a weak acid.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.640
So it is a weak acid in
water type problem.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.780
And so here I've drawn our acid,
and the acid has its

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.470
proton, which is going
to give up when you

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.310
start doing the titration.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.790
So that's what we have
at zero volume.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.180
Then we start adding our strong
base, and the strong

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.230
base is going to react with
the acid, one-to-one

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.490
stoichiometry, it's
a strong base.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:20.710
It'll pull off protons off the
same number of moles of the

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.580
strong acid as the number of
moles of the strong base that

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.540
were added.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.010
And so then, you'll start to
have a mixture of your

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.490
conjugates, your weak acid
and your conjugate base.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.310
So the base is a minus here.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.950
And so if you have a mixture
of a weak acid in its

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.700
conjugate base, that's a buffer,
and so you'll move in

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.810
to the buffering region here.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.520
So that's at any volume that is
greater than zero and less

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.570
than the equivalence point
is going to be

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:52.290
around in that region.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.990
Then we have a special category
of the buffering

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.820
region, which is when you've
added the volume to get to the

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.670
1/2 equivalence point.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.070
And when you've done that, you
will have converted 1/2 of the

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.840
weak acid it its conjugate base,
so you'll have equal

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.680
number of moles of your weak
acid as moles of the

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.210
conjugate base --

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.350
1/2 has been converted.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.490
And so that's a special
category right there.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.320
Then you get to the
equivalence point.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.600
At the equivalence point, you've
added the same number

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.000
of moles of strong base as the
number of moles of weak acid

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.420
you have, so you've converted
all of your weak acid to it's

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.500
conjugate base.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.730
So all you have is conjugate
base now, and so that's

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.440
controlling the p h, so the p
h should be greater than 7.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.990
So that's a weak base
in water problem.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:48.320
And if you keep going, then
you're going to end up with a

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.830
strong base in water problem.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:55.280
The weak base will still be
around, but it will be

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.020
negligibly affecting the p h
compared to the fact that

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.600
you're dumping strong acid
into your titration.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.870
And so that's this part
of the curve.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.590
So you see that in one type
of problem, one titration

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:13.100
problem, you actually have a
lot of sub problems, or sub

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.650
types of problems, you'll have
weak acid buffer, special

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.430
category of buffer, a conjugate
base or a salt

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.110
issue, and then a strong base.

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.580
And this is one of the things
that people have trouble with

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.530
in the titrations, because we
may not ask you to do all the

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.270
points, we may just sort of
jump in somewhere, and say

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.910
okay, what is the p h at the
equivalenced point, and you

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.350
need to think about what's
happened to get to the

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.620
equivalence point.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.550
Or we may jump in and ask you
about a region that would be

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.020
in the buffering region, and you
have to remember that at

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.850
that point you should have some
of the weak acid and also

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.250
some of the conjugate
bases being formed.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.600
So, it seems like there are a
lot of different things, but

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.720
there are only five types of
problems. But in a titration

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.850
curve, you run into a lot of
those different types at

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:02.480
different points
in the problem.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.730
So now let's go the other
direction and consider

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.360
titration of a weak base
with a strong acid.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.100
So here's what that curve
would look like.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.440
You're going to start basic,
of course, because you're

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.870
starting with a weak base,
you haven't added

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.430
any strong acid yet.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:20.460
As you add strong acid,
the p h will decrease.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.450
Because it is a weak base, you
will be forming some of its

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.970
conjugate as you add the strong
acid, and so you'll go

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.770
through a buffering region again
where the curve would be

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.300
flat, where the p h will be
pretty much the same for

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.790
region of time.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.010
Then the curve will drop again
and you'll get to the

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.470
equivalence point.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.460
At the equivalence point, you've
added the same amount

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.980
of moles of strong acid as you
had weak base, so all of your

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.760
weak base is converted to its
conjugate acid, and so you

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.580
should be acidic at the
equivalence point, and then

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.980
the curve goes down.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.870
So again, we can think
about this in

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.750
terms of what is happening.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.030
In the beginning it's just a
weak base in water problem,

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.270
but as you add strong acid,
you were pronating some of

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.560
your base and forming its
conjugate acid here, and

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.170
you're in the going to be
in the buffering region.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:17.310
Then at the 1/2 equivalence
point, you've added enough

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.980
moles of strong acid to convert
1/2 of the weak base

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.250
to its conjugate, so those are
going to be equal to each

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.900
other -- the number of moles
of the weak base and the

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.210
number of moles of its
conjugate acid.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.410
At the equivalence point, you've
converted all of the

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.840
weak base you started with to
its conjugate acid, so it'll

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.410
be a weak acid in water problem,
and then at the end

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.950
it's strong acid.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.400
So the trick is to recognizing
what type of problem you're

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.590
being asked to do, and a lot
of times if people get a

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.570
question and they just write
down OK, at this point in the

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.790
titration curve, it's
going to be a weak

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.130
base in water problem.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.620
And just writing that down, most
of the time if you get

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.570
that far, you do the rest of
the problem correctly.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.950
So just identifying the type,
there are only 5, of problems

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:12.040
gets you a long way to getting
the right answer.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.150
So let's do an example.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.470
We're going to titrate a weak
acid with a strong base.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:25.260
We have 25 mils of 0.1 molar
acid with 0.15 moles of a

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:33.040
strong base, n a o h, we're
given the k a for the acid.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.190
First we start with 0 mils
of the strong base added.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:45.240
So what type of problem
is this?

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.140
It's a weak acid problem.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.330
So we know how to write the
equation for a weak acid or

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.830
for an acid in water.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.940
We have the acid in water going
to hydronium ions and a

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.710
conjugate base.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.900
So weak acid.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:10.415
For weak acid, we're going to
use our k a, and we're going

00:21:10.415 --> 00:21:13.770
to set up our equilibrium
expression.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.720
So here we have 0.1
molar of our acid.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.170
We're going to have some
of that go away in the

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:26.080
equilibrium, forming hydronium
ion and some conjugate base,

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.160
and so we know we have
expressions for the

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.550
concentrations at equilibrium.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.930
And we can use our k a, k a
for acid, it's a weak acid

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:42.150
problem, and we can look at
products over reactants.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.850
So, see, now we're doing a
titration problem, but you

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.330
already know how to do this
problem because we've seen a

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.140
weak acid in water
problem before.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:56.710
So we have x squared over
0.10 minus x here.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:03.070
We can assume x is small, and
get rid of this minus x, and

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.770
then later go back and check
it, so that just makes the

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.790
math a little bit easier.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:13.900
And we can solve for x and then
we can check -- we can

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:21.330
take this value, 0.00421 over
0.1 and see whether that's

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.500
less than 5%, it's
close but it is.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.930
So that assumption is OK.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.240
If it wasn't, what would
we have to do?

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.800
Quadratic equation.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.860
All right, so now, here's
a sig fig question.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:23:20.540
Tell me how many sig figs
this p h actually has.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:42.580
OK, 10 seconds.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.460
So, in the first part of the
problem we had a concentration

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.140
that had 2 significant figures,
the 0.10 molar.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.260
Sometimes later, people have
extra significant figures that

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.380
they're carrying along, but we
had those 2, and so we're

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.630
going to have 2 after the
decimal point then in the

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.800
answer of the p h.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.990
So again, the number of
significant figures that are

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.730
limiting are going
to be the number

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:15.650
after the decimal point.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:20.460
All right, so we have one
p h value, and now we're

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.120
going to move on.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.360
So let me just put our
one p h value down.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:37.720
We have volume of strong base,
and p h over here, and we're

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.760
starting here with
zero moles added.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.020
We have a p h of 2 .

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.920
38.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:49.990
It's a weak acid, so it should
be an acidic p h, which it is.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:55.220
All right, so now let's move
into the titration problem,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.510
and now 5 .

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:02.050
0 mils of the strong base have
been added, and we need to

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.790
find what the p h is now.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.070
So it's a strong base, so it's
going to react almost

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.980
completely, that's
our assumption.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.320
If it's strong, it
goes completely.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:18.120
And so, the number of moles of
the strong base that we add

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.790
will convert all of the same
number of moles of our acid

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.770
over to its conjugate.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.320
So we can just do a
subtraction then.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.810
So first, we need to know
the initial moles of the

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.160
acid that we had.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.580
We had 25 mils, 0.10 molar.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.520
We calculate the number of moles
for the hydroxide added,

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.800
we added 5 mils, it was 0.15
molar, and so we can calculate

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.280
the number of moles of the
strong base that were added.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.590
So the strong base will react
completely with the same

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.470
number of moles of
the weak acid.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.470
And we're going to do then -- we
have the moles of the weak

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.710
acid here, minus the number of
moles of the strong base we've

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.860
added, and so we're
going to have 1 .

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:09.180
75 times 10 to the minus 3 moles
of the weak acid left.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.940
So, then how many moles of the
conjugate base will be formed

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:19.610
by this reaction?

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:28.920
What do you think?

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.780
Same number.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:39.530
So 0.75 times 10
to the minus 3.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:42.930
So always remember that in
these titration problems,

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.530
nothing has been added yet,
you're at zero mils added.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.780
Some amount of some subtractions
are going to have

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.680
to occur because something
has happened.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.000
You've converted something,
things are different than when

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.660
you started.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:01.030
All right, so now we have weak
acid and we have moles of its

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:07.090
conjugate, what type
of problem is this?

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:14.380
If you have a weak acid and
its conjugate base --

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.600
buffer, right.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.790
So we're going to do a buffer
problem and we need to know

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:25.440
the molarity first. So we have
moles over volume -- again,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.610
the volume, you had 25 mils to
begin with, you added 5 more.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.080
So you have to have the total
volume 30 mils, and we can

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.100
calculate then the
concentrations of both.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.870
Now we can set up our
equilibrium table, and this

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.130
looks like a buffer problem
because it is, and by looking

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.556
like a buffer problem you
something over here, you have

00:27:46.556 --> 00:27:49.560
your weak acid over here, but
you have something over here

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.140
now, it's not zero now,
we're starting with

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.900
some conjugate base.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:28:01.110
So we have 0.0583 minus x on one
side, and we 0.025 molar

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.240
plus x on the other side.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.250
We can use k a again.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:12.150
This is set up as an acid in
water going to hydronium ions

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:18.470
and conjugate base, so we can
use our k a, set things up,

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.460
and we can always say let's
see if x is small, make an

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.890
assumption, check it later.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.860
That'll simplify the math.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.320
So we get rid of the plus
x and the minus x.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.300
Again, we're saying that if
x is small, the initial

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.930
concentrations are going to be
more or less the same as the

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.540
concentrations after the
equilibration occurs.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.670
And we can calculate 4 .

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:46.540
13 times 10 to the minus
4, as x, that is a

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.100
pretty small number.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.460
And we have to check it, and
yup, it's small enough, it's

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.730
under 5%, so that's OK.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.080
So now we can plug this in.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.380
X is our hydronium ion
concentration minus log of the

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.140
hydronium ion concentration
is p h, and we can

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.680
calculate p h to 3 .

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.880
38 -- again, we're limited by
two significant figures in the

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.410
concentration.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:19.710
So now we've added 5 mils down
here, and our p h has gone up

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:24.090
a little bit, it's now at 3 .

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:30.080
38 over here.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.510
There's another option
for a buffer problem.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:39.390
What's the one equation
in this unit?

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:43.770
Our friend Henderson
Hasselbalch.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:47.300
And yes, you can use that here
too, assuming that you check

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.570
the assumption and it's OK.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.670
Most people will prefer
to do this

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.120
because it is a bit easier.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.290
So, you weren't given, though,
the p k a in this problem, you

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:03.110
were given the k a, so pretty
easy to calculate -- minus log

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.500
of the k a is the p k a.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.210
So you can calculate
that, put that in.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.320
You have your concentrations
and it should be

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.430
concentrations, but you may
notice that if you actually

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.460
had moles the volume
would cancel here.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.760
So here are the concentrations,
but with the

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.600
same volume, the volume
term does cancel.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.680
It makes this a little faster
and it gives the same answer,

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.370
which is great.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.800
To use Henderson Hasselbalch you
also need the 5% rule to

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.270
be true, because Henderson
Hasselbalch is

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.100
assuming that x is small.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.770
It's assuming that the initial
concentrations and the

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.320
concentrations after
equilibrium

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.180
are about the same.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.280
So we can check the
assumption.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.460
We can back-calculate the
hydronium ion concentration,

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.270
which would be x, and see if
it's small, we already know it

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.080
is, so it's OK.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.090
So there are 2 options for
buffer problems, but do not

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.850
use the Henderson Hasselbalch
equation when it isn't in the

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.960
buffering region, it
doesn't hold then.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.990
So again, you check the
assumption, and if

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.100
it's OK, it's fine.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.970
If not, you need to use option
one and you need to use the

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.730
quadratic equation.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.490
All right, so buffering
region.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:22.190
Now we're at the special kind
of problem in the buffering

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.470
region, the 1/2 equivalence
point.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:30.260
So here you've added 1/2 the
number of moles of the strong

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.840
base to convert 1/2
the moles of the

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.850
weak acid to its conjugate.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:40.330
So at this point, the
concentration of h a equals

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:44.680
the concentration of a minus
-- equal number of moles in

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.460
the same volume, those
are equal.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.140
You can use Henderson
Hasselbalch here, and find

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:55.700
that if they're equal, you're
talking about minus log of 1,

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:02.390
so the p h is going to
equal the p k a.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.610
And you're done with this
type of problem.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:09.560
I have been known to put 1/2
equivalence problems on an

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.900
exam, because exams are often
long, you have only 50

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.090
minutes, there's lots of
different type of problems,

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.865
and this problem should
not take you a

00:32:17.865 --> 00:32:19.070
long amount of time.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.870
You do not have to prove to
me that this is true.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.750
All you need to remember, 1/2
equivalence point, p h equals

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:32.100
p k a, and if you calculate
the p k a, you're done.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.160
So this is a short
type of problem.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.540
If you remember the definition
of 1/2 equivalence point, it's

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.150
easy to do.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:45.480
So now we have another
number, so 3 .

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:58.290
75, and we're working
on our curve.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.950
Now let's move to the
equivalence point.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.780
At the equivalence point, you've
added the same number

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.270
of moles of your strong base
as you had weak acid.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:13.880
So you've converted all of
your weak acid to its

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.020
conjugate base.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.240
So the p h should be
greater than 7.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.220
Now all you have is conjugate
base, that's basic, p h should

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.920
be greater than 7.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.390
So when you are doing this
titration, you have your weak

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.710
acid and your strong base.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:40.950
You're going to be forming a
salt here, and a salt problem,

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.980
you can tell me about salts.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:49.320
And so, just remind me, what
does the n a plus contribute

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:54.200
to the p h here.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.940
It's going to be neutral.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.540
And what about this
guy down here?

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.450
Yeah, so it's going
to be basic.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:06.670
So, the sodium, anything group
1, group 2, no effect on p h,

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:07.670
they're neutral.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.880
But if you have a conjugate base
of a weak acid, that's

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.510
going to be basic.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:17.640
Salt problems, really just
part of what you

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.710
already know about.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.010
So always check your work.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.350
If your p h doesn't make sense
from what you know, you might

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:31.980
have made a math mistake.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.500
So let's calculate the actual p
h at the equivalence point.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.940
We know that it should
be basic, but what

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.590
is it going to be?

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:45.880
So first, we need to know how
much of the strong base we had

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.460
to add, because we need to
know about all the moles.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.110
So how much of this did
we need to add.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.040
So we needed to add enough of
the strong base that you

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.230
converted all of the
moles of the

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.540
weak acid to its conjugate.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.650
So we had 2 .

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.280
5 times 10 to the minus 3
moles of our weak acid.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.810
So that's all going to be
converted to the moles of the

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.430
conjugate base, and so that's
going to be equal to the

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.470
number of moles we
needed to do it.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.900
So we needed 2 .

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.610
5 times 10 to the minus 3 moles
of our strong base to do

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.190
that complete conversion.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.260
We know the concentration
of the base was 0.15 .

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.650
So we would have needed 1 .

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:28.880
67 times 10 to the minus 2
liters of this concentration

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.520
added to reach the equivalence
point.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.890
So then the total volume that
we're going to have at the

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.020
equivalence point is the 25
mils that we had to begin

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.750
with, plus this 16 .

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:45.850
7 mils to make this final,
total volume.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.700
And remember, you always need
to think, what is the total

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.340
volume, how much has been added
to get to this point in

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.590
the titration curve.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.770
Then we can calculate molarity,
so we know how many

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.850
moles of conjugate base have
been formed, and we know the

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:05.000
new volume, so we can calculate
the concentration of

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.500
the conjugate base.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.970
So now, you can help me
solve this problem.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:43.520
Set up an equation for
me to solve it.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:37:02.280
Let's take 10 seconds.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.520
That's the best score
we've had today.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.540
Yup.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:11.010
So now we're talking about
a conjugate base.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:16.920
So we have converted all of the
weak acid to the conjugate

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:23.190
base, and so it's a weak base
in water problem, so we're

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.060
going to talk about a k b.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.810
If you were only given the k a
for this problem, how would

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:35.170
you find k b -- what
interconnects k a and k b?

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.070
K w, right.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.610
So you can calculate, here it's
given to you, but you

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:43.040
could calculate it if you had
a calculator, and you would

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.670
find that this is true.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.980
Now it's a weak base
in water problem.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.730
We're not in the buffering
region anymore.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.660
We've converted all of our weak
acid to the conjugate.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.670
So it's a weak base
in water problem.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:59.200
So we have x squared, 0.06, that
was the concentration we

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.750
calculated, minus x.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:08.520
So again, think about what
type of problem it is.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.710
So again, weak base in water
problem -- x squared

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.720
over 0.06 minus x.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:22.560
And we can assume that x is
small, and calculate a value

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.380
for x, which is 0.83 times 10 to
the minus 6, and then we're

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.330
going to calculate p o h,
because now x is the hydroxide

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.320
ion concentration.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:38.750
Because in a weak base in water
problem, here in this

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:42.240
type of problem, the base, and
here is your acid -- the

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.620
conjugate of this acid is the
base, hydroxide, and the

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:50.010
conjugate of this weak base is
its conjugate acid over here,

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:54.020
so now when we are solving for
x, we're solving for hydroxide

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.510
ion in concentration, so we're
calculating a p o h, which

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:02.800
then we can calculate
a p h from.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.510
So we can take 14 minus 5 .

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.060
74 and get our value.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.830
And it's bigger than neutral,
it's 8, it's basic, and that

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:17.380
makes sense, it is a weak
base in water problem.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.410
So, let's see, it's 8 .

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:26.320
26, so now we're up here in our
curve, and we're at 8 .

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.550
26, and that's going to be
greater than 7 for this type

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.710
of problem.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:38.510
So that makes sense,
it's good.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:44.140
Greater than 7 is what
we want to see.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.800
So now, you've gone too far --
you've passed the equivalence

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:55.990
point, and you keep adding
your strong base in.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:59.580
Now you still have some of the
weak conjugate base around.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.920
So you still have this around,
but you only have 1 .

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.500
83 times 10 to the minus
6 molar of it.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.980
So very little amount
-- x is small.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.440
So your p h is going to be
dictated by the amount of

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:18.170
extra strong base
you're adding.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:22.770
So this is similar, then, to a
strong acid or strong base in

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.480
water problem.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.430
So if you're 5 mils past the
equivalence point, 5 mils

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.430
times your concentration of
a strong base, so you

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.980
have extra, 7 .

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.710
5 times 10 to the minus
4 moles extra.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:42.480
So then you need to calculate
a concentration of that, and

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.730
so you remember the whole volume
-- you're 5 mils past,

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.290
you had 25 miles to start with,
and you had to add 16 .

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.360
7 mils to get to the
equivalence point.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.990
And you have, that's your
total volume, you get a

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:58.510
concentration, that's your
concentration of hydroxide, it

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.250
reacts completely, you don't
have to do any equilibrium

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.210
table here.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.910
It's going complete,
it's a strong base.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:09.710
You could try adding that value
of your other weak base

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:13.880
to this, but remember, that's
times 10 to the minus 6, so

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.340
it's not going to
be significant

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.830
with significant figures.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:20.090
So you can just use this value
-- plug it in to p o h,

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.570
calculate it, and then
calculate p h.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:32.570
And so now we're somewhere
up here at p h 12 .

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:39.880
21, 5 mils past.
And there we've

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:46.260
worked a titration problem.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.460
So let's review what we saw.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.540
In the beginning, zero mils of
the strong base, we have a

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.660
weak acid in water problem.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.790
We moved into the buffering
region where we had our weak

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:01.570
acid and the conjugate base
of that weak acid.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.000
At the equivalence point, we've
converted all of the

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.070
weak acid to the conjugate
base, so

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:07.680
it's a weak base problem.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.960
And then beyond the equivalence
point, it's a

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.160
strong base problem.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:18.530
That's what we've just worked.

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.810
So, we can check these
all off now.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.590
You know how to do all of these
types of problems. And

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.870
there are not that many, you
just need to figure out where

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:30.650
to apply what.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.330
And if you can do that, you're
all set, this unit will be

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:38.110
easy for you, and you can go
through and make me very happy

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.130
on the exam.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.680
There's nothing -- well, there
are few things in life as

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.870
beautiful to me as a perfectly
worked titration problem.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:49.930
It really, it brings me joy, and
I've had people write on

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:53.580
the exam sometimes, "I hope
that my solution to this

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.840
brings you joy." And I will
often write, "Yes, it does,"

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.460
and put a smiley face.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.680
Because it really is nice to see
these beautifully worked.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.850
I know, I'm a little nerdy and
geeky, but after yesterday,

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:16.220
being smart and a nerd and
a geek is cool again.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:20.530
All right, so let me just tell
you where we're going.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.850
We have five more minutes, and
actually that's perfect,

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:29.020
because I can get through some
rules in those 5 minutes.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.630
So let's do 5 minutes
of rules.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.830
Oxidation reduction doesn't have
a lot of rules, so five

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.950
minutes is actually all
we need to do that.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:42.030
Oxidation reduction involves
equilibrium, it involves

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:43.070
thermodynamics.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:46.020
I like it because it's really
important for reactions

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:50.540
occurring in the body, and acid
bases as well -- p k a's

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.480
are really important to that.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.860
And so, between acid base and
oxidation reduction, you cover

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.220
the way a lot of enzymes work.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.720
So let me give you five minutes
of rules, and that

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.950
will serve you well
in this unit.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.110
Some of these are
pretty simple.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:11.600
For free elements, each atom has
an oxidation number of 0,

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.100
so this would be 0.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:19.720
So, oxidation number of
0 in a free element.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:25.830
For ions that are composed of
one atom, the oxidation number

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:30.910
is equal to the charge of the
atom, so lithium plus 1 ions

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:34.180
would have an oxidation
number of plus 1.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.730
Again, pretty straightforward.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.100
Group one and group two
make your lives easy.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.500
They seem to have a lot
of consistent rules.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.320
Group one metals in the periodic
table have oxidation

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.070
numbers of 1.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.770
Group two metals have oxidation
numbers of plus 2.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:55.850
Aluminum is plus 3 in
all its compounds.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:57.970
Pretty simple.

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.470
Now we get to things that are a
little more complicated but

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.930
still useful, oxygen.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:09.020
Oxygen is mostly minus 2, but
there are exceptions to that,

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:13.910
such as in peroxides where it
can have an oxidation number

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:21.520
of minus 1, and if it's with
a group one metal, it

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.200
can be minus 1.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:27.770
Remember, group one, and
actually group two here,

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:31.770
that's plus 1, always plus 1,
always plus 1, always plus 2,

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.050
and so hydrogen has to
accommodate that.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:39.260
So usually plus 1, except when
it's in a binary complex with

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:44.090
these particular metals that are
in group one or group two.

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:49.410
Fluorine, almost always minus 1,
or always minus 1 -- other

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:55.100
halogens, a chloride, bromide,
iodide, also usually

00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:00.070
negatives, but if they're with
oxygen, then it changes.

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:04.410
So, here is an example.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.130
And in neutral molecules,
the sum of the oxidation

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.660
numbers must be 0.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.200
When the molecule has a
charge, the sum of the

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:18.920
oxidation numbers must be
equal to that charge.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.630
So, let's do a quick example.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:28.620
Hydrogen, in this case,
is going to be what?

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:34.340
Plus 1, so it's not
with a group one,

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.690
group two metal here.

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:40.830
So what does that leave
for nitrogen?

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:46.490
And that makes the sum, plus 1,
which is equal to the sum

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:49.530
of that molecule,
so that works.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:52.030
So we might not have known
nitrogen, but we can figure it

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:55.130
out if we know the rules for
hydrogen and we know what it

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.070
all has to equal up to.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.740
And so, this unit is sometimes
a relief after oxidation

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.510
reduction, because it's all
about simple adding and

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:05.390
subtracting, it's not so bad.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.780
OK, oxidation numbers do not
have to be integers.

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:12.570
Example here, you have
superoxide, what would its

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:16.170
oxidation number be?

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:19.090
Minus 1/2.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:24.330
And those are the rules, and
then on Friday, we'll come

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:27.290
back and we'll look
at some examples.

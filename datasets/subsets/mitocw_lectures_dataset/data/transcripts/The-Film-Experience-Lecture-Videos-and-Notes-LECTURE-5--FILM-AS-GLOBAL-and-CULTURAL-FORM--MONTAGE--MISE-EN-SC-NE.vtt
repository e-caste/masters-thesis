DAVID THORBURN: This
afternoon, by welcoming

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.660
our virtual audience,
the audience that's

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.080
looking at this lecture on MIT'S
OpenCourseWare, some of you

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.880
attentive viewers may notice
what the students here

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.961
would not notice-- that
seven years have elapsed.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.210
There's no podium-- some of
you may have gotten that--

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.640
and a much older professor.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.290
I hope that our completion
of these lectures seven years

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.140
later will not result in a
reduced or less energetic

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.040
performance.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.510
I'll do my best.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.510
We come now to the end
of our first segment

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.080
in the course on silent film.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.340
And I thought it would
be helpful to use

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.920
today's lecture in part to
create some perspectives

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.270
on both the silent film, the
idea of the silent film--

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.110
not just the
particular films we've

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.950
looked at, but more generally
the phenomenon of silent film,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.280
the whole phenomenon-- and some
perspectives that will also

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.120
help us look forward
to what will follow,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.100
to the sound films that
will follow this week.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.240
I'd like in a certain
way to do this

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.320
by complicating an
idea I've already

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.950
suggested to you
about the notion

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.500
of the film as a cultural form.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.700
What does it
actually mean to say

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.130
that a film is a cultural form?

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.170
What, in a concrete sense,
does this phrase signify?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.780
Well, one answer I think
I can offer by drawing

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.510
on your own experience.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.330
My guess is that all of you
have watched older films, films

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.960
from 20 or 30 or 40 years
ago, and immediately

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.770
been struck as soon
as you began to watch

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.930
the film by certain
kinds of differences

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.940
that the original filmmakers
would have been oblivious to.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.370
And I'm talking about things
like the hairdos of people,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.330
the clothing that they wear, the
way automobiles look, or even

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.800
a world in which there
are no automobiles,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.220
the physical environment
that is shown.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.320
One of the things that
this reminds us of

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.895
is that always, even
the most surreal

00:02:35.895 --> 00:02:38.410
and imaginative and
science-fictiony

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.660
films, always inevitably
in some deep way,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.110
in some essential ways,
reflect the society

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.212
from which they come.

00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:48.920
They may reflect more
than that, and they

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.915
may be influenced by
other factors as well,

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:53.970
but they are expressions
of the culture that

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.145
gave rise to them in certain
really essential ways.

00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:58.520
And one of the
things this means,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.560
among other significance, one
of the most interesting aspects

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.210
of this recognition
is the fact that films

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.780
get richer over time.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.530
They become artifacts of immense
anthropological interest,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.950
even if they're terrible
films, because they show us

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.170
what the world of 50 or 25 or 30
years ago actually looked like

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.780
and how people walked and
how people combed their hair

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.240
and what kind of
makeup they wore,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.660
all of the things, many
of the things, which

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.990
in many respects, the people
making the original film

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.290
would simply have taken for
granted as part of the reality

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.310
they were trying to dramatize.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.430
So one way of thinking about
film as a cultural form

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.700
is to recognize that
as films grow older,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.100
they create meaning.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.650
They become more interesting.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.600
They become richer, and
a corollary implication

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.810
of this idea that
films become richer

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.100
is that the meaning of
any individual artifact,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.340
cultural artifact, especially
cultural artifacts as complex

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.430
as films, is always in process.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.920
But the meaning is never
fully fixed or finished,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.820
that new significance
and new meanings emerge

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.230
from these texts with
the passage of time,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.900
as if the texts
themselves undergo

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.120
a kind of transformation.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.320
One final point about
this, just to sort of tweak

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.910
your broader understanding
of these kinds of questions--

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.000
one of the kinds
of transitions that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.260
occurs with particular artifacts
is they sometimes move or make

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.230
a kind of transition
from being recognized

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.710
as merely ordinary and
uninteresting parts

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.420
of the society from which they
grow, from which they emerge,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.170
simply ordinary routine aspects
of the experience of society.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.510
Later ages may value
these routine objects

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.176
as profoundly
valuable works of art.

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:55.550
And in a certain
sense, one could

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.030
say that the film
in the United States

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.126
underwent a transition
of that kind,

00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:03.180
that at a certain point in the
history of our understanding

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.660
of movies, American culture
began to recognize that movies

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.090
were actually works of art,
that they deserved comparison

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.972
with novels and plays and
poems and so forth, probably

00:05:15.972 --> 00:05:17.930
an idea that all of you
folks take for granted.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.050
Many of members
of your generation

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.890
admire movie directors more than
they do novelists and poets--

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.870
a radical mistake
it seems to me,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.970
but that's my literary
bias showing through.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.340
I certainly admire great
directors certainly as much

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.030
as I do good novelists.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.930
But the fact is that this
is really not the case.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.670
This recognition of the
film as an artistic object,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.090
as I've suggested
earlier in the course,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.532
is not some fixed
or stable identity

00:05:46.532 --> 00:05:48.240
that the film has had
from the beginning.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.480
It's an identity that
the film has garnered,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.640
that has been laid
on the film later

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.370
as cultural changes
have occurred

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.170
and as other forms of
expression have emerged

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.250
that have put the film in a
kind of different position

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.000
hierarchically from other kinds
of imaginative expressions.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.542
And as I've already suggested
many times in this course,

00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:13.500
we'll come back to this
principle, because it's

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.700
such a central historical fact
about the nature, the content

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.400
of American movies especially.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.960
It's the advent
of television that

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.210
is partly responsible
for the transformation,

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.420
although it takes some
time for the transformation

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.260
in American attitudes
toward what movies are,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.870
because television became
the throwaway item,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.800
the routine item,
the thing Americans

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.370
experienced every day.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.800
And the consequence of that
was to change our understanding

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.740
of what the film was.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.790
Now of course, the Europeans
had an insight like this long

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.430
before the Americans
did, and that's

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.390
something I'll talk
about a bit later today

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.650
and also at other
times in our course.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.570
So that's one way of thinking
about what it means to say

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.260
that a film is a cultural form.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.190
It means that it's
unstable in the sense

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.420
that its meanings are
not fixed, and the way

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.870
in which a culture
categorizes and understands

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.040
a particular artifact is also
something that's unstable,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.270
that undergoes change over time.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.710
But there are
other ways to think

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.920
about this problem of film
as a cultural formation,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.190
as an expression
of society, and I

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.965
want to tease out some of
those meanings for you as well.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.330
One way to come
at this problem is

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.270
to think of a kind of
tension or even contention

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.530
between our recognition that
film is a global form-- that

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.970
is to say that because
the movies are watched

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.529
across national boundaries,
movies that are made

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:39.820
in the United States can
influence movies that are made

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.820
in Europe and vice versa.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.120
So in one sense,
the film, especially

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.070
after film got going within
the first 10 years of its life,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.280
it had become an
international phenomenon,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.060
and American films
were watched in Europe,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.470
and European films influenced
American directors, even

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.980
at very early stages
so that we begin

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.370
to get certain kinds of
films that certainly appealed

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.460
across national boundaries.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.850
And so there is a kind
of global dimension

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.602
to what film might be.

00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:12.060
And there's another
way of thinking

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.820
about what it means
to talk about film

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:19.150
as a global phenomenon, not as
a merely national expression.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.560
And that has to do specifically
with the way in which

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.830
particular directors and
films in particular societies

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.010
can influence world cinema.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.010
And from the very earliest
days of cinema, as I suggested,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.870
this has been a reality.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.370
As David Cook's History of
Narrative Film informs you,

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.289
and I hope you'll read
the assigned chapters

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.409
on Russian film closely,
because I can only skim

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.610
these topics in my lecture.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.180
What you'll discover
among other things

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.980
is that the great American
director, DW Griffith,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.530
had a profound impact
on Russian films

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.950
and that, in fact,
at a certain point

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.570
in the history of
Russian films, there

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.920
was a workshop run by
a man named Kuleshov,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.580
who actually took
DW Griffith's movies

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.540
and disassembled
them shot by shot

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.500
and studied the editing
rhythms in his workshop.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.520
This had a profound impact
not only on Russian cinema,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.340
but Griffith's practices
had a profound impact

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.900
on virtually all filmmakers.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.650
And there's a kind
of reverse influence,

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.300
because certain Russian
directors, Eisenstein

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.880
especially, but
also Dziga Vertov,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.550
their work had a profound
impact on the films

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.880
from Western Europe and
from the United States.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.120
So it's a two-way process.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.970
It's too simple to say that
particular films are only

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.270
an expression of French
culture or only an expression

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.920
of Russian culture or only an
expression of American culture.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.030
They are also global
phenomena, and they

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.980
were global phenomena from
almost the earliest stages.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.640
So it's important to recognize
this tension or this balance.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.680
There are dimensions
of film that reach

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.640
across national boundaries.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.530
And as we've already
suggested, one

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.160
of the explanations for the
success of American movies

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.440
in the United States
was in part a function

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.890
of the fact that they
did not require language

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.480
in nearly the same degree.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.150
They were visual experiences,
and an immigrant population

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.380
coming into the large
cities of the United States

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.320
at the turn of the century was
one of the primary factors that

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.950
helps to explain the phenomenal
quick growth of the movies

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:31.310
from a novelty into a profound
embedded cultural experience.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.180
So it is a global
phenomenon in a certain way

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.270
and reaches across
national boundaries.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.450
But there's also-- and
we need to acknowledge

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.690
this side of the equation
too-- there's also a profound,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.180
a really deep fundamental
sense in which

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.780
films, at least
until very recently,

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.860
are an expression of the
individual national cultures

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.720
from which they come.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.960
I say until very recently,
because some of you

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.590
must be aware of the fact
that a new kind of film

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.960
is being made now by
which I mean a film that

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.990
seems to appeal across all
national boundaries, that

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.520
doesn't seem to have a
decisive national identity.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.770
At least some films like that.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.170
I think the Bollywood people
are making films like this.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.520
Americans are certainly
making films like this now.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.810
And sometimes if you think
of some of the action

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.360
adventure films that
will have a cast that

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.140
is drawn from different
cultures, a sort

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.040
of multiethnic and multilingual
cast, all of them dubbed

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.100
into whatever language the
film is being exhibited in,

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.160
you'll see an example.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.740
What's begun to emerge now
in our 21st century world

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.550
is a kind of movie that
already conceives of itself

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.920
as belonging to a kind
of global culture.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.970
So far I'm not sure these movies
have as much artistic interest

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.450
as one would like, but
it's a new phenomenon,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.910
and the globalizing tendencies
of digital technology

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.130
are certainly
encouraging new ways

00:11:53.130 --> 00:12:00.160
to think about the origins or
the central sources of movies.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.450
But until very recently,
it is still the case

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.390
that virtually every
film made in any society

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.170
reflected in deep
and fundamental ways

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.790
aspects of that society.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.560
And one of the reasons that
this is such an important thing

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.280
to recognize is it
means that, especially

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.180
in cultures like the
European societies

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.770
and those in the United States,
the movies are profoundly

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.830
illuminating source of
cultural and social history.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.440
Even if they had no
artistic interest,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.800
they would be worth
teaching and studying.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.970
And the fact that some of
them are luminous works of art

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:42.680
makes teaching them a particular
pleasure, a particular joy,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.640
a real vocation.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.760
So if we talk about films as a
national expression, what we're

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.720
talking about here is
the extent to which

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.100
the assumptions about
personal relationships

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.525
and the assumptions about
the way society operates

00:12:57.525 --> 00:13:00.570
are going to be grounded
in culturally, socially

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.570
specific phenomena,
socially specific practices.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.820
And we're also talking not just
about the content of movies,

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.470
but also about the structure
of the industries which end up

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.270
providing movies to the public.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.560
And part of what I
want to at least allude

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.500
to today in the
lectures and materials

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.680
that we're looking at today is
to crystallize or concretize

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.090
this idea that the
variations that

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:32.100
are possible within the broad
universe of the cinema so

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.680
that, for example, the
individual and atomistic system

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.470
that developed in
the United States

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.632
for the production of movies,
the capitalist arrangements

00:13:42.632 --> 00:13:44.090
that developed in
the United States

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.540
for the development of
movies, are in many ways

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.570
radically different
from the systems that

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.720
were developed in some
European societies

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.620
or in the Soviet Union.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.110
And there's a
particular contrast

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.640
with the Soviet Union,
which developed movies

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.570
in a quite different way and
had a quite different notion

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.580
about them.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.890
The emergence of
the movies coincides

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.750
in some degree with the
turmoil in the Soviet Union.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.670
The Russian Revolution is 1917.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:17.090
Movies become a central source
of information and propaganda

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.140
for the emerging
of Soviet culture.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.220
Lenin called movies
our greatest art form,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.110
because he understood
how important they

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.070
were in promulgating
certain ideals

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.590
and embedding those
ideals in the society.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.840
And in fact, there
were not in Russia

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.200
a series of independent
companies that produced films.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.554
There was a top-down arrangement
in which the government

00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:42.470
controlled filmmaking.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.220
It doesn't mean that
they didn't make

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.730
remarkable and
interesting films,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.980
but it was a different system.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.660
It was a top-down system.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.410
We had central
government financing

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:57.250
in which the genres
in Soviet films

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.340
could be said to
have had what we

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.870
might call rhetorical sources.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:08.400
For example, a revolution story
is one genre of Russian film,

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.520
celebrating the heroic
struggle of the people.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.240
There were even sort
of genres that we

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.370
might call building
genres or creating genres,

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:21.720
and they were about creating a
farm or building a skyscraper.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.930
And the film was put in the
service by the Soviet state,

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.450
was put in the service
of this emerging society.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.550
It was understood
as a system that

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.310
would mobilize
mass social forces

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.550
for the betterment of society.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:43.480
And these differences in
attitudes and in the ways films

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.370
are financed and who makes the
decisions about what films will

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.950
go forward, of course,
has a profound impact

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.720
on the nature of those movies.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.030
Our demonstration
instance today will

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.480
be one of the most famous
passages from Eisenstein's

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.190
Potemkin to demonstrate
some of the,

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.080
in a much more
concrete way, some

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.130
of the implications
of this difference

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.150
between American and Russian
film that I'm suggesting.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.470
There also profound differences,
and I'll develop this argument

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.870
a little more fully to this
evening when we shift over

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.240
to the great German
silent film that we're

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.190
going to look at tonight.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.330
There are profound differences
between the American and German

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.410
systems of moviemaking
and attitudes

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.060
toward the making of movies.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:37.660
And I'll elaborate on some
of those notions later today

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.440
in the evening lecture.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.380
But for the moment
then, suffice it

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:46.060
to say that virtually all
movies are going to reveal

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.084
or are going to
embody the values

00:16:48.084 --> 00:16:50.250
and assumptions of the
culture from which they come,

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.770
that that makes them
anthropological artifacts

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.820
of profound significance and
distinguishes French film

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.000
from British film
from American film

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.890
in ways that continue to be
illuminating and significant.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.869
But there's certain other
contrasts or potential tensions

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.220
in this notion of film
as a cultural form

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.160
that I'd also like
to develop or spend

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.359
a little bit more time on.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:19.130
One of them is the notion
that there's a profound, even

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.500
a fundamental
difference, more broadly,

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.680
not just between French
and American cinema,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.180
but between all forms
of European cinema

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.762
and the American version.

00:17:27.762 --> 00:17:30.220
And this is a principle we'll
talk about more this evening,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.780
but I want to allude to it now.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.289
One of the ways to
crystallize this

00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:35.080
is to remind you of
something we've already

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.230
talked about briefly
in the course, which

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.220
is the migration of
filmmaking from the east coast

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.830
to the west coast in the
early days of filmmaking

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.430
in the United States, the flight
of filmmakers to California.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.440
And we've talked a
little bit about why

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.190
that's a significant
transformation

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.090
and a significant move.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:18:00.340
But perhaps, the most important
aspect of this historical fact,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.070
the migration of the
movies to the west coast,

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.550
is that what this meant is that
the movies in the United States

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:12.650
were able to develop in a
culture whose intellectual

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.550
and artistic and
cultural authorities

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:19.490
were on the east coast, as far
away as possible from where

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.960
movies were developing.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.150
In other words,
the American movie

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:28.030
is much more fundamentally in
its emergence a popular form,

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.550
a form that has no consciousness
of itself as a work of art.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.150
It knows that what
it's trying to do

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.850
is make money and
entertain people,

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.570
and the earliest--
very early, there

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.250
were some directors
like DW Griffith who

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.409
recognized the artistic
importance of movies.

00:18:43.409 --> 00:18:45.700
I don't mean there weren't
directors who recognized it.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.620
Chaplin surely thought of
himself as making works of art,

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.360
especially later in his career.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.050
But the fact is
the American movies

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.440
begin on the farthest
Western verge of the society.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.770
Nothing developed there.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.850
New York is the cultural center.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.630
Boston is a cultural center.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.279
Maybe we could even say some
of the great Midwestern cities

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:04.820
have some kind of
cultural authority,

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.450
but there's nothing
on the west coast.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.720
And what that means is
that all the writers, all

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.840
the dramatists, all the
actors, all the theater actors,

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.634
all the poets, all
the musicians--

00:19:14.634 --> 00:19:15.550
they were in the East.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.850
They lived in New York, and
there was a kind of freedom

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.030
that this imparted
to American movies.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.650
And this is a very
sharp contrast

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.900
with the development of almost
all forms of European cinema,

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.290
partly because the cultures are
literally geographically more

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.150
limited, unlike the vast
expanse of the United States.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.620
But also because of the
much stronger traditions

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:45.280
in these European societies of
high culture, the much stronger

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.930
respect in these societies
for theater and for poetry

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.930
and for prose narrative.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.610
In the European societies,
and this was especially true

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.740
in Germany, but it was
true in some degree

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.370
in every European society,
including the Soviet Union,

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.370
there was a sense
that the movies

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:07.350
were emerging in the shadow of
older art forms whose greatness

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.940
and grandeur shadowed,
menaced this emerging form.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.196
And in a way, the
distinction I'm mentioning,

00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:16.820
the difference I'm
mentioning, accounts

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.740
both for the limitations
and for the glories

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.030
of both kinds of film,
because if the European film

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.020
was more static-- and
we'll talk much more.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.853
I'll give you some
examples of this tonight.

00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:29.450
If the European film
was more static,

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.430
it was less cinematic in
a way in its early years,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.900
because it thought of itself
as emerging from literature,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.160
from theater, from poetry.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.630
And in fact, some of the
important early German

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.450
filmmakers especially were
people who came from theater,

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.690
and they had theatrical
notions of what art was.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.800
We'll talk more about
this this evening.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.810
So because that
was true, the glory

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.650
of the early European
cinema was its recognition

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.390
that it could be
artistically powerful,

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:03.480
its sense that it was talking
about important subjects.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.990
But of course, the
limitations were

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.440
that it was often very boring
visually, that it was serious,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.890
but not a movie, that
it didn't exploit

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.400
the properties of the
medium nearly as quickly.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.860
It didn't try to explore the
unique properties of the medium

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.770
nearly as quickly, in part
because it was so in thrall

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.790
to inherited ideas of artistic
value and artistic expression.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.860
This isn't entirely a
disadvantage, as I said,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.740
because it also imparted
to European filmmakers

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.649
a sense of dignity and the
importance of their enterprise

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:37.190
that served them
well in certain ways

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.554
and made them pick
ambitious subjects.

00:21:39.554 --> 00:21:41.470
And you'll see the
outcome, the final outcome,

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.190
once the European film was
liberated into a greater

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.180
cinematic freedom.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.170
And I'll show you an example
or two tonight of that.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.810
It became something
immensely rich

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.440
in part because it had
this legacy of high art

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.580
behind it and high
artistic ambitions.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.160
The United States' story
is almost the opposite.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.490
In the United States,
there was a kind

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.610
of glorious sense of having no
responsibility toward older art

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.110
forms.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:11.550
There was something exuberant,
experimental, joyous,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.479
unembarrassed about
early American films.

00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:16.270
They didn't think of
themselves as artwork,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.080
so it gave them a
kind of freedom.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.490
They were also vulgar as hell.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.140
They were often
trivial and silly.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.640
They often had limited
artistic ambitions,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.920
but they explored the
nature of the medium

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.790
in a way that became the
legacy of movies and a legacy

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.806
that was communicated to
other societies as well.

00:22:35.806 --> 00:22:38.180
Well, this distinction then
between American and European

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.300
cinema is something I'll
develop a little bit more

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.229
fully with examples
this evening.

00:22:42.229 --> 00:22:43.520
But it's a crucial distinction.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.230
It's a crucial difference,
and it tells us a lot

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.730
about both forms of filmmaking.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.030
There's one final tension
that I want to mention here.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.250
We'll return to it
again when we come

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.650
to look at Singing
in the Rain later

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.050
in the course, which dramatizes
this subject among others.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.760
There's another kind of tension
implicit in what I've already

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.980
said, which is the tension
between what we might call

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.730
popular culture, notions
of culture that are enjoyed

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.250
by the masses, by everyone as
against high culture like opera

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:17.370
and poetry and theater, which
only the educated people go to.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.530
And this tension is
especially important-- it's

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.365
important in many
films-- but it's

00:23:23.365 --> 00:23:26.290
an especially important
tension in American movies.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:31.270
And one of things that we will
come back to in different ways

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.680
as we think about these American
films is the way in which

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.630
very often, American
films position themselves

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.597
as the antagonist
of high culture.

00:23:39.597 --> 00:23:41.180
And there are many
films that actually

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.790
do that, and some
of the Marx Brothers

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:47.410
films systematically dismantle
the objects of high culture.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.450
There's one Marx Brothers
film called A Night

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.420
at the Opera, which
takes place in an opera,

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.030
and the whole set
comes crashing down.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.450
The whole place falls apart
in the course of the film,

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.990
acting out a kind of aggression
against the older art form.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.990
And this is a tension also
that we will see played out

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.890
in some of the films we're
going to be looking at a bit

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:08.755
later in the course.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:17.690
So this notion of
Hollywood as the embodiment

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:23.380
of a certain kind of demotic
vigor and populist energy

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.610
is a helpful way
of thinking about

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.960
how, especially in
the early years,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.200
American film was somewhat
different from European film,

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.390
and how it also very
aggressively was

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:40.300
happy to distinguish itself
from established art forms.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.450
I want to take a quick, what
will appear to be a digression,

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:44.310
but actually isn't.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:49.320
I want to talk a bit now
about two crucial terms that

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.881
will be useful in our
discussions of the matters I've

00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:54.630
already raised and
some other matters that

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.540
will come up later
in the course,

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:02.790
and then return after clarifying
these terms to an example

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.100
from Battleship Potemkin,
Eisenstein's most famous film,

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.290
to demonstrate
something of what I mean

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:15.810
by the principles of top-down
organization and film

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.360
as propaganda that I was
talking about earlier,

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.160
as well as calling
your attention to some

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.490
of the artistic
innovations that we still

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.650
attribute to Sergei Eisenstein.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.920
The two terms I want to discuss
are the terms montage and mise

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.860
en scene.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.980
They're contrasting elements
of what is in all movies.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.800
In a certain way, the term
montage and the term mise

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.310
en scene describe the
most essential features

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.930
of what movies are.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:48.130
Mise en scene, a term drawn
from the theater, which

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.380
literally, it's a French word.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.660
It literally means
what is put or placed

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.840
in the scene, what
is in the scene.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.050
Mise en scene refers
to the single shot,

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:02.500
to what goes on within the
single continuous unedited shot

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.260
of film, the frame of film,
however long it lasts.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.210
And the mise en
scene of that shot

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.120
is virtually everything
inside that frame.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.650
In other words, even how
the actors move in the frame

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.716
is part of the mise en scene,
but especially, the mise

00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:22.600
en scene emphasizes what
is the environment like,

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.289
what's the furniture
like, what's

00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:26.580
the relation between the
foreground, the middle ground,

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.490
and the background.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:32.640
And in mise en
scene, the emphasis

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.240
is on the composition
within the frame,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.790
and sometimes very
great directors

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.150
will compose their
frames with such subtlety

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.160
that if you freeze them,
they look like paintings.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.820
They're balanced or
unbalanced if that's

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.370
the artist's intention
in particularly

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.100
artistic and complex ways.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.740
So we can think of
this in some sense

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.380
almost as having a kind
of painterly equivalent.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.740
What goes on in
the scene within?

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.260
The other great term, montage,
which is also a French term,

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.830
comes from the verb the French
verb monter, which means

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.540
to assemble or to put together.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.000
And a montage means what is
put together, what is edited,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.280
what is linked together.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.060
So a montage means the
editing of continuous shots

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.490
in a sequence.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:27.900
So the montage of a film is
the rhythm of its editing.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.059
So all films have
both elements in them,

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:32.100
and in fact, we need to
be aware of both of them.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.570
When we look at a film,
it's often very helpful

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.740
to ask yourself questions about
the rhythm of the editing,

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.280
to pay attention to how
long the shots are held,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.860
to the way the film is edited.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.371
Again, the Eisenstein
example we're

00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:45.120
going to look at in a
minute will give you

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.470
some dramatic instances
of why manipulating

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.030
the editing and
the montage can be

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.400
so dramatic and so signifying.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.800
So there's a kind of
convention that has developed,

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.530
and though ti radically
simplifies in some ways,

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:05.340
it's a simplification that's
immensely instructive.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.790
One way you can
talk about directors

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.240
is to categorize them
as montage directors

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.744
or mise en scene directors.

00:28:13.744 --> 00:28:15.660
Mise en scene directors--
I'm oversimplifying,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.380
remember, because there's
montage in every film.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.870
So a mise en scene
director can be

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.970
a master of editing
too, and a director

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.650
that we identify as a
montage director certainly

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.880
has to know how to
manipulate his mise en scene.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.240
So it's not as if
one kind of director

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.670
doesn't do the other thing, but
what it does try to signify,

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.500
what it does try to
indicate is that directors

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.290
we call montage directors are
directors whose effects come

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.740
in a central way from the
way they edit the film,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.350
from the quickness
of their editing,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.460
from the way their editing
manipulates or controls

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.590
meaning in some sense.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.560
And we therefore would think of
montage directors-- Eisenstein

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.660
is a classic example.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.495
Hitchcock is probably
the contemporary example,

00:28:58.495 --> 00:29:01.120
near contemporary example, that
most of you might have in mind,

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.060
in which the editing of the
film, the quickness with which

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.990
the shots develop,
the way the music

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.740
is superimposed on
the editing rhythm,

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.490
to increase your emotional
response to the film.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.340
What we would say
is that that's what

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.190
a montage director embodies.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.840
So if we say that Hitchcock is
a montage director, what we mean

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.910
is that most of his
most profound meanings

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.480
come from the way in
which he edits his film.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.550
And a contrast would be,
let's say, with a director

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:40.630
like the director we're going
to see in a few weeks later

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.980
in the term, Jean Renoir,
a realistic director

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.670
who might be called much more
fully a mise en scene director,

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.030
because he does edit.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.190
His editing rhythms
are subtle, but he's

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.510
interested in long takes.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.440
Montage directors
like short takes,

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.330
shots that last
only a short time.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.810
In the most dramatic
segments of the segment

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.970
from Battleship
Potemkin that I'm

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.460
going to show you this
afternoon in a few minutes,

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.410
sometimes the edits are so
brief that they don't even

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.660
last a second and a half.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.190
The average number of shots
in the film as a whole,

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.290
in Battleship
Potemkin as a whole,

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:20.870
the shots last four seconds.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.305
That's not very long.

00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:28.720
In a Renoir film, they might
last 10, 15 seconds, sometimes

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.060
much longer than that.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.590
That's a very long time
for a shot to be held,

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.800
and if a shot is held that long,
it means the camera will move,

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.290
action will occur in it, but
it'll still be a single shot.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.623
And can you see that if you
hold the shot for that time,

00:30:42.623 --> 00:30:44.971
and the camera moves like
this, what is it encouraging?

00:30:44.971 --> 00:30:46.970
It's encouraging you to
think about the relation

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.980
between characters
and the environment.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.600
It's encouraging a kind
of realistic response

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.190
to what the film is showing
you, whereas if you're

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.420
looking at a film in which the
cuts occur every two seconds,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.915
you don't have time
to sort of take

00:31:00.915 --> 00:31:05.540
in what's the relation between
the actor and the furniture.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.270
You're disoriented, and
in fact, Hitchcock often

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.650
brought his editing to a
point just below the threshold

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:13.630
of disorientation.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.830
When Eisenstein was theorizing
about the power of editing--

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.060
he was one of the first
great film theorists--

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.990
he talked about the way in which
you could control an audience

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.797
physiologically by
manipulating montage.

00:31:25.797 --> 00:31:26.380
And it's true.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.520
You can, as you will
know, and something

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.210
that fascist societies are
fully aware of and make use of.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.600
So this distinction between
montage and mise en scene

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.950
is immensely useful,
and in some degree,

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:45.670
if you apply the
terms generously

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.470
and tactfully, you can learn
something about every film

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:53.130
you look at by thinking
about how these elements work

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.960
in the film.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.040
I want to turn now to
arguably, certainly

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.620
one of the most famous films
in the history of cinema

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:08.090
and to a particular
fragment from the film

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:12.320
or an extended
one, which I think

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.910
embodies and will help clarify
many of the abstract ideas I've

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.820
just been suggesting to you.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.470
Let me say a word
about the film.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.170
The film Battleship Potemkin
was produced in 1925

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.150
at a point when Eisenstein was
now at the height of his power

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.440
and authority.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:36.470
And it commemorates a moment in
an abortive revolution of 1905

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:40.220
so that by the time Eisenstein
came to make the film,

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.240
Battleship Potemkin was kind
of like a founding story,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.640
or at least, it was about
an abortive founding that

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.330
would then occur years later.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.550
What it dramatized
was a historical fact.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:01.770
There was a rebellion by the
crew of the Battleship Potemkin

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.630
against its officers,
and it the battleship

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:13.480
sailed into the port of
Odessa, and its mutineers

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.120
were welcomed by the people
in the port of Odessa.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.210
And then the czar, angry that
his Navy and his Naval officers

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.840
had been mutinied against,
sent soldiers to Odessa

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.140
to decimate not
just the mutineers,

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.900
but the population of Odessa.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.980
And so the film, it was
understood in a way,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.660
it was a revolutionary
document or an attempt

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.590
to sort of create a
kind of founding myth

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.420
for Russian society, because
everyone watching the film

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.520
would have known that the
real revolution occurred only

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.570
whatever it was, 12
or 13 years later,

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:57.200
and that this was a
kind of rehearsal.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:03.480
And so the film would have
had a kind of patriotic aura

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.320
for its audience.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:11.090
So the passage I'm going to
show you is the famous passage.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.530
I think David Cook calls
this the most famous montage

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:16.730
sequence in the
history of cinema.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.446
It was certainly
profoundly influential,

00:34:18.446 --> 00:34:20.154
and as we're watching
it, I may interrupt

00:34:20.154 --> 00:34:22.210
it to say a few things
as you're watching,

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.870
but I'll try not to do
too much interruption.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.790
What I want you to watch
for especially is not only--

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.159
I will have to make some
commentary-- as you're watching

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:35.250
it, among other things,
watch for the way

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:41.590
in which the length of the
shots or the time between shots

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.510
varies.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:47.909
And as this passage
begins to increase

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:52.910
in intensity and terror, the
cuts become even briefer.

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:54.409
And then watch also
the way in which

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:58.550
certain other strategies
of Eisenstein's reinforce

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.920
these montage strategies.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.050
For example, where the
camera is positioned.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:05.369
Is it looking up at a character,
or is it looking down?

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:06.410
And very different thing.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.560
If you look up, you
enlarge, and you mythify.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.240
If you look down, you
humiliate and minimize.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.760
Watch how he does
that sort of thing.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:20.330
You'll find it, I think, very
illuminating and significant.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:24.705
The sequence is
often seen today,

00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:27.282
and rightfully, I suppose,
as deeply heavy-handed,

00:35:27.282 --> 00:35:29.740
because you're not allowed when
you're looking at this film

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.870
to have an alternative
view of things.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.300
The film doesn't leave you room.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.560
Eisenstein's strategies
don't leave you

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.970
room for independent judgment.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:46.150
You're immersed in a spectacle
so emotional and so wrenching

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.330
that you don't have
time to sort of sit back

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.770
and think and come
to conclusions.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.186
And one could say
that this is one

00:35:51.186 --> 00:35:53.820
of the great differences
between montage directors

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.270
and mise en scene directors.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.310
Not an accident most horror
movies, all horror movies

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.420
really, are a form of montage,
because your feelings are

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.280
being manipulated.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.750
You're not supposed to
be allowed to sit back

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.820
and say how ridiculously
implausible these events are.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.007
If that happened, it
would spoil the film.

00:36:12.007 --> 00:36:13.340
We'll come back to these things.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.470
So here is the
Odessa step sequence

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.387
from the Battleship Potemkin.

00:36:20.387 --> 00:36:23.670
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:30.820
These are the Odessans
welcoming the mutineers.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.440
One of the things that
Eisenstein was fond of

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.070
was a theory of montage that
was based on two principles.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:44.227
One he called typage,
typage-- T-Y-P-A-G-E.

00:36:44.227 --> 00:36:46.560
And what he meant by typage
was the idea that there were

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.690
ethnic, very racist in a
way, that there were ethnic

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:53.530
and social types that could
be recognized visually.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.880
So he would type.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.250
So he felt, if I
show you this face,

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.320
you'll know he's a
working class character.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.170
If I show you a
woman with a parasol,

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.807
you'll know that she belongs
to the upper classes.

00:37:06.807 --> 00:37:08.640
And in fact, he's
probably right about that.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:27.777
Here are the czar's forces,
come to punish the mutineers

00:37:27.777 --> 00:37:28.735
and the city of Odessa.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.960
So the soldiers are on top,
and they're forcing people down

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.749
the steps, and they are
presumably shooting them. .

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.090
Kristen, freeze it for a second.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.710
I don't want to distract you
by talking while it's running,

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.220
so let me interrupt
it for a second

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.420
and say something else about
the way the film works.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.050
One of the things
Eisenstein understood was--

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.470
and it's actually a
brilliant discovery.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:23.510
He realized that he could
create through his strategies,

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.730
especially of
dramatic editing, he

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.290
could create a
situation in which

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.950
the actual time of the
experience that you're watching

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:34.280
was not real time, but was what
might be called emotional time.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.640
That is to say what's happening
here, it's probably in the film

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.760
taking longer than
it took in reality,

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.520
because in moments of horror,
the horror is extended.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.160
And watch how those kinds of
rhythms operate in the film.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:47.660
OK.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.220
Seems like a naive hope.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.250
Freeze it again, Kristen.

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.030
One other quick observation.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.040
I hope you recognize
how artful this

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.175
is, even if you're
not moved in the way

00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:15.800
the original audiences
would have been.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.390
I think contemporary
audiences often

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.650
feel it's too heavy-handed.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.790
They resist the extent to which
the film is manipulating them,

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.086
but think back to the
earliest days of film.

00:41:25.086 --> 00:41:29.190
What an unbelievable, shocking,
incredibly exciting experience

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.450
it must have been
for early film-goers

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.610
to have an experience
that-- certainly

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.270
for the Russian audience, but I
think for every audience-- that

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.440
was so intense and so
emotionally powerful, so full

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.160
of fear and violence
that can be evoked

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.250
by the rhythms of the
editing, by the music,

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.150
by how close-- I hope
you noticed the way

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.380
he mixes in closeups in
incredibly powerful ways trying

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.790
to create certain effects.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.250
Again, you're not given a choice
about how to feel about this.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:00.050
You can descend from it by
withdrawing your interest,

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.900
but you can't say, oh, I
really love those soldiers

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.210
who were doing the shooting.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.870
Let's make a case for them.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.170
The film won't allow
you to do that, will it?

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.730
In that sense, it's
manipulating you,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:15.540
but it's telling us a
story about the creation

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.960
of a revolutionary society.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.100
Finally, remember,
I said that this

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:25.457
is a question about emotional
time as against real time.

00:42:25.457 --> 00:42:27.040
Think how long this
has been going on.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.720
You think that this
massacre is over,

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.750
but in fact, it's only
half over, as you'll see.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.860
There's going to
be a moment when

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.290
horse-mounted cossacks,
horsemen, show up

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:42.037
at the bottom of the steps
and get them in a pincher.

00:42:42.037 --> 00:42:42.537
Go on.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:11.300
I don't think this soundtrack
is the original soundtrack.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.076
It's very good though.

00:43:15.076 --> 00:43:16.200
This is a brilliant moment.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.640
I don't know whether we can
attribute this to Eisenstein

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.780
or not when suddenly
the music stops.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:37.729
There should be sound now.

00:43:37.729 --> 00:43:39.270
Maybe something
wrong with our print.

00:44:16.025 --> 00:44:17.900
I wanted to wait at
least until you saw this,

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.490
because some of
you may recognize

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.780
this moment as something
that's been copied

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:27.830
in recent American
movies, a kind of allusion

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.749
or a reference to this scene.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.865
The moment I wanted you to think
about is this baby carriage.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:05.300
OK.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.500
Thanks, Kristen.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.330
Blood in the
eyeglasses-- can you

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.580
think of a movie in which
you've seen that recently?

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.700
Maybe not that recently.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.960
It's actually an ancient
film now by your standards.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.771
How about The Godfather?

00:46:16.771 --> 00:46:18.520
There's a wonderful
scene in The Godfather

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.230
where a guy looks up
from a massage table,

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.680
and he's shot through
the eyeglasses.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.860
Very memorable moment.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.570
It's surely an
allusion to this movie,

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.719
but how about the
carriage going down?

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:30.510
There have been several
films that actually

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.050
recreate that
moment, but the one

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.970
I'm thinking of-- Who is it?

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.927
AUDIENCE: The Untouchables.

00:46:35.927 --> 00:46:36.760
DAVID THORBURN: Yes.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.849
From The Untouchables.

00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:38.640
Who's the director?

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.411
Do you remember?

00:46:39.411 --> 00:46:39.910
Yes.

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:42.300
Brian De Palma's film,
The Untouchables,

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.810
has a moment just like that.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.810
And De Palma, of course, is a
kind of historian of movies.

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.730
Virtually every scene
in a De Palma film

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.390
is a reference or an
allusion to an earlier film.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:56.000
And part of the importance
of Battleship Potemkin

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.410
is that it is still a fruitful
and fructifying source

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.070
of imagery for
contemporary filmmakers.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:05.380
So let me conclude then
by simply reminding you

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.160
that, as Cook
suggests in his book,

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.420
this is the single most
influential montage

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:15.460
sequence in cinema
history, and that it's

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:21.460
a wonderful instance for us, I
think, of the way in which film

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:24.640
in a different kind of culture,
in an authoritarian culture,

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.840
in a revolutionary culture,
full of moral fervor,

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.570
would be conceived
both as an apparatus,

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:38.780
as an engine of social
transformation by a society

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:42.670
that controlled film in a
way fundamentally different

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.870
from the way in which
film developed, let's say,

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.470
in the United States.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.100
We will continue
these arguments,

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.730
and I hope complicate
them this evening.

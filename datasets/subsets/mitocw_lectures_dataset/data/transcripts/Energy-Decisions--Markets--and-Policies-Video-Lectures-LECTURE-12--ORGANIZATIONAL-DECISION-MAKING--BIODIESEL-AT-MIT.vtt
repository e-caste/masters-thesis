RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I want to
say a little bit about Hexion

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.840
to relate to where we are
today and then do biodiesel,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.450
which is a great case.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.390
Obviously if Darren were
making his own decision,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.650
if Darren were the CEO or
Darren owned the company,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.430
then his decision to use
combined heat and power

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.880
to generate would reflect
his preferences, whatever

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.630
they happen to be.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.480
And if Darren was
consistent over time,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.330
you could predict
Darren's decisions

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.470
from his past decisions.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.750
But it's a committee.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.830
And the case doesn't go
into-- in my modification,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.700
the case didn't really go
into who was on that committee

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.500
and who the doubters are.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.740
But it's clear he had to
get by a group of people.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.710
And there's no guarantee that a
group of people is consistent.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.170
They had different questions.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.940
You could read into
those questions

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.970
different preferences about
downtime, different worries

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.080
about bonuses.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.020
You couldn't really tell--

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.080
again, you'd have to have a lot
more than the questions they

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.150
asked or the objections
they posed to predict

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.095
what the decision would be.

00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:49.470
It sounds like Darren would
have just run the spreadsheet

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.480
and done it.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.180
But others, who knows?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.210
The terms that Cohen,
March, & Olson use,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.170
this is a group with
problematic preferences.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.390
And groups have
problematic preferences.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.479
There's no reason in
principle why groups are

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.790
consistent in making decisions.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.220
You may recall we did
this voting paradox

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.600
thing some time ago where if
I have preferences arranged

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.630
correctly, I can get any
decision I want by deciding

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.100
which pairs you consider first.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.740
So there's no reason that a
group would be consistent.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.880
And in fact, if you think
about just that committee,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.920
you'd like to know
who shows up, you'd

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.690
like to know what
arguments are made,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.790
you'd like to know
who's prepared,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.060
you'd like to know what other
items are on the agenda.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.840
If you've been in committees,
you know how this works.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.940
Sometimes somebody
will lose an argument.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.730
And to keep that
person on board,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.310
they get to win the next
one, et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.110
So Cohen, March, and Olsen talk
about problematic preferences

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.380
in organized anarchiies
like universities.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.910
The only point I
want to make here

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.670
is that if you
think about Hexion,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.350
and you think
about Darren trying

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.030
to get this project approved
through some kind of committee,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.840
that story holds--

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.730
who shows up, what are
they interested in,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.810
what are their motivations,
how prepared are they, what

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.900
other issues are up that day.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.480
You can't assume
consistency, and you may not

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.760
be able to predict decisions.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.768
So we're going to
see some of this,

00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:32.560
and we're going to see
some other features.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.727
We'll see this, and we'll
also see some other things

00:03:34.727 --> 00:03:37.990
in biodiesel which
has to do with a more

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.570
complicated and presumably
anarchic organization--

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.150
us.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.430
So the story you all know, a
student-led group, simple goal,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.450
you take the used cooking oil
and convert it into diesel fuel

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.370
to replace the diesel--

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.910
save the reprocessing
cost and use it

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.340
in tech shuttles,
other equipment.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.190
Lots of diesel
engines around campus.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.380
I assume you've
all read the case.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.840
There is a short video
that's actually--

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.920
if I can get it to work, it's
sort of a nice description

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.160
told by the participants.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.960
And I'm going to
refer back to this.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.627
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:25.627 --> 00:04:27.445
- Animal, so animal weight.

00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:30.540
- The whole biodiesel
from used vegetable oil

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.236
is definitely a
good idea because it

00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:35.990
reduces waste as well as
creates a useful product.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.950
- Biodiesel MIT, the student-run
organization that's been

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.560
working to get a biodiesel
processor installed on campus

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.745
is going to take the used
vegetable oil from campus

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.695
dining from fryolators and all
that kind of stuff and convert

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:51.570
it into fuel for the
tech shuttles on campus.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.960
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: This
was made in 2010, this video.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.285
- So the smell of French
fries [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:03.768
- I got involved because
I heard about biodiesel.

00:05:03.768 --> 00:05:05.185
I was working in
renewable energy.

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:08.545
- I heard they were looking
for someone to do some testing.

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:11.890
- When I got here as a freshman,
I was really looking for some

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.305
sort of energy and [INAUDIBLE]
environmental initiative.

00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:17.490
- I joined the group actually
as the website manager.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.310
- They needed me
to find them help.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.610
So, I figured I have the skill
set to help with the project.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.810
- I tried from the
beginning to say

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.540
this is not a research problem.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.890
It is an implementation problem.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.800
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.290
- The group had been
told, if you get funding,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.055
it'll be easier.

00:05:36.055 --> 00:05:38.480
- The project's going to pay
for itself within a year.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.920
- We also wrote up a proposal
for the mtvU GE Eco-imagination

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.590
Challenge.

00:05:48.572 --> 00:05:52.670
The charismatic view
from mtvU came in first.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.250
And they had balloons,
they had this giant check.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.220
I had to go take a
math test after that.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.018
The administration
had theoretically

00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:05.935
supported the project.

00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:09.130
- You can parallel
this as people

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.690
in a community
going to government

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.760
and saying, we
have the solution.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.830
We just need a place
for it, and maybe

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.368
incentives, economic incentive.

00:06:17.368 --> 00:06:18.910
- I really didn't
think it would take

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.320
that much time because the
group had just won $25,000.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.037
- But we had no experience
with implementation.

00:06:25.037 --> 00:06:26.370
We have no experience in policy.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.578
- We still didn't have space.

00:06:27.578 --> 00:06:30.270
We still didn't
have a processor.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.090
There wasn't really anything
tangible that people could see.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.550
So we lost a lot of, I guess,
recognition and student

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.050
support.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.990
- We had the technical
problem solved,

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.320
so we thought everything
else was easy.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.850
This experience
actually taught me

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.900
that it's actually
the other way around.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.750
So even if you have
the technology,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.420
if it's not going
to be implemented

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.880
by the government or
the administration,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.186
nothing's going to happen.

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:03.300
- So we got to a point at
the very end of the Spring

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.730
semester in 2008 where the
administrative organization

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.670
that had been helping us
look for space basically

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.700
just said our least
expensive may turn out

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.240
like $160,000 in renovation.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.610
This is really just infeasible.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.527
We're going to stop
looking for space for you.

00:07:18.527 --> 00:07:20.270
And I'm sorry, we can help you.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.810
So we agreed that we
would terminate the group.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.810
- We came to a conclusion after
a lot of struggling, especially

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.050
because it seemed at the point
that all the effort was wasted.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.580
- There's actually,
like immediately

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.440
calling that, a huge
student uprising of support.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.210
Three or four days
later, we get a call

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.220
from the Kennedy [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.198
And practically Facilities
was all like, hey,

00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:45.115
we can get back again.

00:07:45.115 --> 00:07:47.282
We found you space this time.

00:07:47.282 --> 00:07:51.175
This is Biodiesel@MIT's
biodiesel processor.

00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:53.950
- Being part of the
group has helped

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.750
me realize how important the
politics of it all can be.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.610
- I'm so convinced that the
policy is more important.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.005
- It's just pushed me
to a minor in policy.

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:04.360
- Putting different
groups of people

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.705
together always produced
pretty good results.

00:08:07.705 --> 00:08:09.195
- There have to
be first members.

00:08:09.195 --> 00:08:10.930
- Even if you have
a good idea, it

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.790
doesn't really matter
if you have to change

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.990
the way people do things.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.700
- But after
Biodiesel@MIT, I know

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.090
that people will be able
to do things like this

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.324
much more easily.

00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:23.782
[MUSIC PLAYING]

[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.923
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:08:55.923 --> 00:08:57.590
The group's website
doesn't seem to have

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.720
been touched since last
summer, so I don't know

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.430
what its current status is.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.360
But they did manage
to produce fuel.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.760
So I'll just run lightly
through the history

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.460
because I want to spend
some time on the discussion.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.770
Did that raise any questions
vis-a-vis the case, by the way?

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.530
Is that pretty clear?

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.350
The first time we
taught this case,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.950
Sara presented it, so
nice to see her again.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.470
So they talked to
the administration

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.500
and they were told, if you
have dollars and space, why,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.830
that's great.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:37.680
They won this award, they looked
for space from the full of 2007

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:45.780
through the spring of 2008,
they gave up, space was found,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.470
and they installed the process.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.960
So they actually
did produce fuel.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.880
And at least according
to the website,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.700
it's in use, or was in use,
at least as of last summer.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.500
So there it is.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.260
It's a nice project
if you think about it.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.510
From the MIT point of view,
it's got some research.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.110
Somebody had to do
the cost analysis.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.000
They had to get
this stuff tested.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.890
They had to get the system work.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.170
They had to design
the logistics,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.381
a lot of interesting
things, good photos.

00:10:18.381 --> 00:10:20.530
It comes out a little
murky you will see,

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.530
but it can be made usable.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.420
But it took a long time.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.790
And you got the
frustration in that video.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.940
And I hope you got the
frustration in the case.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.700
A project that seemed like
such a good thing, and the case

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.201
goes on, it saves energy, it's
clean burning, it's swell,

00:10:45.201 --> 00:10:48.400
it took a long time.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.930
So I want to talk about, and we
will talk at some length about

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.070
why that happened because I
think this really is a good

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:01.140
case in terms of what it takes
to make organizations change,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.040
that's what this is
about, and why they don't.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.640
So the conventional
explanation, and you

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.580
could see it in Sara's
face was, gee, if only

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.155
you'd been a better leader,
if only, if only, if only.

00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:19.620
The whole Women in Science
Initiative here a few years ago

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.280
really did have a big impact,
really did change things.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.610
How come that worked?

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:30.648
How come that went off
right away and this didn't?

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.690
The alternative might be
that there was something

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.130
about the organization.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.910
And it wasn't a matter of
better or worse leadership.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.860
It was a matter of
strategy running up

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.150
against organizational problems.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.900
So I think there are
more things in the story.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.140
What we got in the case, and
what you get in the video,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.420
is they tried real
hard, they gave up,

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.360
and then suddenly
the space was found.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.430
And it's got to be more
complicated than that.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.700
So we think--

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.530
I think context is
really important.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.680
So let's walk through
a little bit of this.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.850
So in the video, Sara
talks about "and we

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.400
talk to the administration
and the administration

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.570
was supportive."

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.850
And you hear, that,
you hear people

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.960
talk about large organizations
in the singular a lot.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.140
BP does this, Goldman
Sachs does that.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.470
The administration does
one thing and another.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.650
Well, it's not a black box.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.950
It's a set of people.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.140
That's just the top set.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.684
That's the top layer.

00:12:38.684 --> 00:12:41.780
And there are rules.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.005
That shows reporting
relationships, who reports up

00:12:45.005 --> 00:12:47.630
through the provost, who reports
up through the chancellor, who

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.690
reports up through the executive
vice president and treasurer,

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.060
a little dotted line
responsibility here

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.270
from Israel, a Sloan graduate.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.920
She's a Sloan graduate,
but never mind.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.637
If you look at MIT,
there's a formal hierarchy.

00:13:04.637 --> 00:13:06.470
I'll show you some more
organization charts.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.040
People report to
people, particularly

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.050
outside the faculty
realm, particularly

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.470
in the staff side of the
operation, which is what

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.510
they were largely dealing with.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.340
They're specialized
responsibilities.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.520
Different people have different
jobs, different things

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.440
they're judged on.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:30.380
And they're a set of
rules, formal, informal,

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.630
but mostly formal
rules and procedures

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.800
about how we do things.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.960
You can go on the
MIT website, and you

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.600
can get the rules and
regulations of the faculty.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.270
You can get a document called
Policies and Procedures that

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.220
lays out a lot.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.430
In various other places,
there are sets of rules

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.570
deep into organizations.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.770
I mean, it's a bureaucracy.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.580
That's not-- that's a technical
term, an organization that

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.980
has all of those things.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.810
Most large
organizations have to be

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.290
bureaucracies to
get things done.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.123
You got to have hierarchies
and reporting responsibilities,

00:14:02.123 --> 00:14:03.790
and you've got to
divide responsibility,

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.530
and you've got to have some
rules for how we do stuff.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.820
That makes for efficiency.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.945
It doesn't make for change.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.800
There are also a set
of informal rules.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.150
Who votes with whom?

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.410
Who talks to whom?

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.750
Who supports whom?

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.420
What are the
communication channels

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.780
in this complicated entity?

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.440
So, whenever you think about
changing an organization

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.380
or about how an
organization behaves,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.270
you got to think about
it in the plural.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.150
It's a set of people, it's
a set of relationships,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:46.690
it's a set of rules, a
set of responsibilities.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:53.970
And here are-- oh, yeah,
let's go to the next one.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.580
So this is a description--

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.410
I'm not quite sure
where it's from--

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.870
of what Biodiesel@MIT does.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.200
They work with-- they have
to work with Campus Dining,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.110
Facilities, Environmental
Health and Safety,

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.840
MBP Bioenergy, I think,
was the reactor supplier,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.100
and the Energy Initiative.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.870
And it's designed to do some
training and to make biodiesel.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.510
That's sort of where
this organization

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.200
has to be situated,
has to get space,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.340
has to pass Environmental
Health and Safety because things

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.370
can go wrong with the reaction.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.750
And you've got a lot
of material around.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.730
The Energy Initiative,
not so clear.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.900
Health and Safety, yeah.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.640
Campus Dining to get the fuel.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.410
Lots of places.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:47.700
Who was the most
troublesome from the case?

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.900
What parts?

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.900
Max.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.900
MAX: --trying to
find them space.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.630
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That
was the CRSP, the Committee

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.760
for Review of Space Planning.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.960
Anybody else troublesome?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.230
Scott.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.647
SCOTT: Also the
Health and Safety,

00:16:00.647 --> 00:16:03.160
it was a lot of
different back and forth.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.810
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Health and Safety.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.300
Anybody else?

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.152
Yeah.

00:16:08.152 --> 00:16:11.275
AUDIENCE: They said something
about the janitorial service.

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:13.690
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That's
facilities basically, yup.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.232
AUDIENCE: And there
were members that

00:16:15.232 --> 00:16:18.064
were in class familiar
with isolating systems.

00:16:18.064 --> 00:16:19.600
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.050
Let's unpack it a little bit.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:26.200
Let's see, Facilities and
Environmental Health and Safety

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.980
report up through the executive
vice president and treasurer.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.750
We can see them there.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.950
This unpacks the organization
from the website.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.150
There's Facilities, there's the
Environmental Health and Safety

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.190
reporting up through
the executive vice

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.320
president and treasurer.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.960
What are their day jobs?

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.210
What's Environmental Health
and Safety's day job?

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.800
What are they mostly
concerned with?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.950
They don't exist to provide
space for student activities.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.372
What do they exist to do?

00:16:56.372 --> 00:16:56.872
Jacob.

00:16:56.872 --> 00:16:58.789
JACOB: I know they do a
lot of safety training

00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:02.360
for people for different labs
and students who are working

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:02.860
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.235
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So their job

00:17:04.235 --> 00:17:08.230
is to prevent accidents,
and incidents, and hazards.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.829
They do training.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.460
They also work
with people to make

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.280
sure they're in compliance
with a variety of regulations

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.760
and try to instill
best practices to make

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.940
the place safe.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.819
They want to reduce risk.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.270
They want to reduce risk.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.490
What about Facilities?

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.430
What's its main job?

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.810
What's its day job?

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.685
Again-- yeah, Columbus.

00:17:30.685 --> 00:17:34.030
COLUMBUS: To make sure that
the physical buildings are

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.401
operating correctly.

00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:37.930
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That
the physical plant runs,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.673
that it's clean, that it's
warm when it needs to be warm,

00:17:40.673 --> 00:17:42.340
that it's cool when
it needs to be cool,

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.510
that the plumbing works, the
electricity works, things

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.520
are clean and
landscaped and all that.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.860
They're concerned with
the physical plant,

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.990
keeping it going.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.970
OK, CRSP, CRSP is a
more complicated story.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.580
Sorry, that's the acronym.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.760
The space planners are a
more complicated story.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.540
But just to give you a sense,
here's-- what do I have first?

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.610
Here's Facilities.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.130
So Facilities-- I don't
have people down there.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.190
But there are people
in all these boxes.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.210
That's what
Facilities looks like,

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.570
worrying about the utilities,
worrying about security,

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.480
janitorial services,
grounds, making sure

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.810
the mail gets delivered,
and a whole lot of overhead.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.830
That's the planning, building
new construction, renovation,

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.690
and so forth.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.910
A fairly complicated
organization,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.810
not unusually complicated
for an institution this size,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.120
but fairly complicated.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.020
And lots of people.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.532
And everybody's got a job.

00:18:45.532 --> 00:18:46.990
Whoever these folks
are, they worry

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.365
about getting the
mail delivered.

00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:52.510
And these folks worry about
the grounds and landscaping.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:53.720
That's their job.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.180
That's how they're evaluated.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:03.830
And you don't see a provide
lab space for students.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.600
Not their job.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.220
Environmental
Health and Safety--

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.810
you have to have
an MIT certificate

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.050
to get this org chart, which
I don't quite understand.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.590
But I had to type in a bunch
of credentials twice to get it.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.220
But there's Environmental
Health and Safety.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.300
You got folks worried
about the reactor,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.780
a variety of other
responsibilities,

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.330
some technicians out here.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.790
A whole set of people
concerned with minimizing risk.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.510
So these are simple,
focused organizations.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.130
So when Sara talks about "the
administration," we talked

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.710
to the administration,
the first question

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.910
is, who, who did you talk to?

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.130
What was that person's
role in the hierarchy?

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.500
What was their responsibility?

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.420
What rules were they
operating under?

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.960
And how are they judged?

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.510
Now, let me come to the
really interesting one.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.540
This is CRSP.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.630
I have to tell you in
nine years as dean,

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.750
I never actually knew
who was all on CRSP.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.900
But CRSP was like one of--

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.800
I can't remember whether it was
a Carter advisor or a Clinton

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.300
advisor who said,
when I die, I want

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.940
to come back as the bond
market because everybody's

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.878
afraid of the bond market.

00:20:19.878 --> 00:20:22.170
Well, I'd like to come back
as CRSP because everybody's

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.080
afraid of CRSP.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.120
At MIT, space isn't priced.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.790
Departments, labs,
don't rent space.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.220
Space is allocated.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.037
But space is a status symbol.

00:20:36.037 --> 00:20:38.370
If you're running a lab, you
want to have a lot of space

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.410
because that means you're
active, you're busy.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.240
I mean, those of us
who work at our desks,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.560
we're out of this game.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.130
But in most of MIT,
space is a status symbol,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.100
and CRSP allocates space.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.210
CRSP is a nice
illustration, its processes,

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.690
of the garbage can model.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:02.310
First, CRSP deals with
proposed solutions.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.760
And this is a characteristic
of lots of entities and lots

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.740
of organizations.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.050
How can Congress,
when it decides

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.630
to actually do something, get
legislation written in a hurry?

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.130
Because somebody's drafted
it, somebody's got the answer.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.590
They're just waiting
for the right question,

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.470
just waiting for
the right question.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:28.260
Some years ago when Rush
was moved from September

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.830
to later in the year, that
was a proposal acted on.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.510
There was no problem definition
from which that emerged

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.740
as the optimal solution.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.410
This is a very standard mode
of operation of organizations.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.450
There are solutions.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.700
If you want to actually think
about another university

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.420
example, many colleges and
universities around the country

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.500
have abolished their
Greek systems over time.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.610
Was that the optimal solution
to a carefully defined problem?

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.130
No, it was a solution
that people put forward,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.470
a proposal that people put
forward that was evaluated.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.150
So CRSP acts only on
proposed solutions,

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:12.940
only on "I need to do this
with this space because," not--

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.330
and you can see why.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.850
You can't sit down--

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.750
they process many requests
with great regularity.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.120
Particularly this
renovations subcommittee,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.800
which is what's
at interest here,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.560
meets twice a month,
every other week,

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.240
and processes dozens of requests
of various sizes, dozens

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.990
of requests.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.270
You can't say, is this
the absolute best way

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.620
to meet this need?

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.885
It's like, is this OK?

00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:39.510
Does this work?

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.010
Can we do this?

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.650
Fluid participation
was a characteristic

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.000
of the garbage can model.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.320
Well, look at all those people.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.120
Does everybody come
to every meeting?

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.960
Probably not.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.180
Is everybody thoroughly
prepared on every issue?

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.920
Probably not.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.560
Does everybody care
passionately about every issue?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.670
Probably not.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.990
And everybody's got, with
one or two exceptions,

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.300
has got a day job,
has got a day job.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.680
So, exactly who's active
in making a decision

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.900
is going to vary.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.700
It's going to vary.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.290
So if you want to affect it-- if
you want to affect a decision,

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.790
you'd like to make
sure that there's

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.725
somebody in the room on your
side when the decision is made.

00:23:26.725 --> 00:23:29.350
You don't just-- and this is how
you deal with Congress, right?

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.870
You don't just make a
great proposal to Congress.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.303
You go talk to people.

00:23:33.303 --> 00:23:35.470
You go talk to people on
the committee, and you say,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.950
here's why this is important.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.710
OK, fluid participation.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.200
Who makes the decision varies.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.890
Problematic preferences.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.760
We know CRSP is not
consistent over time.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.840
We know it from the case.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.438
We know it from life.

00:23:53.438 --> 00:23:54.730
The case illustrates it nicely.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.640
Can't find you space, it's going
to cost $160,000, boom, here

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.810
it is, we found it.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:02.750
A miracle.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.030
A miracle.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.340
The other thing,
unclear technology.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:14.220
By "technology" they mean
the decision-making process.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.230
And if you say to
somebody, well,

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.020
how come this
project got approved

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:27.150
and this project didn't,
you will hear the argument

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.000
that was made for or against.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.930
That's not necessarily why.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.760
That's the argument that
rationalizes the decision.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.330
In any group like
this, particularly when

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.970
the objectives aren't clear--

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.310
x wants $20,000 to
renovate the lab.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.220
Is that a good
deal or a bad deal?

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:54.100
Well, it's not like we're
trying to maximize profit here.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.980
We're trying to-- who knows,
MIT has a complicated set

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.410
of objectives involving
research and education.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.420
But almost everything
that's proposed

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.820
will contribute to
research and education.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.300
So which ones can you fund?

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:12.145
Well, exactly how those
choices get made is obscure.

00:25:12.145 --> 00:25:13.960
It has to be obscure.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.030
If you ask the people
to describe it,

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.380
it would be obscure.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.270
That's a lot of people
in a room dealing

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:25.650
with a lot of information,
again, not atypical.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:33.270
So when Daniel says, well
it's politics, well, yeah,

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.160
but that doesn't help you
figure out what to do.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.770
It's politics in the sense
that there are people making

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.120
a decision for other people.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.200
So in a very broad
sense, I use politics--

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.540
at the start of the
semester, it's politics.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.280
It's a collective decision.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.190
But if you wanted
to do a better job,

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.560
you would want to do more
than treat the administration

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.630
as a black box.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.880
And you would want to do
more than say, well, what

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.460
goes on in here is politics.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.820
Yeah, OK, what kind of politics?

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.320
Who?

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.370
Why?

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.440
What interests are
people serving?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.637
So this is the background.

00:26:13.637 --> 00:26:15.720
I want to spend some time,
and a good deal of time

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.935
if we can, on what happened,
what happened and why?

00:26:19.935 --> 00:26:23.560
Why did it take so long?

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.190
Was this a bad project?

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.780
Is this project
inconsistent with the kinds

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.250
of stuff MIT tries to do?

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.690
You're shaking your head, David.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.280
Not inconsistent.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.662
Good values.

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:40.850
DAVID: [INAUDIBLE] President
Hockfield at that point of time

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.596
had stressed the
MITEI initiative.

00:26:44.596 --> 00:26:46.220
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.855
And they have 50 faculty
members, MITEI support.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.200
This I think is
the key question.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:01.680
How come 50 faculty
members, MITEI support,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.700
consistency with MIT values
didn't move this thing

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.250
off the dime for all that time?

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:11.800
Andrew.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.215
ANDREW: Because everybody's
not responsible for actually

00:27:16.215 --> 00:27:17.590
making the decisions.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.010
Ultimately they first saw
the [INAUDIBLE] concern.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:20.525
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:27:20.525 --> 00:27:22.192
ANDREW: It falls to
their responsibility

00:27:22.192 --> 00:27:23.437
to change [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:23.437 --> 00:27:25.270
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So all those supporters

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.830
didn't have the
power to move it.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.200
Point.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:29.700
Sam.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.150
SAM: I think just the biggest
issue is the back end.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.630
What the group
planned to do, it'd

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.270
affect so many
different operations.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.520
They would need to get the
Dining Hall on their side,

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.410
Facilities to help
them move the grease.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.900
They'd need to get the OK from
Facilities to actually use

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.125
the biodiesel in their vehicles.

00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:47.250
They need to get the space
from the administration.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.780
So it just encompasses
so many different areas.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.960
And that's like five
or six different

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.840
like sub-bureaucracies
you have to deal with.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.173
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But you
didn't hear the Dining Hall

00:27:56.173 --> 00:27:57.030
objecting.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.520
The main objection--
the main objection

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.390
was between Facilities,
and Environmental Health

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.785
and Safety, and space.

00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:06.490
SAM: Well, they did
have most at stake.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.490
All the Dining had to do
is say, OK, we'll leave

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.757
our grease on this back porch.

00:28:09.757 --> 00:28:11.340
And Facilities, they
had to be the one

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.970
to move it, bring it over
to wherever the space was,

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.720
pick up the finished
biodiesel, figure out

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.990
how they're actually going
to put it in the shuttle.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:19.490
I mean, it's the
most work for them.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.865
So that explains why
they were most hesitant.

00:28:21.865 --> 00:28:23.490
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, explain why,

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.180
because this is consistent
with MIT values thing,

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.070
and it's a good MIT thing.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.200
And the students
probably would have

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.190
volunteered to handle
the legwork of moving it.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.200
I don't think we're
talking that much bulk.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.790
Blending it is going
to be an issue.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.040
But blending is blending.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.430
You could probably
do it simply enough.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.580
But then you notice all of
a sudden [SNAP OF FINGERS]

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.722
it happened.

00:28:48.722 --> 00:28:51.180
All of a sudden they got the
space, the reactor was bought,

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.020
and they were moving forward.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:58.110
So what you're saying
was Facilities resisted.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.340
Why?

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.235
What was it to Facilities--

00:29:01.235 --> 00:29:01.860
well, go ahead.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.310
SAM: I mean like in Facilities
[INAUDIBLE] was like changing

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.555
people's responsibilities,
which I think people,

00:29:07.555 --> 00:29:09.180
like it you've been
a role for a while,

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.890
and you're comfortable with
that job, somebody says, oh,

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.432
we're going to have to implement
this completely new system ,

00:29:13.432 --> 00:29:14.380
we're going to balk.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.440
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.160
So for Facilities they
added to their day job.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.720
Christopher.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.510
CHRISTOPHER: I mean, I think
you have to define support, too.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.130
I think any faculty member
would be willing to say, hey,

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.490
that's a great idea.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.360
But is it worth it to
them to actually go

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.010
out and do something about it?

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.855
Like for Facilities,
to get their support,

00:29:33.855 --> 00:29:36.005
it has to be worth their
time and their money.

00:29:36.005 --> 00:29:37.380
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So there has

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.620
to be something in it for them
because they have the ability

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.700
to block, don't they?

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.450
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.970
Like if there was a Professor
that had a research interest

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.345
and vested in
this, then he might

00:29:46.345 --> 00:29:48.847
be more willing to try and find
some space or vouch for them

00:29:48.847 --> 00:29:50.610
with CRSP or
something like that.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:57.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well that
actually comes to the next one.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.860
What kind of entity is this?

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.680
It wasn't a professor's
lab, was it?

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.160
It wasn't a live-in group, it
wasn't an administrative unit,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.260
it wasn't a department.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.442
What kind of creature was it?

00:30:10.442 --> 00:30:11.775
You had your hand up, Alexandra.

00:30:11.775 --> 00:30:13.817
ALEXANDRA: Oh, I was
going-- can I say something?

00:30:13.817 --> 00:30:16.038
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, of course.

00:30:16.038 --> 00:30:17.758
ALEXANDRA: So-- wait.

00:30:17.758 --> 00:30:19.192
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:21.050
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Hold that thought.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:21.920
I'll go with Julian.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.620
I'm sorry.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.818
JULIAN: It's a student
organization, right?

00:30:25.818 --> 00:30:27.860
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It's
a student organization.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.380
But most student
organizations don't

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.480
handle potentially
flammable equipment

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.240
that could do various
kinds of damage,

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.190
don't take up-- don't
need to interact--

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:43.550
it's a student organization,
but it's kind of different.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.490
JULIAN: It is a different
student organization.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.250
So because of that,
you have to take

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.273
into account like
practicality, where

00:30:51.273 --> 00:30:52.440
are they going to get space?

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.570
It's not like they
think they're going

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.040
to Walker Memorial and whatnot.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.590
Also, most student
organizations don't actually

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.700
have a space of their own.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.128
So it's kind of a zero sum game.

00:31:02.128 --> 00:31:03.670
Everyone's fighting
over equal space.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:04.753
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:31:04.753 --> 00:31:08.750
JULIAN: And not everyone is
moving out of your space.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:12.170
And, of course, MIT--

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.330
it's highly sought over
to have space at MIT.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.480
So, I mean,
realistically they're

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.162
not going to be able to move in
until someone else moves out.

00:31:20.162 --> 00:31:21.620
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Or unless CRSP

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.740
decides they're very important
because faculty members expand

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.210
their labs all the time.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.080
And space is zero sum.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.780
Logan.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.480
LOGAN: I would say that
a lot of the difficulty

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.610
stems from the fact
that it's spanned

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.700
across a lot of different
types of organizations.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.240
And there are [INAUDIBLE]
is everyone listed up there,

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.870
including some others, like
transportation and stuff

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:44.740
like that.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.820
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Alexandra, good to go?

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.320
OK.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.737
ALEXANDRA: What I
was going to say

00:31:48.737 --> 00:31:50.400
is like, the fact
that, as he said,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.750
spans across so many different
departments, as well as

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.300
a lot of those
departments, their goal

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.090
is not necessarily to
make biodiesel work.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:03.380
So maybe it works with
MIT's general idea,

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.470
but Facilities wants
to maintain buildings.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:11.450
So add-- the MIT@Biodiesel
group probably

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.160
adds to their responsibilities.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.150
And also now the space group
has to talk about this.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.150
And maybe they don't
actually want to spend time

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.210
if like no one really cares.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:25.095
So probably it seems to me what
happened was maybe the student

00:32:25.095 --> 00:32:26.720
group wasn't pushing
hard enough for it

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.790
or didn't know how you go
about talking to people.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.450
And then they quit,
and then everyone else

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.100
was like, oh my
gosh, don't quit!

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:34.690
And then--

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.230
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
But we're going

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.772
to come to that
because that's a very

00:32:37.772 --> 00:32:40.110
important part of the story.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.095
I don't know who was
first here, Ryan?

00:32:42.095 --> 00:32:43.220
We'll get all three of you.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.510
RYAN: I was the last one.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.430
But--

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.222
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, that's not fair.

00:32:47.222 --> 00:32:47.950
Erica.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:48.780
No, go ahead.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.238
RYAN: Well, I was
just going to say

00:32:50.238 --> 00:32:52.700
that I think that part of
the problem was that MIT

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.160
and many other places
just made the bureaucracy

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.210
too complicated.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.820
Instead of actually
deciding on to do anything,

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.220
they usually have a meeting
to decide a committee

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.600
to decide something.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.207
So I would say that the
reason it didn't get through

00:33:07.207 --> 00:33:09.290
was partially their fault
because they didn't know

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.312
who to go to, but it's
also partially the fault

00:33:11.312 --> 00:33:13.520
that bureaucracy has evolved
into this monster that's

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.585
hard to get through.

00:33:14.585 --> 00:33:17.270
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well-- but to be fair,

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.880
this is not some kind
of terrible thing.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.240
And it's not, compared to other
universities, particularly

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.740
bureaucratic.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.120
It's that if you want to run
a place this complicated,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.780
you have to have a hierarchy,
and a division of authority,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.040
and a set of rules.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.140
Everybody's got a
Facilities department.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.500
Everybody's got Environmental
Health and Safety.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.720
Everybody has to have a
process for assigning space.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.600
So those three entities
have to exist in some form.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.670
So I wouldn't say
MIT's an example

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.050
of out-of-control bureaucracy.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.850
It seems like that
occasionally when

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.260
I try to get something done.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.250
But looked at objectively,
I don't think--

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.812
it's really good at doing,
it's not good at changing.

00:33:58.812 --> 00:34:00.020
That's the way all these are.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:00.735
Steven.

00:34:00.735 --> 00:34:03.027
STEVEN: Well, the first thing
I was going to comment on

00:34:03.027 --> 00:34:06.170
was that when you say that
the faculty support and values

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:08.719
weren't sufficient, it's not
that they weren't sufficient,

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:10.909
it's that it's easy
to gain support

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.400
from people and bodies
that don't necessarily

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.370
have to make the sacrifices
in order to implement

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:17.420
those types of changes.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.449
So that way with the Facilities
and the Health and Safety

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.460
groups, they actually
have to sacrifice

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.400
other groups and
other possible issues

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.469
in order to take care
of this initiative.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.320
And also the fact about space,
I don't know a lot about CRSP,

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.449
but I know with certain
other organizations

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.730
when they're assigning
spaces, they'll

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.370
do it at a specific
point once every year,

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.130
that way they review all
the different allocations

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.980
of spacing, whether it be
rooms in the Student Center

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.860
or other places on campus
and say, all right,

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.600
you can use this
space, or this group

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.127
is getting this space now.

00:34:49.127 --> 00:34:50.960
So I'm not sure if maybe
CRSP, for instance,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.927
says like at the
beginning of the,

00:34:52.927 --> 00:34:54.469
year they can
re-assign different lab

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:58.080
spaces, different locations
for other groups as well.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No,
they operate more flexibly

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.610
than that.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.080
Renovations-- that renovations
committee met every two weeks,

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.698
and the body itself met monthly.

00:35:08.698 --> 00:35:10.490
So if you're going to
put in a big request,

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.922
like we want to
build this building,

00:35:12.922 --> 00:35:14.630
it may go through
CRSP, but it ultimately

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.940
goes to the president.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.740
But for medium-sized
things, they

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.750
get decided on a
pretty regular cycle

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.910
because you don't
want to wait a year.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.035
You have a big--

00:35:24.035 --> 00:35:26.180
you've got a big
grant, it requires

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.647
you to install
some equipment, you

00:35:27.647 --> 00:35:29.480
don't want to sit around
and wait for a year

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.010
to get the project going.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.290
So it operates pretty regularly.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.830
Erica.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.038
You were probably first, huh?

00:35:35.038 --> 00:35:36.110
STEVEN: Yeah.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:40.510
ERICA: I think there's a
lot of, like, instability,

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.840
I guess in the process or
uncertainty because I think

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.660
when they first got the
GE Eco-imagination grant,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.143
and they are thinking, oh, it's
going to take $35,000 I think

00:35:50.143 --> 00:35:50.810
was the number--

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.518
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Something like that.

00:35:52.518 --> 00:35:55.580
ERICA: --and it ballooned up
to $137,000 and came back down

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.080
to like--

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.470
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Came back down.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.345
Isn't that a miracle?

00:35:58.345 --> 00:35:59.045
Yeah.

00:35:59.045 --> 00:36:02.780
ERICA: But all the
costs that piled up,

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.650
this was not only like,
oh, it's a big cost.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.210
Now it's also an
indication that they

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.950
didn't realize how far
things were going to go.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.940
And so when you think, OK,
it's not even what, 35,000,

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.740
and they think they
know what we're doing,

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.570
and then all these other
things start piling up--

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.528
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Then
they get overwhelmed.

00:36:20.528 --> 00:36:22.650
ERICA: Yeah, overwhelming,
and it's harder

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.075
to support when you don't
know what the [INAUDIBLE] is.

00:36:25.075 --> 00:36:26.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's true.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.060
That's true.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.150
It's hard-- they had
faculty support, which

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:30.650
a number of people
have pointed out,

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:36.050
is really pretty cheap and
fairly useless for many things.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.570
But for this one, where you
had to deal with the staff,

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:39.230
quite useless.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.730
David.

00:36:42.554 --> 00:36:44.160
DAVID: I was just
going to say I think

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.700
it's important to realize that
the people who are in charge

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.190
of these communities are
gatekeepers, not necessarily

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.060
stakeholders in the project.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.510
So for them to say
no to something

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.760
is to minimize their risk
because if something doesn't

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.980
go forward, they're really
not on the line for it

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.352
unless there's public attention
drawn to their decision, which

00:37:02.352 --> 00:37:03.060
is what happened.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.820
And then they had
a choice to make.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.518
There was we do it and we
deal with the consequences,

00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:10.560
or we don't do it and deal
with the consequences,

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.600
as opposed to doing
it and possibly

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.090
dealing with a fire, or
explosion, or something

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.220
expensive down the
line, or not doing it

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.280
and then it fizzles out and
dies and no one knows about it.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.590
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
I want to come back to that.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.500
I just do want to
make the point here

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.530
that we've danced around, which
is this group doesn't quite

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.920
fit.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.840
You could look at
policies and procedures,

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.610
and it talks about
labs, and it talks

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.920
about the departments,
and administrative, units

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.000
and living groups.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.670
And it even might talk
about student organizations,

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:44.200
but not in a way that deals
with this kind of operation.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.520
This is a production
operation run by students.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.490
You can look through the
rules and the precedents,

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.190
and you don't find any of those.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.700
So you're giving the
administrative apparatus

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.320
with its rules, and
its hierarchies,

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.170
and its defined
responsibilities,

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.060
and you're giving it a
new kind of creature.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.336
David.

00:38:05.336 --> 00:38:08.740
DAVID: There are lots of
student groups that do have hard

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.140
allocated spaces
in [INAUDIBLE]----

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.767
there's the [INAUDIBLE] City
team and [INAUDIBLE] team

00:38:13.767 --> 00:38:14.600
and stuff like that.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.240
And you do power allocated space
with like dangerous machines

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.490
and stuff where there is risk.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:22.615
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Some
of those have been around

00:38:22.615 --> 00:38:23.880
for a long time, of course.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.810
This was a new one.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.700
DAVID: So maybe it
took them five years

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.603
to get space or 20 years.

00:38:28.603 --> 00:38:31.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I also
think the Environmental Health

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.812
and Safety stuff has gotten much
more focused in recent years.

00:38:35.812 --> 00:38:37.770
I think we've all gotten
much more risk averse.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.118
If you look at something like--

00:38:39.118 --> 00:38:40.410
well, I don't know which shops.

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.140
I know the ones that used to be
when I was here as a student,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.310
they'd been around for 50
years when, hey, go ahead

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.310
play with a drill press.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:48.920
Who cares?

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.795
So it may just be that
there's more scrutiny.

00:38:51.795 --> 00:38:53.637
DAVID: There's some
sort of precedent

00:38:53.637 --> 00:38:56.022
that these groups use.

00:38:56.022 --> 00:38:57.430
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: There is.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.360
There is.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.950
I take your point.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:04.360
But boy, they acted like this
was neither fish nor fowl.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:04.860
Charlotte.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.040
CHARLOTTE: I was
going to say, I guess,

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.080
I think that that's
the answer right there,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.515
that just in today's
world, things take longer.

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:12.640
I mean, I think it's more
impressive that a student

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.730
group was able to successfully
carry out this project,

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.280
and get approval, and get
a space within two years.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.200
And then now, six
years later, we're

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.795
actually producing the product.

00:39:21.795 --> 00:39:23.170
I think that's
really impressive.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:25.360
And I know that two years
seems like a long time

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.462
to a college student,
but in the real world,

00:39:27.462 --> 00:39:29.170
wouldn't a project
like this take longer?

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.253
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It
would depend, wouldn't it?

00:39:31.253 --> 00:39:34.810
I mean, it went real
fast once it cleared.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.450
So I think part of
what we've been saying,

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:41.740
and a lot of people have said
it, was none of the key players

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.800
had a positive incentive to
take this project forward.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.780
It was more work
for Facilities, it

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.700
was more risk for Environmental
Health and Safety,

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:54.670
it was space from
other uses for CRSP.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.200
So, Arianna.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.310
ARIANNA: I'm not sure I
entirely agree with that.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.360
I think there is some
kind of incentive

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.210
as part of [INAUDIBLE]
the overall organization

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:07.810
if this is accomplished, then it
kind of looks good on everyone.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.535
But because those-- it's a
collective action problem.

00:40:10.535 --> 00:40:12.160
If not everyone's
pulling their weight,

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.920
and because it's taking
all these different groups

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.860
to pull it off, if
someone's lagging,

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.780
it's a waste of
everyone else's time.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.510
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But
if I'm the Facilities guy,

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.950
the fact that MIT gets good
press doesn't affect my job

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:29.440
performance rating,
doesn't affect my day--

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.780
how well I do my day job,
which is what I'm judged on.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.120
I'm not judged on
MIT's press, I'm not

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.655
judged on MIT's
education, I'm judged on,

00:40:37.655 --> 00:40:40.970
does the mail get delivered,
does the landscape look good?

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.860
And if I'm Environmental
Health and Safety,

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.610
I'm judged on accidents.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.630
Are there risks?

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.790
Do we comply?

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.710
This is not an
opportunity for me.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:51.910
This is a challenge for me.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.510
CRSP is more complicated because
of its diverse representation.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:59.440
But Facilities and
Environmental Health and Safety,

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.480
this is not an opportunity,
this is a challenge.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.000
For MIT as a whole,
that's a different game.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.795
ARIANNA: I think there's some
trickle down of smiling faces.

00:41:07.795 --> 00:41:09.670
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
But the whole point here

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:13.840
is not much, in a large
complicated organization,

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.525
not much.

00:41:14.525 --> 00:41:15.025
Erica.

00:41:15.025 --> 00:41:19.000
ERICA: Well, in this
situation, having

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.360
MIT look better as a whole would
just affect the Facilities'

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.880
and EH&S's jobs.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.652
So they needed to be required to
implement the [INAUDIBLE] pass

00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:28.715
as part of their job.

00:41:28.715 --> 00:41:30.880
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: They
could be required to.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.880
And in fact, that's
probably what happened.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.020
But when the process is
coming up through them,

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.370
there's nobody requiring them.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:41.200
Sarah.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.060
SARAH: It raises a question
as to the direction

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.728
of the rules in the
hierarchy because it

00:41:45.728 --> 00:41:48.020
seems like all of the rules
we've talked about thus far

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.940
are about proceeding
up the hierarchy.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.878
But there aren't checks
and rules for going down.

00:41:52.878 --> 00:41:55.420
So if you brought something like
this to President Hockfield,

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.800
she would have the incentive
to move forward with it

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.650
and force those incentives
on the people below her.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:04.245
But it's not able to move
on the other direction.

00:42:04.245 --> 00:42:08.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That's the
nature of organizations, right?

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.060
You go back to Hexion,
all these folks concerned

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.342
about their bonuses with
there might be an outage,

00:42:14.342 --> 00:42:15.800
and it might affect
my bonus, and I

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.615
can't go to Hawaii
this year, it may

00:42:18.615 --> 00:42:20.660
be a great thing for the CEO.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.300
If you can get it on the CEO--
the CEO might say, oh, come on,

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.570
we want to be leaders, we
want to get great press,

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.070
and the savings are nice.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.650
So for the organization
as a whole,

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:35.040
if not necessarily for you and
your bonus, we should do this.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.220
But if it doesn't get
on that person's desk,

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.770
it doesn't go down
the hierarchy.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.150
It doesn't go down.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.110
Andrew.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.386
ANDREW: I assume
[INAUDIBLE] some points.

00:42:44.386 --> 00:42:46.020
Somebody brought up
one of the points

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.150
that despite--
because if we talk

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.820
a little about the
administrations

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.695
and how they interact
with each other.

00:42:53.695 --> 00:42:56.100
But I think that we
shouldn't underestimate

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.080
the importance of the
individual people who

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.520
are in that administration.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.730
Like if it happens to be that
that went to the registrar's

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.240
office and one day spoke to
person A about the same issue,

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.000
and then the next day
spoke to person B,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.375
and they should
discover results,

00:43:12.375 --> 00:43:15.130
simply because they spoke
to the right person.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.120
"Right" might be his position,
it might be his mood that day.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.730
It might be the [INAUDIBLE]
who he conferred me to.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:23.026
So I think that--

00:43:23.026 --> 00:43:27.075
I mean, some of you [INAUDIBLE]
previously that it's not always

00:43:27.075 --> 00:43:28.200
the administration, per se.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.080
It's the actual people
inside and not dealing

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:31.960
with a black box.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.440
And then if you make it his
personal goal or something

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.490
to make sense--

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.510
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, the registrar

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.510
is a good example because
the registrar's office

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.860
is student-facing importantly.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.080
Facilities is sort
of building-facing.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.020
Registrar's office is supposed
to solve problems for students.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.980
So part of it's
temperament and ability.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.380
But if you get somebody
good, that's their job.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.695
It's not the job of the
person in Facilities.

00:43:57.695 --> 00:43:58.195
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:58.195 --> 00:43:59.495
AUDIENCE: I know there are
[INAUDIBLE] differences.

00:43:59.495 --> 00:44:00.920
But you can also argue--

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.790
I mean, you got to juxtapose
this against, say, maybe MITx,

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:08.810
that you may not be dealing
with Health and Services

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.650
and Facilities,
but you're dealing

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:12.650
with other organizations
and so on and so forth.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.192
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That have terms.

00:44:14.192 --> 00:44:17.620
AUDIENCE: And that went from
idea to ground in less than two

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.010
or three months that we know of.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.280
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And it
had support from the top.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.400
And the Energy Initiative
got launched with support

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.160
from the top.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:26.660
Casey.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.540
CASEY: So this biodiesel
effort was a solution.

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.780
So maybe part of the
problem was that there

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.580
wasn't a saline problem
that needed to be addressed

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.785
within the MIT community.

00:44:36.785 --> 00:44:38.830
I mean, this group
had an idea of what

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:40.690
it wanted to accomplish.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:46.390
But maybe just the fact that
the rest of the MIT community

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:50.560
wasn't so concerned about the
fuel usage of transportation

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.370
that the key players did
not have this incentive

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:56.640
to address the problem because
there wasn't this push.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:02.360
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So,
why'd it change so radically?

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:02.860
Obina.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.695
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
to a question.

00:45:04.695 --> 00:45:07.320
Instead of an incentive, do you
think there was a disincentive?

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.470
Because they're doing
the narrative played out.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.970
Students had a great idea, they
get a lot of press about it,

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.310
and then they run up against all
these roadblocks within the MIT

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:14.685
administration.

00:45:14.685 --> 00:45:16.350
So it's like, oh,
this school project

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.320
was stalled by MIT itself.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.320
Oh, are they doing this?

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.695
And so suddenly
you start looking

00:45:20.695 --> 00:45:24.540
bad in the eyes of whoever
is reading this bad press.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:28.440
And so maybe they were
like, OK, maybe the guys

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.470
up top intervened, like
who's causing the--

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.640
who's stalling?

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.270
EHS, get your act together.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:35.940
And then, I don't
know, it accelerated.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.315
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Put yourself

00:45:37.315 --> 00:45:40.590
in President Hockfield's
shoes and imagine

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.290
you're reading The
Tech on May 13,

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.250
and you're reading the story.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:50.280
And as Sara told it, that we've
been trying all this time,

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.510
here's what we're going to
do, and it's gotten killed.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.890
Suddenly you react from
the point of view of MIT.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.640
And you talk to
the folks in CRSP,

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.400
and you say, surely
we can do this.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.990
Surely there has
to be a way to do

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:08.020
something that has research,
and education, and student

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:08.620
initiative.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:12.060
And I gather the numbers are OK.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.820
It becomes an
opportunity, not a threat.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:22.520
It's a threat to Facilities
because it's more work.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.090
It's a threat to Environmental
Health and Safety

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:30.470
because it's got risks,
no doubt about it, that

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.770
Adds to their problems.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:37.580
It's even a threat
to CRSP because it's

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.330
competing for space, which is
really valuable in which people

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:42.900
really want.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.900
And here are these students--

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.870
with all due respect, students--

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:53.700
who want to take space from
department heads, and deans,

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.190
and people like that.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:02.090
So in a way, it's a
problem for CRSP as well.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:08.210
You're not going to control
much that matters to them.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:14.340
But for MIT as a whole,
it's an opportunity.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.850
It's an opportunity to talk
about student initiative,

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:19.250
and environmental
leadership, and lots

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.250
of great and wonderful--
learning by doing, hands on.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.700
It's a great story.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.350
It's not a great
story for Facilities,

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.260
or Environmental Health
and Safety, or CRSP.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.840
But it's a great story
for President Hockfield.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.980
I don't know what happened.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.840
I don't know whether she called.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.020
I'd be kind of surprised if
the president or provost hadn't

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.130
intervened on the
basis of that article

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.610
because CRSP turned on a dime.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:46.630
The case makes it clear.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:50.140
They turned on a
dime from very risk--

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.870
and the environmental
risks went down,

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:57.530
and the space was available,
and the remodeling was cheaper--

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:01.280
all of a sudden,
all of a sudden.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:05.470
Somebody from the
top did something.

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:08.150
What might they have done?

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:11.260
I would say when Sara first
presented this experience

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.440
to this class two years ago, she
said if we just tried harder,

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.840
if we just kept after
Facilities, if we just kept

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.070
after the environmental people
and talked to folks on CRSP,

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.240
was at the right play?

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.035
Yeah.

00:48:23.035 --> 00:48:24.835
AUDIENCE: I think they
should have realized

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:27.760
if it was in the committee,
identify who they actually

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.760
had to talk to because I think
their biggest mistake was

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.160
that they found their values--

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.660
they thought their
values should be

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.700
consistent with the
committee's values.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.880
And it's almost incorrect
to say that it's

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.430
consistent with MIT's
values because what we just

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.340
pointed out is that the
undergrad-- that the student

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.700
body's values are very different
to the administration's values.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.280
Like Facilities might
have their own objectives,

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.890
Environmental Health and
Planning might their own.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:57.020
So in order for them to
have been more effective,

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.630
I might have made
sense if they knew

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:01.060
they weren't dealing with
a student representative

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.750
or anyone in there who
shared the values of being

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.790
environmentally friendly
with the-- and perhaps

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:09.130
that they should have
stressed on other points,

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.038
or had someone else [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:12.038 --> 00:49:14.080
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I
hadn't thought about this,

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:20.300
but the question
comes up on CRSP,

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.940
there isn't anybody
there, as you

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:29.980
look at them, who has a
primary role in education.

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:32.680
Claude does research.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.760
But either-- this is
the current makeup.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.530
So I'm not sure
who was there then.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.260
Phil Curry was a former dean,
so you would talk to Phil.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.990
Rafael, faculty member,
you'd talk to him.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.460
Grimson, faculty member.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.160
Everybody else-- well,
Claude is a faculty member,

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.960
but he has research
responsibilities.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:59.320
These are the three people
on that committee who have

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.080
very broad responsibilities.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.710
Everybody else is Department
of Facilities, Department

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.900
of Facilities, Finance,
Project Management, Planning

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.400
and Design.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.600
In this case, you have
to take it up the line.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.100
Charlotte.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.045
CHARLOTTE: Well, it also
seems that maybe they

00:50:19.045 --> 00:50:21.780
could have tried taking it
to the students initially,

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:22.800
like if they'd gotten--

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.258
because it seems
like what happened

00:50:24.258 --> 00:50:27.938
in the end was that because
the student body cared so much,

00:50:27.938 --> 00:50:28.980
other people took notice.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.272
So maybe they should have
gone about getting a petition

00:50:31.272 --> 00:50:34.897
or having some sort of student
body support from that end,

00:50:34.897 --> 00:50:35.980
which isn't going offline.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:36.813
I say that's going--

00:50:36.813 --> 00:50:38.070
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Right.

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:39.760
That's starting a
social movement,

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:45.760
so to speak, getting strong
and noisy student support.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.550
Yeah, that's another
way because, again,

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:51.940
the top administration
will be sensitive to that,

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.420
will be sensitive to that.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.696
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:55.696 --> 00:51:00.340
AUDIENCE: I feel like if they
had gotten more support of what

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:05.890
this would solve, if they get
support of maybe the transport

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:08.710
section, I'm pretty
sure even though--

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:10.223
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Transport guys,

00:51:10.223 --> 00:51:11.890
it's actually a bit
of a threat to them,

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:15.790
too, because the
machinery runs fine,

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:18.130
and we're going to
change the fuel,

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.410
and you're telling me
it'll still run fine,

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.842
it'll be environmentally
friendly.

00:51:21.842 --> 00:51:23.800
But from the point of
view of cutting the grass

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.410
and running the shuttles,
there's no upside,

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:28.043
there's only a downside.

00:51:28.043 --> 00:51:29.960
From the point of view
of running the shuttles

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.400
and cutting the grass, yeah,
it'll be good, we'll feel good,

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.410
but I'm not judged
by my emissions.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:39.230
I'm judged by do the
shuttles run on time.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.820
So I'd worry about that.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.880
AUDIENCE: Besides that,
look at maybe Dining.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.040
If Dining sees this
as an opportunity

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.430
to be able to dispose
of that oil in a--

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:50.180
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I think that's right.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.555
AUDIENCE: --safer
or cheaper way.

00:51:51.555 --> 00:51:56.060
And even though
there's no one here

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.990
who ensures that as a ten
student group get some space,

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.850
there should be a
community that can

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:03.650
support Dining if
Dining presents

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.223
that as a need for them.

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:07.640
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So they solve

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.140
a problem for Dining of getting
rid of all this used cooking

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:11.720
oil, and you want
to stress that.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.490
And you'd want to get--

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:16.160
you'd want to get
student activism

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.120
of one kind or another.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.800
It sounds like this was a small
group that worked very hard

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.090
and burned out.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.930
And that's not the way to do it.

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:25.430
Erica.

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:27.980
ERICA: Also I think if--

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.600
I'm not sure how they
pitched it, I guess,

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.770
because obviously, there's the
whole environmental "do good"

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:36.330
side.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:40.230
But if you wanted to get the
support of certain groups

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.850
on campus, like department
Facilities or EHS,

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:47.000
you'd probably have
to change what's--

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.790
prioritize what's important to
them to make them want to join.

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:54.520
So we keep on
saying how much work

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.770
they have to also put into it.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:57.450
But if you found
something, I guess,

00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:00.900
another way to say, like, well,
yes, you're putting more work,

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:05.295
but you see this aspect that's
not only the do good side,

00:53:05.295 --> 00:53:05.850
I guess.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:09.090
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I think
facilities would be hard.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:12.860
I don't know how you make
this a winner for Facilities.

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:15.870
Marie, you're with us, right?

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:20.060
Any thoughts on how they could
have been more effective?

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.020
MARIE: I mean, the
main thing that I

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.880
can give you is the
thing with Charlotte

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.107
is if they had gotten the
students involved earlier--

00:53:27.107 --> 00:53:28.690
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Broadly involved.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:32.660
MARIE: Broadly involved
across campus, maybe--

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.900
I mean, instead of having
faculty support where they

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.290
didn't really specify
who the faculty were

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:42.130
and only faculty in small cases,
if they had gotten a broader

00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:44.820
support system that could
really pushed it further out

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.080
it would have been helpful.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.510
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It
might have been interesting

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:50.550
just in terms of
faculty support,

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:53.140
could you get
somebody, for instance,

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.340
to put a petition
in a faculty meeting

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.740
that the MIT faculty
endorsed blah, blah, blah, as

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.746
opposed to we talked to a
bunch of guys and they like it?

00:54:01.746 --> 00:54:06.040
MARIE: [INAUDIBLE] just
pretty broad and you have--

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.412
yeah, I guess the course that it
covers in chemical engineering,

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.620
and they have the core six
that was doing the website

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:15.120
and spanning a lot
of different majors,

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.870
and they could have
gotten faculty support

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:18.480
in many different categories.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.022
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
And even a Sloan

00:54:20.022 --> 00:54:21.512
MBA running the
spreadsheet, huh,

00:54:21.512 --> 00:54:24.240
to do the cost effectiveness.

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:24.780
Max.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.030
MAX: I think one of the big
problems with this project

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.930
is that--

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.580
that probably led to
a lot of hesitancy

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:34.500
with CRSP was just putting
that much trust in students

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:37.590
to deliver this product that
MIT relies on or will hopefully

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:38.490
rely on.

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.460
And, I mean, student
support, I think,

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.225
may have had some factor.

00:54:43.225 --> 00:54:44.850
But I think students
are pretty fickle.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:47.530
And there's a big risk that
if interest in this project

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:50.490
dies out in the future,
how can we keep it going?

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.500
What's the contingency
plan for supplying

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.537
the biodiesel, which maybe--

00:54:54.537 --> 00:54:55.620
I didn't read the formal--

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.328
I don't think there
was the formal report

00:54:57.328 --> 00:54:58.120
for the proposal--

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.120
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: We
didn't include it, yeah.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.820
MAX: --but if that had in it
more of a contingency plan

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:04.930
to show that this
is sustainable,

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.480
it's not just going to rely
completely student support.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.300
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: If you
go to the website-- again,

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.230
I assume it's still going.

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:11.647
But if you go to
the website, it's

00:55:11.647 --> 00:55:13.800
clear that all
the excitement was

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.440
getting it out-- first
of all, doing the study,

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.630
getting approval, getting
it up and running, getting

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.960
the reactor actually to work,
getting the fuel tested,

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.600
dealing with a whole bunch
of logistical issues,

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.370
and then it's a factory.

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.770
And then it's not so much--
then it's not so interesting.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:29.580
Sam.

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:33.240
SAM: Like I think the size
getting student support,

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.842
the other just really key
thing to getting anything done

00:55:35.842 --> 00:55:37.800
is that when you're
dealing with a bureaucracy,

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.180
you always need to work--

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.270
you always want to work down the
chain of command instead of up.

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:43.980
If from the beginning
they had gone

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.560
to the provost,
or the chancellor,

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.755
or even like President
Hockfield said, look,

00:55:48.755 --> 00:55:50.130
we have this really
cool project.

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:50.922
It saves you money.

00:55:50.922 --> 00:55:52.860
But more than that,
it's a great--

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.670
it fits with MIT's
mission statement,

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:57.270
it's students taking initiative,
it's hands-on learning.

00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:59.190
And then you can get
some of them to--

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.970
like a high level
person of influence

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:03.390
to support it from the
beginning, then you kind of--

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:04.473
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Boom.

00:56:04.473 --> 00:56:05.180
Then it happens.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.790
Then it happens in weeks.

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:07.290
Yes.

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:08.282
AUDIENCE: Well, I
was pretty much was

00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:09.936
going to say what Sam said.

00:56:09.936 --> 00:56:11.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
you can just point to him.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:14.063
AUDIENCE: Would it be entirely
unreasonable to go and knock

00:56:14.063 --> 00:56:15.440
on President Hockfield's door?

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.720
Like her house is right here.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.625
[STUDENTS LAUGH]

00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:20.860
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, you have

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.340
to have some sense of just
how insanely busy her life is.

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.260
And the answer is no.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.750
And she's also-- one
of her first quotes

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:31.240
on taking office was "I
don't like surprises."

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.580
So no, you want to
work through her office

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.140
to get on her calendar.

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.060
But that would not
be unreasonable.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.490
You could take a shot at it.

00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:43.450
She probably would
push you away.

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:45.880
I'm just thinking
about operating style.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.380
She'd push you down.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.330
But she wouldn't push
you down to Facilities.

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.640
She'd push you maybe
to the chancellor,

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.950
or maybe to the
dean of engineering,

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.920
or somebody rather
than Facilities.

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.350
So it'd be worth a shot.

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:03.050
I don't think you'd get
in to see her right away.

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:05.930
But I think you could get
higher up in the organization.

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.000
Yes.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.330
AUDIENCE: I think playing
off the other department

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:12.427
to try and get off that set
train, getting Dining to make

00:57:12.427 --> 00:57:13.510
that call could be useful.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:15.880
But playing the devil's
advocate, what would have

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.213
happened if they just did it
and then asked for a grant?

00:57:18.213 --> 00:57:19.672
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
They couldn't.

00:57:19.672 --> 00:57:21.150
They had to have
a place to do it.

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:23.700
AUDIENCE: Say if one of the
faculty that was supporting

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.940
them would let them do
a shoestring version,

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.070
and so they could go to
Facilities with a couple

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:31.780
cans of biodiesel and say,
try this out for a week.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.090
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
they're not going to--

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:39.270
if you've got a faculty
member to give up

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:42.330
lab space, which around here
is not one of the easy things

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:44.100
to do--

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.365
and plus they didn't have--

00:57:46.365 --> 00:57:47.740
I'm just trying
to think through.

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:50.080
I hadn't thought
about this approach.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:55.140
They had enough money to buy
a reactor, a commercial piece

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.170
of equipment.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.930
So they couldn't start
small and scale up

00:57:57.930 --> 00:57:59.760
because you couldn't
do it twice.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.420
So you had to be all in.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.450
So you needed a reasonable
amount of space.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:06.420
And I think finding
a faculty member

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:09.863
to do that-- if they'd done
it, that'd be a way forward.

00:58:09.863 --> 00:58:12.280
AUDIENCE: Obviously an approach
I would have shoehorned it

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.230
into a UROP.

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:16.380
And then that would
give me money and space.

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:19.230
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: UROP is
not going to give you space.

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:24.810
UROP is not going to-- space is
the killer here because space,

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:27.240
it's free, and it's
a status symbol.

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:31.274
So there are no worse fights at
any university than over space.

00:58:31.274 --> 00:58:32.847
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:32.847 --> 00:58:35.430
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Ultimately,
it's the faculty member's lab

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:37.387
space, ultimately.

00:58:37.387 --> 00:58:38.970
Yeah, let me go back
there, then here,

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:40.260
and then I'm going to move on.

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.090
AUDIENCE: And just
one of the thing

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.010
I think maybe they
should have done,

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:47.360
and I doubt they did this,
actually look at this.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.210
I mean, I doubt that they
actually sat down and realized

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:53.100
that this is mostly
this department,

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.910
and this department, and
those people who know that.

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:59.790
So maybe I think
they're the kind of--

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:02.580
talk to someone, and then
that person from someone else.

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:06.530
I think it was kind of like
learning by doing things.

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:08.393
And I think if they
had some their homework

00:59:08.393 --> 00:59:10.305
and sold the structure,
maybe they would have

00:59:10.305 --> 00:59:13.686
known to do this versus stupid.

00:59:13.686 --> 00:59:15.780
AUDIENCE: I was
going to say going

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:18.270
through the top-down method,
one of the things they learned

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:23.040
later on was that MIT does not
react well to bad publicity.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.085
So working with the
mtvU initiative,

00:59:26.085 --> 00:59:27.460
they were the ones
that gave them

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:30.060
the initial grant saying, hey,
we're going to work with them.

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.200
They gave us this initial grant.

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.783
They want to come
back a year from now

00:59:32.783 --> 00:59:34.650
to see what we've
done with that money,

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:36.910
and they want to do a
special piece on MIT,

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:39.690
it would just hit MIT right
away and be like, all right,

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:41.190
now we have to do this.

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:43.298
Otherwise, we're going to
look like complete jerks

00:59:43.298 --> 00:59:45.090
for not letting our
students follow through

00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:46.175
with their initiative.

00:59:46.175 --> 00:59:47.550
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
And you have

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:52.320
to make sure that somebody
who cares about MIT's image,

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.750
and who isn't just rewarded for
delivering the mail on time,

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:59.880
making sure the trees are
trimmed, is aware of this.

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.170
So let me move on.

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.058
I think we've hit
almost all the points.

01:00:06.058 --> 01:00:07.850
Oh, that was supposed
to come on in pieces.

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:13.490
So much for custom animation,
but we can do this.

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:20.660
You really have to
understand the organization.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.520
I mean, every
organization that's

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.270
larger than 10 or
15 people ends up

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.820
having reporting
responsibilities, a division

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.890
of labor, different people
rewarded for different things,

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:33.350
some sort of procedures.

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.280
And that makes change hard.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.697
That's not a bad thing.

01:00:36.697 --> 01:00:38.030
It's good at getting stuff done.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:39.750
It's not good at changing.

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.870
So, how do you get change done?

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:48.010
Well, there is a tendency
to mimic good organizations.

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:50.390
MIT occasionally
resists this tendency.

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:54.860
There was a story of a
fundraising organizer years ago

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.010
that said to a president,
to be nameless, well,

01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.450
we haven't done
this quite before,

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:01.970
but here's how Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton do it.

01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:03.773
And the response was, we're MIT.

01:01:03.773 --> 01:01:04.440
What do we care?

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.980
Well, I mean, raising money
is raising money it turns out.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.340
And there is a good
thing to imitate.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:16.640
The other thing we
saw here is whatever

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.650
the goals of the
organization are that we all

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:22.830
have tattooed on our foreheads,
people have their own goals.

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:26.460
So in no organization
do you really get,

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.510
I live to serve
MIT's grand goals,

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:34.020
or I live to make
money for BP or Apple.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:37.700
I've got my-- in a lot of cases,
I have my professional norms

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.270
and values.

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:40.700
I've got my own career concerns.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.910
And this is particularly tricky
when the organization's goals

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.390
are fuzzy, and universities'
goals are fuzzy.

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:53.630
I think-- one can
debate this, but I

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.000
think this kind of
issue of goal conflict

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.890
is most serious for
the organization

01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:59.087
in middle management.

01:01:59.087 --> 01:02:00.920
If you're at the bottom
of the organization,

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.480
you're delivering mail,
you're delivering mail,

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.110
and you get rewarded for
delivering mail well, bingo.

01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:09.660
But if you're up the
notch a little bit,

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.030
you have budget authority,
you have the ability

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:16.140
to direct others, and you're
concerned about your own career

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.060
and about promotion.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:22.020
And every organization
wrestles with this.

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.840
You want to stand
out to be promoted.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.610
But, of course, you
have to be cooperative

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.800
for the organization.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.580
That's a standard tension.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.560
Lots of good ideas,
but limited resources.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.180
Pats on the back are cheap.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:39.390
This is exactly what
happened to these folks.

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:41.505
They trotted around
this idea of biodiesel.

01:02:41.505 --> 01:02:44.400
And everybody said,
that's a great idea.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.800
And they were clearly
energized by that.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.840
But that's free, as a
number of you pointed out.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.000
That's free.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.800
That's great.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.810
Division of labor,
it leads to silos.

01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.540
I mentioned some weeks
ago that when I came back

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:02.130
from Washington, young
and bright-eyed in 1991,

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:05.610
I pushed for Green Lights at
MIT, which Green Lights was

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:08.010
then a new EPA program
that organizations

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:10.530
would pledge to use
efficient lighting when

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:12.610
it made economic sense.

01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:15.990
And so I said, why
don't we do that?

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.570
It's good press, and
it'll lead to MIT

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:21.510
as an institution to look
at its lighting decisions.

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:23.940
The place is full of
incandescent bulbs.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.870
We can save money.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.440
It'll be great.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.480
And I got pushed
appropriately to Facilities.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.940
And the then crusty
old head of Facilities

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.900
said to me, let me
explain it to you.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.360
The light bulbs come
out of my budget,

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.020
the electricity doesn't.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.610
OK.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:48.560
So the notion that I should
put in more expensive bulbs

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.050
to save somebody
else's electricity

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:54.230
doesn't work because my
budget's not going to go up,

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:57.720
and I've still got to
replace the light bulbs.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.490
Well, I quit.

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:02.700
I mean, there are only so
many battles you can fight.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.320
And I didn't see
a way around that

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.600
without changing MIT'S
budgeting procedures, which

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.470
wasn't going to happen.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:12.660
I think that basically there
was an instruction down

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:13.710
to be more efficient.

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.980
We don't put a lot of
incandescent bulbs in anymore.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.457
But around 1991, this
was somewhat radical

01:04:19.457 --> 01:04:21.540
that we ought to be moving
to compact fluorescents

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.870
and so forth.

01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.330
But that's a silo.

01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:25.080
That's a silo.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.090
The guy at Facilities
had his incentives,

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:30.060
and he had his instructions,
and he was doing his job.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:35.130
His job was minimize how much
you spend to provide light.

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:36.660
That's the job.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.210
It wasn't minimize
the lifecycle cost

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:41.728
because he didn't
pay for electricity.

01:04:41.728 --> 01:04:44.020
Would it have been better if
he'd paid for electricity?

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:44.770
Maybe.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:48.220
Hard to do, hard to do.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.720
He wasn't graded on it.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.260
The system wasn't in place.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:54.160
There were formal rules,
divided responsibility,

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.390
and he was managing his silo.

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:59.590
So I mentioned the
next one, that space is

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:02.540
unpriced but a status symbol.

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.090
There are no more brutal
fights than over something

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:09.475
that's free that
you really want.

01:05:09.475 --> 01:05:10.350
Let me just say that.

01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:12.330
So when students say,
oh, we'd like some space,

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:16.110
too, this is like going between
the trenches in World War

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:19.920
I. It's not a place you really
find yourself comfortable,

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.440
unless you have allies.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:25.920
And finally, why would
Facilities care about you

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.110
folks, with all due respect?

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:31.220
Making you happy
is not their job.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.550
They report to various other
people in the administration.

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:35.810
They do not report to you.

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:39.740
They do not report to department
heads really or to deans.

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:42.680
They report to Facilities up
through the executive vice

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.550
president.

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:45.030
So you've got no influence.

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:50.120
So, how does change ever happen?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.220
We did get biodiesel.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.450
And I will say the Energy
minor that a lot of you

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.210
were engaged in is
an example of that.

01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:01.130
It's the first
interschool minor.

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:05.330
This took several
years of work to get it

01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:10.160
through various organizations
because it wasn't an animal

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.790
for which MIT had rules.

01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:15.835
The notion that--
departments offer minors.

01:06:15.835 --> 01:06:18.760
There might even
be a school minor.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:24.520
But the Energy minor has pieces
from engineering, and science,

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.590
and Sloan, and in principle
the other schools as well.

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:32.720
There was no governance
structure for that.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.240
It all made sense.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.207
Everybody approved it.

01:06:35.207 --> 01:06:37.040
Everybody's, oh, a great
idea, a great idea.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.040
I just want to make sure
we maintain quality control

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.290
and have the usual governance.

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.060
Wait a minute, how are we going
to do that without a department

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.560
being in charge?

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.720
How are we going to do that?

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.470
Well, it happened.

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.240
A number of faculty
members cared.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.880
The top administration cared.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.770
The problem was solved.

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:56.560
But it was another one of
those things that didn't quite

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.350
fit the existing categories.

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:03.830
It wasn't a department,
it wasn't a live-in group,

01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:07.430
it wasn't an
administrative unit.

01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:10.045
It was a different
kind of thing.

01:07:10.045 --> 01:07:13.670
It got solved, a lot of work.

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:16.660
So let me walk
briefly, given time

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:20.350
through the optional
readings, which have

01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:22.060
interesting examples of change.

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.180
And let me just say a little
bit about each of them.

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:26.950
They're not tough reading, but--

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:28.690
one of them is.

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:33.850
Sharma has an interesting
study of oil and gas firms.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:40.090
And the question is, what
determines whether or not

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.040
they go beyond the
requirements of regulation

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.540
in doing environmental
protection?

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:46.330
Because a lot of them do.

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:47.380
Interesting study.

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.280
When does it happen?

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.290
Well, again, there's a
lot of statistical work.

01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:55.900
But I'll just go down the
more likely to go beyond.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.320
First of all, companies,
there's a lot of questionnaires

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.660
about attitudes and so forth.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.330
If you view environmental
protection as something

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.710
that the company is
about, well, that's

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:10.575
not a Friedman view,
that's a Handy view.

01:08:10.575 --> 01:08:14.010
If you have a broad view of what
business is for, you can say,

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.450
and one of the
things we try to be

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:18.670
is responsible
environmental citizens.

01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:22.300
Milton Friedman would
say, we obey the law.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.130
Handy might say, well,
we go beyond the law

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:27.100
where it makes sense, if you
view environmental protection

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.290
as part of the
identity, if you view

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:32.240
the environment
as an opportunity,

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.450
an opportunity for
leadership, rather

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:37.140
than a threat to profits.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:40.870
BP went to Beyond
Petroleum, you may recall.

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:43.120
It viewed the
opportunity as it--

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.250
the environment as an
opportunity for leadership.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:47.020
Now, did it do much
besides advertise?

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:47.680
No.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.540
But it advertised like a demon.

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.740
And it viewed environmental
protection as an opportunity.

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:56.740
Again, these firms that view
that environmental protection

01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.380
as an opportunity to demonstrate
that they're a leader

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.689
to make points go beyond.

01:09:01.689 --> 01:09:04.120
OK, but this is a
positioning issue,

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.080
just like positioning biodiesel
is an opportunity for MIT,

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.600
not a threat to
Facilities, gets it done.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.013
So if you view the
environment as an opportunity,

01:09:15.013 --> 01:09:15.930
you're going to do it.

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:20.790
Also if you've got
money, that doesn't hurt.

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:24.420
Another-- this is
actually very surprising.

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.760
It's a study of
14 pulp and paper

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.170
mills in various countries.

01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:31.660
And they have different
regulatory systems--

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.660
New Zealand,
Australia, Canada, US.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.649
But it turns out the differences
in environmental regulation

01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:42.401
don't do much to explain
differences in performance,

01:09:42.401 --> 01:09:43.359
which they can measure.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:47.740
They can measure emissions
per ton or per whatever.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.649
That doesn't do it.

01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:54.460
Most did more than was required.

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:59.830
And their conclusion that they
draw, being profitable helps.

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:02.770
Being profitable a few years
before the sample was taken

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:06.850
helps, if environmental
management style was affected

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:08.950
by was the firm profitable.

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:12.790
But they all pointed
to community pressure.

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:14.860
They all pointed to
community pressure.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.670
If you're in a community
that is organized

01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:24.150
and vocal on the subject of
environmental protection--

01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:25.440
the plant manager lives there.

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.330
This comes to the
issue of, would it

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:33.720
have mattered if you'd
been able to organize

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.780
100 students to march on the
president's office in favor

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.570
of biodiesel?

01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:40.065
Well, yes.

01:10:40.065 --> 01:10:41.440
They don't have
any voting power.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.632
They're not in any of
those organization charts.

01:10:43.632 --> 01:10:44.590
Would it have mattered?

01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:45.220
Yes.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:48.655
It'd be a globe story,
among other things.

01:10:48.655 --> 01:10:49.660
That would turn it.

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.620
That would turn it.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.800
So it was striking-- again,
this is interview work.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.530
It's striking how
often these folks

01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:58.840
pointed to community
pressure, sometimes

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.260
their customers, but
often their communities,

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.250
as to how they decided to
approach the environment.

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:07.480
And this is just--

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:11.170
this they could do by
talking to the managers.

01:11:11.170 --> 01:11:14.170
Were they just barely complying
with the law, were they

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:17.440
committed to complying, were
they trying to be strategic

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.120
about it, or did
they really believe

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.620
in protecting the environment?

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.400
And these are
emissions measures.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.700
This is biological
oxygen demand.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:26.650
This is total suspended solids.

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.060
And I forget what this is.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:31.900
But you see that, depending on
the company's strategy, which

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:35.710
is influenced by the community,
by how much slack they have,

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:40.300
their profitability, you
get better performance

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:43.760
per, well, kilograms per day.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.880
But I think it's per
unit of output, I hope.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.460
Andrew, you had a comment.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.320
ANDREW: However, given
the community, though,

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.390
this community
pressure, this means

01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:00.947
to indirectly affect the
person who makes the decision?

01:12:00.947 --> 01:12:02.030
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Sure.

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.120
ANDREW: What I'm trying
to say that if it

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.562
could be bribing him, it
could be threatening him,

01:12:06.562 --> 01:12:07.547
it could be--

01:12:07.547 --> 01:12:09.630
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No,
they didn't describe it--

01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:11.220
they didn't describe
it like that.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.470
Take a look at the piece.

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:15.750
It was social pressure.

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.720
It was when you go
to the club, people

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.170
say, the river's pretty
smelly today, George.

01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:24.395
Can't you guys do better?

01:12:24.395 --> 01:12:25.770
When you go to
the grocery store,

01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:27.855
people walk around like this.

01:12:27.855 --> 01:12:29.790
It's that-- that
kind of pressure

01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:32.048
is what they pointed
to, not bribing.

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:33.090
That's not going to work.

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:37.490
ANDREW: Because only--
ultimately though,

01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:40.560
should your goal be that I
should influence the community,

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.360
or should my goal be I need to
influence that person somehow?

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.480
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Sure.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.250
The goal should be I need to
influence that person somehow.

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:52.200
But if you can organize
social pressure,

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.810
if you can run
editorials in the paper,

01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:57.010
you can do all kinds of things.

01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:58.150
This one is interesting.

01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:01.210
Let me just do it quickly so
I get you out of here on time.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.850
This guy looks at--

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:05.310
first of all, universities
didn't do recycling

01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:07.290
until the late '80s.

01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:09.780
This person looks at what
kind of recycling programs

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.900
a bunch of universities and
colleges around the Great Lakes

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.810
established between
the late '80s and '95.

01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:17.550
A lot of them went in.

01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:19.650
They went in in two forms.

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:21.540
And this is social pressure.

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.520
This is a social movement.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.690
We should all be recycling.

01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:25.920
Isn't this great?

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.680
And universities and colleges
complied in two ways.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:32.340
Status creation was you
name a recycling director,

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:35.280
you create a new position, you
give it budget, and you say,

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.500
you're in charge of recycling.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.775
And the other way is you say
to those folks in Facilities

01:13:40.775 --> 01:13:42.900
who we've been bad mouthing
for an hour and a half,

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:46.490
and you say, oh, by the way
you're also doing recycling.

01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:51.890
Now, you would expect having
a person actually in charge

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:54.460
of recycling with that
responsibility evaluated

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.835
that way would be
more effective.

01:13:55.835 --> 01:13:57.710
It doesn't measure it.

01:13:57.710 --> 01:14:02.570
What's interesting is he looked
at a whole bunch of variables

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:06.500
that determined, did they adopt
a status creation approach,

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:10.520
did they adopt a role
accretion approach?

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:13.550
Large selective institutions--
selective institutions tend

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:16.130
to have more active
students like you--

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:21.320
and the presence of the Student
Environmental Action Coalition

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:25.687
were all positively associated
with this role accretion.

01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:31.760
The small public
schools that seem

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.950
to be influenced by
their peers were more

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:36.950
likely to do role accretion.

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:40.580
If you had a chapter of this
Student Environmental Action

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:43.340
Coalition, you were
less likely to do

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:47.000
role accretion, very
significant impact, very

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.250
significant impact.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:50.410
Yeah.

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:54.030
AUDIENCE: Did it say in the
paper for the status creation

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.790
if they often got
someone from the outside

01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:58.370
to come and take the position,
or if they promoted someone

01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:59.780
from within their own ranks?

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
They actually did.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.750
They actually did say.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:05.030
And it tended to be
a recent graduate who

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:08.720
had been active in this
area, just the sort of person

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.540
you would expect, right?

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.280
And let me just
for fun, if you're

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.720
looking for something
interesting to do, first look

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.970
up SIAC on Wikipedia and
read what it says about it,

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:28.340
and then go to the
group's own website

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:32.750
and read among the most amazing
histories I've ever read.

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:37.770
It's when they say 1996
was a bad year for us,

01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:41.600
we lost all of our
funding and staff.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.890
It's a really,
really interesting--

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:48.500
but on Wikipedia, they
have 70 college chapters

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.170
and are very active.

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:52.640
This you can read on your own.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.460
It's a summary of some of
the stuff we've talked about.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:59.280
I'll see you Wednesday
for the quiz.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.650
The quiz will be lovely.

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:02.460
It's closed book.

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.360
It does not require computation.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.500
It does, I'm afraid,
require some thinking.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.290
It does not require
a lot of writing.

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:16.163
So please, we all hate the
strategy of, if I put enough

01:16:16.163 --> 01:16:17.330
down, I'll get a good grade.

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:19.310
Don't do that, please.

01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:21.160
Thank you.

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.200
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.640
So where were we last time?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.480
So we had derived the
Fermion Lagrangian

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.460
which is at the
top of the board,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.320
and really the only
difference between this

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.280
and what we talked about earlier
is that we had to perform

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.550
the multipole expansion.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.110
So we distinguish between
collinear momenta that

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.690
are scaling like a collinear
momentum and momentum that

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.260
are scaling like an ultrasoft,
and only the collinear pieces

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.810
were showing up in here, and
same with the collinear gauge

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.310
field.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.470
It was only showing up in here,
whereas both were showing up

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.210
in here.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.220
There's only a single
type of derivative

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.740
here, because
ultrasoft and collinear

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.900
momenta are the same size
in the end component.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900
But they're different in
these other components,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.820
so we had these labels
in this label operator

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.845
that picked out the
collinear momenta.

00:01:08.845 --> 00:01:10.970
So we could define collinear
covariate derivatives,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.790
if you like, with
this subscript n,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.610
whereas this D is like a
full derivative that involves

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.580
both types of gauge field.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.830
And then at the end of
lecture, it was kind of rushed,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.653
but I was talking about the
collinear gluon Lagrangian,

00:01:23.653 --> 00:01:25.570
and I said there is a
set of replacement rules

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.690
that we could make to
effectively do the same thing

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.668
that we did here.

00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:31.210
And now I've just
written out for you

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.690
with that Lagrangian is with
those replacement rules.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.940
So curly D is basically just
taking all the derivatives

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.650
and taking only the
leading order pieces.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.210
So we take the collinear
pieces in this component

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.490
and this component.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.380
We take the ultrasoft
pieces in this component.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.650
And then if you wrote
the original Lagrangian

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.690
as a commutator of two
covariant derivatives,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.860
you'd just replace it by
the leading order pieces,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.580
and that's what the leading
order action will be.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.130
Then, we had to think
about gauge fixing.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.830
Since this is the
collinear gluon Lagrangian,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.410
we should think about
collinear gauge fixing.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.270
This here as a general
covariant gauge

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.610
fixing with parameter
tau, and then there's

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.470
a corresponding ghost term.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.800
And in this Lagrangian, the
usual way it would look,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.740
this would be i
partial, and then

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.850
I said that, because we don't
want the collinear gauge fixing

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.910
term to break ultrasoft
gauge invariance,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.710
we're going to turn
that i partial into

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.321
a covariant derivative under--

00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:35.800
we're going to include
this piece here

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.150
at the n dot a ultrasoft
to make it ultrasoft gauge

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.550
invariant at lowest order.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.050
OK?

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.200
So that's really the only--

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.800
other than just doing this most
naive thing by just replacing

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.450
derivatives by
covariant derivatives,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.250
and you might think,
well, I'll just keep

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.458
this as a partial derivative.

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:54.190
Since it's to
doing gauge fixing,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.140
I don't need to
make it covariant,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.110
but we do want to make it
covariant under the ultrasofts,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.690
and that's why I write
this curly D ultrasoft.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.190
OK.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.580
So that gives you the
leading order Lagrangian.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.180
Once you put together
this with what

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.680
you want for the
ultrasoft, then you

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.650
would have the full
leading order Lagrangian,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.780
and the ultrasoft part
is actually very simple.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.430
So for the ultrasoft
part, we just

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.830
take a full QCD action
for the ultrasoft field.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.085
So this is just
q ultrasoft bar i

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:39.000
D slash ultrasoft q ultrasoft.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.350
And likewise for the gluon
piece, it's just QCD,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.970
and we would do the gauge
fixing without thinking

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.440
about any complications,
like these ones,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.620
and these are just involving
ultrasoft fields, so just

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.320
QCD, just ultrasoft fields.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.770
OK?

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.800
So the only place--

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.930
and you take everything
here together--

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.330
the only place that the
ultrasoft and collinear fields

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.370
talk to each other
in the Lagrangian

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.490
is in this single component n
dot partial, n dot a ultrasoft.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.180
And that comes about basically
because of the power counting,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.680
that this is really the only
place that these two things can

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.220
interact.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.623
And we'll talk about the
implications of that later on,

00:04:31.623 --> 00:04:33.290
but that's the leading
order Lagrangian.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.970
So once you have this piece, and
this piece is pretty straight

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.907
forward with this
additional complication

00:04:38.907 --> 00:04:40.990
of worrying about what
gauge symmetry means, which

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.392
we'll talk more about later.

00:04:43.392 --> 00:04:45.100
But we had to be
careful not to break it,

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.410
when we introduced this
term, because we wanted

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.930
to in some sense have a gauge
fixing both for the collinear

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.900
gluon and a separate gauge
fixing for the ultrasoft gluon,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.380
and that's why we
wanted to do this.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.130
And then this piece
here is simple.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.000
It's just QCD, because
it's, if you'd like,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.710
it's the lowest
energy mode, and it

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.690
doesn't know about any
of the complications

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.780
that we had for the
collinear modes.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.460
OK?

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.680
So any questions
about this so far?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.620
OK.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.440
So everything that we did
in deriving these actions

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.630
is tree level.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.120
All the steps that we
did were tree level.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.478
So you can ask, if
I start to do loops,

00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:26.020
will there be some
Wilson coefficient

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.580
that shows up somewhere here?

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.380
Will I generate
some new operators

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.360
that I don't see here?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.135
Those are reasonable
questions, and that's

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:34.510
what we're going
to address next.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:57.870
So to go further,
we'll use symmetries,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.240
and we're actually
going to consider

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.550
three different symmetries,
gauge symmetry, which I've

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:21.850
been promising you for a while,
reparameterization invariance,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.560
and spin symmetry.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.855
Where I'll put a question
mark by this last one,

00:06:32.855 --> 00:06:35.230
because we need to answer the
question whether there even

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.892
is a spin symmetry.

00:06:37.892 --> 00:06:39.850
These two here, this
number one and number two,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.970
will turn out to
be quite important.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.490
Number three is
not so important.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.110
So reparameterization
invariance here

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.510
will be like reparameterization
invariance in HQET,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.190
except now it's different.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.530
We've introduced the
parameters and then n bar,

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.660
and we'll have to see
what kind of symmetries

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.610
we have with respect to
that choice of basis factors

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.893
that we made.

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:09.060
But it otherwise will be
analogous to our discussion

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.585
of HQET.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.730
So let's actually first dispense
with the one that in some sense

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.430
is the least important,
this number three.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.780
So first, let's revisit
our spinners a little bit.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.440
So if I put together
the information

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.840
that we talked about
when we derived

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.340
the equation at the top of the
board there for the Lagrangian,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:48.360
we worked out at a tree level
we have this formula that

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.170
relates the fields.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.630
So from that formula, if we
just project onto the spinner

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.580
pieces, we can
write down a formula

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.680
that relates the spinners.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.710
So throwing away
the gauge fields,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:18.490
we have in momentum space
the u of p, the spinner,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.050
would be related
to whatever spinner

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.640
we have for this cn field which
I call Un by that formula.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.680
And then if you
take this formula,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.250
you also see that if I
hit it with a projector,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:36.460
n slash n bar slash over 4, if
I hit the u with a projector,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.840
it's going to kill this piece.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.749
Because the n slash n bar slash
can be pushed through the p

00:08:40.749 --> 00:08:45.280
perp slash, then n
bar squared is 0,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.210
so that kills that second piece.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.780
So we also have this formula.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.700
And then once you
have this formula,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.230
you have the formulas
that we wanted for that.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.600
OK?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.180
But this actually,
this spinner here,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.640
this Un is not exactly
the same as the spinner

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.527
that we talked about earlier.

00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:13.360
So let me come back.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.425
Let me come to that in a minute.

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:17.800
So first thing
you might consider

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.640
is whether, when I
take this cn field,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.400
and I take the Lagrangian
up at the top of the board,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.370
do I just get the collinear
propagator that we

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.270
talked about?

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.350
And indeed, you do.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.470
It's kind of obvious for the
momentum-dependent parts,

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.470
and really you might only
worry about the spin.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.670
And so if you
consider this formula,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.480
and you consider the sum
over spins of u u bar which

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.000
is what's going to appear in
the numerator of the propagator

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.458
for the Fermion when you're
driving the Fermion propagator,

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.400
you get a sum over
the physical spins.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.630
Then, from this formula, this
is a projector on something

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:10.345
you know how to do the spin sum
for which is the full theory

00:10:10.345 --> 00:10:10.845
spinner.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.120
And that spin sum
is p slash, so this

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.550
is like p slash sandwiched
between projectors.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.610
And you could work out that
that's exactly the numerator

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:38.745
that we had before after a
little bit of Dirac algebra.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.040
So that part works as expected.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.610
If we take this
Lagrangian, and we work out

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.610
what the propagator is, we
get exactly the propagator

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.690
we got from expansion.

00:11:13.108 --> 00:11:17.390
So quantizing lc0 gives
us that propagator.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.970
But the situation is not quite
the same for the spinner.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.440
And in some sense, this is not--

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.110
this point is not
absolutely crucial,

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.830
but actually, there's
a little simplification

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.590
I want to do in order to
discuss the spin symmetry,

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.170
and in order to do
that at this point,

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.585
it's important to
understand this point.

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:58.460
So that I'm going through
this in some sense,

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.593
because then it'll be very easy
to discuss what spin symmetry

00:12:01.593 --> 00:12:02.510
we have in the theory.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.890
So this guy is actually not
equal to our expanded spinner

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.990
which putting in
some normalization I

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:21.390
could write like this.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.920
So this is what we
got by expanding,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.860
something like this which is
very simple where this u is

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.606
equal to 1, 0 or 0, 1.

00:12:30.606 --> 00:12:33.492
in the Dirac representation.

00:12:33.492 --> 00:12:34.950
But that's actually
not what we get

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.970
if we just take the formula
up here and use this.

00:12:43.573 --> 00:12:44.740
So let's see what we do get.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.830
So if you use the
formula up there,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.447
then you have the following.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.020
So here's the full
theory spinner

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.391
with a conventional
normalization.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:27.790
So this thing and this
thing here is the projector.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.040
OK?

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.970
So you could work out what that
product is, and it turns out

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.040
that you can write it in
the following way which

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.700
is very closely related but
not precisely the same as what

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.930
we had before.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.720
So you can write it in what
looks like the same form

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:56.200
as we have over here, except
this curly U, curly capital U,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.505
is a more complicated object.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.070
And it's just whatever I
get by multiplying these two

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.620
things out which turns
out to be something

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.790
I can write in that form.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.260
So it's some
two-component spinner,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.720
but it's got momentum
dependence, unlike our simple

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:41.690
1, 0 and 0,1.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.133
But everything we said about
Un really depended only

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:46.550
on the fact that it could be
written in this form in terms

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.530
of some two-component spinner--

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.540
the fact that n
slash on it was 0,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.990
the fact that it had
projection relation.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:59.600
So these formulas here, if
you have a formula like these,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.240
these formulas here are true.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.100
OK?

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.230
So actually, it would be true
whatever spinner we have there.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.640
So why should I want
this U twiddle spinner

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.175
and rather than the U spinner?

00:15:17.393 --> 00:15:19.560
That actually has to do
with this reparameterization

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:26.410
invariant, so it'll become
clear when we talk about that.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.000
But these extra terms
in U relative to those

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:40.120
for the other guy,
the simple U, actually

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.162
ensure the proper structure
under reparameterizations.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:55.317
And basically, it'll
become clear in a moment,

00:15:55.317 --> 00:15:57.400
but basically, if we wanted
to get this U spinner,

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:11.910
we should have a slightly
different projector,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.610
which I'll call Pn prime.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.390
So we could have used a
different projector which

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:28.820
is this one, and then
we could have come up

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.880
with another projector which
was the Pn bar projector which

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:45.230
would satisfy that the
sum is 1, if we wanted.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.165
And this projector here, when
acting on the full theory

00:16:49.165 --> 00:16:50.540
field, would have
given something

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.640
that would have
been proportional

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.460
to this combination over here.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:54.960
OK?

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.880
So you just have to believe me.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.530
I don't want to go
through the algebra,

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.420
or you can check it yourself.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.810
But this projector here is not
invariant under that symmetry

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.165
of reparameterization variance.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.950
When we talk about
RPI, it'll be clear

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:17.619
why we want a projector which
is this projector and not

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.140
the slightly different
projector which

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.790
has this extra n slash over 2.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.130
OK.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.050
But nevertheless,
the important point

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.360
that I wanted to
emphasize is really

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.150
that we have this
way of decomposing

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:37.080
the spinner, the true
spinner, for our field cn

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.770
in terms of a two-component
object, U twiddle.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:41.400
OK?

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.083
So we are able to do that.

00:17:45.083 --> 00:17:47.500
And if you want to talk about
spin symmetry of the theory,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.223
it's easier if you use a
two-component notation.

00:17:50.223 --> 00:17:52.140
So the reason that I
wanted to go through this

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.030
is really to have on
the board this equation,

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.240
which I can then use to
motivate writing down

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.385
to two-component version of cn.

00:17:59.385 --> 00:18:01.962
And once I have a
two-component version of SCET,

00:18:01.962 --> 00:18:04.170
then it's very easy to see
what the spin symmetry is.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.220
So let's write down a
two-component version

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.960
of our collinear
quark Lagrangian.

00:18:20.835 --> 00:18:22.960
You can do the same thing,
of course, in HQET right

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.320
down the two-component
version rather than

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.580
a four-component version.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.810
If you have a
four-component version,

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.160
it has this projection relation.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.380
If you have the
two-component version,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.880
the projection
relation is built in.

00:18:37.028 --> 00:18:39.070
The reason to consider
the four-component version

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.715
is if you want a
couple this object

00:18:41.715 --> 00:18:43.840
to four-component fields,
like the ultrasoft field,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.257
then it's, of
course, a nice thing

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:47.920
to have a
four-component version,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.389
but some things are
easier in two components.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:12.730
So take cn, and write
it as follows, where

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.850
this phi n has two components.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.780
And I've set things up,
so the dimensions of cn

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.390
are equal to the
dimensions of phi n.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.890
OK?

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:33.800
So I can take that formula, plug
it into our SCET Lagrangian,

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.235
and then I can, using the Dirac
representation for the gamma

00:19:37.235 --> 00:19:44.090
matrices, write out a
Lagrangian for this phi n.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.120
So that requires doing
a bit of algebra,

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.680
which I will take you through.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.620
And then we get an
equivalent Lagrangian

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.210
but in terms of this field,
and it looks as follows.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.900
OK.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.530
So it's almost independent
of spin but not quite.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.750
There's this sigma
3 sitting there.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.640
If sigma 3 wasn't there,
it'd be like HQET,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.770
where you have an SU2 symmetry.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.300
The fact that sigma
3 is there means

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.745
you don't have an SU2 symmetry.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:27.650
And really, all you
have is a U1 symmetry,

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.220
and that U1 really
corresponds just to helicity.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:39.770
So in four-component notation,
that U1 would be the following.

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:47.110
It's projecting a spin operator
onto perpendicular indices

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.490
anti-symmetric in both of them,
and in the two components,

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.950
that just becomes a sigma 3.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.860
So obviously, if we do
an exponential rotation

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.780
with respect to sigma 3,
sigma 3 commutes with sigma 3,

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.160
so does the identity.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.550
And so we could have a
rotation of this guy by that,

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.340
and that's the
only spin symmetry

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.780
that you have is this helicity.

00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:30.180
And so because of the
coordinates we're using,

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.980
this corresponds to the spin
along the direction of motion

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.604
which is the three
direction, if you like,

00:22:37.604 --> 00:22:39.340
which sometimes we
denote by just saying

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.790
it's along the direction n which
is then more independent of how

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.310
we pick our axes.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.990
So this symmetry
here is actually

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.140
related to what you would
call the chirality in QCD.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.205
So it's not really
a new symmetry.

00:23:00.207 --> 00:23:02.165
So this is just related
to the chiral rotation.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:12.180
So if you look at gamma
5 times c and gamma 5

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.950
in our representation
would be 0, 1, 1 0.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.710
And then if I write
it out in terms

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:24.960
of this two-component
thing, then that

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:33.200
is just giving me 1 over root 2,
and it's swapping up and down.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.750
And so that just means that phi
n has gone to sigma 3 phi n.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.060
So multiplying by gamma
5 is actually the same

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.840
as multiplying by sigma 3 in
the two-component notation.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.340
OK?

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.060
So this is not really new
symmetry, and actually

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.770
all the usual things
that you would

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:57.380
say about chiral rotations
in QCD would apply here too.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.630
So chiral rotations,
of course, are not

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.270
exact chiral rotations
are broken by masses.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.130
Chiral rotations are broken
by non-perturbative effects.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.830
You can worry about anomalies.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.980
They are useful in perturbation
theory for quantifying

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.290
operators, and that
remains true here,

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:20.248
but if the collinear fields
were non-perturbative,

00:24:20.248 --> 00:24:22.540
then you should worry about
those other things as well.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.200
OK.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.250
So spin symmetry, there's
not really anything new

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.560
there to talk about,
but along the way,

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.560
we saw we could write
SCET in two-component form

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.477
which is kind of nice.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.615
So let's talk about something
that's more important which

00:24:41.615 --> 00:24:42.365
is gauge symmetry.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.670
Is there any questions about
the spin before we talk about

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.295
gauge symmetry?

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.945
AUDIENCE: So the extra term you
got in determining the theta n

00:24:56.945 --> 00:25:01.460
bar, that is why you had the
minus n slash [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.960
and why you don't
have the full SU2?

00:25:12.338 --> 00:25:13.005
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.930
I looked at it once,
but it's hard for me

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.888
to remember the answer.

00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:23.868
I think not, but I think if
you do the other version,

00:25:23.868 --> 00:25:25.910
then you just get something
more complicated here

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.720
but still breaks SU2.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.010
Yeah.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.910
AUDIENCE: Is it--

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.900
I'm just looking
for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.220
PROFESSOR: So they're
two disconnected fact.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.008
The thing that I
wanted to motivate

00:25:40.008 --> 00:25:41.800
that I could use this
formula, and I wanted

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.600
to be honest with you
about where that came from,

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.253
and that's why I told
you this other fact.

00:25:47.253 --> 00:25:48.670
But I could have
jumped right here

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.147
and said, remember,
and glossed over it,

00:25:51.147 --> 00:25:53.230
and that would have been
fine for this discussion.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.180
So they're in some sense two
disconnected things, at least

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:55.690
in my mind.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.410
AUDIENCE: Do you
have some intuition

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.190
for what theta n bar is?

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.040
PROFESSOR: For theta n bar?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.380
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.150
Yeah.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.700
It's really just saying--

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.320
my intuition for
it is really just

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.950
that, when you're producing
energetic particles,

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.510
it's what we did
at the beginning.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.930
When you're producing
energetic particles,

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.990
these are the spin components
that you have at lowest order,

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.700
and that leads to, if you like--

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.560
the fact that you
have this form,

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.350
and you have this
projection relation

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.630
is kind of non-trivial,
even though you

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.030
don't have a spin symmetry.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.110
There is something to it.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:42.730
It's not like a SU2
symmetry of the spin,

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.420
but it does, for example,
when you go and look

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.820
at form factors, it does
lead to non-trivial relations

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.390
for those form factors.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.970
So I don't call it a symmetry.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.590
I don't think of
it as a symmetry,

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.220
because it's not a formal group
theory statement of Lagrangian,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.070
but I think it's basically--

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.150
well, OK.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.490
Let me not speculate
any further.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:14.780
It caused some confusion in the
literature actually as well.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.120
All right.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.780
So what about gauge symmetry?

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.940
So we're doing a
non-abelian gauge theory.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:30.070
A gauge transformation
is something like this.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.273
And in order to just talk
about gauge symmetry, what

00:27:32.273 --> 00:27:34.940
we need to do is we need to talk
about the gauge symmetries that

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.087
are related to the two type
of gluons that we have.

00:27:37.087 --> 00:27:38.170
We have a collinear gluon.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.680
We have an ultrasoft gluon.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.790
You know that the field
acting like the connection

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:44.870
for that gauge symmetry.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.400
So there should
be, in some sense,

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.710
a gauge symmetry associated
to the ultrasoft gluon

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.870
and a separate one associated
with collinear gluon,

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.060
if the meaning of these
things as gauge fields

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.060
is going to have
any sense to it.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.423
So rather than have just this
set of gauge transformations

00:27:58.423 --> 00:27:59.840
that we can make
in QCD, we should

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.762
have some more complicated
structure of gauge symmetry

00:28:02.762 --> 00:28:04.220
in the effective
theory, because we

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.303
have a more complicated
structure of gauge fields.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.073
So in order to talk
about U's, we're

00:28:15.073 --> 00:28:16.740
going to want to
divide them into camps.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.530
And the useful
thing to think about

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:23.250
is that you want to have
U's that, first of all,

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.170
leave you inside the
effective theory.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.180
And really what this
means is that you

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.400
want talking about
gauge symmetry

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.230
to commute with your
discussion of talking

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.270
about power counting.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:41.040
So by way of
example of this, say

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:48.350
you had a gauge
transformation that was large,

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.590
that made a formula like that
one, that i partial on it

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.194
was scaling like q.

00:28:53.194 --> 00:28:54.020
OK?

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.270
So this would be a very
large momentum associated

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.560
to that spacetime dependence.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.110
Then, if you talked about the
gauge transformation which

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:09.530
would be U times c, even if
this guy has collinear momentum

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.460
scaling, the new guy would
not because of this fact.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:34.130
OK?

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.140
So if we want to talk
about gauge symmetries,

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.390
we want to talk about symmetries
that take us to the fields

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.580
that we've already decided to
have a certain power counting.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.413
And we don't want the
gauge symmetry to mess

00:29:42.413 --> 00:29:44.930
that up, so we're going to
demand that that's true.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.570
So given that, we can think
about dividing up the gauge

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.550
symmetry into
pieces, into pieces

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.500
that have different
scaling in terms

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.750
of how big the
transformation are,

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.180
how the coordinates
are behaving.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.510
And it's convenient
for this discussion

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.150
to divide them into three parts.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:09.090
A global transformation,
where this guy is not

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:14.930
spacetime dependent, a
collinear transformation,

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:22.430
which I'll call Uc,
where i partial on Uc

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:29.240
scales like a
collinear momentum,

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:41.688
and then an ultrasoft U Us,
where the i partial scales like

00:30:41.688 --> 00:30:42.605
an ultrasoft momentum.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.920
And basically,
what we want to do

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.900
is we want to connect this gauge
transformation to the gauge

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.950
field for the collinears
and this transformation

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.325
to the gauge field
for the softs.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.710
OK?

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.500
So one complication that
we have to deal with

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.842
is this momentum labels
that we were talking about.

00:31:16.842 --> 00:31:18.300
Because the way
that we distinguish

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.490
between these types of momenta
and these types of momenta

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.770
was dividing things into
these labels and residuals.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.100
Gauge transformations
are something

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.200
that's very nice in position
space but not so nice

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:40.040
in momentum space, and that's
because gauge transformations

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.870
are local transformations.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:46.160
Local means local
in x not in P. So

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.890
what is simple multiplication
in position space

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.740
becomes convolutions
in momentum space.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:06.800
So if you go over to this hybrid
notation that we developed,

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.556
then you would
have the following.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:28.970
At this field, if I
do a transformation,

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.650
it goes into
something like that.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.940
Where the way that you should
think of what this sum over q

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.890
is in the following way.

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.710
But if you have a
transformation in position space

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:49.780
that looks like that,
then in a momentum space,

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.820
that simple product
is convolution.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.570
OK?

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:09.280
So this is one dimension, and
you'd have that correspondence.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.668
And so this complication that
we have here just correspond

00:33:12.668 --> 00:33:14.710
to the complication that
you'd have for any gauge

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.793
symmetry that you want to
write in momentum space.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:23.130
But we can be slick about
this and introduce a notation

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.860
and then dispense with
it, because it's really

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.520
not a technical complication.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.300
It's just a notational
complication.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.750
So let's do that in
the following way.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:43.410
Let's let Uc which is a
matrix with two indices

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:49.030
be defined by this
Uc of bl minus ql.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.280
So I'll say define a matrix.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.890
Then we can use a matrix
notation for the convolutions,

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.570
where we sum over
repeated indices,

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:08.256
and that takes care of this
notational complication.

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:19.900
So what is meant by this is that
the Pl, ql entry of this matrix

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.190
is a number, and that number
is given by this thing

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.790
that we call Uc Pl minus ql.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.060
OK.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.770
So then the formula
up here could just

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.449
be written in terms
of that matrix

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.512
as a kind of matrix
multiplication.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:44.560
OK.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.320
So what are the transformations
once we adopt that?

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.053
Let me write them down
and then talk about them.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:10.090
So cn of x goes to Uc of x cn of
x, where you should understand

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:15.290
this thing is a matrix that
has two indices, like this,

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:19.030
also dependent on spacetime.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.570
And I just dot over the repeated
indices in this thing which

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.072
is like a vector.

00:35:24.072 --> 00:35:28.420
So this is like a matrix,
and this like a vector.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:39.310
That makes it look like it's
the usual notation which

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:42.430
is the point of
introducing this notation.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.490
So for the collinear
gauge field,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.530
it's going to be
basically that it,

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.020
as we said over here,
that it becomes the gauge

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.560
field of that
transformation, and so that's

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.370
what this would be.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.375
That would be the standard
gauge transformation,

00:36:09.375 --> 00:36:11.750
and then there's one little
complication here, which is I

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:15.050
wrote curly D ultrasoft,
the ultrasoft derivative,

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.790
the thing that has the n
dot a ultrasoft field in it.

00:36:23.277 --> 00:36:24.860
So the reason that
I wanted to do that

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.112
is because I'm thinking
here of the ultrasoft field.

00:36:27.112 --> 00:36:28.820
When I'm thinking
about collinear fields,

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.190
I'm thinking of the ultrasoft
field as a background field.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.420
And if I was to do a background
field gauge transformation,

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.100
then I would have a
covariant derivative

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.870
here under the background.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:58.390
So this n dot a ultrasoft
is like a background field

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:59.950
to the collinear gauge field.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:20.980
So this, if you want to make an
analogy of what this is like,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:25.600
it's like the quantum gauge
transformation of a field that

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.995
has a background.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.290
If you look up how
background field gauge

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:44.007
works and background
field transformations,

00:37:44.007 --> 00:37:45.090
you'd have the same thing.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.342
You'd have something covariant
under the background,

00:37:47.342 --> 00:37:49.300
and that's what we're
going to do here as well.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.400
Yep?

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.030
AUDIENCE: Kind of
a silly question.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.600
So UC of x is a matrix.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.220
So what exactly UC
of p [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:00.217 --> 00:38:01.050
PROFESSOR: Well, no.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.830
This is just a number.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:06.580
So just think of this as
like this is some vector,

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:07.830
and this is some other vector.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:11.310
The difference of these are
some label on this thing.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:11.920
Right?

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.610
And for each value of this,
I get a different number,

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.450
and then for each
value it's based on,

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.283
I get a the different
number, but this thing

00:38:18.283 --> 00:38:19.330
is just a number.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.470
And I'm saying think of it
like a matrix in the sense of,

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.320
because we are thinking
of these as discrete--

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.907
AUDIENCE: But isn't
UC [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:27.907 --> 00:38:28.740
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.240
Yeah.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.360
That's another matrix.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.690
It's an orthogonal matrix.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.120
It's also a matrix
in that space.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:33.420
Yeah.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:33.620
Yeah.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.120
Yeah.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.860
So here, I'm defining a
matrix in a new space which

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.440
is this momentum space,
and that's just really

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.560
my way of making transformations
in momentum space look

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.340
like as simple as they
do in position space

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:51.148
by just having a matrix
notation for the convolutions.

00:38:51.148 --> 00:38:53.190
AUDIENCE: So that number
is essentially a matrix.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.280
PROFESSOR: It's a matrix,
yeah, in that space.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:56.790
Good point.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.553
What about the ultrasoft fields?

00:39:05.553 --> 00:39:08.220
Well, ultrasoft fields shouldn't
transform under collinear gauge

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:13.120
transformations because
of exactly the same logic

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.280
that I gave you a minute
ago about why I shouldn't

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.710
be able to inject a hard
momentum like this one

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.840
into the effective theory.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.710
If I want my ultrasoft
fields to remain ultrasoft,

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.440
then I can't let them
transform, because that would

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.780
spoil their power counting.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:34.550
So q ultrasoft under
this Uc transformation

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:40.430
just goes to q ultrasoft,
and A ultrasoft

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.928
has to go to A ultrasoft.

00:39:42.928 --> 00:39:45.470
So these things should not be
touched by that transformation.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:50.090
AUDIENCE: So why cannot make
the ultrasoft and the collinear

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:50.840
talk to the--

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.340
PROFESSOR: Well,
we don't want that.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.130
You could think of trying to
develop effective theory, where

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.460
they would mix.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:56.960
Right?

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.640
But whenever you have
a Lagrangian that

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.598
mixes two fields, the
first thing you try to do

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:02.900
is to force them not to mix.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.793
So it's better, say I set the
theory up so that they mixed.

00:40:06.793 --> 00:40:08.960
The first thing I would try
to do to that Lagrangian

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.520
is make field
redefinitions to go

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.910
to some form of the
Lagrangian that wouldn't mix.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:14.930
OK?

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:19.675
So I prefer, if you like,
to develop the one that

00:40:19.675 --> 00:40:21.050
doesn't mix right
from the start,

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:25.040
and you could view it that way.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.990
So you could always
think of I'm going

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:28.940
to tell you like two
sets of transformations.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.378
You could always think of
formulating linear combinations

00:40:31.378 --> 00:40:32.420
of those transformations.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.520
Say these are the fundamental
ones, not the ones

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.680
you wrote down but
these other ones.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.580
Right?

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.245
And then by some
manipulations, one

00:40:40.245 --> 00:40:41.870
could go to the ones
I'm talking about.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.670
All right.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.425
So now, the other set of
transformations that we want

00:41:20.425 --> 00:41:24.640
are these ultrasoft
ones, and for that type

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.498
of transformation, we don't
have the same type of problem

00:41:28.498 --> 00:41:29.290
with the collinear.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:32.380
We can't say the collinear
fields don't transform,

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.847
because that type
of transformation

00:41:35.847 --> 00:41:37.930
doesn't spoil the collinear
field being collinear.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.750
We can always add
ultrasoft momentum to it.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.900
So these fields cn
and An will transform

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.410
like background fields--

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.336
sorry, like quantum
fields in a background.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:06.980
So from the point of
view of the cn fields

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.870
which are the shorter
distance fields,

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:10.298
you can really
think of like what

00:42:10.298 --> 00:42:11.840
we're doing here is
exactly like what

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.510
you would do if you had
quantum and background gauge

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.833
transformations.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.800
And the physics of thinking
of the background as a longer

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.380
wavelength mode is
exactly the right way

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.720
of thinking about how
these fields which

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.450
are shorter wavelength think
about the ultrasoft fields.

00:42:37.382 --> 00:42:39.090
So what that means is
that they transform

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.460
like matter fields in the
appropriate representation.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.500
OK?

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.680
So with that in hand,
we can write down

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.680
how things transform
under the ultrasofts.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.780
A Fermion just transforms
like that on the left,

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.270
and this, unlike our
notation over there,

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.440
this is one number for
all entries in the vector.

00:43:21.093 --> 00:43:22.510
This guy doesn't
have any indices.

00:43:30.572 --> 00:43:31.550
OK?

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.480
So this is like transforming
all the terms in the vector

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.830
by the same overall color
matrix, overall number

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:41.140
in the momentum matrix base.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:54.310
So this guy should
transform like an adjoint,

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:58.960
and you can read the
adjoint as a U on each side.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.660
So there's two ways of writing
the transformation here.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:07.350
You could write it as like this.

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:09.580
If you wrote down an
adjoint transformation,

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:16.490
then this guy would have
two indices A and B,

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.240
and you'd have a
transformation like that,

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.340
where this is in the adjoint.

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.310
But if you want to write it
in terms of the U ultrasoft

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.920
that's e to the ita, which
is in the fundamental,

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.338
then you write it like this,
and those are equivalent.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.980
So why are they equivalent?

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.710
So they're equivalent because--

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:43.700
well, OK.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.090
Maybe I'll tell you later.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:46.590
Yeah?

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.890
AUDIENCE: I'm always confused
about why n dot is a background

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:58.200
field to A ultrasoft,
because it actually

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.579
has the same size of
momentum, so its wavelength

00:45:00.579 --> 00:45:01.940
is the same size.

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.090
PROFESSOR: The wavelength
is not the same size.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.430
The component's power
counting is the same size,

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:12.060
but the n dot An field
carries momentum which have

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.473
P squared which is much larger.

00:45:13.473 --> 00:45:14.140
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.013
P squared [INAUDIBLE]
wavelength, right?

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:18.180
PROFESSOR: So I'm talking
about the wavelength which

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.660
is related to that P squared.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.920
So you think about the n dot An
field carries a large P minus

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.700
momentum still.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.200
Right?

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.400
Even though it has a small--

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.220
it carries in order
a 1 P minus momentum.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.280
So if it's confusing,
think about just the P

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.780
minus momentum.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:39.360
The n dot An field, right,
has P minus, which is

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.840
the what are lambda to the 0.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.030
So just let's think about
wavelength with respect

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.030
to P minus.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.980
AUDIENCE: That's
definitely true, yeah.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:47.688
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:47.688 --> 00:45:52.770
Whereas the n dot A ultrasoft
field carries P minus, which

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:56.370
is what are lambda squared, so
just thinking about those two.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.863
AUDIENCE: You were saying
conflating [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:59.863 --> 00:46:00.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:01.030
Yeah.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:05.670
All right.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.700
We have room here to squeeze
the final transformation.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.810
So the final transformations
are just what you'd expect,

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.090
that the ultrasoft fields
transform as regular gauge

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:16.590
fields.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.220
So let me just squeeze that in.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:40.090
All right.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:41.740
So there's the regular
transformations

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.990
that you'd have
for a gauge field.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.310
Yeah?

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.790
AUDIENCE: So I just
want to clarify.

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:53.200
These two analogies
for background field

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.950
transformations, they're
not disconnected.

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:55.450
Right?

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.020
PROFESSOR: They're
not disconnected

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.800
in the sense-- that's right.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.300
Yeah.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.168
So if you take the
background field notation,

00:47:02.168 --> 00:47:03.710
and you just really
think about that,

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:05.960
then this is how you would
transform the quantum

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.630
field into the background
gauge transformation.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:12.650
And this is how you would
transform the quantum field

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:15.840
under the quantum
gauge transformation.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.340
Yeah.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.990
That's right.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.540
Yeah.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.550
AUDIENCE: So even if you made
these to separate the gauge

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.260
transformation for
just [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.443
they still have the
same quantum numbers?

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:27.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:27.652
That's right.

00:47:27.652 --> 00:47:30.462
AUDIENCE: Are they going
to meet at some level?

00:47:30.462 --> 00:47:32.420
PROFESSOR: We're going
to make sure they don't.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:37.490
In some sense, we really
want-- the picture is this one

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:40.250
that we had earlier,
where we really

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:43.730
want the collinear
fields to live up here,

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:44.930
so we had these hyperbolas.

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:45.240
Right?

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.115
We want this guy to live
up here and this guy

00:47:47.115 --> 00:47:51.380
to live down there
in momentum space.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.660
So this was P minus.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:54.407
This is P plus.

00:47:54.407 --> 00:47:56.240
So we want them to live
in different places.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.010
They have the same
quantum numbers,

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.770
except we want them
in momentum space

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:02.600
to live in different
places and to describe

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.550
different degrees of freedom.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.330
Right?

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.760
So everything that we did
here is exactly related

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.520
to this picture, that we
want to talk about this guy

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.190
as having larger momentum, talk
about gauge transformations

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.600
that shuffle things
around with components

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.705
that have large momentum
versus small momentum.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.260
All right.

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.260
So we're going to
hypothesize that these gauge

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.470
transformations are the
fundamental symmetry

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:37.470
of the effective theory.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.950
And I tried to motivate
them physically

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.770
by this analogy with
background field gauge

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.410
and thinking about a longer
wavelength mode with respect

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:52.560
to a shorter wavelength mode
which is in this picture

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.390
exactly the fact that
this hyperbola is

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.820
higher than this one.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.350
Maybe the hyperbola
should stay on the board.

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:00.850
OK?

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:04.680
So they multipole, where
the multipole expansion

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.770
that we did between these
fields and the statement

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:11.610
that this is a longer
wavelength mode

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:13.560
is exactly the fact that
there's a separation

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.430
between these guys.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:40.050
So we'll take these to be the
fundamental transformations

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.715
that do not get corrected
by power corrections.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.910
And I'm not claiming
that that's necessarily

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.770
a unique way of getting
to the effective theory.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:00.403
You could think
of there might be

00:50:00.403 --> 00:50:02.820
an example in the literature
of where people were thinking

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.893
of other gauge transformations.

00:50:04.893 --> 00:50:06.810
These are the ones that
people talk about now,

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:08.352
but in the early
days, I think, there

00:50:08.352 --> 00:50:09.935
is an example in the
literature, where

00:50:09.935 --> 00:50:11.820
people are thinking of
other transformations,

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.278
and you could prove
that they could

00:50:13.278 --> 00:50:16.060
be connected to these ones.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.343
But we'll just
take the ones that

00:50:19.343 --> 00:50:20.760
are the most useful
from the start

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.968
and not worry too much about
what we could have done.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:27.990
All right.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:31.200
So there's no mixing
in the power counting,

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.560
and that's something
that we like.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.480
Set up that way.

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:50.720
If there was a mixing,
if we connected things

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.210
that were different
sizes in lambda,

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:56.420
then you could say, well,
that the power counting,

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.150
that the gauge transformation
induces power suppressed terms.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:00.817
And you could end up
with some situation

00:51:00.817 --> 00:51:03.350
where you're trying to connect
things at different orders,

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:06.680
and we don't have that here.

00:51:11.005 --> 00:51:12.630
And that's because,
if we want to think

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.670
about this thing as a
symmetry, it should really

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:16.378
be a symmetry of the
leading order action

00:51:16.378 --> 00:51:19.680
that shouldn't require some
other sub-leading terms

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.110
necessarily to compensate
for it, at least

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:24.360
for a gauge symmetry like this.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.060
We'd like to think that what
the meaning of gauge symmetry is

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.980
and the redundancy
encoded in gauge symmetry

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.180
is all something
that you're talking

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.710
about at the order of
the leading order action.

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.750
And you're not talking
about redundancies

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.900
in fields in sub-leading
order, et cetera.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.100
OK.

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.990
So let's do an
example, now that we

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:47.580
have this, of how it comes in.

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.170
And I want to come
back to our example

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:54.170
of our heavy-to-light current
and talk about gauge symmetry

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:54.670
there.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:00.940
If you just took the
tree level result

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:05.750
that we had in
that case, then we

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:09.440
had something that just
involved these two guys,

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.800
and this hv field was ultrasoft.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.170
This guy was collinear.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.010
So if you did a
Uc transformation,

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:22.700
then under our rules, what you'd
find is that the cn transforms,

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.670
and this guy doesn't,
the h doesn't.

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:27.750
So that would not
be gauge invariant.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.150
But actually, we saw that this
also wasn't the lowest order

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.650
current.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:45.350
There was this additional thing,
the Wilson line showed up,

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:47.660
and that Wilson line is
going to fix this issue.

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.367
It's going to make
it gauge invariant.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.260
So we have to ask, how
do Wilson lines transform

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.695
under gauge symmetries?

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:10.390
And that Wilson line
in position space,

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:13.620
I called it something like this.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.700
I can't remember if I
used a twiddle or a bar.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.430
We'll use a bar here for the
position space Wilson line.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:24.880
So in general, in just
a regular gauge theory,

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.360
the Wilson line
between two points

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.060
transforms at the endpoints.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.380
So you get U of x.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.015
Then, you get a U dagger of y.

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.560
So if you like,
what we would say

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.350
for this Wilson line is that
we have a U of x on one side

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:48.590
and a U dagger of minus
infinity on the other side.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:01.650
Minus infinity is really
long wavelength physics,

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.420
and so we have to
worry a little bit

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.600
about the overlap between
our different types of gauge

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.860
transformations.

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:13.340
I divided them into three
camps-- collinear, ultrasoft,

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:18.006
and the global, so let
me do the following.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.760
To avoid some double counting
with what I called U global,

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:38.290
let's just simply take,
since U global acts the same

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:41.950
everywhere, let's just simply
take Uc dagger at minus

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:44.251
infinity to be 1.

00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:46.810
So this is at some
particular spacetime point.

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:50.140
We take it to be 1,
and this U global

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.530
will transform at that point.

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:56.400
We then know there's no overlap
between Uc and U global.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.930
OK?

00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:01.890
Then, that's enough
to ensure that.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:07.290
So with that, our guy under a
collinear gauge transformation

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:08.700
just transforms on one side.

00:55:12.085 --> 00:55:14.460
If you like, what's happening
is that the coordinate here

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.580
corresponds to this
very large momentum,

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:22.200
and we're stretching
ourselves out to long distance

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.450
physics which is corresponding
to the smaller momentum.

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.660
So when I think
about transformations

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.170
that should be collinear, I want
them to be associated to the x.

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.420
And I want to associate other
types of transformations

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.190
to what's going on at
infinity which is really

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:37.857
a spacetime of its own, which is
this ultrasoft spacetime that's

00:55:37.857 --> 00:55:41.680
sitting at the
collinear infinity.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.318
So that's why I want,
actually, it to look like this.

00:55:44.318 --> 00:55:48.878
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] just
with the collinear fields?

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:49.545
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:49.545 --> 00:55:50.087
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:50.087 --> 00:55:50.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.084
So this guy here is a
path-ordered exponential,

00:55:55.084 --> 00:56:01.640
and it just involved
the n bar guy.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.140
Yeah.

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:07.640
So that's what it was
in position space,

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:13.250
and in momentum space,
they called it W,

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:16.770
and it was a sum over
a bunch of things.

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:22.690
I'm not going to--

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:30.450
we had this formula.

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:31.940
Let me not write
it all out again.

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:41.520
As a short form
for that formula,

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.060
we can write the
following formula

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:47.850
which is given our
notation that we've

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:52.540
developed a useful way
of thinking about it.

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:55.680
So if we formally expand
out this exponential,

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.350
and we just keep the order of
that expansion, where the P

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:01.290
bar acts on all the fields to
the right, that will correctly

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:04.770
reproduce this denominator,
the sum over permutations

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:06.990
is something that
we still have to do.

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:12.280
It was 1 over n factorial,
k factorial in here.

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.735
M factorial with this notation.

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.630
OK?

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:18.160
But this is like
a little shorthand

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.326
for that messy formula.

00:57:20.326 --> 00:57:21.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:22.550
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:25.310
AUDIENCE: I think it's related
to the gauge transformation

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:26.230
equation before.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:27.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.958
AUDIENCE: How do you get
the i epsilon prescription?

00:57:30.958 --> 00:57:32.837
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:32.837 --> 00:57:35.170
PROFESSOR: So that actually
is related to the fact that,

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.940
when you look at the--

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.460
for this Wilson line
with the i epsilon,

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:43.310
it's not related to the gauge
transformation at infinity,

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:46.040
but it's related to the fact
that the path goes that way.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.060
So that when you do
the Fourier integral,

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.750
the fact that it goes from minus
infinity to x will give the i0.

00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:53.710
OK?

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:56.952
But for these Wilson
lines here, if you

00:57:56.952 --> 00:57:58.660
think about what's
happening at the place

00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:00.970
where the i0 would
actually matter,

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:03.820
that's exactly the 0 bin.

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.290
So it's going to
be a little more--

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:05.790
Yeah.

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:08.308
So you don't really care.

00:58:08.308 --> 00:58:09.260
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.320
I can only say that--

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.960
we'll explain what I
just said to Ilia more

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.650
when we come to it later on.

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:21.660
OK.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.690
So this field here has--

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:30.510
I said, it's a momentum
space, but then I wrote x.

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:32.310
So really what I mean
by momentum space

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:36.310
is momentum is in the
label momentum space.

00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:39.290
There's some guy, and the labels
are these labels on the fields

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:39.790
here.

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:40.590
Right?

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:42.975
So there's still an x,
and that x corresponds

00:58:42.975 --> 00:58:44.850
to the residual coordinate
that we were using

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:47.110
to do the multipole expansion.

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:49.980
So in some sense, this isn't
simply the Fourier transform

00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.170
of that, because of that.

00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:54.300
It's still knows
about the separation

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.550
between the large momentum
and the soft momentum

00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:59.680
from that multipole expansion.

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.350
So this dependence
on x allows us

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:04.830
to think about the multipole
expansion on these Wilson

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:06.990
lines.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:10.230
It encodes all the
residual momenta,

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:12.930
and the fields in the Wilson
line carry a residual momenta.

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.720
So we're just putting
our notation to use here.

00:59:25.523 --> 00:59:27.940
And if you really strictly
want to connect to that formula

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:33.630
up there, then you would take
the residual momenta to be 0.

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:40.350
And then the Fourier
transform with respect

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:46.560
to just the large
momentum Pl minus

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:51.820
gives a line which
is just depending

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:53.629
on that one single coordinate.

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:04.110
So if we just had
a coordinate which

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:05.910
is conjugate to the
large momenta, which

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:07.920
is the thing that's
showing up here

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.990
are the large momenta, then
that would be the analog of what

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.240
we were talking about up here.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.090
Where in general,
this thing also

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.660
has a dependence on
the residual x, which

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:18.947
we'll make use of in a minute.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:24.920
OK.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:32.350
So let's think
about, so I told you

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:35.200
how this Wilson line
transforms under Uc see.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.120
How does it transform
under U ultrasoft?

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:49.410
So under Uc, again using
this matrix-type notation,

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:50.635
it's just Uc.

01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:58.610
So this is a matrix
multiplication

01:00:58.610 --> 01:00:59.600
in momentum space.

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:12.350
What about under an
ultrasoft transformation?

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.390
Well, under an ultrasoft
transformation,

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:15.850
this should be a derived--

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.850
in some sense, under a
collinear transformation,

01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:19.600
it was a derived
quantity, because we knew

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.948
of the gauge field transform.

01:01:20.948 --> 01:01:23.240
The thing that gave us the
transformation of the Wilson

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.680
line is just the transformation
of the gauge field.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.180
OK?

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.030
So that's what led to,
actually, this form, once we

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:30.240
put in this fact.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.970
So under the ultrasoft
transformation,

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.553
we just take the transformation
that we have for the collinear

01:01:34.553 --> 01:01:36.530
gauge field, and
then we derive how

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:41.360
the Wilson line should transform
under the ultrasoft gauge

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.510
symmetry.

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:43.010
OK?

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:45.800
So how does this guy transform?

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.160
This guy transforms by
putting U's on the left

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:57.190
and the right that are at x.

01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:58.840
But every field in
this exponential

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.260
has the same, U U
dagger, multiply it,

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.120
think about expanding that out.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.470
All the U U daggers that are
next to each other cancel.

01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:08.595
You just get an overall U
U dagger that comes right

01:02:08.595 --> 01:02:10.670
outside the exponential.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:16.960
So this guy is just transforming
with U ultrasoft of x.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:23.440
Wilson line back again,
U ultrasoft dagger of x,

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.200
and that's because this
Wilson line with our notation

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.470
is really a local thing with
respect to the coordinate x.

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:31.640
All the fields sit at x.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.140
OK?

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.500
So it just transforms
like that, because that's

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.359
how the gauge field
inside it transforms.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.310
So in some sense,
both of these are

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.030
derived from the
transformation of An,

01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:56.277
but it's easier to think about
how a Wilson line transforms

01:02:56.277 --> 01:02:58.110
and then think about
how it should transform

01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:00.410
under collinear than just
go through the An route

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:03.070
and impose this condition.

01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:03.570
OK.

01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:10.020
So let's come back now to our
full current which was this,

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.590
that had the Wilson line in it.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:16.410
And now if you ask how
it transforms under Uc,

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:19.560
you see what's going to happen.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.720
You get Uc dagger, Uc,
and the ultrasoft guy

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.720
doesn't transform,
and then these cancel.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.050
So it's invariant under
the transformations

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.380
that have momenta of
order of the ultrasoft.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.610
It'll have a momentum of
what are the linear scale.

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:38.070
There's two objects in this
thing that have momenta

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.210
that can be of that size.

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:42.180
The gluons, they're in W in
this collinear quark field.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.950
Both of those things transform,
but that transformation

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:48.826
cancels between the two things.

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:51.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:54.040
PROFESSOR: Whoops,
that's important.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.040
Thank you.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.330
And then under an
ultrasoft transformation,

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.610
we can also transform this
guy, and then everybody's

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:04.853
transforming.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:19.330
Gamma, of course, has
not got color indices,

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.740
and again, it's gauge invariant.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.240
OK?

01:04:26.668 --> 01:04:27.780
Missed a gamma.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:34.970
Gamma's not so important.

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:35.470
All right?

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:37.990
So this current that
we derived earlier

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:40.690
is actually invariant under two
different types of symmetries

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:44.230
which are really momentum space
splitting of a standard gauge

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:47.380
symmetry into pieces where we
have a large momenta and pieces

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.390
where you have these
larger momenta, collinear

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:51.370
momenta and pieces where
we have a smaller momenta,

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.360
this ultrasoft momenta.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.777
But both of these
types of momenta

01:04:53.777 --> 01:04:57.790
are momenta that we're allowing
inside the effective theory.

01:04:57.790 --> 01:04:58.440
Yeah?

01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.815
AUDIENCE: Just
trying to remember

01:04:59.815 --> 01:05:03.080
that the ultrasoft scale was
the same for the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.770
The momentum of the ultrasoft--

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:10.610
the ultrasoft momentum
of the collinear

01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:12.700
quark, you pulled
out mv, and then

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.580
the remaining part was
ultrasoft in the discussion

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.780
for this particular thing.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.710
All right.

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:26.720
So it's the Wilson
line, the moral of this

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.180
is that what we were doing
before, where we're integrating

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.460
out those collinear
gluons, is actually

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.660
connected to gauge symmetry.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.180
Because without
that Wilson line,

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:38.518
we wouldn't have a result
that's invariant under the type

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.310
of gauge symmetry we've
been talking about.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:50.120
So this Wilson line carries
these n collinear gluons,

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.910
and those gluons would be the
gluons that in the full theory

01:05:52.910 --> 01:06:01.910
would give you a gauge symmetric
result. They would combine.

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:04.550
They would be the attachments
to the heavy quark that

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:06.560
combined with attachments
to the light quark

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.878
to give you a result
that's invariant,

01:06:09.878 --> 01:06:11.795
if you looked at word
identities, for example.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.320
But in the effective
theory, these are just

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.650
put into a Wilson line, because
that's the leading order

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:26.080
way that they can
show up, but still we

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.680
have a gauge invariant answer.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.150
So the Wilson line is really
needed for the gauge symmetry.

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:39.490
And finally, the ultrasofts, as
can be clear from the notation,

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:41.290
the ultrasofts can
just as well include

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:46.680
the global transformation,
if you like.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.930
So we don't really need three.

01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:50.140
We could put the global
back with the ultrasofts.

01:06:57.450 --> 01:06:59.970
Then, we just have two.

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:01.590
All right.

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:03.030
So that's our symmetry.

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:06.000
That's an example
of how it works.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.415
Now, let's talk about
covariant derivatives.

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:32.410
So gauge symmetry ties
together regular derivatives

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:36.090
with the gauge field, and
here, what it ties together

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:37.090
at the following things.

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:46.980
So because of the treatment
of the A ultrasoft

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.980
field as a background,
it actually ties together

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:49.910
both of these things.

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:07.750
And then it does what you
expect in a collinear sector.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:11.620
It ties together the derivative
with the gauge field.

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.819
And if you're acting
on ultrasoft fields,

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:20.620
then there's an ultrasoft
covariant derivative

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:32.510
which is just like that.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.979
So now, you can ask
the question if I just

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:39.660
had this gauge
symmetry, which is going

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.038
to force me to use covariant
derivatives-- which I was

01:08:42.038 --> 01:08:43.830
already thinking ahead
to when I wrote down

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:45.439
the Lagrangian earlier.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:45.939
Right?

01:08:45.939 --> 01:08:48.420
We already wrote it in terms
of these kind of objects,

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.878
so it seems like
we're good to go.

01:08:49.878 --> 01:08:51.420
So you can ask the
question if I just

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.080
have power counting,
the cn that we

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.590
decided we're going to use, and
gauge symmetry, is that enough?

01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:59.250
Am I done?

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:02.053
Do I have everything I need for
the leading order Lagrangian?

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.200
So power counting told us that
we had this type of derivative,

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:35.810
and that we could have two
of these perp derivatives.

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:36.310
OK?

01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:38.435
So those are the two type
of terms we were getting.

01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:51.399
There's no other order lambda
squared field structures that

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:58.100
would have the right dimensions
and that could do the job.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.580
So these are really the only
two that we have to think about.

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.130
So you could try to
think about maybe

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:06.880
I can have something with some
additional n bars floating

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.450
around, but really,
it boils down--

01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:12.460
since you need to
get a lambda squared,

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.940
you need either two
perp derivatives.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.310
You need two of them, because
you still have a rotation

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:22.690
symmetry around the
direction of motion,

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:24.970
or you could have an n dot D.

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:35.110
But there is one operator
that is not rolled out,

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:40.860
by gauge symmetry alone,
and that is this operator.

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:53.325
When we wrote the operator, we
had D perp slash D perp slash.

01:10:53.325 --> 01:10:56.370
But nothing stops me from doing
something similar in some way

01:10:56.370 --> 01:11:02.590
by just taking the D perps and
contracting them, like that.

01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:05.290
That's a different operator
than the D perp slash D perp

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:08.380
operator that we got before.

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:12.140
Oops, only one of those.

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.640
OK?

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.230
So this operator is
a different operator.

01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:15.640
In a priori, you
could say, well,

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.800
do loop connections
generate this operator which

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.420
is different than the D perp
slash D perp slash operator.

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.743
The answer is no, actually,
but so far what we've done,

01:11:26.743 --> 01:11:27.910
it's not enough to see that.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:40.710
So we need actually this other
symmetry that I alluded to,

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:43.230
the reparameterization
invariance,

01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:45.000
and that will actually
rule out this guy.

01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:51.578
So what's RPI?

01:11:51.578 --> 01:11:53.120
Well, when we
formulated this theory,

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.280
we needed a direction
for the collinear line

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.380
or for the collinear particles.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.990
And then we needed an
auxiliary vector n bar,

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:01.550
and we formulated
the whole set up

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.710
in terms of this n and n bar.

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:06.320
But having vectors like
that that we write down,

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.140
that breaks Lorentz invariance
in the same way that

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:16.820
specifying v mu in HQET
breaks Lorentz invariance.

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.240
So if you say that m mu
nu is the set of Lorentz

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.760
transformations, the
usual six generators that

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:26.800
are anti-symmetric, then
the ones that are broken

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.730
are these ones.

01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:44.160
And there's five of them,
and the one that's not broken

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.260
is this one which corresponds
to rotations about the three,

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.110
axis with the axis
specified by n.

01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:07.710
OK?

01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:11.190
So those rotations would act
in the components of these guys

01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:12.840
that are 0, if you like.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.850
So there's no issue
there, and these guys

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:17.940
are the guys that are
connected to the pieces that

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.160
were non-0 in general.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.550
So there's going to be a
larger, because there's

01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:26.580
five things here and
because there's two vectors,

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.250
it's going to be a larger set
of reparameterization symmetries

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:29.792
than in HQET.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.120
First, talk about just the
n and n bar themselves.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.570
There's three types of
reparameterization invariance

01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:48.900
that would leave
n squared equals 0

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:53.450
and bar squared equals 0
and n dot n bar equals 2.

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:55.950
And those were the formulas
that we were using over and over

01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:57.210
again really.

01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:59.610
Everything else was
just convention.

01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:01.590
OK?

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:04.710
So what are those three types?

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:06.750
Well, we could take
n, and we could

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:10.290
change it by some amount
in the perp direction

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:12.690
and leave n bar unchanged.

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:15.300
And since n bar dot
something perp is 0,

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:21.900
that would satisfy this, or
we could do the opposite.

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.955
That would be type two.

01:14:23.955 --> 01:14:27.600
So don't change n,
and change n bar.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.920
And so this is two
transformations

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.020
there's two things specified
by this perp guy and two here.

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.790
And then there's one more
which is called three,

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:46.450
and this one let me
write it like this.

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:48.210
It's a simultaneous
transformation

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:54.960
of these two guys, where I just
do a multiplicative factor.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.460
Well, a multiplicative
factor is not

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.550
going to change the fact that's
the square of something 0.

01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:02.250
The place where the
normalization comes in

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:04.470
is this n dot n bar, and
if I just rescale them

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:09.550
both by an opposite amount, then
that remains satisfied as well.

01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:11.550
So I formulated this in
terms of an infinite--

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:15.120
I'm going to think about this is
an infinitesimal transformation

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.510
for delta perp, infinitesimal
for epsilon perp.

01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:20.160
I could also expand
this exponential

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.535
and think of it
as infinitesimal,

01:15:21.535 --> 01:15:24.010
but the finite one's easier.

01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:26.850
So let's just think of
the finite transformation

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:27.540
in the last one.

01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:33.220
Now, this is an
effective theory.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.220
So whenever we think
about transformations,

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.480
we should think
about power counting.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.040
We just spent a lot
of time thinking

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.690
about that for gauge
symmetry, and we should think

01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:41.275
about power counting here too.

01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:43.500
Did you have a question?

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:46.853 --> 01:15:47.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:53.790
So what I was just about to talk
about, how big things can be.

01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:58.980
So the power counting that's
the right power counting

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:01.860
for these guys, so these things
are infinitesimal or finite,

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:04.980
but they also have some counting
in a different space which

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:08.640
is the power counting space.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:13.330
And the right power counting
for these guys is as follows.

01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:16.200
So this means I can
make arbitrarily

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.410
large transformations in a
power counting sense of type

01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:21.000
two and type three.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:21.990
There's no constraint.

01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:25.650
That's what this means, so that
maybe that's easier to swallow.

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:28.290
This one, there is a
constraint, and the reason

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:31.116
that you can think of
there being a constraint,

01:16:31.116 --> 01:16:35.010
I can give you a simple
example, and then you'll

01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:37.580
see how you would derive
the other things as well.

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.735
So think of n dot
P. If you transform

01:16:39.735 --> 01:16:42.180
n dot P, that becomes n dot--

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.120
think of this is n mu, P mu.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:49.770
That becomes n mu, P mu
plus delta perp dot P perp.

01:16:52.432 --> 01:16:54.390
So this is order lambda
squared, so this better

01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:55.390
be order lambda squared.

01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:57.310
But this momentum
here is order lambda,

01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:59.602
so you need to have a power
counting for the delta perp

01:16:59.602 --> 01:17:01.890
that makes it of order lambda.

01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:04.625
In order to keep the transform
guy the same size as the guy

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:06.000
you started with,
because I don't

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.333
want to consider transformations
that would take me away

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.720
from my power counting,
that would violate it.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.490
So imposing that this thing
is of order lambda squared

01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:15.780
says that this is true.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:19.530
If you go through the same
logic for the other guys,

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:21.750
the n bar component
was order lambda 0,

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:24.430
so you can make the epsilon
perp of order lambda 0.

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:28.071
It doesn't cost you anything,
because there's no constraint.

01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:36.590
You're not making something
that would mess up

01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:37.596
the power counting.

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:47.340
All right.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.637
So what does this
correspond to physically?

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.660
So type three is
actually pretty simple.

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:57.460
Type three is like a
boost along-- if you

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.230
think about our
back-to-back vectors,

01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:01.450
type three is like
the analog of a boost,

01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:04.030
but you're transforming
it in the passive sense

01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:05.095
of transforming the axis.

01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:13.380
And what the outcome
is is very simple.

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:20.130
It just implies that any
operator that has an n

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:22.360
must have a corresponding
n bar sitting next

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.278
to it, effectively.

01:18:27.278 --> 01:18:28.570
So I'll give you some examples.

01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:33.570
So really, if you have--

01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:36.780
let's just say it this way--
if you have an n bar mu

01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:44.610
in the numerator, then you
either have a corresponding n

01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:51.070
in the numerator, or--

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:03.390
well, you have an n
bar in the denominator.

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:06.260
Since we could have n bars
in the denominator and that

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.730
was showing up in some places.

01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:10.040
Those are the two possible
ways of compensating

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.610
for the transformation.

01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:14.610
So it's just like a simple
counting that you have.

01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:24.370
So if you look at our lc
0, we had various terms.

01:19:24.370 --> 01:19:29.462
One of them was n bar slash
1 over i n bar over D.

01:19:29.462 --> 01:19:31.420
So here, we have an n
bar in both the numerator

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.370
and the denominator,
and that compensates

01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:34.840
for the transformation.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:40.030
And then in another term, we
had an n bar slash n dot D,

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:43.425
and then that again is invariant
in this type of transformation.

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:53.550
What about type one and two?

01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:57.460
So type one is the following.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.140
So think about these guys
as in this kind of language

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.720
they would be back to back.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.220
We're trying to
describe the physics

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:08.310
in this cone for the
collinear particles,

01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:12.360
and n was the vector that was
pointing inside that cone.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.750
What this is saying, type one,
is that I can rotate that guy,

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:18.895
and as long as I'm not
rotating it by too much--

01:20:18.895 --> 01:20:19.395
i.e.

01:20:19.395 --> 01:20:21.000
I'm rotating it
by a small amount

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.670
of order lambda,
which you can think

01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:25.980
of as staying inside the cone--

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.795
then I can describe
everything equally well

01:20:27.795 --> 01:20:29.670
by some other vector
that lives in that cone,

01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:32.760
and I can decompose the
momenta and the modes

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.820
in terms of that vector, and
it will work equally well.

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:37.320
OK.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.050
So that's what type one
is physically doing,

01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:43.260
and so you're not making a
large transformation here,

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.820
because you want to
still be inside the cone.

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.195
You still want something that's
pointing in the collinear

01:20:47.195 --> 01:20:48.030
direction.

01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:51.930
Type two is related to
the fact that this n bar

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:53.790
vector was just an
auxiliary vector that we

01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:54.838
used to decompose things.

01:20:54.838 --> 01:20:56.130
We didn't really care about it.

01:20:56.130 --> 01:21:03.810
It didn't have a strong
physical motivation.

01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:06.460
It was just needed because we're
using light cone coordinates.

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:10.485
So I can make a very large
transformation of that guy.

01:21:10.485 --> 01:21:13.942
So here's a large
transformation,

01:21:13.942 --> 01:21:15.150
and I can use some other guy.

01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:17.150
And we gave you an example
earlier, which was 3,

01:21:17.150 --> 01:21:20.670
2, 2, 1 as a possible
value for the n bar,

01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:22.710
and that's something
that you could think

01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:25.620
of getting to by a finite
type two reparameterization

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.520
transformation.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.020
OK?

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:32.070
So that's the picture for what
these transformations are,

01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:34.830
and we will finish up
talking about them next time

01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:38.400
and will show that actually this
additional term that we could

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.830
write down in the
Lagrangian is actually

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:44.660
ruled out reparameterization
symmetries.

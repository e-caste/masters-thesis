00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.180
I would now like to calculate
the potential function for two

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.560
other conservative
forces that we

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.380
encounter all the
time, spring forces

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.880
and gravitational forces.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.440
Will begin with spring forces.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.250
So first off, let's begin with
some type of coordinate system.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.990
Suppose we have a spring.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.400
We have a block.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
This is my point x
equilibrium, unstretched

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.800
length of the spring.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.620
And now whether we stretch
it or compress it here,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.880
I'll stretch it.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.210
I'll introduce a
coordinate function x.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.720
Union vector i, and
my spring force, f,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.030
is -kxi, where x can be
positive for a stretch spring,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.270
force is in the negative
i-hat direction.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.220
When x is negative,
negative times negative,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.120
means the spring force is in the
positive i-hat direction when

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.110
it's compressed.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.330
So this is a force
that's a restoring force,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.160
always back to equilibrium.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.340
This is an example of
a conservative force.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.030
And now let's calculate the
change in potential energy.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.730
And then introduce a
zero reference point

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.140
and get a potential
function for this force.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.380
So the first calculation
is straightforward.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.260
So, if we took our
displacement to be dx i-hat.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.950
And we take the
dot product of fds,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.440
we get dx i-hat dot
i-hat is 1, times dx.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.360
And that's just the x component
of the force displacement.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.180
And minus sign because the x
component of the force is -kx.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.320
And so now, if we were
to start our system,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.840
so, again, for
our initial state,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.410
let's say that the block from
the unstretched position,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.170
is stretched xi.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.500
And our final state, whether
it's stretched or compressed,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.970
it won't matter, but we'll just
stretch it out a little bit

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.540
more to x-final.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.780
So now let's
calculate the change

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.800
in potential energy between our
initial and our final states.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.840
Now, recall there's
a minus sign,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.780
because it's -w conservative.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.410
That's minus the integral
x-initial to x-final of -kxdx.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.620
We have 2 minus signs.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.360
That's our integration
variable, if you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.520
want to see all the detail.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.910
And when you simply
integrate x-prime dx-prime,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.130
you get x-prime squared over 2.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.220
And so the change in potential
energy between these two states

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:56.220
is 1/2 kx-final squared,
minus 1/2 kx-initial squared.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.410
And that's physically meaningful
if I take my system initially.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.820
And the system ends
up in the final state.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.580
Then what I'm calculating
is minus the work

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.150
done by the spring
force on the block

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.700
as it goes from the initial
state to the final state.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.280
I'm not talking about the
work that an external agent

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.320
does in stretching
or compressing it.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.430
This is explicitly the
work done by the spring

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.670
force on the block as it
goes from the initial state

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.440
to the final state.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.810
I introduced the minus
sign in our definition

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.340
of potential energy.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.730
And so this quantity
represents the negative

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.980
of the work done
by the spring force

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.550
as a system goes from the
initial to the final states.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.800
Now, you may have
already thought about it,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.370
but the reference point
that we're going to use

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.900
is x equals zero.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.740
The unstretched
length of the spring.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.210
And our reference potential
at that point will be zero.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.350
So our reference point is
actually the zero-point

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.200
for the potential.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.870
And then our arbitrary
state, we can call this

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.630
the referent state, if you like.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.680
That's probably better
than the reference point.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.430
Our arbitrary state will
be at some arbitrary

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.710
stretch or compress.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.440
And our potential
energy function,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.550
at that reference, minus
the potential energy

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.200
at the arbitrary state,
minus the reference state.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.990
Well, if we set xi equal
to 0 and x-final equal

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.720
to x, as we have
in this expression,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.290
we simply get 1/2 kx squared.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.300
So the potential energy function
equals our reference potential,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.790
plus 1/2 kx squared.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.150
And we have defined that our
reference potential to be zero,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.680
it could have been anything.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.060
But we're making it 0 so that
we get a nice function, 1/2 kx

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.430
square.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.460
And again, it's always
worthwhile to plot

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.120
that function.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.190
It's a nice parabola.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.370
U of x, x.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.560
And you can see down here,
that's our reference point.

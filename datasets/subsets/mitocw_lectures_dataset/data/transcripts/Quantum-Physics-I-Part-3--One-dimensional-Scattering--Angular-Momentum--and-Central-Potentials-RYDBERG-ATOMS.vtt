00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
PROFESSOR: What
is a Rydberg atom?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:11.520
Well, it's a-- an atom can be
a Rydberg atom if the outermost

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.860
electron is in a very high
principal quantum number.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.560
That's a definition
of a Rydberg atom.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.270
The last electron is an n--

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.880
little n, very large.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.530
Now that is very
interesting because when

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.400
that happens, Rydberg atoms--

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:49.300
when that happens, you have
a nucleus with charge ze

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.640
and you have lots of electrons.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.600
And the last electron--
suppose the last electrode

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.900
is in an orbit further out.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.379
You see the orbits do become
further out in general.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.250
And suppose the last electron
is in some large value

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.680
of little n, so
it's somewhat out.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.070
So here is the last electron.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.500
This electron sees a
nucleus with charge z,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.050
but it also sees z
minus 1 electrons, all

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.370
the other electrons.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.060
The last electron is outside
the nucleus and the cloud

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.590
of the other electrons.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:45.740
So the last electron sees
a charge plus 1 z from here

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:54.210
and z minus 1 of the electrons.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.020
So the last electron
sees charge 1.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.690
So in some sense, to
a good approximation,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.250
the last electron says, oh,
there's a hydrogen atom here.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.350
I'm part of a hydrogen atom.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.820
I don't see my friends.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.900
The other electrons are
too close to the nucleus.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.370
And I'm out there going
around as if I were hydrogen.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.540
So that's a very nice
application of hydrogen atoms.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.340
So the first question that
we want to understand,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.450
that it's, again conceptually,
is what is the size.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.795
If n is large what is
the size of the atom?

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.770
Now I must say, I
myself, when I look

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.830
at these things
after a few years

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.460
that I don't teach quantum
mechanics, I look at here

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.910
and say, OK, this
is the solution.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.820
Well, maybe the size is na0.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.150
Unfortunately, that's
completely wrong.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.070
And we're going to
try to explain what

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.690
was wrong in looking there.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.600
You know, you see your
hydrogen atom wave function.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.710
There's nothing like
really the size,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.940
there's no such precise
definition as the size.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.560
But you could say, what's the
expected value of the radius.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.470
That's a reasonable
definition of size.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.930
And you know from
this wave function,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:56.440
is going to come out to a0, a0
over 2, 2a0, maybe pi over 2a0.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.520
Something like that.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.470
So from here you
would say, well,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.780
it's going to come out to pi
and na0 or something like that.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.490
That is not true.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.500
So how do we see
that it's not true?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500
We'll take a little
time in a few minutes.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.670
But how can we get
the size of that atom

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.100
correctly in an intuitive way?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.700
Again, we want to
just understand

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.220
a few results
about hydrogen atom

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.750
that become part
of your intuition.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.285
So the important result
here is the virial theorem.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.450
Now whenever I think of
the virial theorem I say,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.750
oh, there was a factor
of 2 or a 1/2 there.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.560
How did it go?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.365
It takes me a few seconds to try
to reconstruct that it's this.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.590
For the hydrogen system,
for any 1 over r potential,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.230
there is this relation
within the expectation

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.160
value of the kinetic energy,
the potential energy.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.200
You've seen that result
probably a couple of times

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.550
already in this course.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.070
Because it's a real
important result.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.920
It looks like OK, just a
theorem about these things.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.330
But the intuition
is really important.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.280
So how does one remember
or picture that?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.930
One way is the following.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.800
And that's the way I like it.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.620
I imagine the energy line here.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.570
And here is 0.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.980
And the one thing I
remember is that, yes,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.930
there is a kinetic energy here.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.480
And actually the
bound state energy

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.390
is exactly the same,
but the opposite.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.320
That's a way to remember that.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.240
That's really what is going on.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.500
That's the key thing.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.710
The kinetic energy and
the bound state energy

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.120
are just of opposite signs.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.730
Why do we see that?

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.350
Because then we have that
V, from this equation,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.880
is minus 2T.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:37.720
And if V is minus 2T, means
that T plus V is T minus 2T.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.620
And T plus V is
the total energy.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:49.610
So T plus V is equal
to the total energy

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.750
E of the bound state.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.340
For any stationary
state, this is true.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:04.910
And this thing, given this
condition, is minus T.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.630
So that's the way
we think of it.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:16.350
So we then have a nice result
because the expectation value

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:27.510
of the potential would then be
minus 2 times the expectation

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:37.510
value of T, which is
itself minus the energy.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.420
So you have a minus 2
times minus the energy.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.020
And it's equal to the energy.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.070
And this is correct.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.630
The expectation value
of V is the energy

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.140
and the expectation
value of Eb is negative,

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.180
and the energy's negative.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.140
So what is this?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:06.330
This is the expectation value
of minus e squared over r.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.030
In fact, of-- yeah,
I'll leave it like that.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.110
So I'm back to z
equal 1, because we're

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.710
talking about Rydberg atoms.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.370
Oh, 2Eb, I'm sorry, here.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.420
Thank you.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.590
OK, so expectation value of
the potential we have here.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.590
And 2 times the energy--

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.240
yeah, I would have
gotten this wrong.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.570
Thanks for correcting
it before it

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.280
did damage to the derivation.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:48.100
We have it there, e squared
over 2a0, 1 over n squared.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.730
So what can we cancel?

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.870
Well, the 2's cancel.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.670
The e squares cancel.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.920
The signs cancel.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.080
And we get expectation
value of 1 over r

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:12.680
is equal to 1 over
n squared a0, which

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:20.830
is suggesting very clearly that
the typical radius is not na0.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.220
It's n square a0.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.870
So this is exact.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.000
The virial theorem is exact.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.200
The energy is exact.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.570
This is exact.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.720
That's not quite the
expectation value of r.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.260
The expectation
value of r is not

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.410
the inverse of the
expectation value of 1 over r.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.260
It's somewhat related.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.330
But there's no theorem,
because it would be false,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.110
that the expectation value
of 1 over a random variable

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.644
is the expectation value of--

00:09:59.644 --> 00:10:03.750
is 1 over the expectation
value of the random variable.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.240
It's just not true.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.380
This nice result for 1
over r is exactly true.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.480
And it's l independent.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:22.650
On the other hand, the
expectation value of r

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.630
can be calculated with
a bit more effort--

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.700
a lot more effort.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.660
And it's equal to this.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.720
It's just the same thing and
1, with a little correction,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.635
which is 1/2 1 minus l times
l plus 1 over n squared.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:53.550
So actually, the expectation
value of r in the hydrogen atom

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.010
is l dependent.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.290
Not terribly strongly l
dependent, but somewhat l

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.460
dependent.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:10.180
To get an idea, this is equal
to n squared a0 times 3/2

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.790
for l equals 0.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.680
When l is equal to 0, you see
this whole bracket becomes 3/2.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:30.920
And for the maximum l, l equals
n minus 1, this is roughly 1.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.780
This is roughly 0, to a good
approximation but not exactly.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.920
It becomes n squared
a0 with corrections

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.790
that are very, very small.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.364
It's pretty accurate.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.880
All right.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.360
So, first thing we've
learned is that we

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.250
got a radius, expected radius,
that goes back n squared a0.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.680
So it's kind of
interesting to see

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:07.830
what went wrong if
you would have thought

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.470
with a form of the solution.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:20.395
So psi nlm equal Ar to
the l Wnl, a polynomial,

00:12:20.395 --> 00:12:28.360
e to the minus r over
na0 Ylm of theta and phi

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:37.840
or fnl of r times Ylm
of the solid angle.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.490
And what do we know
about this polynomial?

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:49.430
It's of degree n minus l plus 1.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.130
That's it.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.705
And it depends on r.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.840
So what we're looking at is
what was the error in thinking

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.130
that the typical r was na0.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.560
And you see, when you
make a mistake like this--

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.630
the mistake I made of saying
oh, na0 must be right--

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.350
and you find that it's
wrong, it's very important

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.420
to go back and learn why did
you get the wrong answer.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.240
That's what we're doing now.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.170
So the one question
I can ask to begin

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:34.000
with is what is a
probability density

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.470
to find the electron between
some radius r and a radius r

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:49.850
plus dr. So, you know,
this is a probability.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.290
And it depends on theta and phi.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.740
And it's very complicated.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.460
How about giving
me a probability

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.020
along r that they can
integrate along r and visualize

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.270
how this is dependant on r?

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.980
So the probability to find
the electron in this shell

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:17.260
must be equal to the value
of the wave function squared

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.220
times the volume element.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.500
And the volume
element here is psi

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:29.480
squared r squared dr times--

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.580
you would say 4 pi, but it's
not spherically symmetric.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:41.120
So you have to integrate
over solid angle.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.130
That is the volume element.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.920
And since I have to
integrate over solid angle,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.650
I must have psi squared here.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.120
So that's the right equation.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.510
If you want to make
things look perfect,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:01.150
put the d cubed x before
the psi squared here.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.700
And the problem is
that the d cubed

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.080
x is big enough that it, in some
sense, has partial integrals.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:15.450
The So notation is not
perfect, but somehow you

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.090
must imagine this
whole volume element

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:24.660
that is still infinitesimal but
involves some integral already.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.370
So you have this.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:37.030
And you get then r
squared dr fnl squared

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:43.158
and you have the integral, the
omega of this Y star lm Ylm.

00:15:46.014 --> 00:15:52.120
And that integral is exactly 1.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.020
Spherical harmonics
are normalized.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.330
So now I can cancel
the dr. And I

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.680
get that the radial
probability distribution, which

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:12.105
is a nice concept, is really
r squared fnl of r squared.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.940
Radial probability.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:28.210
So our mistake-- my
mistake must have

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:34.780
been that I didn't include
all that was relevant.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.760
The exponential is one part.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.350
But there is the polynomial.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.730
And the polynomial must
be causing the trouble.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:50.780
Indeed, that's
what is happening.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:58.300
Let's look at fnl from
the top blackboard.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:05.579
That includes r to the
l times that polynomial.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:08.200
And it's a polynomial
of that degree.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:20.770
So it begins like a0 plus
up to coefficient a prime r

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:25.470
to the n minus l plus--

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.329
well, minus l minus 1.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.370
And then I have the exponential.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.920
OK.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.120
Now I cannot do this--

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.440
I don't want to do this
calculation exactly.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.710
It's too complicated.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:57.580
So let's ignore the lower
part of the polynomial.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.200
And we're thinking the radius
is going to be reasonably big.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.090
So it's a reasonable
idea to keep

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:09.130
the power of the polynomial
that is the largest.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.400
So what is the largest?

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.540
And here you see a
nice thing, actually r

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.360
to the l times this polynomial
is a polynomial that

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.860
begins with r to
the l and finishes

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.136
with r to the n minus 1.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:31.980
So it has like equal
number of terms as reaches

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.020
a value of n minus 1.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:39.090
The last term in the polynomial,
when you multiply it in,

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.990
this begins like r to
the l and the last term

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.040
is r to the n minus 1.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.570
So let's take this
to be proportional

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:54.480
to r to the n minus 1
equal to minus r na0.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.410
And here is the fight that
actually changes the answer.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.370
Because this is fnl.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:14.080
So actually I can write
p of r is proportional up

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.640
to a constant of normalization,
and the approximation

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:26.010
they have then r squared
times this polynomial squared.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.490
But I'm taking the last
term of the polynomial,

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:34.820
so we get r to the 2n e
to the minus 2r over na0.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.682
That's a probability
distribution.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.990
And with this
probability distribution,

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.080
then you see what's
happening is that there

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.510
is a fight between
an exponential that

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:58.420
has a typical length where it
decays to half its value, that

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.700
is related to na0
but the maximum

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.170
is delayed because it's
multiplied by a function

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:13.630
that the higher the value of n,
the slower it is to take off.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.920
x squared or r squared
takes off slower than r,

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.340
takes of slower
than r to the 4th.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:27.250
So here you have a thing
that just grows like that,

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.550
but it takes
forever to take off.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.920
And the result of this is a
function that just picks up

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.200
at some point over here.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.300
And we want to find the maximum.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:47.520
So the maximum comes
from taking a derivative.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:55.590
So the maximum of p
of r is determined

00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:00.690
by setting the derivative
of this equal to 0.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:09.900
So you get 2n over r times
the same r to the 2n e

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.830
to the minus 22 over na0.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.480
So the first term,
the derivative

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.460
is 2r and r to the 2n
minus 1, which is divided

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.220
by r and the same thing.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.470
The second derivative
gives you minus 2 over na0.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.350
And that's it.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:41.670
So from these two you get that
n over r is equal to 1 over na0.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:54.320
So r equals n squared
a0, as we had predicted.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.690
So it's the interplay
of the polynomial

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:03.390
with the other thing that
makes the radius go very high.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:10.170
So what about this
Rydberg atoms in nature?

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.930
Well, they've been observed
in interstellar gases.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.500
You see, there was this
phenomenon of recombination

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.530
when protons captured electrons
as the universe cooled off,

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.800
and formed hydrogen atoms.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.360
And that recombination
sometimes works in such a way

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.380
that the proton can
capture an electron.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.160
And it captures it in a
very high quantum number.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.970
And it keeps happening as
we observe this electron.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:56.030
So people have observed in
astrophysics n equal 350.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.790
And [INAUDIBLE] here the
electron being captured,

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:05.170
just not in the usual size but
almost a million times bigger.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:12.970
So what happens for this
thing r is equal 0.53 times

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.930
10 to the minus 10 meters.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.050
That's a0.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:23.150
And then you have 350 squared.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.023
And that gives you 6.5 microns.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.750
That's actually pretty big.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.340
A blood cell is 8 microns.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:45.660
A red blood cell is 8 microns.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.580
They are not stable because
eventually they spiral in.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:55.090
But if you have an atom
that, for example, has

00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:00.630
an n equal to 5, it jumps
to n equals to 1 in 10

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.320
to the minus 7 seconds.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.650
These atoms are rather stable.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:08.670
Instead of lasting 1/10 of
a millionth of a second,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.450
they can last a millisecond,
1/10 of a second,

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.300
sometimes even 1 second.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.900
It takes a long time
to go down that spiral.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:25.890
The energy levels-- if you have
energies that go like 1 over n

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:31.590
squared, the energy levels,
the separation between them,

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.720
goes like 1 over n cubed.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.460
So lots and lots
of states there.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.370
And it takes a long time for it
to decay from one to another.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:47.680
So they observe them in
the lab in different ways.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.720
They create them
with lasers now.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.840
You have the outermost
electron, you kick it

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.980
to another orbit with one--

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.410
they use three lasers.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.780
In the lab at MIT, three lasers.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.200
One and two to kick
it to an n equal 10,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.370
and then the third one to
kick it to n equals 60.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.680
And they detect those
atoms by ionization.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.590
A normal atom, you can't ionize.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.060
You would need millions
of volts per centimeter

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.570
to ionize it with
an electric field.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.140
These atoms you can
ionize very easily.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.910
So they can see that they've
been created that way.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:37.290
So also in terms of sizes,
the diameter of hair

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:41.010
is about 50 microns.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.330
Hair is very thin.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.340
But you see it.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.240
So you're about a
factor of 5 or 10

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.140
to being able to see that
atom with your naked eye.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.520
It's pretty impressive.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.775
Incredible, in fact.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:04.320
So a nice laboratory, those are
almost semi-classical atoms.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.440
All what Bohr was
doing of calculating,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.060
you can derive this
law by assuming

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.680
that the transitions between
orbits in the hydrogen atom

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.400
emit photons of the
right frequency.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.180
It's all kinds of fun things.

WEBVTT

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:17.740
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.710
So today, we're going to
talk about immunity again.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.100
And so this movie up
on the screen here--

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.330
this is a cell.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.705
You can see the outline of
the cells kind of around here.

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:33.933
That's the outline of the cell.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.350
But what you can
see is that there

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.740
is something in the
cell moving around,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.450
and that is an intracellular
bacteria called listeria.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.020
And you can see it's
rocketing around in this cell.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.110
It's having a total
party in this cell,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.110
and what you'll see here is you
can often see the bacteria push

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.753
out from the cell.

00:00:57.753 --> 00:00:59.920
So if you look here, one
is going to push right now.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.580
See?

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.163
There it goes.

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:03.520
And it kind of runs into
the edge of the cell

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.380
and pushes out, and this
enables the bacteria

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.950
to spread from cell to
cell without actually going

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.790
into the extracellular space
surrounding the cells, OK?

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.390
So let's take a
hypothetical situation.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.360
So listeria is a
foodborne illness.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.570
It causes a nasty sort
of intestinal disease.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.490
So Brett, do you want
these bacteria having

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.600
a party in your cells?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.950
AUDIENCE: Unlikely.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.010
PROFESSOR: Hell no.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.710
OK, Malik, do you want
these bacteria having

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.840
a party in your cells?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.010
Hell no.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.890
Carmen, do you
want these bacteria

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.390
having a party in your cells?

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.230
AUDIENCE: Hell no.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.140
PROFESSOR: Hell no!

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.640
Yes.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.310
OK, so our body has to have
some way to sort of address

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.030
this type of an
illness, and the problem

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.440
is if you're thinking about what
we discussed on Wednesday, is--

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.940
all right.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.220
So you're hosting
this party, right?

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.840
This is your cell.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.670
So you have a host cell--

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.000
that's your cell-- and you
have an intracellular pathogen,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.360
such as a bacteria or it
could also be a virus,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.660
and they're essentially
using your generous host

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.240
cell to reproduce
itself to spread

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.790
to other cells of the body.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.330
And so you don't want that,
but the problem is that--

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.070
I told you about B cells,
so remember B cells--

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.740
they have an antigen receptor.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.520
It's initially on
their plasma membrane.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.740
It can also be secreted,
and it's secreted

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.030
into the extracellular space.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.410
The problem is that these
pathogens are inside the cell,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.700
and there's a plasma
membrane separating them

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.950
from the antigen receptors that
you need to recognize them, OK?

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.050
So this presents an issue.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.270
It's also the case for T
cells, because as you heard

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.440
on Wednesday, T cells only
have this membrane-bound form

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.900
of the receptor, and the antigen
recognition domains of all

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.640
of these are extracellular,
so there is really--

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.390
with just this system, there's
no way for your immune cells

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.490
to see in the cells.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.650
So today, I want
to talk about how

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.040
is it that the immune
cells are able--

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.460
how our immune cells are
able to see within the cell

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.340
in order to address an infection
like this one, with listeria.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.480
OK?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.180
And the first part
of the answer is

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.610
that it involves a process
known as antigen presentation.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.640
And antigen presentation
is the process

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.140
by which peptides, so short
sequences of amino acids,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.250
are presented and displayed
on the surface of the cell

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.990
for the immune system--

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.580
for immune cells to see.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:50.080
So here, peptides are
displayed on the cell surface

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.730
for immune cells to see them.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.810
And in this specific case, it's
going to be for the T cells

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.060
to observe what's going
on inside the cell, OK?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.360
So this mechanism
involves another molecule,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.840
which I briefly introduced.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:21.280
It's called the major
histocompatibility complex,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.070
which is abbreviated MHC.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.420
So when I referred to MHC
in Wednesday's lecture,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.810
I was referring to this major
histocompatibility complex.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.920
And there are two
classes of MHCs.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.620
Thankfully, the first
one is known as class 1,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:52.600
so class 1 MHC, and class
1 MHC looks like this.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.810
Like many of the
immune receptors

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.250
that I've talked about,
it has a heavy chain,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.150
which is this long
polypeptide light blue,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.630
and it has a light
chain in purple.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.430
So the MHC is composed of these
two separate polypeptides.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.830
They're encoded by
different genes,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.100
and then it assembles into
this structure shown here.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.720
So this molecule
has two Ig domains,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.450
and these are proximal
to the plasma membrane.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.850
And this thing is all inserted
in the plasma membrane.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.780
It's an integral
membrane protein.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.780
And then distal to
the plasma membrane

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.390
is this structure
here, and if you

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.330
look at the crystal structure,
it's kind of like a sheet--

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.710
a beta sheet with
two alpha helices.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.130
And altogether what it does
is it basically creates,

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.890
like, a little cup, OK?

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.590
So it's creating, like, a cup.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.690
And what sits in this cup is a
peptide, so you get peptides,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.560
and the peptides sort of sit
in that hand, if you will.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.540
And some of the amino acids from
that peptide are sticking out

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.750
and they're sort of displayed
away from the MHC molecule.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.700
So this is basically a hand
that holds peptides and displays

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.440
them on the outside
of the cell, right?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.990
So the outside of
the cell here is up.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.300
This would be the
exoplasm out here,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.090
and it's displaying these
peptides for immune cells

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.575
like T cells to observe.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.340
All right.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.660
So class 1 MHC is a
class that's expressed

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:48.350
on all nucleated
cells in your body.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.320
So that's all of
your nucleotide cells

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.370
are synthesizing
in a class 1 MHC,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.660
and then it's sort of being
displayed on the surface.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.470
And the peptides that are
held by this class 1 MHC--

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.620
the peptides here
are being derived

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.720
from a specific place in the
cell, which is the cytoplasm.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.990
So the peptides are
from the cytoplasm,

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:27.170
so this is the source
of the peptides,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.610
and I'll tell you how these
peptides are sort of loaded

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.890
on to this MHC molecule.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.919
So the MHC molecule
is a membrane protein,

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:45.050
so it's translated on the
endoplasmic reticulum,

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.780
and its extracellular
domain is initially

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.170
present in the lumen of the ER.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.150
And the peptides
are from proteins

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.520
that are present
in the cytoplasm,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.920
and what happens
to these proteins--

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.890
and this occurs for
unfolded proteins,

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.150
but also for proteins that
might be ubiquitinated--

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.420
is that they're processed
by the proteasome, which

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:14.990
is this kind of a shredder-like
function for proteins,

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.300
and it cuts up the proteins into
little snippets, or peptides,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.960
that can then be pumped
into the lumen of the ER

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.000
through this transporter, TAP.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.970
So these peptides can
be taken and transported

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.340
into the lumen of
the ER, and that's

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.570
where they're loaded onto
the class 1 MHC molecule.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.570
But the source peptides
is from proteins

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.100
that are in the cytoplasm.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.520
They're processed
by the proteasome.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.390
So then, once you have
a peptide-MHC complex,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.090
it can then be trafficked
through the normal vesicle

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.780
trafficking pathway all the
way out to the plasma membrane

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.440
of the cell where now that
peptide will be displayed

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.040
for T cells to observe.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.180
And so the peptides
here, they're

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.470
processed by the proteasome--

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.670
processed or cut
by the proteasome--

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.440
and then the type
of T cell that's

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.190
going to look at these
class 1 molecules--

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.970
they are known as seeds
CD8 positive T cells.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.350
So this is the first
class of MHC molecule.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.170
Because there is a
class 1, that means

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.740
there also must be a
class 2, which there is.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:49.730
And so class 2 MHCs are
fundamentally different in all

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.840
of these properties.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.310
The function shared
by these MHC molecules

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.670
is they both display peptides
on the surface of the cell.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:08.660
So MHC molecules
do display peptides

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.190
on the surface, which is
known as antigen presentation.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.320
But other than that, MHC
class 2 is pretty different.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.170
You see the structure
of MHC class 2

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.920
is very similar to
that of class 1,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.080
but you see that
rather than having

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.030
a heavy and a light
chain, here there

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.320
are two chains that are
roughly of equal size.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.550
And so these are encoded
by different genes

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:42.350
than the class 1 molecule, and
they encode different proteins.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:47.760
But the overall structural
similarity is very similar,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.640
so there are two
Ig domains, they're

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.910
proximal to the plasma
membrane, and then there's

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:58.250
this structure at the very
end of the MHC molecule,

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.560
which has this
groove in it which

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.110
can hold a peptide
that would be displayed

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.390
on the surface of the cell.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.410
And there, you see the groove
and you see the peptide

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.610
that is present in it.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:18.170
All right, so one big difference
between class 1 and class 2

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.640
is that class 2 is expressed
on a much more restricted set

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.990
of cells.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:29.030
So class 2 MHCs are expressed
specifically on specialized

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:38.120
cells known as
antigen-presenting cells,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.040
and these antigen presenting
cells include cells like B

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.230
cells, which are the ones
that I'll focus on, but also

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:53.300
phagocytic that can phagocytose
foreign substances--

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:04.280
phagocytic cells-- and
there's another cell type

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.500
called the dendritic
cell, which is also

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.270
an antigen-presenting cell.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.880
I'm going to focus
on the B cells.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.730
So class 1 is
expressed everywhere.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.760
Class 2 is really expressed
on these professional

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.290
antigen-presenting cells.

00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.660
And the way that the peptides--

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.960
the source of the peptides
and the way they're generated

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.270
is also very different.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:37.700
So peptides for class 2 come
from the extracellular space,

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.020
and they are processed
by lysosomal proteases.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.720
And so I'll show you how
that looks in cartoon form.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.810
So for MHC class
2, the peptides are

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.420
from the extracellular space.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.590
And so we've talked
about ways that cells

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.030
can take in material.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.400
One way is through
endocytosis, right?

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.950
So if this is my
antigen, the antigen

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.600
could be endocytosed
by the cell,

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:26.300
and now it's in a vesicle
that's present in the cell.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.360
And so if you
endocytose this protein,

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.500
then it's now in a vesicle,
and one compartment

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.660
that it can go to
is the lysosome,

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.840
where are these there are
these lysosomal proteases they

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.840
can then chop up this
protein into little snippets,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.370
or peptides.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.140
And so MHC class 2,
again, is translated

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.820
at the end of
endoplasmic reticulum,

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.815
like all plasma
membrane proteins.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.470
But in the
endoplasmic reticulum,

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.740
you see the peptide
groove is blocked such

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.770
that peptides derived
from the cytoplasm

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.490
can't interact with
class 2, but then

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.870
is trafficked to a unique
compartment which can combine

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.100
with the compartment that has
the peptides that originated

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.990
from outside the cell.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.700
And then those can get loaded
onto this class 2 MHC molecule,

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.970
and then this can be
recognized by T cells.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.884
But in this case, it is a--

00:15:28.884 --> 00:15:30.980
oh, I endocytosed my chalk.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.230
I need to get it back.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.110
Here.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:38.630
So in this case, it's not a CD8
T cell that's recognizing it,

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.670
but a CD4 positive T cell.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.640
OK, so let me briefly review
what I just went through,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.840
and review the differences
between class 1 and class 2.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.010
So class 1 MHC is expressed
on all nucleated cells,

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.290
whereas class 2 is
much more restricted,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.385
being expressed specifically
on antigen-presenting cells.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.940
The T cells that recognize
these two classes are different.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.570
Class 1's recognized by
CD8 positive T cells.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:20.060
Class 2 is recognized
by CD4 positive T cells.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.570
And the source of the antigen
is different in these two cases.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.980
The source of the antigen
for class 1 is the cytoplasm.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.090
For class 2, it's the
extracellular space.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.030
So the different MHCs are
sampling different sort

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.330
of pools of proteins.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.820
And where the
peptide is loaded is

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.680
distinct between
these two, which

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.680
allows these distinct
classes to basically

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.500
discriminate between the
sources of the peptides

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.090
that they're loading.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.280
So for class 1,
that's in the ER.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.600
For class 2, it arises
from a vesicle compartment

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.380
that results from
endocytosis of an antigen

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.670
from outside the cell.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:07.440
All right.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.640
Now, the type of molecule
that recognizes this MHC

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:18.950
peptide complex is the T cell
receptor, which I briefly

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.290
outlined on Wednesday,
but now we're

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.290
going to talk about it
in much more detail.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:30.180
So the T cell receptor, or TCR--

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.250
and I talked about its structure
which is shown up on the slide,

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.620
but I'll just draw
more simply here.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.070
If this is the plasma membrane,
this is the cytoplasm,

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.900
and this is the
exoplasm facing down,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.200
then this T cell
receptor has two chains.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.370
One is called the alpha
chain, and the second

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.495
is called the beta chain.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.590
And each is comprised
of two Ig domains,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.930
which you see up there.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.830
So the T cell receptor
here is in pink.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.740
You can see an Ig domain
there on one strand--

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.990
Ig domain there.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:18.650
And you have another two Ig
domains on the other subunit,

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.800
and this receptor,
the T cell receptor,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:27.470
recognizes antigens through its
variable domain, which is here.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.580
And it's binding basically
to the end of this receptor,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.990
so this is a sort of ribbon
diagram of a structure for a T

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.040
cell receptor.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.270
The plasma membrane
would be up here.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.930
This is the end of
the T cell receptor.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.740
And MHC is in green, and
it's holding a peptide here

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.100
in yellow.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.190
And you can see how the TCR is
sort of interacting or docking

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.290
to this MHC-peptide complex.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:04.920
So for the T cell receptor
to interact and bind to MHC,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.070
you have to have a
T cell receptor that

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.290
recognizes the
specific conformation

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.830
of the peptide that is
being sort of extended away

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.480
from the cell.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.510
So let's say this is
my T cell receptor,

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.210
and I'm going around and
searching for cells that

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.100
might want to look at this.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.880
Then if I had a T cell
receptor that was like this,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.100
it's not going to
be able to stick

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.610
to this MHC-peptide complex.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.420
However, if I had a
T cell receptor that

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.270
had the right
conformation, because there

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.560
are different types
of T cell receptors,

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.650
it might be able to dock on
and stick to the peptide,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:49.880
and then the T cell is now stuck
to the peptide-MHC complex, OK?

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.040
So there are different
T cell receptors.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.470
There's a diversity
of T cell receptors,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:58.280
and they're able to discriminate
between different peptides

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.255
loaded onto MHC.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.680
OK, so now, we have to think
about where this diversity of T

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.180
cell receptors comes from.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.130
There's a diversity of
TCRs, and lucky for you,

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.610
the mechanism that generates
the diversity of TCRs

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.470
is the same that generates
diversity for antibodies.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.320
Now, Georgia asked a really
good and really important

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.750
question at the end of
lecture on Wednesday,

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.820
which is-- she asked if
this sort of rearrangement

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:44.430
of gene segments in the
variable domain of the antibody

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:49.340
was due to splicing
or recombination

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.480
at the genomic locus.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.610
And the answer is that
it's recombination

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:58.270
at the genomic locus, and
that's a very important point.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.920
So here's a diagram for
the beta chain of the TCR.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.290
You can see that like
the B cell receptor,

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.820
there's a gene rearrangement
in the genomic DNA that

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.490
brings V, D, and J
segments together to make

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.510
the variable chain of
the T cell receptor.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:24.930
So like the B cell receptor,
there is a gene rearrangement,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:33.330
also known as VDJ
recombination, and this is not

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.310
splicing of the transcript.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.110
This is in the genomic DNA--

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.890
a very important point,
because by having

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.250
this happen in the
genomic DNA, it

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.810
creates an irreversible
change in that genomic DNA

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.330
such that all
subsequent cells that

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:55.050
are derived from that
original B or T cell

00:21:55.050 --> 00:22:00.480
are going to express the
identical B or T cell receptor.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.850
So it's not splicing,
but it's a real sort

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.150
of irreversible change
to the genomic DNA.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:14.070
So you have a diversity of T
cell receptors, but the T cell

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.100
receptor is not
the only thing that

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:22.500
enables the T cell to
interact with whatever cell

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.060
is presenting the antigen. There
are these other co-receptors

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.070
which are important.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.680
So there are co-receptors
on the T cell--

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.000
this is on the T cell--

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:44.250
and the co-receptors
are CD4 and CD8,

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.845
and they're expressed on
different subsets of T cells.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.960
And these co-receptors--
because it's not sufficient

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.370
for just the T cell
receptor to interact

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:02.490
with a specific peptide,
it also requires

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.630
this co-receptor in order
to get an immune response.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.640
So the logic is
that if the T cell

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:15.660
receptor and the co-receptor
both bind to the MHC,

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.340
then you get a particular type
of response, so you need both.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:27.810
And CD4 cells recognize
the class 2 of MHC.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:37.475
CD8 recognizes class 1 MHC.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:50.880
So you have these two
different subsets of T cells

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.850
and they recognize these
distinct MHC complexes.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.600
So my question for you is what
should these CD8 positive T

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.410
cells do?

00:24:04.295 --> 00:24:05.670
To help with that,
you might want

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.840
to look at where the
peptides are coming from that

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.610
are presented on the class 1
MHCs, which are going to be

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.600
presenting specifically to CD8.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.650
So what should these do?

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:31.670
What does it mean if you have a
class 1 MHC molecule containing

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.890
a peptide that looks foreign?

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.470
Well, where do the
peptides come from?

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.000
What's that, Patricia?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.940
Patricia is right.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.700
They're coming from the cytosol.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.120
So if you have foreign elements
coming from the cytosol,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.940
what might that
mean for that cell?

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.250
Good, bad, irrelevant?

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.090
What's that?

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:01.112 --> 00:25:02.070
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.210
OK, Brett's saying it
needs to be dealt with,

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.690
and I totally agree.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.920
Here's one scenario--
would be the scenario

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.960
I showed you in the
beginning of class

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.110
where you have some sort
of intracellular parasite

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.460
that is basically using the host
cell for its own evil purposes

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:22.350
to produce more viruses
or more bacteria.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:27.780
So if the immune cell has
some sort of indication

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.760
that this is going wrong,
another example is in cancer,

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.450
because if you have oncogenic
mutations in certain genes,

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.520
then those could be
recognized as foreign.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.540
And so an appropriate
response might

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.300
be to do something to
that cell that would limit

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.820
the expansion of the tumor.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.880
Or in the case of an
intracellular parasite,

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.030
you really need to
terminate the cell

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.360
so that you stem the tide
of viruses that are going

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.210
to be produced by that cell.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.410
So the response
should be to kill.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.950
So it was CD8 positive.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.755
If you have a CD8
positive T cell,

00:26:13.755 --> 00:26:17.400
it indicates there's something
wrong inside that cell,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.750
and the response
should be to kill it.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.020
And these CD8 positive
T cells are known

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:33.175
as killer or cytotoxic T cells.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:42.080
So what happens if a CD8
positive T cell recognizes

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.270
a MHC class 1 peptide
complex, then it

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:52.070
releases materials from inside
it that perforate that cell

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.040
and lead it to
undergo cell death.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.050
So it's a way of
limiting an infection

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:01.430
by killing the cells that
the virus or pathogen is

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.540
using to reproduce itself.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.230
OK, what about CD4 positive?

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.390
What should be the response
of a CD4 positive T cell?

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.630
Should it also kill?

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:24.240
Should be like the T-1000?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.160
No one gets my
cultural references.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.880
Yeah.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.100
Should it be the Terminator 2?

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.330
No.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:31.830
Yes or no?

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.180
Who thinks it should terminate?

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.850
OK.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.885
Steven, can you
tell us your logic?

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:43.690
Why should it not terminate?

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.400
AUDIENCE: Because
it's a [INAUDIBLE] B

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.460
cell from the same [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.030
PROFESSOR: What are
the MHC class 2 cells?

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.693
AUDIENCE: Like, a B
cell or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:56.693 --> 00:27:57.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.902
It's not only a B
cell, it's a B cell

00:27:58.902 --> 00:28:01.477
that recognizes
the foreign agent

00:28:01.477 --> 00:28:02.560
that you're infected with.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.185
Yeah, Brett?

00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:08.280
AUDIENCE: So those B cells
are antigen presenting cells.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.528
They have the information
about what is bad

00:28:10.528 --> 00:28:13.200
or what is wrong in
probably other cells?

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.250
So like, oh, hey, we
have this information.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.700
You should go and mobilize.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.200
PROFESSOR: They're
binding something

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.560
that it recognizes as foreign,
internalizing it, and then

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.500
presenting bits of
that foreign element

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.610
on the outside of itself.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.440
AUDIENCE: Shoots the messenger.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:27.870
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.610
It's shooting the
messenger, exactly.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.630
Yeah.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:36.580
So it would be an extremely
bad idea for the CD4 positive T

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.930
cell to kill what's
presenting the antigen,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.100
because you would kill the
exact cell that you would need

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.960
to fight that antigen, right?

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.500
Here you have a B cell.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.730
It would be a B cell that's
producing an antibody that

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.980
actually can produce
antibodies that

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.790
might be able to neutralize
that foreign invader,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.950
and so you don't
want to kill it.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.880
You want to help it or
enhance the B cell function.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:19.260
And so these CD4 positive cells
are known as helper T cells,

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.000
and they enhance B cell function
in a number of different ways.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Oh, I should point out
where this happens.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.630
So this sort of interaction
between B and T cells

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.740
happens in the lymph node,
because in the lymph node,

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.280
you have antigen-presenting
cells, or even

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.970
soluble antigens, coming
into these lymph nodes.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.400
And you also have B
and T cells, and this

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.670
is kind of like the
B and T cell hangout

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.820
to get sort of, like,
interactions between these two

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.920
distinct immune cell types.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.920
And when you get
sort of a B cell

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.580
that presents an antigen
that's recognized by a T cell,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.760
then the T cell enhances
B cell function,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.040
and it does so in a
number of different ways.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.440
The first way that it induces
a response in the B cell,

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.480
known as affinity maturation.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:26.340
And this affinity maturation
results from a hypermutation

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.250
of the variable domain
of the antibody such

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.950
that you get even more
diversity, and such

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.390
that a B cell can be selected
that even has a tighter binding

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.670
to the antigen.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.550
So for affinity
maturation, this is

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:46.500
responsible for the
transition in binding

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.980
from a more weak binding
to a tighter binding,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.950
which I talked about
as being a difference

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.610
between the primary infection
and the secondary sort

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.710
of immune response, OK?

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.250
So the antibodies get better
because of this B and T cell

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.130
interaction and this
affinity maturation process.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:13.410
One other thing that happens
is that the B cells can produce

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:17.580
different classes or
isotypes of antibodies,

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.162
and this is known as
isotype switching.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.150
And so this is, again,
the genomic locus

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:37.430
for the heavy chain
of an immunoglobulin.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.740
You see, here's the
VDJ segment, so it's

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.400
undergone VDJ
recombination, and then

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.000
what you see are these
different blue regions here.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.380
Each of these are exons that
encode a different isotope

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.840
for the antibody.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.000
So the first one
is mu, and so that

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.300
produces IgM when that's the
one that's proximal to VDJ.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:08.560
So if you have IgM, that's the
initial state of the antibody,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.820
and that's initially
membrane bound

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.350
and serves as the
B cell receptor.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.320
But each of these
different constant domains,

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.870
even though they're not
undergoing variation,

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.030
they have different
effector functions

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.420
and can do different
things for the body.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:31.100
So for example, if you
had isotype switching

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.140
and you had a
recombination event that

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.160
brought this gamma 2
segment together with VDJ,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.940
that would produce the
isotype which is known as IgG,

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:47.060
and IgG is a highly secreted
form of the antibody that

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.930
is highly effective for
bacterial infections

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.180
because it's secreted
in the blood,

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.720
and it's able to neutralize
bacteria and limit

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.570
the infection that way.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.430
But there are other
possibilities,

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.610
because you have all of these
different possibilities.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:08.630
And so you could get VDJ
together with this alpha,

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:13.300
and that would produce
an isotype known as IgA.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.430
And IgA promotes
mucosal immunity

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.980
because it's able to pass
through the epithelial linings.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.130
In addition, IgE is
another type of antibody,

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.900
and the constant domains are
constant for each of isotypes,

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.860
but they recruit different
effector functions.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:41.630
So IgG would be hitting
bacteria by promoting

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.370
phagocytosis of those bacteria.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:51.150
IgE, in contrast, is especially
good at dealing with worms,

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:51.650
right?

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.810
So if you have an
intracellular--

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.530
or not intracellular, but like,
an intestinal worm or something

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.060
like that, then IgE--

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.970
its effector functions are
better at dealing with that.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.120
So this process of
isotype switching sort of

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.139
allows the immune system
to adapt to tackle

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:16.980
a particular type of pathogen.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:17.480
All right.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:24.050
The last way in which T
cells enhance this function

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:28.070
is by promoting the
differentiation of B cells

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.139
into different types of B cells.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:34.480
One of those types of B cells
is known as a memory B cell,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.190
and the memory B
cell is a B cell

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.710
that can last in the
body for decades,

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.000
even if the antigen
is not present.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.250
So this mediates sort of the
memory of the immune system.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:55.310
And so just to summarize
what I just told you,

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:59.000
if you have a B cell and it
recognizes an antigen, which

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.960
could be a protein, it would
internalize that protein

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.020
via endocytosis
and then process it

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.710
so that it can display
peptides from that antigen

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.240
on its surface.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.230
And if that's
recognized by a T cell,

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:18.440
then that leads to an
interaction between the T and B

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.080
cell that will lead to these
different things happening,

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.120
such as affinity maturation,
isotype switching,

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.060
so the red here would be
a different constant chain

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.860
on this same variable chain.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.340
So the variable
chain doesn't change

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.590
with the isotype switching,
so it's still always

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.530
able to recognize that antigen--

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.910
it's just recruiting
different effector functions.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.190
And you can also get
differentiation of B cells

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:50.330
into plasma cells, which really
secrete a ton of antibody,

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:54.110
and therefore help the
body fight infection.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:59.910
Now this is important because
for a vaccine to be effective,

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.530
you need to engage this
T cell response such

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:06.960
that you have all of
these things happening.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.380
So all of these
things need to happen

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.960
for an effective vaccine.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.860
So for an effective
vaccine, you can't just

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.980
activate the humoral side
of the immune system.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.230
You have to activate
both the humoral

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.920
and the cell-mediated sides
such that they interact in order

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.965
to enhance the immune response.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.210
All right.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.740
Now I'm going to move on
and talk about a big problem

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.230
that the immune
system has, which

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.410
is that it needs to somehow
be able to discriminate

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:48.700
between self and foreign, right?

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.690
And so if you have your
immune system recognizing

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.170
an antigen that is
natively part of your body,

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:59.050
that results in an
autoimmune disease.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.990
So there's a balance
in the immune system

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:07.930
between tolerating
antigens or attacking them,

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:11.860
and if it's attacking a native
antigen, then it's autoimmune.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.380
And this is a huge
problem because,

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.920
if you think about it, because
we've talked about the B cell

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.100
receptor, the antibody, and
the T cell receptor, right?

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.010
Our bodies are generating
tens of millions

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.800
of these receptors that
are diverse and can

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.410
recognize different molecules.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:38.540
So our body is generating
tens of millions

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:46.770
of antigen receptors, and
it does this constitutively,

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:49.890
so that means that it's
just doing it automatically.

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.230
You don't even need to be
infected for this to happen.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:56.730
This is just part of the
development of B and T cells.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.860
OK, so it's constitutive,
doesn't require infection--

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.710
constitutive.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.700
In addition, it's
totally random.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.080
Your body could generate any
sort of combination of V, Ds,

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.200
and Js, and it could
mutate in a certain way

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.440
that it's likely that at some
point during your lifetime

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.930
you're going to generate
a receptor that recognizes

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.020
a native protein in your body.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.020
So it's totally random--

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:33.140
at least what the sort of
rearrangement of VDJ gives.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:37.340
That process is
constitutive and random.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.880
So I just want to point
out several diseases that

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.570
are caused by autoimmunity,
and I've distinguished them

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:47.810
based on whether
the disease involves

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.230
the generation of antibodies
that recognize self or T

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.840
cells that recognize self.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.370
So for antibodies, there's a
disease, myasthenia gravis,

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:01.640
which an individual's--
individuals generate

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.930
an antibody against a receptor
for a neurotransmitter,

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.940
acetylcholine.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.670
And acetylcholine is
the neurotransmitter

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:14.570
which is predominantly involved
in sending signals from a motor

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.180
neuron to a muscle,
and therefore

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.820
antibodies that
inhibit this receptor

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.450
result in muscle weakness.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.140
Now self antibodies can
also result in diabetes,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.270
and individuals can
develop antibodies

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.480
that recognize and inhibit
the insulin receptor,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.440
and this leads to insulin
resistance and diabetes

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.020
mellitus.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.500
Some examples of T
cell mediated diseases

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.020
are-- if you recall back in
the beginning of the month,

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.320
when we talked about electrical
signaling in neurons,

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.870
I told you about
the myelin sheath

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.950
and how this increases
the speed of the action

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:58.370
potential along that axon.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:02.510
And if T cells attack
the myelin sheath,

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.820
then it disrupts this process
of electrical signaling,

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.170
and that results in a
devastating disease,

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.570
which is multiple sclerosis.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:16.680
Autoimmune disease involving T
cells also involves diabetes,

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.950
and if T cells
attack and destroy

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:23.720
the islet cells of the
pancreas, this also

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.780
disrupts the body's
ability to produce insulin,

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.260
and that results
in type 1 diabetes.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.470
So I'm sure many
of you know people

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.970
with these types of diseases,
and they're obviously

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:41.600
of significant impact
both in this country

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.650
and around the world.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:49.520
So the problem for the cells in
our body and the immune system

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.050
is that the immune system
has to have some sort of way

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.590
to distinguish between
self and foreign.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.760
So how is it that the
immune system does this?

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.490
And also, it has to
have different responses

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.760
to self-recognition versus
foreign recognition.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.830
So what should the
immune system's response

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:20.950
be if there is a
self recognition?

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.600
What should it do
to the cells that

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.270
recognizes a native protein?

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:25.173
Rachel?

00:41:25.173 --> 00:41:27.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.380
PROFESSOR: It could
delete that cell.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.020
What Rachel said is you
should get rid of it.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.220
And so one way to think
about this process

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.210
is there's a bit of a Darwinian
natural selection going on

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.960
in the body, and if there
is a self recognition,

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.370
then there should be a negative
selection against that cell,

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.410
so there should be
negative selection.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:55.600
This cell should be more
unfit, whereas if it's

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.160
obviously foreign, then there
should be positive selection.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.910
This B cell should be more fit.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.690
And what Rachel
suggested is to get rid

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:10.480
of the cell, which is a great
idea, because if you kill off

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.750
the cell then you won't generate
any more cells that have

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:16.210
that recognition against self.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:21.110
So negative selection is
mediated by apoptosis and cell

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:21.610
death.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.760
And positive selection could be
both the activation of the cell

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.740
and also its proliferation.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.240
As you see up on the slide
there, that orange cell--

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.260
if it was recognizing a foreign
antigen, would get activated

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.720
and it would undergo a
monoclonal expansion.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.450
All the cells resulting
from that expansion

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.420
would express the same antibody
and therefore recognize

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.750
that antigen, so
this would result

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:59.650
in cell division or expansion
of that population of cell.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:12.380
So now we know what to do
with self versus foreign,

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.420
but how is it that
we distinguish

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.640
between self and foreign?

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:29.480
So how does the immune system
distinguish self from foreign?

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.570
And there are several
mechanisms to do this.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:37.820
The first is that the organs--

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.850
the lymphoid organs-- where
are these B and T cells

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.720
mature and undergo these
genomic rearrangements

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.315
are largely protected
from foreign agents.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:58.760
So there are basically
only self antigens

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.645
in the generative
lymphoid organs.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.050
These are the lymphoid
organs were B and T

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.340
cells are being generated.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.440
So the generative
lymphoid organs

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:21.830
would be the bone
marrow for B cells

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.330
and the thymus for T cells.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.150
Therefore, if a B or T cell--

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:31.430
if its receptor
engages with something

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.950
very tightly during
its development,

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:36.950
that's a signal for
the immune system

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:39.020
to delete and kill
off that cell.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:46.100
So if you get self
recognition here,

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.310
you get apoptosis and
deletion of that cell.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:54.470
The second way that the
body is able to distinguish

00:44:54.470 --> 00:45:01.160
is that it responds to
antigens specifically

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.022
when there is an
innate immune response,

00:45:04.022 --> 00:45:05.480
or if it responds
better when there

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.075
is an innate immune response.

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:17.540
So you can think of it like a
coincidence detector, right?

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.380
If you have an immune cell
and it recognizes an antigen,

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.080
and there's also an
innate immune response,

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.880
that's a strong indication
that this is foreign.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.700
So this would indicate
"foreign" to the immune system.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:40.010
If there is antigen
only and the body is not

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:42.830
mounting an innate
immune response,

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:46.760
it's much more likely
that this will generate

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.020
a robust immune response, and
this is the immune system's

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:57.260
signal that this
is a self antigen.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.530
This is also important
for vaccine development

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.600
because in most
vaccines, in addition

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:07.990
to having some antigen that's
a part of the infectious agent,

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:14.060
there's also something called
an adjuvant, which is basically

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.500
something that activates
the innate immune system.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.940
So the adjuvant activates
the innate immune response,

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.700
and that's important
because if you just

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.890
had the vaccine with
just the antigen,

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:31.550
there wouldn't be nearly
as robust a response.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:37.490
So you need both to activate
the adaptive immune system,

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.460
but also the innate immune
system to really get

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.810
a robust response.

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:50.180
So I want to end by talking
about this year's Nobel Prize

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:56.330
work, and it involves
another mechanism that

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:59.960
basically prevents
autoimmunity and downregulates

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:06.890
the activity of these
T cells, and that

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.920
involves another type of-- we've
only talked about activating

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.300
receptors on the T cell, right?

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.450
The T cell receptor, CD4, CD8--

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:17.820
they're activating receptors
for the T cell receptor,

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.500
but there are also
inhibitory receptors that

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.000
are on the surface of T cells.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.830
So inhibitory-- we'll
just call them receptors.

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:33.260
One is called CTLA4 and
another is called PD1.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.180
Their names are not terribly
important, but what they do

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.870
is they keep the
immune system in check.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.670
And we've talked a
lot about signaling

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.310
and how signaling
gets activated,

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:53.600
and often a step in signaling
is once you get the signal sent,

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.080
and it's been sent, there
is, like, a negative feedback

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.390
that then turns
off the signal such

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.030
that there's signal termination.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.850
So you often have some
type of signal termination.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.150
That way, you don't have just
a constitutive activation

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.250
of the signal,
which in this case

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:16.760
would be sort of inflammation
and an immune response,

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.300
and one or both of
these is involved

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.460
in sort of keeping the
immune system in check

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:27.740
and stopping it after you
get that initial reaction.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.830
Now, the reason
this is so important

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:34.280
and why James Allison
and Tasuku Honjo won

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.590
the Nobel Prize is
they had the idea

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:41.750
to use this as a
therapy for cancer.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:45.380
And it turns out that
some cancer cells

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:51.620
can express the ligand for
these inhibitory receptors

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.830
such that they can avoid the
immune system from recognizing

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:56.510
the tumor.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:01.220
So this would be one case where
the tumor cell is expressing

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:05.570
the ligand for PD1, and that
inhibits the function of this T

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:09.140
cell receptor so that it
doesn't kill the tumor cell,

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:13.080
and that leads to the
expansion of the tumor

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.300
so the tumor can expand
in an unchecked way.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:22.070
And what James Allison and
Tasuku Honjo determined

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:27.050
is that if you block
that inhibitory receptor,

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:31.340
then you sort of uncheck the
response of the immune system

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.260
such that these
immune cells are now

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:37.700
able to recognize the
tumor cells and kill them.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.780
So by sort of blocking
the inhibitor,

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:45.860
you now have T cells-- these are
CD8 positive T cells that are

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.060
killer cells--

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.120
they will now recognize these
T cells and kill them off.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:58.550
So there's what's known
as an inhibitor blockade

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:05.570
because you're
blocking the inhibitor,

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:10.340
and these inhibitors are
antibodies that recognize

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:14.960
these inhibitory receptors, and
they're now being used to treat

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.250
some forms of advanced cancer.

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.410
And so this is something
that the cancer

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:25.580
field and immunology fields
are both really excited about.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:31.130
What might be one complication
with this type of treatment?

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.290
If you get rid of the
inhibitory receptors,

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:35.590
what might be a consequence?

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:36.330
Yeah, Steven?

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:38.665
AUDIENCE: Then you could
recognize other self cells that

00:50:38.665 --> 00:50:40.070
inhibited [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you
get autoimmunity.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.250
That's exactly right.

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:46.580
So one of the downsides
of this is that--

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.310
one of the side effects is
that you can have patients

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:51.690
with an autoimmune reaction.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.900
So it's not the magic
bullet, but it's

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.880
a step in the right direction.

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.840
All right, we'll
see you next week.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.060
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.670
So it's time to start.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.870
So today, I want to talk about
general features of quantum

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.220
mechanics.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.270
Quantum mechanics is something
that takes some time to learn,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.470
and we're going to be doing some
of that learning this semester.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.250
But I want to give you a
perspective of where we're

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.220
going, what are the
basic features, how

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.160
quantum mechanics looks,
what's surprising about it,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.650
and introduce some
ideas that will

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.470
be relevant throughout
this semester and some

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.110
that will be relevant for
later courses as well.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.740
So it's an overview
of quantum mechanics.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.360
So quantum mechanics,
at this moment,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.810
is almost 100 years old.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.000
Officially-- and we will hear--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.330
this year, in 2016, we're
celebrating the centenary

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.790
of general relativity.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.440
And when will the centenary
of quantum mechanics be?

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.760
I'm pretty sure it
will be in 2025.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.370
Because in 1925,
Schrodinger and Heisenberg

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.020
pretty much wrote down the
equations of quantum mechanics.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.370
But quantum mechanics
really begins earlier.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.180
The routes that led to quantum
mechanics began in the late

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.100
years of the 19th century
with work of Planck,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.470
and then at the
beginning of the century,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.790
with work of Einstein and
others,m as we will see today

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.640
and in the next few lectures.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.020
So the thoughts, the
puzzles, the ideas

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.350
that led to quantum
mechanics begin before 1925,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.940
and in 1925, it
suddenly happened.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.450
So what is quantum mechanics?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.860
Quantum mechanics is really
a framework to do physics,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.880
as we will understand.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.490
So quantum physics has
replaced classical physics

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.560
as the correct description
of fundamental theory.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.580
So classical physics may
be a good approximation,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.630
but we know that at some
point, it's not quite right.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.960
It's not only not
perfectly accurate.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.420
It's conceptually very
different from the way things

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.560
really work.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.820
So quantum physics has
replaced classical physics.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.480
And quantum physics
is the principles

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.060
of quantum mechanics applied to
different physical phenomena.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.410
So you have, for example,
quantum electrodynamics,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.520
which is quantum mechanics
applied to electromagnetism.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.490
You have quantum
chromodynamics, which

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.480
is quantum mechanics applied
to the strong interaction.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.320
You have quantum optics when
you apply quantum mechanics

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.760
to photons.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.790
You have quantum
gravity when you

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.620
try to apply quantum
mechanics to gravitation.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.980
Why the laughs?

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.600
And that's what gives rise
to string theory, which

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.200
is presumably a quantum
theory of gravity,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.912
and in fact, the quantum
theory of all interactions

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.400
if it is correct.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.890
Because it not only
describes gravity,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.660
but it describes
all other forces.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.630
So quantum mechanics
is the framework,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.220
and we apply it to many things.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.490
So what are we going
to cover today?

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.990
What are we going to review?

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:59.280
Essentially five topics--
one, the linearity

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:14.350
of quantum mechanics, two, the
necessity of complex numbers,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:25.950
three, the laws of
determinism, four,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:41.530
the unusual features
of superposition,

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.970
and finally, what
is entanglement.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.530
So that's what we
aim to discuss today.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.900
So we'll begin with
number one, linearity.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.690
And that's a very
fundamental aspect

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.540
of quantum mechanics,
something that we have

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.670
to pay a lot of attention to.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.090
So whenever you
have a theory, you

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.980
have some dynamical variables.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.070
These are the variables
you want to find

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.270
their values because they are
connected with observation.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.600
If you have dynamical
variables, you

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.020
can compare the values
of those variables,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.350
or some values deduced
from those variables,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.460
to the results of an experiment.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.990
So you have the equations
of motion, so linearity.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.210
We're talking linearity.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.300
You have some equations
of motion, EOM.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:00.770
And you have
dynamical variables.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.400
If you have a theory,
you have some equations,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.000
and you have to solve for
those dynamical variables.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.450
And the most famous example
of a theory that is linear

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.470
is Maxwell's theory
of electromagnetism.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.420
Maxwell's theory
of electromagnetism

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.220
is a linear theory.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.270
What does that mean?

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.810
Well, first, practically,
what it means

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.030
is that if you have a solution--

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:35.640
for example, a plane wave
propagating in this direction--

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.390
and you have another solution--

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.710
a plane wave propagating
towards you--

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.180
then you can form
a third solution,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.500
which is two plane waves
propagating simultaneously.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.690
And you don't have
to change anything.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.920
You can just put them together,
and you get a new solution.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.820
The two waves propagate
without touching each other,

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.150
without affecting each other.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.990
And together, they
form a new solution.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.350
This is extraordinarily
useful in practice

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.260
because the air
around us is filled

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.690
with electromagnetic waves.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.850
All your cell phones send
electromagnetic waves

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.870
up the sky to satellites
and radio stations

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.160
and transmitting stations, and
the millions of phone calls

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.990
go simultaneously without
affecting each other.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.480
A transatlantic cable can
conduct millions of phone calls

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.750
at the same time, and as much
data and video and internet.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.750
It's all superposition.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.820
All these millions
of conversations

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.950
go simultaneously
through the cable

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.310
without interfering
with each other.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.330
Mathematically, we have
the following situation.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:11.620
In Maxwell's theory, you
have an electric field,

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:17.540
a magnetic field, a charge
density, and a current density.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:25.360
That's charge per unit
area per unit of time.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.400
That's the current density.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.640
And this set of data
correspond to a solution

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.309
if they satisfy
Maxwell's equations,

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:41.500
which is a set of equations
for the electromagnetic field,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.700
charged densities,
and current density.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.950
So suppose this is a solution,
that you verify that it

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.320
solves Maxwell's equation.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:58.780
Then linearity
implies the following.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:08.740
You multiply this by alpha,
alpha e, alpha b, alpha rho,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.470
and alpha j.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.720
And think of this as
the new electric field,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.450
the new magnetic field,
the new charged density,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.910
and the new current
is also a solution.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:32.710
If this is a solution,
linearity implies

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.470
that you can
multiply those values

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:42.505
by a number, a constant number,
a alpha being a real number.

00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:48.150
And this is still a solution.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.830
It also implies more.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.680
Linearity means
another thing as well.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:10:01.380
It means that if you have two
solutions, e1, b1, rho 1, j1,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:08.010
and e2, b2, rho 2, j2--

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:25.030
if these are two
solutions, then linearity

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:37.260
implies that the sum e1 plus e2,
b1 plus b2, rho 1 plus rho 2,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:44.060
and j1 plus j2 is
also a solution.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:00.330
So that's the meaning, the
technical meaning of linearity.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.320
We have two solutions.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.100
We can add them.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.260
We have a single solution.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.220
You can scale it by a number.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.260
Now, I have not shown
you the equations

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.720
and what makes them linear.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.800
But I can explain this
a little more as to

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.130
what does it mean to
have a linear equation.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.890
Precisely what do we mean
by a linear equation?

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.005
So a linear equation.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.870
And we write it schematically.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.780
We try to avoid details.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.750
We try to get
across the concept.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:47.110
A linear equation, we write
this l u equal 0 where

00:11:47.110 --> 00:12:00.190
u is your unknown and l is what
is called the linear operator,

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.860
something that acts on u.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.440
And that thing, the equation,
is of the form l and u equal 0.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.210
Now, you might say,
OK, that already

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.810
looks to me a little strange,
because you have just one

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.080
unknown, and here we
have several unknowns.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.560
So this is not very general.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.900
And you could have
several equations.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.900
Well, that won't change much.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.370
We can have several
linear operators

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.510
if you have several equations,
like l1 or something,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.670
l2 on something, all
these ones equal to 0

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.680
as you have several equations.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.940
So you can have several
u's or several unknowns,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:53.771
and you could say something
like you have l on u, v,

00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:59.330
w equals 0 where you
have several unknowns.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.670
But it's easier to just
think of this first.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.570
And once you understand this,
you can think about the case

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.290
where you have many equations.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:11.090
So what is a linear equation?

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:15.235
It's something in which this l--

00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:17.640
the unknown can
be anything, but l

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.190
must have important properties,
as being a linear operator

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:29.900
will mean that l on a times
u, where a is a number,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:41.540
should be equal to alu and l
on u1 plus u2 on two unknowns

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.390
is equal to lu 1 lu 2.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.505
This is what we mean by
the operator being linear.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.470
So if an operator
is linear, you also

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:06.140
have l on alpha u1 plus beta u2.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.950
You apply first the second
property, l on the first plus

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.700
l on the second.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:19.940
So this is l of alpha
u1 plus l of beta u2.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.130
And then using the
first property,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:29.680
this is alpha l of
u1 plus beta l of u2.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:41.590
And then you realize that
if u1 and u2 are solutions--

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:47.170
which means lu 1
equal lu 2 equals 0

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.840
if they solve the equation--

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:58.525
then alpha u1 plus
beta u2 is a solution.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:10.270
Because if lu1 is 0 and lu2 is
0, l of alpha u1 plus beta u2

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.180
is 0, and it is a solution.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:23.970
So this is how we write
a linear equation.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.620
Now, an example
probably would help.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.370
If I have the
differential equation

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:39.290
du dt plus 1 over
tau u equals 0,

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:45.020
I can write it as an
equation of the form lu

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:51.500
equals 0 by taking
l on u to be defined

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:59.730
to be vu vt plus 1 over tau u.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.300
Now, it's pretty much--

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.770
I haven't done much here.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.000
I've just said, look, let's
define l [? active ?] [? on ?]

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.110
u to be this.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.370
And then certainly, this
equation is just lu equals 0.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.240
The question would be maybe
if somebody would tell you

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.780
how do you write l alone--

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.290
well, l alone, probably
we should write it

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:32.850
as d dt without anything
here plus 1 over tau.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.080
Now, that's a way
you would write

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.930
it to try to understand
yourself what's going on.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.980
And you say, well, then when
l acts as the variable u,

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.500
the first term takes
the derivative,

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.910
and the second term, which is
a number, just multiplies it.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.236
So you could write
l as this thing.

00:16:52.236 --> 00:17:00.260
And now it is
straightforward to check

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
that this is a linear operator.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.286
l is linear.

00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:11.859
And for that, you have to
check the two properties there.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:20.440
So for example, l on
au would be ddt of au

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:28.630
plus 1 over tau au,
which is a times du d tau

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.185
plus 1 over tau u, which is alu.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.710
And you can check.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.740
I asked you to check
the other property

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:46.780
l on u1 plus u2 is
equal to lu 1 plus lu 2.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.010
Please do it.

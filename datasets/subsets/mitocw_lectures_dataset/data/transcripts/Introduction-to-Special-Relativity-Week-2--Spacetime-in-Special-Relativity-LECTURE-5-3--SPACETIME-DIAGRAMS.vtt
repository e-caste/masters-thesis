00:00:07.078 --> 00:00:09.370
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.570
In this section, we talk
about spacetime diagrams.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.930
They turn out to be very
useful tools to describe

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.320
events or sequences of
events, in particular

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.170
when observed by
multiple observers.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.270
So what is a spacetime diagram?

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.260
Here's an example.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.560
You have an x-coordinate
and a t-coordinate

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.479
for space and time.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.270
I plotted an event in blue here.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.490
And the world line of events.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.680
A world line is just a sequence
of events as they occur.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.260
In this case,
something seemed to be

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.940
moving with constant velocity.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.060
The world line is just a
continuous line of movement.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.490
The velocity of
this event is delta

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.320
x over delta t, which
is 1 over the slope.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.980
Let's have a look here.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.069
So the time axis is defined
as those events which

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.820
all occur at the same
space, x equals 0,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.300
whereas the x-axis is
defined as those events which

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.480
all occur simultaneously
at the same time.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.200
And then you can
draw additional lines

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.210
into the spacetime diagram
where, for example, all times

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.380
are equal to 1.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.670
You might want to add a unit.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.170
I omitted this here.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.150
Time might be given in seconds,
in days, in hours, in years--

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.640
whatever you like-- similar to
space in meters or light-years.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.660
So lines here in green of
the same time, meaning time

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.730
is constant.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.970
All events on that line
happen simultaneously,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.360
while in blue are those
lines where events happened

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.690
at the same location, so
x is equal to constant

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.710
some specific values.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.110
Here in red, I add one
additional caveat, which you're

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.810
typically not aware
or considering

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.030
very much in diagrams is
the role of tick marks.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.759
Here in this spacetime
diagram, our tick marks

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.870
are perpendicular to the axis.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.570
It's also OK or correct here
to say that they are parallel

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.330
to the second axis, and
we'll come back to this point

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.110
later on.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.640
An example of a
world line is simply

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.870
drawing all events which
correspond to me, right?

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.050
Professor Klute is
pacing in his office.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.500
You know, maybe on a line,
just the x-coordinate

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.830
is plotted here, time
passes, and I'm just pacing

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.270
the long-changing direction.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.960
Each time, each little
segment is constant velocity.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.020
That's the world line
of me from some time t

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.360
for minus t to term
time equals 40.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.240
OK, so now our first
concept question.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.600
Let's consider the set of
world lines, 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.630
and the question is,
which of the objects which

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.270
correspond to the world
line is moving the slowest?

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.350
Let's consider
this for a second,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.000
and then we look at this.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.890
As the velocity is
1 over the slope,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.720
the object with
the steepest slope,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.050
the largest value of the
slope, is moving the slowest.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.990
And in this case,
it's object number 2.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.070
All right, now we want to
actually make them useful.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.830
Yes, they can be used in order
to describe certain event

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.470
lines, but they're
really useful when

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.640
you describe events happening
for different observer.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.030
So in this activity, I invite
you to draw Bob's spacetime

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.180
diagram into Alice's, and
then as a second step,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.630
draw Alice's spacetime
diagram into Bob's.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.020
The situation is very similar
to previous ones discussed

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.770
in this lecture.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.200
Alice is stationary
and Bob moving

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.190
in this rocket with a velocity
of half the speed of light,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.230
or a gamma factor of 1.2.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.880
All right, try.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.810
Go ahead.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.980
Try to show where is
the time axis for Bob

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.880
and where is the spatial
coordinate for Bob.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.700
OK, so the way to approach
this is the following.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.180
We want to use Lorentz
transformations in order

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:33.400
to figure out what is the value
of Bob's time axis and space

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.360
axis for different values of
Alice's spacetime diagram.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.920
So we start with drawing
Alice's spacetime diagram.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.460
And then if you want to find
the x-axis as seen by Bob,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.130
we have to set the time
for Bob to equal 0 and then

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.300
find the corresponding elements
or tick marks on the axis.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.150
So the first point
we're going to find

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.230
is tB equals 0 and xB equal 1.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.060
So with the Lorentz
transformation,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.620
we find that xA 1, so
this point corresponds

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.350
in Alice's spacetime diagram
to xA equal gamma equal 1.2

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.110
and tA equal gamma times v
over C squared equal 0.6.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.550
So we can make this--

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.850
find this first point and
plot it in our diagram.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.510
It's right here.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.350
OK, and then we go move around
and find the second point

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.450
and the third point,
and we do the same

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.520
for the time axis, where xB
is equal to 0 and tB equal 1,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.130
then corresponds to 4.6
in xA 1 and 1.2 in xA 2,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.350
where we find these points here.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.130
I failed to say that the
origin of those two spacetime

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.320
diagrams [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.080
OK?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.310
So this is already it.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.830
So we found Bob's time axis,
where xB is equal to 0,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.550
and Bob's x-axis,
where tB is equal to 0.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.100
And I did draw those tick marks
parallel to the second axis.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.090
So if I want to now find out
the time axis for xB equal 1,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.120
I just have to follow along and
draw a parallel in the picture

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.620
here.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.850
All right, so the
second question

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.280
then is, where Alice's axis
in Bob's spacetime diagram?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.100
So the procedure is
very similar as before.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.860
We draw Alice's axis--

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.930
sorry, we draw Bob's axis,
and we find Alice's x-axis

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.280
by setting tA equals 0, and then
we find the number of points

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.180
and connect those.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.080
And the time axis is found
by setting xA equals 0

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.520
and finding them points
for various values of time.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.020
And you see here, this looks a
little different than before.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.060
I just zoom in
here a little bit.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.520
What you find specifically,
because relative

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.210
the direction of motion
changes, the positive values of

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:15.920
x are in positive value--

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.920
and negative-- so the
positive values of the x-axis

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.330
are in the negative
time direction,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.780
while the negative values of
x are in the positive time

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.570
direction, so would
be across down here.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.930
So this needs a little
bit to get used to,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.720
but you will later
see when I draw

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.380
in any of the two
spacetime diagrams

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.460
specific sequence of events,
I can immediately read off

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.690
how this event is perceived
from Bob's and from Alice's

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.860
perspective.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.230
And this makes our space
diagram very, very useful tools.

00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:23.370
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.235
lecture on non-linear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:27.890
structures.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.770
In the previous lectures, we
have considered quite a bit of

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.510
theory related to non-linear
finite element analysis in

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.860
some example solutions.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.700
The objective in the next two
lectures now, the last

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.170
lectures of this video course,
is to show how an actual

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.030
finite element analysis is
performed on the computer.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.760
We start with a linear solution
in this lecture, and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.820
then consider a non-linear
solution in the next lecture.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.930
We cannot discuss really, in
this amount of time given, all

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.520
the aspects of the analysis,
but want to summarize and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.050
demonstrate on the computer
the major steps of the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.840
analysis and concentrate on
possible difficulties,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.200
possible pitfalls, and some
general recommendations.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.460
As the example problem, we want
to use the plate with a

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.350
hole, that we already
considered earlier.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.200
And we performed a linear
analysis and then

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.750
a non-linear analysis.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.530
Remember, I pointed out in the
previous lectures that it is

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.830
very important to always do
linear analysis first before

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.700
you go into a non-linear
analysis.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.880
The elastic analysis is
performed to obtain the stress

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.440
concentration factor at the
hole, then we do an

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.020
elasto-plastic analysis to
estimate the limit load, and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.820
an analysis also to investigate
the effect of a

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.440
shaft in the plate hole.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.070
These two analyses are being
performed in the last lecture

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.280
of the video course.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.430
The plate we are analyzing is
shown on this view graph here.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.610
Notice it's a square plate.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.750
Here, we show the hole, the
plate is loaded as shown up

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.050
here, and down here.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.670
The material property for the
elastic analysis are given

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.130
here and the thickness of
the plate is 0.01 meter.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.930
Because of symmetry conditions,
we only need to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.710
consider this quarter here.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.370
Of course, using appropriate
boundary conditions along

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.880
these two lines. we will talk
about that more later on.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.880
The first step for a finite
element analysis is to select

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.710
a computer program, and we, of
course, use the ADINA system.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.430
ADINA-IN is the pre-processor
to prepare, generate the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.810
finite element data.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.250
ADINA then solves the actual
finite element model, and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.040
ADINA-PLOT is used to this
display numerically or

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.470
graphically the solution
results.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.320
Schematically, we are sitting
here at a terminal and we're

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.170
inputting the data
to ADINA-IN.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.220
We can also receive here,
numerical output, and we can

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.380
also plot on this terminal here,
any of the information

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.550
that we like to plot.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.200
This is a graphics terminal.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.190
Notice ADINA-IN, of course,
communicates to a storage

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.030
device and further on
to ADINA, as we will

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.650
discuss just now.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.630
The user inputs, in
other words, or

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.400
types into the terminal.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.690
ADINA-IN commands interactively
or for batch

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.670
processing and then the user
checks also the input and the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.420
generated data on the graphics
device, as I showed you on the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.020
previous view graph.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.750
ADINA-IN generates the
input data for ADINA.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.965
The input data is checked
internally in ADINA in for

00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:51.430
errors and inconsistency, and
also is displayed as you are

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.330
requesting it as a user.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.850
The degree of freedom numbers
are generated and to obtain

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.560
minimum bandwidth, we have a
minimum bandwidth minimization

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.020
algorithm in the program, as
I will point out a bit

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.480
stronger later on.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.459
ADINA data inputs then, is
available to ADINA, and the

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.350
user runs ADINA, and ADINA then
stores the output data on

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.600
a porthole file and
on an output file.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.130
The output file, in other words,
contains really the

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.640
ADINA model data and the
calculated results.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.740
We access ADINA porthole
file using ADINA-PLOT.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.870
We can, of course, also look
at the output file and see

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.610
numerically the data that was
calculated using ADINA.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.100
Here, we have the action
displayed or schematically

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.200
shown by the user.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.830
User uses ADINA-PLOT to fetch
data from the ADINA porthole

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.430
file and then ADINA-PLOT
displays those data either

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.220
numerically or graphically.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.480
Let's look very briefly at
an overview of ADINA.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.610
The program can be used for
static and dynamic solutions,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.250
for linear and non-linear
analysis, for small and very

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.030
large finite element models,
and the formulations finite

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.400
elements and numerical
procedures used in the program

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.640
have largely been discussed
in this course.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.710
The displacement assumptions
that can be employed for the

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.340
finite element models are either
infinitesimally small

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.150
displacements, large
displacements, large rotations

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.480
but small strains, and large
deformations, large strains.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.750
We discussed these assumptions,
of course, also

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.310
in the course.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.240
Material models that are
available in isotropic linear

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.110
elastic model, orthotropic
linear elastic model,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.350
isotropic thermo-elastic model,
a curve description

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.300
model for analysis of geological
materials, a

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.000
concrete model, isothermal
plasticity models,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.300
thermo-elastic-plastic and creep
models, and non-linear

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.430
elastic incompressible, and
user-supplied models.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.540
The elements available in the
program, is available number

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.650
nodes tress element, an element
that can have two

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.780
nodes, three nodes,
or four nodes.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.461
It can also be used
as a ring element.

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:42.990
A two-dimensional solid element
that is used for plane

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.840
stress axis symmetric and
plane strain analysis.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.510
This also can have available
number of nodes, from four

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.300
nodes to nine nodes.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.800
Similarly, available number
of nodes element for

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.190
three-dimensional analysis.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.890
Then also a beam element, a
2-node beam element, Hermitian

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.890
beam element.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.830
And the isoparametric beam
element that we talked about

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.920
in the course.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.020
This element can carry, or can
be used with two nodes, or

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.200
three nodes, or four nodes.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.260
A pipe element that we did not
discuss in the course, but you

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.950
might be interested in reading
about that element is a curved

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.390
beam element, of course,
of pipe section.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.250
Which however, also includes the
effects of ovalization So

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.000
this element also carries, if
desired ovalization degrees of

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.740
freedoms at the nodes.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.140
And shell elements, we talked
about the use of the 16-node

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.420
element, and the MITC 4,
the 4-node element.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.850
We also talked briefly about
transition elements that I

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.470
used to model shells,
or thin structures

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.330
that couple into solids.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.580
Let us summarize some important
observations

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.500
regarding finite element
analysis.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.210
It's important to check the
finite element data, of

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.820
course, very carefully.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.310
The data must be checked
prior to the

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.730
actual response solution.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.410
This is done, of course, with
the pre-processor, by plotting

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.380
the data, looking at it very
carefully, typically.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.330
And then after the response
solution, you still want to

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:39.200
check the input data once more
by seeing whether the boundary

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.350
conditions are properly
satisfied, that you want to

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.800
impose on to the model, whether
the displacement and

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.050
stress solution is
a reasonable.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.970
Once the analysis has been
performed, you want to very

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.640
carefully evaluate
and interpret

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.390
the calculate response.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.130
You want to start in detail the
calculated displacement

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.360
and stresses along
certain lines.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.960
In particular, look
at stress jumps.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.120
We pointed that out already in
an earlier lecture, and we

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.200
will do so in our example
solution again, just now.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.180
And here, I'd like to add that
stress averaging, stress

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.300
smoothing should only be done
after the above careful

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.230
evaluation.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.260
That's something important
to keep in mind.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.790
I believe that you should first
look at the stresses,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.310
the way they have been
calculated by the program and

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.020
then start thinking about
stress smoothing.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.630
Only after you've gone through
this phase here.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:42.410
The data for the construction
of the finite element mesh,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:51.150
that we want to deal with in the
example solution is input

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.180
for this quarter of
the plate, as I

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.630
pointed out earlier already.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.180
We have these elastic material
constants, we're looking at a

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.590
plane stress analysis.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.510
This is the thickness
of the plate.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.800
And once again, here
is a loading.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.770
Notice, we are putting this
boundary on rollers, and we

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.720
want to put this boundary as
well on rollers to model the

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.640
symmetry conditions that we
need to model in order to

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.990
consider a whole plate, where we
actually analyze here, only

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.230
one quarter of that plate.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.770
The finite element mesh that we
will be using is shown on

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.550
this view graph.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:31.120
It consists of 64 8-node
isoparametric elements.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.820
Well, we performed this analysis
on the computer in my

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.832
laboratory at MIT a few weeks
ago, and we have brought in a

00:10:38.832 --> 00:10:42.060
video crew to record all the
actions that we have been

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.270
performing to actually complete
the analysis.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:50.230
I like to now share with you
what we have recorded and

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:54.470
narrate to you as we go step by
step through the analysis

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.950
of this plate on the computer.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.060
Our first step is to look at
how we are generating using

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.400
ADINA-IN, how we are generating
this mesh, and also

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.210
the other data that are required
for use of ADINA.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.000
So let's look at this first step
now, after which I will

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.140
then introduce you to the next
step and narrate continuous

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.660
narration of the analysis.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.780
Here we show briefly the
hardware equipment we are

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.490
using in my MIT laboratory.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.300
A MASSCOMP minicomputer with two
megabytes of real memory,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.320
and 330 megabytes
of disk storage.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.200
We also have a tape drive.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.600
The computer features virtual
memory, and we use a

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.045
Unix-based operating system.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.890
Roughly, for our purposes,
the computer is

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.670
equivalent to a VAX 750.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.940
We use two terminals.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.190
One terminal for alphanumerical
and numerical

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.410
input and output, and one
terminal, the one to the

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.660
right, for graphical output.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.210
We also have a plotter.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.110
We use this plotter to generate
the figures of finite

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.440
element meshes, and results
for this course.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.640
Here comes my student,
Ted [? Sossman, ?]

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.660
who will sit at the
terminal to input

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.670
the data to the program.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.720
In what follows, we will see the
data input prepared by Ted

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.030
on the terminal at
which he sits.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.730
Non-graphical output is
displayed by that same

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.990
terminal, whereas we will see
graphical output displayed on

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.540
the right terminal.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.200
Here, we see the start of input

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.470
preparation for ADINA-IN.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.370
We have opened the data base,
on which the data input and

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.460
generated will be stored and
have already input the title

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.700
for the analysis, quarter plate
with hole, 64 elements.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.420
We have also defined master
degrees of freedom conditions

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.820
by specifying the
values of IDOF.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.330
1 means of a deleted degree of
freedom, 0 means a free,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.360
existing degree of freedom.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.970
Here, all degrees of freedom
have been deleted except for

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.860
the yz displacements.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.920
Notice also that at
our request, all

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.840
text appears twice.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.900
After we have typed a line, the
line is echoed back by the

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.520
program merely for checking.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.020
In what follows, we now specify
the coordinates of a

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.110
few key points that defines
the outline of the

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.360
quarter of the plate.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.583
Note we define the y-
and z-coordinates.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:39.100
First of node 1, then for
nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.110
Note that these coordinates
are input in free format.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.230
Here the node 6 input is not
aligned with the other nodal

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.480
point coordinate input.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.520
We now want to look at the plot
of these nodal points.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.950
This is achieved by the frame
and mesh commands.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.030
Here they are, the six points.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.670
Point 1 is the center of the
hole, points 2 and 3 defines

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.920
the boundary of the hole.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.850
Points 4, 5, 6 defines the
remaining corners of the

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.050
quarter plate.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.510
And here, you see the first
set of generated nodes.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.210
Note that the nodal points have
consecutive numbers along

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.430
the vertical symmetry edge,
except for the top and bottom

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.700
nodes, numbers 3 and 4,
similarly for the horizontal

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.090
symmetry edge.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.540
This would mean a large
bandwidth unless we use a

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.410
bandwidth minimizer.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.150
And we will do so, hence we
are not concerned with the

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.800
nodal point numbering
used at this stage.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.175
Next, we generate also the nodal
points on the remaining

00:14:57.175 --> 00:14:59.630
edges of the quarter plate.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.810
And here they are.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.670
We now want to generate the
elements of the plate.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.040
For this we define, first the
material to be a elastic.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.120
Young's modulus E, Poisson's
ratio NU.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.820
We want a plane stress
element group.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.630
The Gauss integration
order is 3x3.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.300
The material set has a number 1,
this is the material set we

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.550
just defined.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.320
The G-surface command next
generates the 8-node elements

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.070
in the domain defined by the
corner points, so to

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.450
say 6, 4, 3, 2.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:04.000
We now want to plot the
generated element mesh, and

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.250
here, you see it.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.500
Note once again, we use 8-note
isoparametric elements, around

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.010
the hole, they are
curved elements.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.920
Finally, we also define in the
ADINA-IN input the elements

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.690
thicknesses to be 0.01 and the
loads which correspond to the

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.180
pulling on the plate.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.180
This [? end ?] completes
the input preparation

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.430
for ADINA-IN .

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.330
ADINA-IN has now all the
information to generate a

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.380
complete input file ADINA.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.830
In addition, we also want to
ask ADINA-IN to assign

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.300
equation numbers that correspond
to a minimum

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.190
bandwidth for the solution
of this problem.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:52.210
So our next step is to have
ADINA-IN go through these

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.670
actions, and turn back to our
laboratory and see what is

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.420
happening now.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.700
Here, we see the end of the
ADINA-IN input file that we

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.530
saw already before.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:10.109
The command ADINA now generates
the ADINA file.

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:12.569
At the same, also, the bandwidth
of the stiffness

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.430
matrix is minimized.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.619
We use the reverse Cuthill-Mckee
algorithm.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:24.680
Notice that the bandwidth has
been reduced from 399 to 93.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.400
The original bandwidth was, of
course, artificially large

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.740
because our nodal point
generation did not take

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.900
account of any bandwidth
considerations, as I pointed

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.570
out before.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.500
Let us briefly look
at the ADINA file

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.360
generated by the ADINA-IN.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.120
Here, we see common cards,
automatically inserted by

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.290
ADINA-IN to explain
the input cards.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.760
We see the master control card,
the load control card,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.580
the Eigenvalue solution control
card, and so on.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.230
Let us look a bit closer at
the element data cards.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:05.990
Element 1 has eight nodes and
the first three are 6, 64, 74.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:10.325
Element 2 has 8 nodes and the
first three are 64, 62, 76.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.800
Note a maximum of nine
nodes is possible.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.370
The last 0 is the node card
signifies that the ninth node

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.620
is not used.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.070
With a complete ADINA input
file now available, we can

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.110
call ADINA to execute this file
and this gives us our

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.900
first solution results.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.590
We look at the solution results
and, in particular, we

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.390
plot the deformed mesh onto the
original mesh, and this

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:45.540
shows, in fact, that we have
made an error in the input

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.560
description.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.660
It will show us that we have
fixed all these nodes down

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.190
here, whereas they should
have been on a roller.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.940
This is shown by plotting the
deformed mesh on to the

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.080
original mesh, and it's
also shown by

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.120
looking at the stresses.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.780
We do so by using an option in
the ADINA system for the

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.570
stress vector outputs, and this
is schematically shown

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.500
here, this option.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.510
We plot maximum principle
stresses--

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.780
say tensile in this
case here--

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:26.040
as a line with two arrows, and
principles stress that's

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.920
compressive as simply a line.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.820
So we can see, in other words,
how the stress flows through

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.280
the material, and we can see,
of course, compressive and

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.170
tensile stress situations, and
notice that the lengths of

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.490
these lines corresponds or is
proportional to the magnitude

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.680
of the stresses.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:54.030
We can plot this stress vector
output for all the integration

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:59.210
points stresses in the mesh, and
that, as I said already,

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.930
indicates clearly once again,
that we have used the wrong

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.280
boundary conditions down here.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.350
So we go and correct the
boundary conditions down here,

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.900
and re-run the analysis.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.520
In other words, call ADINA again
and those results that

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.610
we obtained then, once again,
displacements, in other words,

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.750
are plotted by plotting the
deformed mesh onto the

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.120
original mesh.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.350
We see that we now got much
better, much more

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.110
realistically-looking results.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.850
And we also will look at the
stresses using the stress

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:38.730
vector plots again, in the
elements, that show us also

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.340
that the results are now quite
realistic and that our mesh,

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.050
including the boundary
conditions have been quite

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.860
properly defined.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.080
So let us now look at this
step of the analysis.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.420
The command runadina
calls ADINA to

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.450
execute the input data.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.770
The data input file is
in ADINA-IN F02.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.680
And here, we see now the
deformed plotted onto the

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.890
original mesh.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.690
The original mesh is plotted
in dash lines.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.395
Of course, the deformations
are magnified.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.570
Note that as expected, the top
face has uniformly moved up.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.630
However, note that the nodal
points on the horizontal

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.580
symmetry line have not
displaced at all.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.420
This is quite unphysical and
shows that the wrong boundary

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.380
conditions have been used.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.220
If we look at the stress vector
plot over the mesh, the

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.200
same conclusion is reached.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.680
For clarity, on the video, we
show here the stress vectors

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.940
just on the elements closest
to the hole.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.670
And we can see in the element
adjoining the horizontal

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:56.010
symmetry line, a stress that
acts normal to the whole.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.160
This is, of course,
unphysical.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.330
Next, we show the stress vectors
in the outer most

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.090
elements of the quarter plate.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.420
And you can see here, a stress
acting perpendicular to the

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.360
free edge of the plate, when
we look near the horizontal

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.530
symmetry line.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.610
This is also unphysical and is
due to having specified the

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.050
wrong boundary conditions
on the wrong

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.300
horizontal symmetry line.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.450
The specification
of the boundary

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.520
conditions is shown here.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.860
The character, C, denotes the
boundary condition on the

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.150
horizontal symmetry line.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.280
The character B denotes the
boundary condition on the

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.410
vertical symmetry line.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.780
Where B means only the z
displacement is free and C

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.810
means all displacements
are fixed.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.610
For the six possible
displacements and

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.370
[? flotatations, ?]

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.620
a 1 means the degree of freedom
is fixed, and 0 means

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.870
the degree of freedom is free.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.170
We now correct the boundary
conditions.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.380
And B on the horizontal symmetry
line means now the v

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.620
displacement is free.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.520
C on the vertical symmetry
line means now the w

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.770
displacement is free.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.480
We run ADINA again, and here
you see the deformed mesh

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.270
plotted on the original mesh.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.820
The deformations look
very reasonable.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.750
The plate has contracted
horizontally, and

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.990
correspondingly, the hole
has shrunk horizontally.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.830
The deformations closest to
the hole are shown here.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.350
And here, we see the
stress vector

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.310
plots for these elements.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.110
The stresses align nicely
with the hole.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.680
Notice that there is no stress
perpendicular to the free

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.640
surface of the hole when we look
at the integration point

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.910
layer closest as a hole.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.790
The value of the maximum
stress is given here.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:01.040
It is 301.9 megapascal.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.170
Here, we look at the element
which carries the largest

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.600
stress, element 57.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.870
Once again, we can see that
the stresses align

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.940
nicely with the hole.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.610
We now recall is that the
objective of our analysis is

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.920
really the calculation of the
stress concentration factor.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.930
And if we look at the problem
once more, here, we have the

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.990
plate with the hole.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.050
The plate subjected to the
tractions, as shown here.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.550
We now need to, of course,
predict the stresses

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.770
accurately around the hole,
and in particular, at this

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.290
point here.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.170
Here, we have our
finite element

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.690
method used in the analysis.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.370
And so far, the only calculated
stresses at the

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.720
integration points
in the elements.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.040
Now this is here, by the
way, element number 57.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.210
And for this element, we have
calculated so far, only the

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.150
stresses at these integration
points.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.470
However, these integration
points do not lie on the

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.200
circumference of the hole, on
the boundary of the hole.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.350
And that is where the maximum
stresses occur.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.380
Of particular interest is, of
course, also this point here,

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.880
where we anticipate to
obtain the maximum

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.910
stress in the analysis.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.970
If you look at, schematically,
how the stresses would vary,

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:24.090
say, through the element, to the
boundary of the hole, we

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.470
would see a schematic
plot as shown here.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.900
Here is an actual element, the
other elements lie next to it,

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.480
and here you can see
schematically shown the stress

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.960
computed at the closest
integration point to the

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.530
boundary of the hole.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.790
And here, we would have
the stress computed

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.140
at the nodal point.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.580
That is actually the stress
that we are interested in.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.660
Well, we can ask ADINA to
calculate the stresses at the

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:55.260
nodal points, and then we can
ask ADINA-PLOT to enter with

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.640
these nodal point stresses
into this formula here.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.940
Sigma yy, sigma zz, and sigma
yz are the stresses at the

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.900
nodal points.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.170
To calculate, ADINA-PLOT
calculate this Sigma 1, which

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.300
is the maximum principle of
stress at that nodal point.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.770
We can ask ADINA-PLOT to
calculate sigma 1 at all the

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:26.160
nodal points in the mesh, and by
doing so, we obtained these

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.270
stresses and then they can ask
ADINA-PLOT to search through

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.490
those nodal points stresses,
these sigma 1 stresses, to

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:37.770
find us the location, the
element and the nodal point,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.200
to have the physical location
of the maximum stress

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.525
occurring in the mesh.

00:26:42.525 --> 00:26:49.950
We will see that doing so,
ADINA-PLOT comes up to tell us

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:55.640
that this is the point, element
number 57, point

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.990
number 4, that is this physical
point here, where the

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.320
maximum stress occurs and will
also give us that maximum

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.720
stress, and that maximum stress,
of course, gives us

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.450
then the stress concentration
factor.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:13.500
So let us now look at this
phase of the analysis.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.830
Here, we have input some
information regarding

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.910
variables that need be defined
in ADINA plot.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:25.220
TYY refers to tau yy, TZZ
refers to tau zz, TYZ

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.120
refers to tau yz.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.430
We define the result and
variable to calculate the

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:34.350
maximum principle stress.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:40.010
Hence, when TYY, TZZ, and TYZ
are defined [? smax ?]

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.880
gives the maximum principle
stress.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.700
Here, we now enter the command
to look for the maximum

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.140
principal stress in the mesh.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.270
First we make a small input
error, obtain a message, we

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:13.350
correct the input, and here
comes the result.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.510
We see that indeed element
57.4 carries a maximum

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:25.260
principle stress and this value
is 345.151 megapascal.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.840
We have now actually obtained
an answer to the

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.760
question that we asked.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.900
Originally, namely, we wanted
to calculated the stress

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.670
concentration factor
around the hole.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.040
And we have obtained a number
for that stress

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.880
concentration factor.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.630
However, a valid question,
certainly is to ask, how good

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.480
is this number?

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.710
After all, we used a finite
element mesh to approximate

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.910
the plate a particular finite
element idealization was used,

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.230
and we have only obtained
an approximation

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.310
to the exact result.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:01.070
Well, to evaluate that question,
to obtain insight

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:05.140
into that question, to evaluate
how good our analysis

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:10.970
results really are, we can plot
stress jumps, the way we

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.130
discussed it in an
earlier lecture.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:17.370
And in particular, for the
analysis that I'd like to show

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.660
you in this final phase, we
have plotted stress jumps

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.390
along these two lines.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.570
Now, notice that, for example,
at this node here, we have

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:32.940
four elements coupling into this
node, so at this node we

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.760
get four different stress
predictions

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.450
for each stress component.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.760
At this node here, we would
have only two stress

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.900
predictions, for each stress
component because only two

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.960
elements couple into
this node.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:55.430
That is one way to evaluate or
to look at how accurate our

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:56.680
results are.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.830
An alternative way is to plot
pressure bands, and the

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.270
pressure here is scalar.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:09.410
It's computed as shown here,
and we can plot bands of

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.150
constant pressure, the way we
already have discussed it in

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.240
an earlier lecture.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.880
Notice because this is a scalar,
it can be used very

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.910
nicely to plot these bands
of constant pressure.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.170
Of course, we could also have
used here, say, an effective

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:29.810
stress, which is also a scalar,
and we could plot

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:33.440
bands of constant effective
stresses.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.560
One example that you've seen
already early, is this one

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.960
here where we plotted pressure
bands, with band magnitude of

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.435
5 MPa, megapascal, and you can
see here this white band, here

00:30:48.435 --> 00:30:52.580
a black band, in other words,
we're going in steps 5 MPa

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.390
from one band to the next.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.970
Notice that there's a pressure
band discontinuity right here,

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:03.710
which already indicates that we
have a stress discontinuity

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:06.800
here, and which indicates that
the mesh that we used is

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.180
really not a very fine mesh.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.450
And if we are interested in
obtaining a very accurate

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:18.250
result, then based on these
pressure band plots, and also

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.750
the stress jump plots that I
will show you just now, we may

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.980
actually decide to
use a finer mesh.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.360
We discussed this issue already
in an earlier lecture.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.400
So let us now then look at what
happens, or what happened

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.420
in this final phase
of the analysis.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.140
Let's go back to the laboratory
and share the

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.175
experiences that we'll
see there.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.490
Here, we see once more
the mesh we're

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.740
using in the analysis.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.230
We will plot the stresses, and
hence, we can see the stress

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.930
jumps along the horizontal
symmetry line, and the

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.350
diagonal line of the plate.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.670
Here, you see the stresses along
the horizontal symmetry

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.660
line, Tau zz is plotted.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.110
The horizontal axis measures
distance along

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.360
the symmetry line.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.955
And the vertical axis measures
the stress values.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.200
Note that the stress predictions
at the nodes, when

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.590
calculated for the different
elements are almost the same.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.000
Only at one node can we actually
see a difference, and

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.600
it is quite small.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.990
Note that two elements couple
into this node.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.750
Hence, there are only small
stress jumps along the

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.010
horizontal symmetry
axis of the plate.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.450
Next, we look at the stress plot
along the diagonal line

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.200
of the model.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.440
Here the maximum principle
stress is plotted.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.850
Note that at one node into which
four elements couple, we

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.690
have four markedly different
stress values.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.040
Indeed, we have significant
stress jumps at that node, but

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.530
otherwise the stress
predictions do

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:17.780
not show large jumps.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.240
Finally, we look at the
pressure band plots.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.710
Here, they are drawn.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.550
To save time, we skipped some
of the drawing process and

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.430
jumped to a later
picture here.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:51.260
We notice that the pressure
bands are quite continuous,

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.150
except between the first and
second layer of elements

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.370
around the hole.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.190
This corresponds to the stress
discontinuity between these

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.110
element layers that
we saw earlier.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.480
We see now this is now
completed, I'd like to look

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.070
with you once more back on to
two view graphs that we

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.370
already have looked
at earlier.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.800
On this you graph, we summarize
some important

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.840
observations.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.590
And we said that it is very
important to check the finite

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.540
element data input carefully
prior to the actual response

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.580
solution run.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.940
That, of course, means
plotting the data.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.500
And we have done so, of course,
in our analysis.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.960
And after the response solution
has been obtained, by

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.360
starting whether desired
boundary conditions are

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.110
satisfied, whether displacement
and stress

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.820
solution is reasonable.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:45.429
Remember, in our analysis, we
did this, of course, as well

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:50.900
and we found, by looking at the
boundary conditions, the

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.610
way they were represented in the
actual solution, that we

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.230
have actually made an error.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.570
In other words, we looked at
the deformed mesh, and the

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.060
boundary conditions on the
deformed mesh in our first

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.030
analysis showed that we had
fixed the boundary at the

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.190
bottom off the mesh,
which was an error.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:14.720
So it is very important to go
through this step, to look

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.820
very closely whether the
boundary conditions are

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:21.550
actually satisfied on the mesh
that you have been using, in

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.640
the right way.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.930
Of course, the same holds for
the stress and solution.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:31.230
Remember, that we looked at the
stress plots for the mesh

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.540
that was fixed at the bottom
and we could directly see

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.050
there were errors there, and,
in other words, the error of

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:42.860
having fixed the boundary at
the bottom of the plate.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.080
So this step is most important,
and we have seen an

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.450
example in the analysis that
we just completed.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:54.520
I also had this view graph
already on, where we said that

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.690
we want to carefully evaluate
and interpret

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:58.580
the calculated response.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.580
We want to study, in detail,
the calculated displacement

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.630
and stresses along certain
lines, study stress jumps.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:08.660
Well, we saw an example of that
in the analysis that we

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:13.310
just completed, and we also
pointed out that it is

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.760
important to go through this
step here first, prior to

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.280
using a stress averaging because
if you do average

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.700
stresses, of course, you would
never see stress jumps.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.210
And this can be an important
step to gain confidence in the

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.210
analysis results that
you have obtained.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.970
This then completes what I
wanted to share with you in

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:33.710
this lecture.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.080
Thank you very much for
your attention.

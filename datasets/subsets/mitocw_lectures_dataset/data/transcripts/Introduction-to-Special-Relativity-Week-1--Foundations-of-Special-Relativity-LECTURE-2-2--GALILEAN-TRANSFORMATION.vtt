00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.810
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, special relativity.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.300
In this video, we talk about
Galilean transformation.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.940
So what is it
you're going to do?

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.890
We want to describe
our event P, maybe

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.610
Professor Klute exploding, with
two different reference frames.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.320
We can call one of the reference
frames our laboratory frame.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.740
Maybe that's the frame in which
Professor Klute was stationary.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.257
It has an origin and
has axis x, y, and z.

00:00:33.257 --> 00:00:34.840
And then we have a
moving frame, which

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.920
is moving with a constant
velocity with respect

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.320
to the laboratory frame.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.240
The origin is o prime.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.500
The axes are x prime,
y prime, and z prime.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.200
All right, so now what
do we learn from this?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.505
Let's think about an example.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.120
An example most of
you have experienced

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.450
before is the one where
you sit in a train car.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.680
And, if it's not a train car,
it can be a car or a plane,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.860
something which is moving
with respect to Earth.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.790
If you look out of the
window and the acceleration

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.900
is very, very minor,
it's often not clear

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.620
whether or not the Earth, the
train station, or the train car

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.710
is moving.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.790
And so you have this kind of
weird feeling that, you know,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.070
I don't know if maybe the
neighboring train started

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.600
moving or I'm moving.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.300
But what we're
going to do here is

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.735
describe you sitting
in the train car,

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:41.320
reading a newspaper, once
within your laboratory frame,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.600
within the frame of
the train, and then we

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.940
want to describe the very
same events or sequence

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.520
of events in the frame of
the stationary train station.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.340
All right, let's look
at a specific example.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.080
Here again our professor
is exploding at a time tP

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.890
at xP, yP, and zP.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.419
To make this a little bit
easier, we define, at time t

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.170
equals 0, the origin of
the two frames coincide.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.020
That just means
that, at the origin,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.450
we have two clocks, two watches.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.110
And we make sure that
they're synchronized.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.080
And then my watch stays with
me, and then the second watch

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.453
may be with you,
which moves along.

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:31.620
And those are great watches.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.570
They are synchronized.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.670
We also want to
simplify-- we can always

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.240
define the direction of
our coordinate system

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.720
such that the velocity,
the relative velocity

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.190
between the two
reference frames,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.860
is in one specific direction.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.820
And here I decided to use x.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.930
I could have used y
and z, and I could

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.600
rotate the coordinate systems
or the relative movement

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.070
of the coordinate
systems in any way.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.870
It's just a simplification here.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.430
When I do that, I can
rewrite this event P

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.660
in the S prime frame through the
S frame in the following way.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.260
So, for x, we find that xP is
given by-- x prime P is given

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.980
by xP minus v, the velocity,
relative velocity--

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.620
I could put a little
label x here--

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.360
times tP.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.970
And then, for the y-coordinates
and the z-coordinates,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.390
there's no change.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.520
For the time, intuitively,
you say that those two watches

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.360
are run with the
same speed, meaning

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.510
that the time in both frames for
the same events are the same.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.550
So now I'm asking you, if
you're watching this video,

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.500
to find the velocity
and the acceleration.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.920
It might be good to stop
and just write this down.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.740
So find the velocity and
acceleration of S prime,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.010
of S prime expressed
by the S-coordinates.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.190
So let's try to do that.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.500
So, first, we build the
derivative dx prime dt prime,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.720
which is our velocity.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.470
That's the velocity of an
object in my prime frame.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.160
And that's given by d dt--

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.600
I can just do that here because
the times are the same--

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.640
times x minus vt.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.899
That's [? x, ?] ux, the
velocity in my S frame,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.360
minus v. That's really
what you expect.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.820
You just subtract or
add the velocities.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.510
If I then build
the acceleration,

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.070
I have to build the
derivative of u x prime, which

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.540
is our acceleration,
in the prime frame.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.000
Here again I just do
this in x-direction

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.880
because the solution for the
y-direction and z-direction

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.050
are trivial.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.200
So now I find d
ux dt minus dv dt.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.905
Now, the velocity,
as we defined,

00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:53.780
between the two reference
frames is constant.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.140
Therefore, this is 0,
meaning that the velocity--

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.350
the accelerations in the
two frames are the same.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.510
If the accelerations
are the same,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.520
that means that the forces in
the two frames are the same.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.210
And that means that the
forces or the accelerations

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.200
are invariant.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.020
They do not change based on
the reference frame that I use.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.360
So now, coming
back to the example

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.120
we discussed in our
very first lecture,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.820
you are experiment
in the train car.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:32.110
S, the velocity between
those two frames,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.050
the frame in your car or a
second frame, are constant.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.270
There's no way to tell
whether or not your train

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.460
car is moving or not.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.590
That is only true as
long as the velocities

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.330
are constant and
unchanged, constant.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.020
So, in summary, in
Newton's mechanics,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.200
time and accelerations are
invariant and, therefore,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.300
also the forces.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.660
There is no inertial frame
which is above another one.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.920
So you can pick one or
can pick another one.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.700
There's no difference in the
descriptions of the physics

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.910
between those two frames.

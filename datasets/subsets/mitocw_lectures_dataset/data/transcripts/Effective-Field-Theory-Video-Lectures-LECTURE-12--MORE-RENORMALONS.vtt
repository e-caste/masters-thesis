00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.210
IAIN STEWART: So where were we?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.330
So last time, we were
talking about MS-bar scheme

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.300
and renormalons.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.920
And so we talked about
the MS-bar scheme.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.180
We talked about renormalons.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.580
And we said that we could
introduce a mass scheme that

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.790
has an arbitrary power log
cutoff, which we called R

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.420
to distinguish it from mu, or
lambda or some other cutoff.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.620
And so the idea of
this scheme right

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.558
here was perturbing
a way from MS-bar

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:55.100
to get rid of this
renormalon problem

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.430
that MS-bar has, but retain all
the nice features of MS-bar.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.450
In particular, we don't really
want to calculate anything new

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.379
if we can avoid it.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.510
And that's what this scheme
does because really what it does

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.600
is it uses the fact that we
know that the MS-bar scheme has

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.280
this renormalon.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.740
So this series here
has a renormalon.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.530
And it just takes that
series over from MS-bar,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.350
puts it in with a
cutoff, which is this R,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.795
and defines a new mass
scheme using that formula.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.520
So this is like a
mass scheme that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.710
has an adjustable cutoff,
which we can take to be

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.310
at whatever scale we want.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.830
And in particular,
at HQET, you'd

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.280
want to take that R to be
something like a GeV type scale

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.980
because that wouldn't
spoil your power counting.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.600
So recall, in HQET,
that this delta m

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.900
should be, by power counting,
or order lambda QCD.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.730
So technically, you would take
R somewhat greater than lambda

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.405
QCD, but of order lambda QCD.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.570
OK.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.310
So now, we have
this extra cutoff.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.350
So when we have a cutoff, we
have a renormalization group.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.200
And if you think about
the renormalization

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.789
group for MS-bar mass, it
would be something like mu

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.710
d by d mu of M of mu is equal
to anomalous dimension times M

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.325
of mu back again.

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:16.575
This one's a little different.

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:19.140
It's R d by dR of
M of R. And then

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.060
there's no M on the
right-hand side.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.250
It's an additive renormalization
to get rid of the renormalon.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.640
And there's a power,
also, of R here.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.910
So it's not just summing logs.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.310
It is summing some logs related
to the running of alpha,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.058
but it's also got this power.

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:38.850
And when you solve this
anomalous dimension

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.258
equation, which we
talked about last time,

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:42.300
you get an integral like.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.060
In this t variable and
at leading log order,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.030
it looks like this, difference
of two incomplete gamma

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.200
functions.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.000
Because of the
mass dimensions, it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.530
has to be made up
by mass dimensions

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.940
on the right-hand side.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.530
Coupling is dimensionless.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.230
The only thing that has
dimensions is lambda QCD.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.660
And that's exactly what pops
out of solving this equation.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.890
The R gets converted to a
lambda QCD by this formula here.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.270
This g of t was just
t at lowest order.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.140
So this is an
all-order form here.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.345
And this is the leading
log solution there.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:15.720
So if we look at
that leading log

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.060
and what is the t0
or the t1, that's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.540
just the same formula
here, but with alpha

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.560
at R1 and R0, the
boundary conditions.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.570
We want to run from R0 to R1.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.860
And this formula tells
us how to do that.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.760
And we get a result here
that has the coupling at R0

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.820
and the coupling at R1.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.510
OK, so if we look at that
result, it's interesting.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.360
Because if we just had one
of these gamma functions,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.280
these incomplete gamma
functions, then we

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.950
would have a renormalon.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.050
And that's where I
stopped last time.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.760
So just looking at this
lambda QCD times gamma

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.860
and expanding in a
series of about 0, which

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.860
is expanding in the
coupling at infinity,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.540
you get this series, which
has a 2 to the n n factorial.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.860
It's an asymptotic series.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.020
This is a classic
example of a function

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.570
that has an asymptotic series,
this incomplete gamma function.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.860
There's some exponential
that combines together

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.829
with the lambda QCD to give an
R. So I pulled that out front.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.200
And then we have this
series, which is exactly u

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.850
equals 1/2 renormalon.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.490
And the u equals 1/2 had to
do with this power 2 to the n

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.190
here, the fact that
it's 2 to the n and not

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.770
some other number.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.310
But if we take the
difference here--

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.190
and this is what I said in
words last time, but now

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.360
I'll write it down in equations.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.310
If we take the difference
there, that actually

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.000
doesn't have this renormalon.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.710
So this is the difference
of two series, each of which

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.710
is asymptotic.

00:05:02.932 --> 00:05:04.390
If we want to
compare those series,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.565
we should expand them in
the same coupling constant.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.720
So let me do that.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.290
So if I take the difference
of those two series using this

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.260
formula, but now I re-expand all
these alphas in terms of alphas

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.123
at the R1 scale--

00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:52.540
so when they're
at the R0 scale, I

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.790
re-expand them in terms
of alpha at the R1 scale.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.050
Do some rearranging.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.440
I can write the result
in this form as this.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.330
So the key thing is
that difference there.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.810
And if you think about
what this sum here is,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.630
this is kind of like an
exponential, something

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.250
to a power, k factorial.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.597
Except it's limited to n.

00:06:12.597 --> 00:06:14.930
So if I really went all the
way up to n equals infinity,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.880
this would be just giving
actually exponential

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.275
of R1 over R0.

00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:23.150
It would cancel the R0 over R1,
which would then cancel the 1.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.420
You can rearrange the
series a little bit

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.616
to make it more obvious
that it's convergent.

00:06:47.925 --> 00:06:49.550
Because there is this
n factorial here.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.650
And you might worry,
well, this thing here

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.560
has to fall fast enough to
get rid of that n factorial.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.130
So write this thing out,
this 1, as an infinite series

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.340
of terms from 0 to infinity
of the same form as this.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.390
And then what you're left
with is the following thing.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.000
All the terms from
0 to n cancel.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.250
And then you're just left
with the terms from n plus 1

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.396
to infinity.

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:23.670
And then you can see
that the n factorial

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.040
is being tamed by another
factorial growth, which

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.710
is always of a greater
power, n plus 1.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.670
OK, so this is a
number less than 1.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.900
And this thing here, beta 0
alpha over 2 pi times the log,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.368
is also something
that's less than 1.

00:07:39.368 --> 00:07:41.160
It's exactly the thing
that you sum up when

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.928
you're running the coupling.

00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:44.220
So this is a convergent series.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.600
And basically the
physics of it is

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.350
we had this mass that
didn't have a renormalon,

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.257
but it had an arbitrary scale.

00:08:04.257 --> 00:08:06.340
And what the renormalization
group allows us to do

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.243
is move to another scale.

00:08:08.243 --> 00:08:09.910
When we move to another
scale, it better

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.340
be that we don't
reintroduce the renormalon.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.510
And the fact that I can write
this as a convergent series

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.170
shows very explicitly
that I'm not

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.140
having that problem in the
difference between these two.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.330
So it's renormalon free.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.870
And it remains renormalon
free when we change the scale.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.150
And we can sum up
these logarithms

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.780
that have to do with
changing the scale.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.970
Why would you care about that?

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.080
Well, imagine that you extract
this mass from some B physics.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.040
So you take an r.
that's of order GeV.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.410
And then you say, well,
that's a very precise number.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.835
But how do I use it for,
say, a LHC phenomenology?

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:06.960
Well, if I want to connect
it to LHC phenomenology,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.020
I probably want to convert
to the MS-bar scheme

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.430
because LHC is high energy.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.950
Maybe I'm doing Higgs to bb-bar.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.600
Bb-bar-- very energetic, so we
want to use the MS-bar scheme.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.903
But I've got this mass
at a very low scale.

00:09:20.903 --> 00:09:22.320
What you would
want to do is you'd

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.240
want to use them the
renormalization group,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.260
run it up to the mass scale Mb,
switch schemes from this scheme

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.740
where you extracted
the mass to MS-bar.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.170
You'd get a correspondingly
precise value of a MS-bar

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.170
because the series between
this mass and the MS-bar mass

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.920
is, again, a
renormalon free series.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.150
And then you could take
that mass at the Mb scale,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.160
run it up to, say,
the Higgs scale,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.122
and use it for phenomenology.

00:09:46.122 --> 00:09:47.580
So you always want
to be able to go

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.165
back and forth between schemes.

00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:51.540
And if different schemes have
different scales associated

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.020
to them, then you need to
the renormalization group

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.200
in order to put them at
the same scale where you

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.900
want to do the conversion, OK?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.900
So that's why being
able to sum up

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.930
these logarithms without
reintroducing any renormalon

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.758
problems is important.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.370
And in general, if you were
to try to do this with MS-bar,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.130
it wouldn't work.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.730
You don't really have
a way of treating

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.800
the renormalon in the
MS-bar scheme when

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.800
you're talking about physics
below the mass of the particle.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.500
OK, so we can generalize
this little discussion here,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.730
which was a fixed order
leading log discussion.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.430
And I can write down for
you just what would happen

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.070
if I were to formally
integrate this integral here

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.640
without making any
expansion in alpha S, OK?

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.590
So express gamma R of t
as an infinite series.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.500
And it's an infant
series in alpha S.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.140
That means it's an infinite
series in 1 over t.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.550
We had an expression for this
capital G of t last time, which

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.310
again was an infinite series.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.200
Just plug in those
infinite series.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.490
Do all the integrals.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.420
They all turned out to be
incomplete gamma functions, OK?

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:29.280
So we can write
down a formula which

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.350
is an all-order
generalization of that result

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.737
just to see what happens
at higher orders.

00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:36.570
So basically, we would
have something like--

00:11:49.495 --> 00:11:52.260
if I look back at
what g of t was,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.450
we'd have something like this.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.760
And then all the
rest of the terms

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:05.430
we can expand out in an inverse
Taylor series in 1 over t.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.193
So just there's
two terms in g of t

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.610
I want to keep in
the exponential.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.860
And then the rest of them I
can expand out and combine

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.568
with these terms.

00:12:11.568 --> 00:12:13.440
And that just gives
me some series.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.620
And I can do these integrals.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:37.390
So writing the integrand out,
we can just establish some

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:47.858
notation for it for that
infinite series of 1 of t's.

00:12:47.858 --> 00:12:49.525
And we'll just call
the coefficients Sj.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.075
There is 1 over t.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.050
Yeah.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.198
So this gamma bar
starts as a 1 over t.

00:13:07.198 --> 00:13:12.438
So really it should be a
[INAUDIBLE] 1 over t here.

00:13:12.438 --> 00:13:13.980
That's where this
1 over t came from.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.730
So then integrate
that, and that gives us

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.770
a generalization of this
formula here where we

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:31.590
say that M of R1 minus
M of R0 where we work

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.180
at some order in the
resummation, what you would say

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.680
is, N to the KLL.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.930
So you have leading
log, next leading log,

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.120
next to next leading log.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.970
And when you have K
of them, you say NKLL.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.520
And the solution
of that equation

00:13:50.520 --> 00:14:00.600
would be the k-th order lambda
QCD and then this series.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:12.060
And instead of just the 0-th
incomplete gamma function,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.430
we get a slightly different one.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.290
But it's got the same
kind of structure

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.420
where we get the difference
of gamma functions.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.550
And these S's are
just whatever you

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.230
get from the
anomalous dimension,

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.985
so kind of simple notation.

00:14:50.132 --> 00:14:51.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.220
So they're just some
combination of numbers.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.110
And the twiddles here
is just my shorthand

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.790
for accounting for
a fact that there's

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.500
some beta 0s floating around.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.500
So this is just algebra.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.650
And these b1 hats
and b2 hats were

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.790
things that showed up in
the beta function of QCD,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.250
which we also talked
about last time.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.920
So we defined those last time.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.370
The b1 hat and b2 hat were
just combinations of the beta 1

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:29.120
and beta 2 and beta 0.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.600
So these are some numbers
that you can calculate

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.338
given the anomalous dimensions.

00:15:33.338 --> 00:15:35.630
Given those numbers, you can
plug it into this formula.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.860
And then you have
a generalization

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.070
of the previous result.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.445
So whatever order you know
the anomalous dimension to you

00:15:42.445 --> 00:15:43.750
can use that solution.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.375
And we'll use it a little later
when I talk about some numbers.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.750
All right, so any
questions so far?

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.380
There's a similar
thing for MS-bar mass.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.395
If you were summing
logs of the MS-bar mass,

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:04.770
there's an all-orders
formula you

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.263
could write down
and use once you

00:16:07.263 --> 00:16:09.130
know the anomalous dimensions.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.340
You could find it in the
particle data book I think.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.810
All right, so just coming back
to this comment about the fact

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.450
that the anomalous dimension
is renormalon free--

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.205
so the fact that the solution
here was renormalon free,

00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:31.080
that the difference here
was renormalon free,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.600
was because there
was no renormalon

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.100
on the right-hand side here and
that the anomalous dimension

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.668
was renormalon free.

00:16:37.668 --> 00:16:39.210
And it was constructed
from something

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:44.940
that had a renormalon,
which is this delta M,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.330
but it was a derivative
of that delta M.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:53.440
And so the derivative
kills the renormalon.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:00.430
So this thing is free of the
delta M of order lambda QCD

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.655
renormalon because that
renormalon is a constant.

00:17:04.655 --> 00:17:06.030
And when you take
the derivative,

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.170
you kill the constant.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.869
That's how you can think of it.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.500
If you start writing
out the gamma functions,

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.714
then you see that it looks like
you're finding the renormalon.

00:17:16.714 --> 00:17:18.089
But then there's
some differences

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:21.030
that show up and cancel it off.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.810
So the way that that
works, it's kind

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.310
of like this where
you sort of think

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.630
that you have the
renormalon, but then you

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.760
realize there's another
term and it cancels it off.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:55.760
So if we look back at
our formula for delta M,

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.660
this had an infinite
series of a's.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.310
This was like a sum over
sum a n's, and some alpha

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.300
to the n, some other factors.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.370
And these gammas are
just related to the a's.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.940
But they're not just
related to the a's.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.330
They're also factors of the
beta function that come in.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.390
So just to give you an idea--

00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:28.890
so once you know the scheme
conversion to the scheme

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.670
and you know the
anomalous dimension

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.930
and if you look at this
series and you think about

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.910
whether the series for
the anomalous dimension

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:48.570
is convergent or
asymptotic, you can sort of

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.702
identify the pattern of how
these coefficients look.

00:18:51.702 --> 00:18:53.160
And basically, if
you, for example,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.460
look at the bubble
sum, this a n plus 1

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.250
would be something
that has an n factorial

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.720
2 beta 0 to the n plus 1--

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.060
sorry, to the n growth.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:14.640
And then this thing here is
n minus 1 factorial to beta 0

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.040
to the n minus 1.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.690
And then there's this extra
2n beta 0 that multiplies it.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.390
And you can see that there
is an exact cancellation.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.220
One way of probing
the renormalon

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.780
is just to look
at the bubble sum.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.900
And the bubble sum gave us a
particular value of these a's.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.115
And you can see that the bubble
sum renormalon is cancelling

00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:38.240
out between the terms here.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.550
So that's just an expression
of what I said over here.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.400
That's the kind of more
definite expression of the fact

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.657
that this thing is actually
free of the renormalon.

00:19:59.717 --> 00:20:01.550
So I'm going to put
this aside for a minute.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.470
And we'll come back in to
use this formula a little bit

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.580
later in today's lecture.

00:20:08.698 --> 00:20:11.240
So there's sort of two ways that
you can use this technology.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.660
You can use it as a means
of doing what I said,

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.450
of connecting masses
at different scales

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.450
and doing phenomenology.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.160
And we'll come back to
that a little bit later.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.163
But you could also use it as
a probe of the renormalon.

00:20:23.163 --> 00:20:25.580
So one thing that you might
complain about with the bubble

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.757
sum is that it's just some
arbitrarily chosen way

00:20:28.757 --> 00:20:29.840
of probing the renormalon.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.150
And maybe there's some
problem where you don't

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.620
have light fermions around.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.500
Maybe you only have gluons.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.160
And there could still be a
renormalon in those problems.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.730
So how would you
deal with that if you

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.280
didn't have the light
quarks available to make up

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.000
this bubble sum?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.950
Or maybe there's
some renormalon that

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.010
just so happens you don't
see it with the quarks.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.270
There's no guarantee of that.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.220
So you'd like to have
some other mechanism

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.900
for looking for renormalons.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.570
And you can actually use
the renormalization group

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.657
to do that, which is
kind of interesting.

00:20:58.657 --> 00:20:59.990
So I'll show you how that works.

00:21:10.935 --> 00:21:12.560
A nice thing about
this is that it also

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.310
makes it clear how
the renormalon relates

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.427
to the Landau pole.

00:21:16.427 --> 00:21:17.510
So we'll see that as well.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.912
So take our solution
for the RGE,

00:21:28.912 --> 00:21:30.870
which we could write in
terms of this integral.

00:21:41.768 --> 00:21:43.810
And let's consider what
this integral actually is

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.060
doing in the complex t plane.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:58.210
So the t's are negative,
and so they look like this.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.540
The Landau pole where
the coupling blows up

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.920
is where the t goes to 0.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.645
So the Landau pole
is at the origin.

00:22:08.822 --> 00:22:10.780
So this is what the
complex t plane looks like.

00:22:13.482 --> 00:22:15.440
And what we're doing when
we do the integral is

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.040
we're just doing an integral
over that little range

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.690
here, right?

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.460
So we're far away
from the Landau pole.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.418
And that's why everything
was nicely convergent

00:22:24.418 --> 00:22:28.210
and you could connect
one mass to another.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.220
But you could ask, what
happens if I take this t0

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.240
and I move it somewhere
else in this picture?

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.720
And that's what
we're going to do.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.980
So let's consider the
limit where R0 goes to 0.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.240
If R goes to 0 and you
look back at the formula

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.150
that we had that converts
between the MS-bar mass

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:56.375
and this M of R, you'll see
that M of R0 goes to M pole.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.420
Because we had a power of
R times a series of alpha

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.010
of R's, which are
just logs of R.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.380
The power always
wins, and so the mass

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:11.990
goes to the pole mass and
that limit that R0 goes to 0.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:20.420
And if you look
at what T0 is, T0

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.730
is related to the
coupling, which

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.850
I could write in terms
of a log of lambda QCD.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:30.390
And T0 is basically in this
limit going to plus infinity.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.200
So what happens is, if I want
to get back to the pole mass

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.010
from one of these masses, I
basically have to take this guy

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.830
and move out to
infinity, which means

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.800
I have to make a choice about
going around that Landau pole.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.036
So basically, you're
taking your RGE

00:24:04.036 --> 00:24:06.530
and you're pushing
it into a region

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:12.680
where you're no longer
completely perturbative

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.640
and that you're forced to
continue by Landau pole.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.698
Now, you can actually
avoid the Landau pole.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.770
It's true that
the series becomes

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.230
non-perturbative in this
region, but you could go way up

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.350
here and come back over there.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.800
So you can actually
formally stay

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.720
in a region in the
complex plane where

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.615
you're perturbation theory
is still applicable.

00:24:45.615 --> 00:24:47.490
But you still have to
decide which way you're

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.320
going to go around it.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.490
And so that introduces
an ambiguity.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:19.627
So doing that, say we
go above or something.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:34.520
And if you plug in this result,
the lowest order leading log

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:48.600
result, you get this integral.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.580
And this integral,
you know, you have

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.603
to go around the t equals 0
pole because t1 is negative.

00:25:55.603 --> 00:25:58.020
So it turns out that you can
actually take this integral--

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.180
and I'm going to leave
this for your problem set--

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:21.115
and write it in the
form of a Borel integral

00:26:21.115 --> 00:26:25.360
with an exponential that's
exactly the Borel transform

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.750
variable.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.410
So I just change the
variable from t to u.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.840
So I get this integral.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:38.330
And if you do that, what
you find is that f of u

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:43.800
is proportional to
1 over u minus 1/2.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.800
AUDIENCE: What's the lower
limit of integration?

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.136
IAIN STEWART: 0.

00:26:47.136 --> 00:26:47.636
Yeah.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.590
OK, so you can actually see that
the RGE and what was the Landau

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.710
pole here is effectively,
in this integral here,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.050
becoming this Borel
pole at u equals 1/2.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.970
And that makes a little
more clear the fact

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.570
that these poles are related
to the non-perturbative physics

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.260
that's in the coupling
and the infrared physics.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.220
So formally, this
actually allows

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:31.950
you to set up a method of
trying to find the renormalon.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.900
You can ask, given some
series, if I sort of construct

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.393
this thing, what if I
just had this attitude

00:27:40.393 --> 00:27:42.810
that we want to pick that
series to cancel the renormalon?

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.227
Now, take the
attitude, what if we

00:27:44.227 --> 00:27:47.150
didn't know that that
series had a renormalon?

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.860
I could still throw it in,
make a change of variable

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.420
to some mass.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.160
If it's a convergent
series, then I'm

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.285
just defining some new mass.

00:27:55.285 --> 00:27:56.910
And I could go through
this technology.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:03.430
And it should turn out that, if
the series was OK, so to speak,

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.510
then you wouldn't
find this renormalon.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.920
You wouldn't find a pole there.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.540
I won't go through
this in detail

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:17.520
because it is a bit
tricky to derive.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.570
But you can derive what's called
a sum rule for the renormalon,

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:25.560
which is another way of
probing it by basically

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.270
taking our all-order solution.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.400
So I took our leading
log solution here, right?

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.850
If I did the same thing
with the all-order solution,

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.360
I could also take the
Borel transform of that.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.675
And that, if I do that, gives me
this thing called the sum rule.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.870
So it's just manipulating
an infinite series.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:08.530
And Mathematica can sum
some of them up for you.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:14.430
So it's just tedious.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:29.890
And what you find is a formula
for the residue of the Borel

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.610
pole.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.850
So let me call
that residue P 1/2.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.110
And the answer is
actually pretty simple.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.450
So these S's were
these coefficients

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.040
that were showing
up in our solution

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.620
for the all-orders RGE.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.410
P 1/2 is a series
which will tell me

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.810
the residue of the pole.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:13.980
So that means that, if
P 1/2 is not equal to 0,

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.650
then you have a u
equals 1/2 pole.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:32.900
And if 1/2 is equal to 0, then
you have no u equals 1/2 pole.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.140
Now, in practice, you don't
have an all-orders result.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.497
You only know a finite
number of these S's.

00:30:38.497 --> 00:30:40.580
So what you actually do
is you look at this series

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.000
and try to figure out where
it's converging to, OK?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.160
But actually, even
with the knowledge

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.120
that we have of the series, for
example, for the b quark mass,

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.390
you can very quickly see that
it has a u equals 1/2 pole.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.072
And you can even do
some error analysis

00:30:55.072 --> 00:30:56.030
by varying some things.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.810
And you get some kind of ID
of the theoretical uncertainty

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:02.000
from higher order
terms in the series.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.232
If you just formally, say, take
a series that's convergent,

00:31:06.232 --> 00:31:07.940
if I hand you a series
that's convergent,

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.760
you can calculate
all these SK's.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.410
And then you can very easily
see that actually there's no u

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.080
equals 1/2 pole.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.740
What happens is that all the
terms are cancelling in this

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.953
series, and you just get 0.

00:31:20.953 --> 00:31:23.120
So it's kind of like the
cancellations I was talking

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.480
about where I was cancelling
a poll in the anomalous

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.000
dimension, but here it's
happening in this thing if I

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.080
have a convergent series.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.050
So this is a way of probing
for renormalons, which

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.790
doesn't rely on the bubble sum.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.160
And it basically uses the
perturbative information

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.900
that you have available, whether
it's non-abelian or abelian

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.560
information.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.380
AUDIENCE: Iain?

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.100
IAIN STEWART: Yeah?

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.930
AUDIENCE: So when you did,
well, this calculation

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.740
here, that capital F, is it the
same result as we found a week

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.840
and a half ago or something
that has the renormalon at u

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.545
equals 1 and all
that stuff as well?

00:31:56.545 --> 00:31:58.788
IAIN STEWART: No, it's
just the u equals 1/2 pole.

00:31:58.788 --> 00:31:59.830
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:00.390
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:00.560
Yeah.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.340
AUDIENCE: So what happened
to the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.173
IAIN STEWART: Right.

00:32:03.173 --> 00:32:05.540
So what we've done here--

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.607
and actually, I'm just
going to come to this,

00:32:07.607 --> 00:32:08.440
but I'll foreshadow.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.690
So what we've done
here is we set up

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.870
a construction to remove
the u equals 1/2 pole.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.320
And we did not remove
any higher poles.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.460
We said the u equals 1/2
is the most important.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.390
Let's get rid of that
one from the MS-bar mass.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.710
There would be, in
principle, higher ones.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.500
And higher ones,
basically, we had

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:33.340
something that was proportional
to R. That's for u equals 1/2.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.840
If you wanted to
remove higher ones,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.660
you'd need terms proportional
to R squared, for example, for u

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.580
equals 1, et cetera.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.707
So we could have added
more terms to do more,

00:32:43.707 --> 00:32:44.290
but we didn't.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.930
We just sort of removed the
problem at u equals 1/2.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.910
And that's why, when
we go through this,

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.376
you only see a u
equals 1/2 pole.

00:32:51.376 --> 00:32:54.328
AUDIENCE: So if you wanted
to do [INAUDIBLE] analysis

00:32:54.328 --> 00:32:56.620
or something, you'd have to
change the result of this--

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:56.870
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.375
So the way you
should think about it

00:32:58.375 --> 00:33:00.250
is that basically what
you're doing is you're

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:04.300
setting up a scheme change that
perturbatively takes you out

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.580
of MS-bar towards
something else.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.260
You remove the u equals 1/2,
and you get rid of that problem.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.760
If you thought you had enough
perturbative accuracy that you

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.620
were seeing problems
related to u equals 1,

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.730
then you could make
further scheme change

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.490
with another series that's
proportional to R squared

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:21.982
to get rid of that one.

00:33:21.982 --> 00:33:23.860
AUDIENCE: Wait,
so the Landau pole

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.570
would tell you about
all the renormalons?

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.280
IAIN STEWART: It would tell you
about these ones, too. yeah,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.430
absolutely.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:33.610
So you can actually generalize
this for R to the P.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.680
And you can derive a
sum rule for R to the P.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.990
And it's a slightly more
complicated formula here.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.825
And then you'd have
the P over 2 pole.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:57.810
All right, OK, so the sum rule
is a probe, alternate probe,

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.468
for the renormalon.

00:34:08.432 --> 00:34:13.219
The nf bubbles are the classic
one that people know about.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:16.159
And this provides an alternate.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.659
The nice thing about
this is it also

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.480
provides a series that you can
look at the convergence, where

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.600
the nf bubbles just get a
result. See, nf bubbles are

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.449
good for finding
out whether or not

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:28.250
this thing has a renormalon.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.909
If you get some non-0 result,
then you expect that it does.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:35.300
This way you could actually
calculate the residue

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.900
if you wanted to know that
value for some reason.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.400
OK.

00:34:43.837 --> 00:34:46.123
Now, that actually might
be useful, for example,

00:34:46.123 --> 00:34:48.290
if you wanted to think about
higher renormalon poles

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.060
because you might
want to say, well,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.690
let me get rid of the first
one with whatever residue

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:54.800
I can best approximate
for and see if there's

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.827
another one underneath.

00:34:56.827 --> 00:34:58.910
There's not really enough
perturbative information

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.590
that we have about QCD to be
able to do that type of thing.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.185
There's a few cases where
u equals 1/2 is absent,

00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.810
and then you can do
that kind of thing.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.010
I mean, there's
actually many cases

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.300
where u equals 1/2
is absent, and you

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.230
can look for u equals 1.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.897
But looking for a
sub-leading renormalon

00:35:10.897 --> 00:35:15.080
is something that
nobody's found one.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.370
People sometimes
speculate about them

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.997
because maybe the residue of the
first one happens to be small.

00:35:23.997 --> 00:35:25.580
This would allow you
to test for that.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.320
In the tau decays
people talk about that.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:39.700
OK, so let's come back
and actually show you

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.340
how you can use this technology
for some phenomenological

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.570
stuff.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.180
And I want to do that by
generalizing our discussion

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.590
slightly away from masses
towards just a general operator

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.180
product expansion.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.240
So everything that we've
said here for masses

00:35:55.240 --> 00:36:02.020
can be applied more generally to
an operator product expansion.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.153
So let me show you what I mean.

00:36:05.153 --> 00:36:07.570
So let's first consider what
I mean by an operator product

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.980
expansion at MS-bar.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.847
So you can think of this like
maybe I'm integrating out

00:36:12.847 --> 00:36:13.555
a heavy particle.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.690
And I'm writing a
formula down, and it

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:21.100
has some Wilson coefficients.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.040
It has some operators.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.590
And it's a Taylor
series in this parameter

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:31.035
q, which is the hard
scale, high energy scale.

00:36:31.035 --> 00:36:32.410
And I'm basically
just expanding,

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:37.700
if you like, in lambda QCD
over Q. And the operators,

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.750
they're set by lambda QCD.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.960
So I'm going to take this
guy to be dimensionless.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.970
This is some
dimensionless observable.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.560
You can always make
it dimensionless

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.330
by a suitably choosing,
multiplying by appropriate math

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.810
scales.

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.150
So then this here will
be a dimensionless Wilson

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.180
coefficient.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.460
And it's a Wilson
coefficient in MS-bar.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.900
That's what the bar means.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.230
And so this is an MS-bar
operator, MS-bar matrix element

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.464
of some operator.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.562
And it's also dimensionless.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.365
So this guy will be
dimensionless, too.

00:37:21.365 --> 00:37:23.490
And finally, this guy will
have dimension equals 1.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.830
Now, at MS-bar, what's
beautiful about MS-bar

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:35.150
is that the series for these
coefficients are very simple.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.940
That's why people like
to compute in MS-bar.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:56.030
So if you look at what the
series for C bar looks like,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.670
the form of it is as follows.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.170
It's got dependence on mu
over Q and alpha s of mu.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:17.330
And these guys here are
not an arbitrary function

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.450
of mu over Q, but they're
really just some logs.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.430
So this looks like
a series of logs.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.830
So in MS-bar, you're only
seeing these logarithms.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:43.400
So that's good from a
computational point of view,

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.080
but we also know
that generically,

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.500
in this MS-bar approach,
you might get sensitivity

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.090
to renormalons.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.370
Also, another thing
we like about MS-bar

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:01.370
is that it satisfies all the
symmetries we want to keep.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:02.480
It doesn't mess them up.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.292
So it's Lorentz and
gauge invariant,

00:39:05.292 --> 00:39:06.500
which is always a good thing.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.190
And not only is it simple
for multi-loop computations,

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.310
but multi-loop computations are
not even done in other schemes

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.118
because they're
just too difficult.

00:39:21.118 --> 00:39:23.285
So it really makes multi-loop
computations possible.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.460
And the but, there's
only really this one but,

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:36.060
that it has this
renormalon issue.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.400
So we talked about
renormalon for a mass.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.910
And I just showed you what it
was, and then we explored it.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:50.960
Here, let me tell you what
the renormalon would be.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.170
So generically, what
the renormalon would be

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.920
is the following.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.250
You would have an ambiguity
in the coefficient C0

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:06.700
bar that's of the size lambda
QCD over whatever the scale

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.240
Q is.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:17.950
And you would have the same
ambiguity in this theta 1 bar.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.470
So this theta 1 bar, which
is an MS-bar matrix element

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:24.820
has an ambiguity, which
is of order lambda QCD.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.440
This guy has an ambiguity.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.570
And those ambiguities cancel.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.180
So you're dividing up the
physics again in MS-bar

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.850
into short distance physics
and long distance physics.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.970
And the interesting
thing is that there's

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.180
a piece of long distance
physics trapped in the C0

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.340
that, if you really
wanted, should

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.340
be physically in the theta
1 bar and vice versa.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:49.660
So really what's the
problem with MS-bar

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.160
is that there's a
piece of something

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.470
that you want in theta
1 bar, but ends up just

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.710
being in the C0 bar.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.400
And that's what I mean by this
that there is something here,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.280
which is infrared sensitive.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.730
Correspondingly, there is kind
of an ultraviolet sensitivity

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:04.660
in this theta 1 bar.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.013
And you'd like to
get that rearranged

00:41:07.013 --> 00:41:07.930
in an appropriate way.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:10.030
And that's like this
kind of rearrangement

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.910
we were making by changing
schemes for masses.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.670
Except here it's going
to be changing schemes

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.348
for Wilson coefficients.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:26.480
So this thing here is
what we would call a u

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.253
equals 1 renormalon.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.860
So what happens
with u equals 1 is

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.470
that you make a connection
between the leading order term

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.370
and the power suppressed term.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:43.030
That's what happens
with the delta C0 bar.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.900
So in order to flesh out a
little bit better what I just

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.240
said in words, let's
pretend that we

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.530
understand what the theory is.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.280
And let's just pretend
it's some integral.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.160
And I'll just show you
what is going on here.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:20.503
Let's imagine that our
theory is an integral.

00:42:20.503 --> 00:42:21.920
Instead of a quantum
field theory,

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.253
it's a one-dimensional integral.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.680
And it has two
scales, one which I'll

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.800
call lambda QCD, which
is some low scale,

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:39.170
and one which I'll call Q,
which is some high scale.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:42.500
And I'm using a notation where
the integral could diverge

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.190
and I regulate it with a
dimensional regularization type

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.800
parameter.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.383
So I'm doing a one
dimensional undergo

00:42:48.383 --> 00:42:50.415
but continuing it into
epsilon dimensions

00:42:50.415 --> 00:42:52.450
to regulate any divergences.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:59.540
So what MS-bar does with this
integral is it just says,

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.920
well, I'm not going to change
the limits of the integral.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.110
I'm just going to
either expand out this f

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.440
or expand out this denominator.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.000
I'll do two different
Taylor series,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.250
and then I'll put them together.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:17.330
And that's basically how
I'm identifying the terms

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:18.140
in my OPE.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:45.190
So MS-bar-- so I
sort of associate

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:49.420
there being a high energy
piece where k is of order Q.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.253
And then there's some
low energy piece.

00:43:53.253 --> 00:43:54.295
I don't change the limit.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:02.230
So in the low energy piece,
I keep the full function f.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.830
And then I expand
out the other thing.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:13.360
And if I drop the
dots in this formula,

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.720
I can identify these
integrals as toy models

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.860
for the things that are
appearing in my OPE.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.270
So let me write that OPE again.

00:44:29.602 --> 00:44:33.100
So here these things
are 1, this example.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.860
This integral here, which
is over high energy scales

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.140
k [INAUDIBLE] by Q is this guy.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.510
And this integral here, where
k is of order lambda QCD,

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:45.190
effectively, there's
a 1 over Q, which

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:49.630
is this 1 over Q. That's giving
me the operator, theta 1 bar.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.850
So Wilson coefficient
is the high energy piece

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.250
of the original thing.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:59.080
Matrix element here is
the low energy piece

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:04.420
which is suppressed by
1 over Q, but they both

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.200
came from the same
physics in the beginning.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.950
And I just was expanding
it because that's

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:10.117
how I wanted to organize it.

00:45:12.258 --> 00:45:14.800
Now, the thing about MS-bar is
that you integrate all the way

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.700
down to 0 there.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.000
And you integrate all the
way up to infinity here.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.160
And that's where the
renormalon problems come from.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:35.040
So this little procedure here
separates the long and short

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.920
distance physics for the logs.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.100
It does that correctly.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:50.570
But for powers, we
effectively rely on the fact

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:51.535
that it's at scale.

00:45:51.535 --> 00:45:52.670
This integral goes to 0.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.240
That's what's forced
upon us by the definition

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.440
of MS-bar and dimensional
regularization.

00:46:08.582 --> 00:46:11.710
And what goes wrong is basically
that physically we're still

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:14.770
integrating over regions of
those integrals which are not

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:18.190
associated to the physics that
should be in those parameters.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.903
So, now, this is a toy
example, but the same thing

00:47:04.903 --> 00:47:06.570
is happening in the
quantum field theory

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.070
when you think about what
you're doing when you write down

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.470
Feynman diagram and you
construct a Wilson coefficient.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:14.053
It's effectively the same thing
in dimensional regularization.

00:47:14.053 --> 00:47:16.620
You're integrating over
all values of momentum.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.310
And this little
kind of toy analogy

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:22.300
is actually apt for what's going
on in a true operator product

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.730
expansion.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:30.650
What would happen if you did
a Wilsonian picture in our toy

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:32.870
model?

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:35.120
Well, then you would cut off
the integrals explicitly.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.660
You'd say, let's introduce
some scale lambda f.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.970
I could still think of it
expanding in the same way.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.882
I don't need the dimensional
regularization anymore.

00:47:50.882 --> 00:47:53.410
So I'll set that,
get rid of that.

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:59.540
I think of breaking the integral
into two pieces, the low energy

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.040
and high energy pieces.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.740
And in each of those pieces,
I expand the integral

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:04.640
in different ways--

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:13.160
so same type of expansion, I'm
just regulating it differently.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.510
Now, I'm guaranteed
that this is high energy

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.120
and this is low energy.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.250
And you can write down
sort of what this is

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:21.680
a proxy for as a Wilsonian OPE.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.560
Mu gets replaced by
the scale lambda f.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.360
Everything gets a
W for Wilsonian.

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.680
Again, this is one
with our toy model.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.200
This guy is this guy now.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.270
This guy is this guy now.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.270
So it's a very similar
kind of association,

00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:59.770
but just the way
that we're treating

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.740
the integral is different.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.090
In this way of doing things,
you don't have any problem

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:06.020
with the renormalon.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:07.780
You just have an
explicit cutoff,

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.900
which says there's no
low energy part of this,

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:14.160
and there's no high
energy part of that.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:18.290
I'm not integrating
all the way down to 0

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.517
in the first integral, so
I don't have any problems

00:49:20.517 --> 00:49:21.350
with the renormalon.

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:24.020
The renormalon came from
infrared physics that

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.990
was happening near k equals 0.

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:30.750
And in this one, there's
no sort of problem

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:34.510
which would come from infinity.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:39.000
So in some sense, this
is what we'd like to do.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:51.540
And the but here is that
it causes difficulties

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.380
with symmetries.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.780
In particular, it generically
breaks gauge invariance

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.007
and Lorentz invariance.

00:50:12.254 --> 00:50:15.330
These get broken.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:19.050
And the calculations
that you would like to do

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:27.570
are just too difficult. I don't
know of anybody that's done--

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.030
maybe somebody's done two
loops in the Wilsonian picture,

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.580
but nobody's ever done three.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.820
So in some sense, you have
some nice things here.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.268
You have some nice things here.

00:50:37.268 --> 00:50:38.810
But they're not the
same nice things.

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.735
And you'd like to have something
that does the best of both.

00:50:41.735 --> 00:50:43.110
And that's
effectively what we're

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:45.395
doing when we construct
these R schemes.

00:50:45.395 --> 00:50:46.770
What we're doing
is we're saying,

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.570
well, let's take MS-bar
as a starting point

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.060
and try to get rid of
the problem that it has

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.320
by perturbing towards
a Wilsonian picture.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.940
So what would an R
scheme OPEC look like?

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.905
Start with MS-bar and
make a scheme change.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:28.660
And make a scheme change
here both to the operators

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:32.093
and make the same scheme
change to the coefficient.

00:51:32.093 --> 00:51:33.760
So I'm just really
moving things around.

00:51:45.053 --> 00:51:46.470
So let me just
formally write down

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.220
what such a scheme
change would look like.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.220
I set up some coefficients dn.

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:16.112
And I do a subtraction on
the operators and an addition

00:52:16.112 --> 00:52:18.070
on the coefficients in
the way I've written it.

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:24.550
So that's just a
rearrangement of the physics.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:31.980
And we've set it up so that the
result of that looks like this.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:50.000
I took, in this example,
C1 equal to 1 simplicity.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.080
A little more complicated
if I want to keep it,

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.150
but we could keep
it if we needed to.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.930
So basically, I've made
a rearrangement to some

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:02.300
equivalent OPE by just
changing the thing,

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.740
the definitions here, but I have
now the freedom to pick these

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.410
d's.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.035
And what I can do is
I can pick the d's

00:53:08.035 --> 00:53:11.350
to have the same renormalon
as the MS-bar scheme.

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.960
And, therefore, I can
iteratively, again,

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.400
remove the first
problematic term of this

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:22.300
to get a better
defined theta 1 in C0

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.520
just like we were
doing for the masses.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.165
So you can remove the u
equals 1, for example.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:43.450
You can remove the u equals 1
renormalon by choosing the d.

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.440
And that's exactly
what the Wilsonian

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.530
was trying to do for you.

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.910
And that's what it was doing for
you with putting this cutoff.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.690
MS-bar was having problems at 0.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:56.340
And we're sort of perturbatively
removing those problems,

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.393
perturbatively going towards
the Wilsonian picture.

00:53:59.393 --> 00:54:01.060
And the nice thing
about this is that we

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:03.850
can maintain the symmetries,
still gauge invariant, still

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:05.157
Lorentz invariant.

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.130
And we don't get the full sort
of power of the Wilsonian,

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:25.560
but we get closer to it.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.470
And we can, in some
sense, get as close

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:31.850
as we want, again, by sort
of perturbing this from order

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:34.020
by order.

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:37.160
So what we introduce is
power law dependence in R.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.987
And that power law
dependence, it's

00:54:39.987 --> 00:54:41.570
the analog of the
power law dependence

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:43.640
that would be in the
Wilsonian scheme.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.720
So when you have integrals like
this, you would have powers.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.470
There's nothing that
stops you from having

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.200
a complicated function
of Q over lambda.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.770
And what we're saying is that
the dominant kind of power law

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:57.320
sensitive terms here
and here are captured

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.640
by making this scheme change.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:25.790
So we decide that we
like MS-bar because we

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:31.330
have calculations that other
people have done hopefully.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:34.020
If they're three-loop
order, you certainly

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.443
hope that someone else spent
two years of their life on it

00:55:36.443 --> 00:55:37.110
rather than you.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:52.940
And you can take and perturb
your results from MS-bar

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:55.130
towards a gauge invariant,
Lorentz invariant

00:55:55.130 --> 00:56:00.450
version of the Wilsonian,
of the Wilsonian picture.

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:05.740
So let me give you
one example of that

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:11.000
to show you in practice,
putting in some numbers.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.880
Oh, I'm not quite there yet.

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:19.840
OK, so let me give you a
well-defined scheme which

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.560
is analogous to the scheme
that we just talked about,

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.130
which was MSR
scheme for the mass.

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:28.330
There's also an MSR
scheme for the OPE.

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:31.120
And again, the attitude is
let's not calculate anything new

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.160
that we don't have to.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:37.000
So we'll reuse the
coefficients of MS-bar.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.990
Those coefficients
had the renormalon.

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:43.960
So if those coefficients
were, we called them

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:48.160
a few minutes ago,
bn mu over Q, we just

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.660
reuse these at a
different scale.

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.760
So what we do is we
say dn of mu over R

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.740
is defined to be
the bn of my over R.

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:04.810
So these guys were the
MS-bar coefficients.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:06.280
These guys are
whatever we decide

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.930
to put into the
series over there.

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:09.560
Just take them to be equal.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.130
That's the MSR scheme.

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:16.570
And then if you look at what
the coefficient is, if we just

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:19.680
write out explicitly
what the coefficient is

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.530
by plugging in the
series, you can again

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.720
see how it's providing a cutoff.

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.950
So this was our
original MS-bar series,

00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:46.460
bn of mu over Q. We introduce
a subtraction, which

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:51.560
is suppressed by R over Q
times the same series bn.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.500
And this R is providing
kind of like a power law

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:58.310
cutoff on a problem
that this guy had,

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:00.660
exactly the power law cutoff.

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.080
So again, if you look at the
renormalon in this thing,

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.530
this combined thing, the
renormalon is independent of R

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:18.060
and Q. So you would just plug
in the bubble series result.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.820
You'd find, actually, that the
R over Q here would cancel out.

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:24.630
And so that these would just
exactly cancel each other.

00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:36.197
The u equals 1 [INAUDIBLE] 1.

00:58:36.197 --> 00:58:38.280
And again, if I wanted to
probe other renormalons,

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.615
I'd have to consider other
powers besides R over Q.

00:58:40.615 --> 00:58:42.810
But those actually,
in this OPE, would be

00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:45.000
connected to other operators.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.467
So there is other
sub-leading renormalons here,

00:58:47.467 --> 00:58:49.800
which could be connected to
1 over Q squared, et cetera,

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.530
et cetera.

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:54.390
And in MS-bar, that
generically will happen.

00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:56.580
But usually, it
suffices just to worry

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:59.220
about the first one
since many people

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.800
in the community that do these
multi-loop calculations don't

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.092
even worry about the first one.

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:12.180
Anyway, OK, so you can
again, after you've

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:15.600
got this definition, you
could actually formally write

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.760
this as C0 bar [INAUDIBLE] Q, mu
if you want to think about what

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:26.550
it is, minus R over Q,
same Wilson coefficient,

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:30.378
replacing all the
Q's by R. So that's

00:59:30.378 --> 00:59:31.920
another way of saying
what the scheme

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.620
change is from MS-bar
results to this result.

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:42.345
And this R is acting
like an IR cutoff

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:43.930
to get rid of the bad problem.

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:53.000
And again, we have a
renormalization group.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:59.515
So R d by dR of this
Wilson coefficient,

00:59:59.515 --> 01:00:01.890
it's convenient to think about
that renormalization group

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:07.920
with the log cutoff mu set
equal to the power law cutoff R.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.660
And it's very much
like our masses.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:14.280
There's some function
with an R in front.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:18.940
And we could formally
write down solutions to it.

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:21.420
And we can explicitly
plug in results

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.920
given how many
terms in the series

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.480
we know in the MS-bar series.

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:31.400
So all the anomalous dimensions
of this Wilson coefficient

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.160
would be determined
by the MS-bar series,

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.420
the original one,
because the scheme

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.600
that redefining is set up so
that it uses those [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.782
coefficients.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.730
So what would the RGE look like?

01:01:03.665 --> 01:01:05.290
It's the same kind
of structure as what

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:14.008
we have for masses,
some gamma functions.

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:30.730
And you can think
of this as some C0.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.620
If you want kind of to have
a more standard notation,

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.700
you would say that this
is some U function.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.030
And this is a bit of abuse
of notation, actually, here

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:46.363
because it's additive,
not multiplicative.

01:01:46.363 --> 01:01:48.280
But if you allow me to
put this guy into here,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.660
then I could always
write it this way.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.880
And I'll just do
that for convenience.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.510
So I want to show you one
example of how this plays out

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.020
in practice.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:00.200
And it's related to
our discussion of HQET.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.430
So one thing that
we said about HQET

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:04.555
is that you could calculate
the following quantity.

01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:18.658
So HQET makes some
predictions about the B star

01:02:18.658 --> 01:02:19.950
and the B. They were connected.

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:21.810
They were in a
symmetry multiplet.

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:25.370
And when you took the
difference of the B star and B

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:27.120
and you took this
combination, it actually

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.245
is purely perturbative.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.120
Because there's a
non-perturbative parameter.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.440
But if you treat the
charm quark as heavy,

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.380
it's the same for
charm and bottom.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.220
And it cancels out.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.130
So you can actually write down
an MS-bar operator product

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:48.790
expansion, which is
technically defined in HQET.

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:51.100
And what it looks like
is the first thing

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.930
is just a ratio of
Wilson coefficients.

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:55.957
So we talked about this.

01:02:55.957 --> 01:02:58.040
And we plugged in this
sort of leading log result.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.207
And we saw that it was
working actually pretty well.

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:06.170
And if you were to kind
of look at higher order

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:08.510
terms in that OPE, there would
be some power corrections

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:09.010
to that.

01:03:11.682 --> 01:03:13.140
They've got some
traditional names.

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.530
The names are not too important.

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:20.517
But this is like the analog
of the 1 over Q term.

01:03:20.517 --> 01:03:21.600
This is the 1 over Q term.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.210
This is the leading order term,
which was purely perturbative.

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.502
There's no matrix element here.

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:26.640
It's just 1.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.680
This is a higher
dimension operator.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:34.260
This guy scales like lambda QCD
cubed over lambda QCD squared.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.930
This is just lambda QCD.

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.307
So that's like the
lambda QCD over Q term.

01:03:41.307 --> 01:03:43.140
And this is the formula
you would write down

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.182
if you wanted to make a
prediction for this thing

01:03:45.182 --> 01:03:49.380
at higher precision in MS-bar.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.930
So what happens if I think
about this perturbative result

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:53.860
at higher orders?

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.000
So people have actually
calculated that coefficient

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.508
to three-loop order.

01:03:57.508 --> 01:03:58.800
And here's where it looks like.

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:06.865
So at order alpha,
you get minus 0.113.

01:04:06.865 --> 01:04:11.930
At order alpha squared,
you get minus 0.078.

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:19.174
And then you get another
minus 0.0755 at alpha cubed.

01:04:19.174 --> 01:04:22.683
It doesn't look so
pretty, all right?

01:04:22.683 --> 01:04:24.600
So each order that you
calculate is giving you

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.040
a correction about the same
size as the previous order.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.230
Well, you might say, of
course, there's logs.

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.600
So I should resum the logs.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.790
So let's resum the
logs, so leading log.

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:45.360
And then since I have higher
order anomalous dimensions,

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.440
let me put in next leading log.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.940
And actually, I
have one more order.

01:04:50.940 --> 01:05:00.300
So let me put that in, too,
[? 908 ?] next leading log.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.240
Uh-oh, all right?

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.820
So this is the one that we
actually talked about earlier.

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:09.080
And that one is actually
close to the data.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.300
The leading log result was sort
of close to what the data was.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.422
But when you think about
whether that's actually right

01:05:17.422 --> 01:05:19.380
and you calculate the
higher order corrections,

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:23.160
you find that you're moving
away from the data, right?

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.700
And again, it's not convergent.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.100
Summing the logs
has not helped you.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.100
And that's because what
we're talking about here

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.525
has nothing to do with logs.

01:05:30.525 --> 01:05:31.710
It has to do with powers.

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:36.360
It's the renormalon that's
causing this problem, OK?

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.050
So we could throw up our hands
and say, oh, it doesn't work.

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:42.780
Or we could try to
do something better.

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.750
So let me show you what happens
if we do some of this stuff

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:48.190
that I've been
telling you about.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:52.462
So this guy has a u
equals 1 renormalon.

01:05:52.462 --> 01:05:55.200
You can check that very
easily by doing a bubble sum.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.530
Switch to the MSR scheme.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.250
So we reuse our perturbative
information in MS-bar,

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:13.240
but just organize in a
more intelligent fashion.

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:34.493
So we define a
coefficient as above,

01:06:34.493 --> 01:06:35.910
saying that this
problem must have

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:38.260
to do with that renormalon.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:47.790
And then if we write down
what the OPE looks like,

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:51.680
we have, again, an OPE.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.270
And we've changed matrix
examined definitions as well

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:57.060
as Wilson coefficients
definitions.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:59.070
So I'm putting everything
in this scale R0.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:09.090
So that's just rewriting
the OPE in this new scheme.

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:17.670
When we look at this scheme and
we think about what's going on,

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:20.710
we want to choose the
R0 to be of order lambda

01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:23.395
QCD or a bit bigger.

01:07:23.395 --> 01:07:24.770
And the reason we
want to do that

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:26.030
is to preserve power counting.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.370
So power counting is important
when we're making expansions.

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:37.530
In some sense, it's key.

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:43.520
And if we thought that
the original MS-bar matrix

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:47.040
element was dominated
by the scale lambda QCD,

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.670
we better not screw that up when
we make a change of variable.

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:59.145
And so the kind of change
of variable you're making

01:07:59.145 --> 01:08:01.020
is you're taking the
original matrix element.

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:05.520
You're subtracting a series with
a proportionality constant R0.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.170
This guy was lambda QCD squared.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:11.950
And you want this to be not too
far different than lambda QCD,

01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:14.370
so that this whole thing
here is lambda QCD cubed just

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:18.910
like this, so that
this thing is still

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:21.064
of order lambda QCD cubed.

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:22.439
So you don't want
to do something

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.859
like choose the R0 to be Mb or
something because then you'd

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:29.010
be making a huge change in the
value of this matrix element.

01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:31.790
You really want to take the
R0 cutoff to be of order,

01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:33.397
say, g of r or something.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:41.109
So you can use the RGE to sum
up logs from that scale R0

01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:42.090
up to the scale of MQ.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.149
So again, we can sum up logs and
have a logarithmically improved

01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:59.109
result. But actually the
most important thing here

01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:01.960
is getting rid of
the renormalon.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.270
I just wanted to
kind of show you

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:09.920
what the result would look like
with both the RGE improvement,

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.069
just sort of using the full
set of tools that we have.

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:16.430
So here's the scales.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:20.000
You have three physical scales,
b quark mass, charm mass,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.319
lambda QCD.

01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:22.227
You have two cutoffs.

01:09:22.227 --> 01:09:23.810
You have our R0,
which I just told you

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:26.390
you should pick to be
close to lambda QCD.

01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:29.800
And then you can think that
there's these other scales, Mb

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.760
and M charm.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.170
If this is some low scale
and that's some high scale,

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.359
I'd like to sum logs.

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:39.350
And I can do that by
running up from R0 to R1,

01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:44.779
which in this case I'll just
pick between Mb and M charm.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:50.779
So if you did that,
you'd get some result

01:09:50.779 --> 01:09:58.230
that looks like
this, just putting

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:00.400
in some notation for
the resummation here.

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.565
And then this guy
is at the low scale.

01:10:20.477 --> 01:10:21.560
So now, everybody's happy.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.120
The Wilson coefficients
here can be expanded

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.180
in perturbation theory.

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.060
We don't think there's
any large logs.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.550
This U sums up any large
logs between the low scales

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:29.960
and the high scales.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.560
And this guy's living at a
scale that he likes to live at.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.350
And there's no renormalon,
no u equals 1 renormalon.

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:41.570
So what does it look like
if I write down this guy?

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.570
So first of all, if I look
at this thing order by order,

01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:47.718
this is how the
convergence looks.

01:10:47.718 --> 01:10:49.760
You get a downward shift
by about the same amount

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.550
as before, but the
next shifts are small.

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:56.240
So the series actually
looks like it's

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.510
converging to something.

01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:01.565
So that's the first three
orders if you use this approach.

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:08.410
And if you use the complete
power of this at the highest

01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:16.270
order, you can write down
that you get this 0.860 from

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:19.975
the perturbative part, which
is not too far from the 0.88

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:23.240
or the 0.8517, which I
said was close to the data.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.260
So this actually is pretty good.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.750
You can make some error estimate
for how big this thing is.

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:37.730
And you can make
some error estimate

01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:40.930
for the perturbative
uncertainty from higher orders

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:43.590
by varying scales.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:48.330
And you get a prediction
that looks like that.

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:50.390
So when you want to
estimate uncertainties,

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:52.940
what you typically do with
your cutoffs is you vary them.

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:54.440
You say, well, it
has to be up here,

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.000
but I don't have to
take it exactly there.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.170
I could take it up here
or take it a little lower,

01:11:58.170 --> 01:11:59.090
move this guy around.

01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:01.340
That gives you some idea of
higher order uncertainties

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:03.380
because the dependence
on these scales

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:06.190
cancels out order by order
in perturbation theory.

01:12:06.190 --> 01:12:08.990
And so varying it
is a way of getting

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:10.680
an idea of higher
order uncertainties

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.835
from perturbation theory.

01:12:11.835 --> 01:12:13.460
And that's what I've
done, for example,

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.793
for this perturbative term here.

01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:19.490
This is varying R1 up and
down by a factor of 2.

01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:23.600
And just see kind of what
residual uncertainty you have.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.027
This one's more interesting.

01:12:25.027 --> 01:12:26.360
So that one's like mu variation.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.400
This one's more interesting.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.100
And that's because we have
this other cutoff, R0.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:35.210
But what R0 does is it
connects a leading order term

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:37.690
to a sub-leading power term.

01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:40.460
The R0 dependence
cancels between something

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.860
that's order 1 in the
power counting, something

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.520
that's higher order
in the power counting.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.630
But when I vary R0,
it still cancels

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:48.740
between these two pieces.

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:52.370
Because remember, if you
look at the top of the board,

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:56.350
I've included higher power
terms in my Wilson coefficient.

01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:59.000
And so varying the
R0, you can actually

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.860
get an idea of how
big this thing is

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:04.200
kind of in a naive
dimensional analysis type way.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.215
And not gives this number here.

01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:09.500
So R0 variation
actually allows you

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.650
to test for the size of
the power corrections

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:14.900
if you don't know them.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.720
And in this case, it turns out
that the power correction is

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.500
kind of small in this scheme.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.410
But it didn't have
to be that small.

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:24.810
It could have been 165, 265.

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:27.770
It happens to be 0.065, OK?

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:30.230
So everything looks
much nicer after we just

01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:31.607
get rid of the renormalon.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.440
Someone else did the
three-loop calculation.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:39.080
You made the prediction,
just true in this case.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.270
OK, so questions?

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.930
So the moral of the story
is that, if you really

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:54.225
want to use calculations
that are out there,

01:13:54.225 --> 01:13:55.725
you have to think
about the physics.

01:13:55.725 --> 01:13:57.805
You can't just calculate, sorry.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.490
So these renormalons, when
you have kind of order

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:10.270
alpha squared or alpha
cubed information,

01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:12.187
then you have to worry
about things like this.

01:14:12.187 --> 01:14:14.820
And if you didn't, what looked
like was working beautifully

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.490
at leading log order
might get spoiled.

01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:18.990
You're leading log
might be the best

01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:21.625
prediction unless you think
about this that you can make.

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:23.250
Because your just
higher orders, you're

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.960
getting sensitive to
this renormalon problem.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.480
And what that means is
generically this is changing

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.225
and this is changing.

01:14:32.225 --> 01:14:33.600
The power correction
is changing.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.510
And so at each order
that this changes,

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:37.800
I could compensate
by changing this.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.970
But it would have to be a
pretty big change, right?

01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:41.490
I changed this guy
by this amount.

01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:43.073
And then I have to
compensate by that.

01:14:43.073 --> 01:14:45.120
Whoops, now, it even
changes by a larger amount.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.780
Well, compensate by changing
this by order 1 amount.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:52.740
That's exactly this fact, that
both things have this problem.

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.973
Order by order, I can
cancel out the problem,

01:14:55.973 --> 01:14:58.140
but then I can never really
assign a number to this.

01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.567
It's an order dependent number.

01:14:59.567 --> 01:15:01.650
Each order in perturbation
theory that I use here,

01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:02.940
this number changes.

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.440
And that's not
really what you think

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.212
of for a physical concept.

01:15:06.212 --> 01:15:07.920
This matrix element
should have a meaning

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.320
that it shouldn't be
changing by order 1

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.170
depending on the perturbative
order that you're working.

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:14.880
In this way of
thinking, this thing

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.780
is stable, much
more stable anyway.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.970
And you can assign
a number to it.

01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:24.210
That's kind of the moral.

01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:25.097
All right.

01:15:25.097 --> 01:15:25.930
AUDIENCE: Hey, Iain?

01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:26.722
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.978
AUDIENCE: That [INAUDIBLE]
looks [INAUDIBLE]..

01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:34.542
IAIN STEWART: So the thing
is that the convergence,

01:15:34.542 --> 01:15:35.750
it's not about the precision.

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:38.390
It's about the
convergence, right?

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:41.450
So you would be
fine in some sense.

01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:45.860
It would not be technically a
problem if this was 0, right?

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:49.400
If this guy was not
much of a shift--

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.870
and this was a 15 shift.

01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:52.310
This is a 7 shift.

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:56.085
If this guy was small
again, you'd be fine, right?

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.460
Because then you'd
say, OK, well,

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:02.310
I extract this thing in the
same order that I include that.

01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:04.520
And maybe this thing
gives a plus 0.07,

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.960
and this guy is a minus 0.07.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.252
And then I'm close to the data.

01:16:07.252 --> 01:16:08.570
And you're happy.

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:10.460
The issue is that you
go to a higher order,

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.950
and you get even bigger shift.

01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:14.540
That's the real
problem, that you

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.250
don't, in the
perturbative part alone,

01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:18.980
have any sign of convergence.

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.570
That's the issue.

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:24.050
So the fact that this number
is sort of close to that number

01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:25.965
is, in some sense,
OK because you

01:16:25.965 --> 01:16:28.340
think that this thing should
generically be of that size.

01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:30.975
That's what dimensional
analysis would say.

01:16:30.975 --> 01:16:32.600
In dimensional
analysis, you might even

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.310
say it's a little bigger.

01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:37.760
So the real issue is that
you want your predictions

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.252
to be stable.

01:16:40.252 --> 01:16:40.752
Yeah.

01:16:40.752 --> 01:16:44.760
AUDIENCE: But I thought that
precision should be higher

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.962
than the [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:45.962 --> 01:16:46.670
IAIN STEWART: No.

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:50.630
This, actually, here is
connected to that term.

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:53.060
I'm saying, even if I
leave this term out,

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.970
I actually get something
that agrees with the data.

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:58.760
And that's because it turns out
that the power correction here

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.080
is of this size.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.840
And I can get an idea of
how big it is by varying

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.520
the R0 in this prediction.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.280
And that changes this
number by that amount.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:11.090
And since this thing is also
changing in exactly a way that

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:12.620
compensates that
R0 dependence, I'm

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.810
getting an estimate
for this thing.

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:15.960
That's what I did there.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.650
So if I were to put this thing
in, I'd have a new parameter.

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:21.460
And I could exactly
fit the data, right?

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:26.440
But what I wrote was
a little different.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.225
Yeah.

01:17:28.225 --> 01:17:29.600
I kind of went
over that quickly.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:36.230
All right, so that's
actually it for HQET.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:44.040
So before we get to
SCET, which is coming up

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.710
after spring break,
we're going to talk

01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:53.695
about one more topic, which
I'll just basically introduce.

01:17:53.695 --> 01:17:56.470
And then we'll stop and
continue on Thursday.

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.720
So there's going to be one more
example of an effective field

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.830
theory.

01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:10.550
And this is going to be an
example of an effective field

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:13.400
theory with what
looks like a problem.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.460
It's got a fine tuning.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:17.877
So usually, if the whole notion
of effective field theory

01:18:17.877 --> 01:18:20.210
is against the idea that there
should be a fine tuning--

01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:21.860
because you're making
dimensional analysis

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:22.693
estimates of things.

01:18:22.693 --> 01:18:25.310
If there's a fine tuning, that
means your dimensional analysis

01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:26.810
failed.

01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:31.010
In this example, we'll see that
you can make one fine tuning.

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:33.560
And you can understand what's
going on with that fine tuning

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.693
and actually propagate it to
change your power counting,

01:18:36.693 --> 01:18:38.110
to change your
power counting such

01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:41.165
that it takes into account the
existence of that fine tuning.

01:18:41.165 --> 01:18:44.060
It builds the whole effective
theory around the idea

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.480
that there was this fine
tuning from original, perhaps,

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.490
dimension counting
point of view.

01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:51.680
But we can adopt a
different power counting

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.590
that actually organizes
the physics in exactly

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:56.017
the right way that we want to.

01:18:56.017 --> 01:18:58.350
And in fact, it's going to
be such an easy example where

01:18:58.350 --> 01:19:02.390
we can just basically calculate
all the Feynman diagrams very

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:05.030
simply, one line.

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:06.530
So that's what we'll do.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:16.120
It'll be a very simple example
of an effective theory field.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.560
And we'll prove some things
about quantum mechanics that

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:24.080
would be very difficult if we
weren't using effective field

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.790
theory along the way.

01:19:30.423 --> 01:19:32.090
So we'll investigate
an effective theory

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:37.640
that has a naively
irrelevant operator that must

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.600
be promoted to being relevant.

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:50.800
So by dimensional analysis,
it would be irrelevant.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.800
And one way of thinking
about it is that it just

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.140
has such a large anomalous
dimension that it actually

01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:57.870
ends up being totally relevant.

01:19:57.870 --> 01:20:02.110
And that is actually not a
bad way of thinking about it.

01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:05.400
So the example
we'll talk about is

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:13.382
something called
two-nucleon non-relativistic

01:20:13.382 --> 01:20:14.340
effective field theory.

01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:22.655
So you have two nucleons,
a neutron and a proton,

01:20:22.655 --> 01:20:23.155
for example.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.030
It's a bottom-up
effective theory.

01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:31.550
We're not going to be thinking
about calculating nucleons

01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:33.210
in QCD.

01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:35.212
We're going to work
at momenta that

01:20:35.212 --> 01:20:37.420
are so small that we actually
integrate out the pion.

01:20:43.671 --> 01:20:45.970
So all exchange particles
are integrated out.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.500
So there's nothing to
exchange and really just have

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.090
contact type interactions.

01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:08.450
So something that you might
think of as like A pion

01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:12.890
exchange between
two nucleons gets

01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:16.650
represented by some local
operators between the nucleons.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.925
All right, so let me stop there.

01:21:23.925 --> 01:21:25.300
And we'll come
back and talk more

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:27.460
about this theory next time.

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:31.810
And we'll see, first, that
these operators of this type

01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:34.180
actually can organize
some facts about quantum

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:36.280
mechanics in a very nice way.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.920
And then we'll see how to
think about fine tuning

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:43.180
from this contact
interaction theory

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.588
and also how to
think about how we

01:21:45.588 --> 01:21:47.380
want to organize the
power counting, what's

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:49.530
MS-bar say, et cetera.

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.040
It's kind of a fun theory.

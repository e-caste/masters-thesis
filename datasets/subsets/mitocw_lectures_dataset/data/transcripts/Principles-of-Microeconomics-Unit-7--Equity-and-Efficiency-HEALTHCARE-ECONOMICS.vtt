00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.870
PROFESSOR: So to review, what
we've been doing in the last

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.790
two lectures, we talked about
equity versus efficiency, and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.070
the equity efficiency
trade off.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.280
We then talked about
redistribution and the leaky

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.100
bucket, and basically how both
taxation and distortions and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.890
welfare programs lead to
leaks in the bucket.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.690
And we talked about
we do in the US to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330
try to transfer income.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.480
The last lecture, we focused on
the fact that most of the

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.900
US government transfers are not
about just the rich to the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.590
poor, they're about fixing
problems with our insurance

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.930
markets in the form of
social insurance.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.920
And we ended last time by
talking about the nation's

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.910
largest social insurance
program, social security.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.180
What I want to talk about today
is a particularly timely

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.790
topic, which is the biggest
single issue in social

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.500
insurance, indeed the biggest
single fiscal issue facing the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.480
US government over
your lifetimes,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.820
which is health care.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.410
Health care in the US today
consumes about 17% of our

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.970
nation's income, so that
one in every $6

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.730
goes to health care.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:35.570
By 2075, so when you guys are
elders, when I'm no longer

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.610
with you and you guys are
elders, health care will

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.440
consume about 40% of our
nation's product, so $4 in

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.490
every $10 will go
to health care.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.710
By 100 years later, when your
grandkids are elders, health

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.430
will consume 100% of our
nation's product.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.695
That is literally if nothing's
done, every single dollar we

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.350
earn will go to health care.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.590
Now, obviously that is
not sustainable.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.360
That's not a legitimate
outcome to envision.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.780
So something must be done, and
that has led to an enormous

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.350
discussion about this area.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.300
Another way to think about this
is, if you think about

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.100
the US, we haven't talked about
budgetary issues in this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.540
course, think about US
government having a budget,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.040
money it collects through taxes
and money it spends

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.020
through revenues.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.250
We all know the US government
has a big budget deficit right

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.500
now, about $1.3 trillion.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.590
Another way to think about that
is if you look at the US

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.710
government and all the promises
it's made to pay for

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.930
health care alone, forget
everything else, just for

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.420
health care, we've promised to
pay, above and beyond any

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.680
taxes we're planning to collect,
$100 trillion in

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.830
health care promises to the
Medicare and Medicaid program,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.700
above and beyond any taxes
we'll collect.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.800
So if we do nothing, we're
facing a $100 trillion long

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.590
term deficit in health care.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.100
Now, a year ago, that would
have sounded more stunning

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.950
because a year ago, we didn't
use to talk in trillions.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.860
We only talked in billions.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.420
Now, we're all talking
trillions, so it doesn't sound

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.650
that impressive, but believe
me that's a big number.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.380
So basically, we've got enormous
problem facing our

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.420
country with health care, both
in terms of the country's

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.930
devotion of resources, and in
terms of the government's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.820
devotion of its budget.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.580
Now, you might say, well, the
government should just get out

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.440
of this activity, but that goes
back to the last lecture,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.240
which is why is government
in this activity?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.420
Because there's a market failure
for health insurance.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.150
We talked last time about
adverse selection, and the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.690
problem that, if the government
doesn't get

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.510
involved, health insurance
markets might fail, and in

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.150
practice we've seen that
in the United States.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.650
We've see a failure of health
insurance markets.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.230
Now, most people get
their health

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.290
insurance through big companies.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.840
So I get mine through MIT.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.280
You get yours through MIT or
through your parents and the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.850
big companies where they work.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.810
And in those markets, health
insurance works well.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.400
And health insurance works
well through a simple

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.550
statistical fact many of us
learned about in high school,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.220
which is the Law of
Large Numbers.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.890
The Law of Large Numbers simply
says that for most

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.100
distributions we know, certainly
normal distribution,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.930
as the sample gets large
enough, the mean is

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.620
predictable, and basically,
that's the principle under

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.220
which insurers operate.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.899
So I talked about you, last
time, starting your MIT

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.740
insurance company, where
you would go

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.515
and insure MIT graduates.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:29.300
Well, as long as you have a
large sample of MIT graduates,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.870
and you knew they were all going
to buy health insurance,

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.820
then you could clearly predict
what you'd have to spend,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.030
through the Law of Large
Numbers, and you could have a

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.060
functioning insurance market
where you charge that plus a

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.530
little money to make, to
pay for your profits.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.030
And that's how large
business works.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.960
So MIT has insurers, the MIT
insurers know MIT has about

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.125
10,000 employees altogether,
12,000 maybe.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.400
The insurers say, look, that's
a large enough sample that we

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.410
can basically predict what MIT
is going to cost, and we can

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.750
basically figure out what to
charge them for premiums. MIT

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.110
says, well gee, we wish it was
less, but that's fair.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.200
We understand what health care
costs, and we're done.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.030
That's not true if you don't
work for a large firm,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.930
particularly for
an individual.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.160
So let's say you've got your MIT
health insurance company.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.300
You've graduated, you're
successful, you set up a

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.230
program insuring all
MIT graduates.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.415
Let's say, MIT forces everyone
to buy health insurance, so

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:18.870
you've got a nice, predictable
distribution of risks, and

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.770
you're making your money.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.430
And then I walk in the door, and
I don't have to buy health

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.990
insurance from you.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.730
I'm just a regular guy
off the street.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.100
I say, hey, I hear you've
got this great

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.890
health insurance product.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.290
I want in.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.900
And you look at me say, wait a
second, why do you want in?

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.500
You probably only want in
because you're sick, and you

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.815
know that you're going to need
health care, and that's why

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:37.390
you want to buy from me.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.960
So no I'm not going
to sell to you.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.970
And that's the problem
individuals face who want to

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.520
buy health insurance on their
own, is the problem of

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.610
asymmetric information goes away
when you've got a large

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.900
pool of people who are all
buying health insurance.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.790
For any one individual trying to
walk in off the street, the

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.420
problem of asymmetric
information means that

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.400
insurers will be unwilling to
sell to them, and if insurers

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.210
are unwilling to sell to
them, those individuals

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.390
might end up uninsured.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.500
Currently in the US, we have
about 50 million uninsured

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.290
people, so that about 18%
of our non-elderly

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.080
population is uninsured.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.400
Remember, the elderly, as I
discussed last time, get

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.290
universal health coverage
through the Medicare program.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.690
But about 18% of our non-elderly
population, around

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.400
50 million people, are
uninsured, and one of the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.160
reasons they're uninsured is
because of this insurance

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.430
market failure.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.150
And to see that insurance market
failure, you can just

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.430
look at what happens when
people try to get health

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.060
insurance outside of large
employers, through what we

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.470
call the non-group
insurance market.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.090
In the non-group insurance
market, when people try to get

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.770
health insurance, it's typically
incredibly expensive

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.680
because insurers are worried
you're sick, so they charge

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.280
you a high price.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.170
I talked about that last time.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.470
That the lemons problem.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.050
Insurers also, in trying
to deal with asymmetric

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.020
information, the way they
deal with it is by being

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.520
discriminatory.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.340
So if you're an insurer who's
allowed to, what you can do is

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.980
to say, fine, I'm going to
insure you, but I'm not going

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.700
to insure you for any sickness
you previously had because I

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.250
know that's something that
might flare up again.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.350
That's called a pre-existing
condition.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.540
I'm not going to insure
you for any

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.950
pre-existing condition.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.400
Moreover, I'm going to
go even further.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.870
If you get sick, I'm
going to drop you.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.310
You might say, wait a second,
the whole idea of insurance is

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.120
you cover me if I get sick, but
in fact, in most states'

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.080
insurers, it's totally
legal to do.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.690
Insurers can simply say we're
not renewing you.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.100
You got sick.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.900
Well, that clearly
is a problem.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.800
That clearly means that adverse
selection's led to

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.500
market failure because of
what we discussed in the

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.340
uncertainty lectures.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.730
You should go back and review
that, in the uncertainty

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.190
lecture, we talked about why
individuals would value

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.050
insurance, why they pay a risk
premium for insurance, well,

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.220
if insurers simply won't sell
to them once they get sick,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.050
the individuals aren't getting
something they value, and the

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.900
market's failed.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.870
So we've got a situation in
the US where we've got

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.110
insurance that works for many,
many people, those that work

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.280
for large firms. But insurance
markets that are failed for

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.920
individuals, and small firms
are sort of in between, and

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.910
that leads to 50 million
uninsured people.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.710
So we got this problem.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.690
We got all these uninsured
people on the one hand.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.090
On the other hand, we have
incredibly rapidly rising

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.170
health care costs.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.720
We, by far, devote the
largest share of our

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.570
economy to health care.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.610
We're about twice the average
of industrialized countries,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.695
and our costs are rising
incredibly rapidly, although

00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:20.850
that's true around the
world, as well.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.710
So that's the sort of situation
we face ourselves

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.460
in, and that's thte motivation
that underlies the discussion

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.320
you're hearing now about
health care reform.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.900
And in particular, you're
hearing a lot of discussion

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.530
now about the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.650
Act, which passed
last March 23.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.870
This was the single most
important piece of government

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.330
legislation, perhaps,
since World War II.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.530
Certainly, the most significant
piece of domestic

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.760
social policy legislation
since Medicare was

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.280
introduced in 1965.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.530
What does this bill do?

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.960
Full disclaimer, I'm going to
describe objectively, but I

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.370
helped write it.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.320
I'll try to be objective, but
just full disclaimer, I was

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.640
involved with writing
the legislation.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.620
So there is some bias
involved here.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.090
But what does this piece of
legislation try to do?

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.620
What it tries to do is deal
with the second of the

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.610
problems I discussed, which is
the insurance market failure,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.560
and it makes a vague stab at the
first, which is the fact

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.870
that health costs are getting
very, very expensive.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.296
Since more economics is involved
in that second, in

00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:30.230
the insurance market failure,
let's talk about that.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.120
So how do you solve insurance
market failure?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.770
You've got this problem that
there are 50 million people

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.550
without health insurance, often
because this asymmetric

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.550
information problem.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.350
50 million people without
health insurance.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.980
Many more are in this market
that sort of can drop you when

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.140
you get sick.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.420
We discussed the reasons last
time, so what are the two

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.620
options we discussed last time
for what the government might

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.030
do if they want to solve
this problem?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.530
Yeah.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.180
AUDIENCE: Subsidizing the
insurance companies--

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.120
PROFESSOR: Subsidizing
the people and

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.760
the insurance companies.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.490
So one thing I could do is I
could say, look, let's just

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.980
make insurance free
for everyone.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.120
That way everyone will sign
up, and then insurance

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.810
companies can offer
fair prices.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.830
And that's a solution that's
pursued by Canada.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.310
Canada has free universal
health care coverage.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.440
Everyone in the country is
covered by birth for their

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.260
health insurance expenditures
under one, single government

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.530
insurance company.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.940
But it wouldn't have to be
one, single government

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.100
insurance company.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.680
That part's distinct.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.780
We could separate who provides
insurance versus

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.320
who pays for it.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.340
OK, so let's just focus on
the who pays for it part.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.790
If we make health insurance
free, sign up everyone from

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:44.780
birth, then we've solved the
adverse selection problem, but

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.080
that costs a lot of money.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.310
To sign up everyone from birth
and cover them with insurance

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.750
at the full government cost,
would cost on the order of $2

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.520
trillion a year.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.210
That's a lot of money.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.210
That's pretty hard to imagine
the US government raising

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.070
taxes enough to cover that
kind of new program.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.160
So the second solution we talked
about was a mandate,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.860
was to say, OK fine,
we can't make

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.350
insurance free for everyone.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.230
What we can do is we make sure
everyone buys, so that we

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.850
fixed this adverse selection
problem.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.060
So that insurers can know they
are getting everyone, so they

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.420
can price insurance fairly.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.200
And basically, that's
what PPACA does.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.070
It does three things.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.000
The first thing is it says to
insurance companies, we're

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.530
going to give you an
individual mandate.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.930
So starting 2014, every person
in the US will have to buy

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.001
health insurance.

00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:48.710
Now, it's not quite
every person.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.220
There's exemptions.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.780
For example, it doesn't apply
to illegal immigrants, it

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.420
doesn't apply to people for
whom health insurance is

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.840
particularly expensive,
et cetera.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.150
But the estimate is this mandate
would cause about 60%

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.530
of the uninsured get coverage.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.800
So about 47% of the uninsured
will slip through the cracks,

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.280
but about 60% will
get coverage.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.090
The second thing it does, it
says, OK, insurance companies,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.700
since we're giving you the
mandate, we're going to say

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:24.890
you can no longer discriminate
in health insurance.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.760
OK, no more discrimination in
health insurance, so what

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.570
that's saying is, now, you can
no longer, for example, drop

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.260
people when they get sick.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.500
You can no longer exclude people
for their pre-existing

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.450
conditions.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.430
You have to basically offer
insurance the way we described

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.372
it when we talked about
insurance in

00:12:39.372 --> 00:12:40.620
the uncertainty lecture.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.060
Once you get sick, you're
covered, and anyone can get

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.010
it, and it's priced fairly.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.530
So basically, the trade-off
is we're saying, insurance

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.950
companies, we'll give you a
broad distribution of risks.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.480
On the other hand, you
can't discriminate

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.700
anymore in health insurance.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.530
Let's give everyone the same
kind of health insurance that

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.020
MIT gives people, that large
companies give people.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.330
But then finally, the final
thing the bill does is, to

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.150
make that work, we have to
recognize that you can't

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.540
mandate people to buy health
insurance if they

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.220
can't afford it.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.800
Health insurance is
pretty expensive.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.310
My MIT health insurance policy
for my family cost about

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.995
$14,000 a year.

00:13:17.995 --> 00:13:19.970
MIT pays about 10,
I pay about four.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.440
Remember we talked
about poverty.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.650
The poverty line now for a
family is about $22,000.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.900
You can't take a family earning
$22,000 and say I'm

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.890
going to mandate you to spend
$14,000 on health insurance.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.090
That's just impossible.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.440
They couldn't live.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.170
So the third thing the bill does
is it introduces a whole

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.530
bunch of subsidies, so in some
sense, it uses both the

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.490
solutions we talked
about last time.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.140
Both making insurance cheap for
people, so they can afford

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:53.550
it, but instead of spending $2
trillion a year, it spends

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.620
like $120 billion
a year on this.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.260
So it just subsidizes the very
poorest people, and mandates

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:01.980
the other people to buy.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.550
So it's sort of a
mixed solution.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.300
We talked about two solutions
you could do to solve the

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.960
asymmetric information
problem.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.220
You could subsidize insurance
and make it cheap, or you

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.930
could mandate people to buy.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.340
This bill does both.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.850
It subsidizes it for the very
lowest income people and

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.590
mandates it for people
who can afford it.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:26.250
So that's essentially what the
bill does to try to solve this

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:32.650
problem, and we don't know
whether that will work.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.740
We have our best estimates,
but this is a radical new

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.410
intervention.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.480
The best estimates suggest it'll
cover about 60% of the

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.310
uninsured, but this is a pretty
brand new intervention,

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.250
so we'll have to see, actually,
how that shakes out.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.540
But that's the basic structure
of what the bill's trying to

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.020
do to try to solve this

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.940
asymmetric information problem.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.610
Are there questions about that,
how it relates to what

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.860
we learned in the last
couple lectures?

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.290
So that's one problem that we're
trying to address with

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.530
this legislation, is solving
that asymmetric information

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.335
problem using both the mandate
and subsidy tools.

00:15:09.335 --> 00:15:11.230
And as I said, if you want to
learn more, I talk a lot more

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.490
about stuff like this
in my course 14.41.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.170
This is sort of an example of
how government can use its

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.910
tools to address the kind of
fundamental information

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.020
failures that we talked
about last time.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.000
But we don't get into, in this
course, politics, but of

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.940
course, we can't talk about a
government intervention this

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.510
massive without talking about
politics for a minute, and

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:38.130
recognize that this is going
to involve some sacrifice.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.130
I made it sound pretty easy.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.490
Well, we've got this asymmetric
information

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.610
problem, we put in the
solution, we're done.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.560
But there's two problems
with the solution.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.160
The first problem
is you've got to

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.410
pay for these subsidies.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.690
And this comes back to our
discussion of equity

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.660
efficiency, the bill features
an enormous tax increase on

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.690
the wealthiest Americans.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.610
The bill raises about $450
billion over the next decade

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.600
from the richest, about 5%
of American families.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.160
So going back to our equity
efficiency discussion, is that

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.060
a good thing or bad thing?

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.460
That depends on our social
welfare function.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.250
If our social welfare function
is very progressive, Rawlsian

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.920
or some forms of utilitarian,
that's probably OK.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.020
If it's not, if it's a Nozickian
world, where we just

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.970
think that people should just
be left alone and not taking

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.500
money away from the rich just
because they're rich, then

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.920
that's not OK.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.180
So that ties into our other
discussion of equity

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.040
efficiency.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.670
So we have to pay for this, but
obviously, politically,

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.080
that raises problems. That's
going to upset a large set of

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.490
people who are going to have
to pay those taxes.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.610
The other issue of course this
is with the mandate, we talked

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.820
about, well gee, you can't do it
by subsidies alone, that's

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.290
too expense.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.940
You have to mandate.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.970
Well, the mandate isn't
free either.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.990
The mandate basically amounts
to a tax on people who don't

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.970
want to buy health insurance.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.310
What's the mandate?

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.900
A mandate is saying you didn't
want to buy health insurance,

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.350
and now you have to.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.640
That's going to upset a lot
of people, as well.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.200
A lot of people out there
don't want to buy health

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.765
insurance, and you're telling
them they have to.

00:17:10.765 --> 00:17:13.930
You don't make a change this
big without causing some

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.780
problems, and these are the
problems that arise.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.140
This isn't a painless solution,
and so that's, once

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.790
again, why they call this
the dismal science.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.319
We're all about the trade-offs,
and the trade-offs

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.650
here are, you fix the market
failure that we learned about

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.840
last lecture, but at, well,
the potential cost of the

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.960
inefficiency of taxing people.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.620
Whether that's a good thing or
not depends on our social

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.680
welfare function.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.520
And also the inequity,
potentially, of forcing people

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.270
to buy health insurance
who didn't want it.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.660
Yeah.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.880
AUDIENCE: How do they suggest
that you enforce the mandate?

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.950
PROFESSOR: The mandate
is enforced

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.280
through a tax penalty.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.700
We actually have
Massachusetts.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.430
We put in this system in
Massachusetts a few years ago.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.200
We pioneered it, basically.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.630
And the way it works in
Massachusetts is, every year,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.680
I get something called the
1099-HC from my insurance

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.946
company, which says
here's proof that

00:18:07.946 --> 00:18:08.650
you have health insurance.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.050
I attach that to my tax
form, and I'm done.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.870
If you don't attach a 1099-HC,
you have to pay a tax penalty.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.195
In Massachusetts, it's about
$1,000 a year if you don't

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:17.510
have health insurance.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.510
The federal tax penalty will
be about $700 a year.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.010
So it's going to be enforced
through a penalty if you don't

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.970
show, on your taxes, that you
have health insurance.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.760
Other questions about this?

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.820
Now, of course, I haven't
talked about the bigger

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:39.720
problem, which is what about the
fact that we have enormous

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.270
cost control problem.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.800
Now, last time I talked about
two kinds of asymmetric

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.140
information, two
problems in the

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.800
social insurance trade-off.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.082
On the one hand, there's adverse
selection, that fact

00:18:49.082 --> 00:18:51.870
that insurance markets might
not fail, but I also talked

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.120
about moral hazard.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.880
I also talk about moral hazard,
and the fact that, if

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.550
you insure individuals
for adverse events,

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.840
they will act adversely.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.600
Now, there's several kinds of
moral hazard, and health care

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.040
is rife with them.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.890
One kind of moral hazard is a
type we talked about, which is

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:21.240
the classic moral hazard, which
is sort of individual

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.160
precaution.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.400
So the story here is, if I have
fire insurance for my

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.890
house, I don't bother buying
a fire extinguisher.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.480
Or if I have health insurance,
I don't bother wearing a

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.130
helmet when I bicycle.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.150
So these are basically
individuals not taking caution

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.760
because they're insured for
this adverse event.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.260
We don't think that's
that big a deal.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.370
I mean, we don't think that your
decision about whether to

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.080
wear a helmet or not is much
affected by whether you have

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.260
health insurance.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.930
It's probably not
that big a deal.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.740
The bigger type of moral
hazard is resource

00:19:51.740 --> 00:20:02.480
over-utilization, which is
that, basically, because

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:08.270
people are insured, they will
overuse medical care.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.310
So basically, here's the way
we think about that.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:16.740
It's a standard dead weight
loss kind of argument.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.940
So think about the market
for medical care.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.760
Think about the market
for doctors visits.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.870
There's some quantity of
doctor's visits and some price

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.520
of doctor's visits.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.680
And let's say that there's
a flat marginal

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.880
cost of doctor's visit.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.240
Let's say delivering a doctor's
visit costs $100.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.420
So delivering a doctor's
visit costs $100.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.930
And let's say there's some
demand for doctor's visits.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.910
And importantly, I'm going to
make this downward sloping.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.850
Now, this is important.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.760
You might say, gee, wait a
second, shouldn't the demand

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.920
for doctor's visits
be inelastic?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.510
Shouldn't people just go to the
doctor when they're sick,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.180
and not when they're not?

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.430
And why would the
price matter?

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:05.400
In fact, it's uncertain, from
theory, whether this should be

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.310
inelastic or elastic.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.430
It's uncertain how elastic
demand should be, if people

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.590
only go to the doctor
when they're sick.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.400
I hope you understand, the thing
about elasticity, it's a

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.815
good thing to understand for
basic principles, if people

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:16.400
only go to the doctor when
they're sick, that curve

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.770
should be vertical because it
shouldn't depend on price.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.130
But if people care about the
price, and they decide to go

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.840
to the doctor, then it could
be downwards sloping.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.000
In fact, there's excellent
evidence from a actual

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.090
experiment that was
run in the US.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.000
In the 1970s, there was
something called the Rand

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.250
Health Insurance Experiment.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.225
Rand is a company out
in California,

00:21:41.225 --> 00:21:42.710
a consulting company.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:43.970
They ran a health insurance
experiment where they

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.800
literally, experimentally, gave
people health insurance

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.530
of different generosity.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.880
You've got to plan the coverage,
everything, you've

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.780
got to plan with a
big deductible.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.560
So they gave people plans of
different generosity and asked

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.770
how much different medical
care did they us.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.840
Remember when we talked about,
when doing empirical work,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.210
what you'd like to do is think
about a randomized trial.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.150
They essentially ran a
randomized trial, where

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.930
different people had different
prices, and they found demand

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.360
was downward sloping.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.870
People who were charged
more for health care

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.720
used less of it.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.410
So there is a downward-sloping
demand.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:18.200
And so what that says is, if
this is the marginal cost, and

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.080
this is the marginal benefit of
getting health care, then

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.990
the optimal amount of doctors
is just Q*, that basically,

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:30.160
the socially efficient level
of doctors is Q*.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.770
However, when they're insured,
people don't face this $100.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.980
When you go to doctor, you
just pay $10, typically.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.830
Well now, this is the social
marginal cost, but your

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:47.620
private marginal cost, what
it costs you, is only $10.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.280
So what do you do?

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.760
You use a level of health care,
Q super p, for private.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.700
You use too much health care.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.450
You overuse the doctor's
office.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.090
Now when you think of this
intuitively, forgetting the

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.830
graph, you just say intuitively,
if a doctor's

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.370
visit is going to cost $10
instead of the $100 it should,

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.340
you use too many of them.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.005
But graphically, the point is
that the underlying cost of

00:23:12.005 --> 00:23:16.040
the doctor's visit is $100, but
because you're insured,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.300
and the marginal cost to you is
only $10, you overuse the

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.860
doctor's office.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.990
You use too many doctor's
visits.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.110
This leads to a dead
weight loss.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.680
This leads to a dead weight loss
from people over using

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.080
the doctor's office.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.430
OK And that the second kind
of moral hazard, which is

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.680
resource over-utilization.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.880
Questions about that?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.977
Yeah.

00:23:42.977 --> 00:23:45.959
AUDIENCE: How do you
define too much?

00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:47.209
If everybody else--

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:55.235
you said Qp is just right, and
Q* is like people go to the

00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:58.250
doctor too few times?

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.540
PROFESSOR: That that's
a great question.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:08.430
If everything is working
perfectly, then Q* is, by

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.680
definition, right.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.550
We talked about, earlier in
this course, about how the

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:18.060
private market competitive
outcome is welfare maximizing.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.290
The private market competitive
outcome is where marginal cost

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.070
equals marginal benefit,
supply equals demand.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.900
That's the optimal outcome
if there's no

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.960
other market failures.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.900
So in this course up to a few
lectures ago, you shouldn't

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.210
have even asked that question,
we know Q* is optimal because

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.290
we know the private market
outcome's optimal.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.630
Now, you might say, OK well,
there's lots of reasons to

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.510
think Q* might not be optimal.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.590
For example, many people aren't
fully informed about

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.460
the right level of medical
care to use.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:51.660
Then you're right, then it might
be that Qp is optimal,

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:56.750
but the point is, absent
other market failures--

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.330
We know Q* is the socially
maximizing point where

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.170
marginal cost equals
marginal benefits.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.430
We developed that earlier.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.410
So if people use more than
that, that's inefficient.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.420
So you might say, well
gee, how do we know?

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.870
Well, actually it turns
out we can tell.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.090
Let's go back the Rand Health
Insurance experiment.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.520
Same person, see if you
can figure it out.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.600
How could we use that same
experiment to tell whether it

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.340
was optimal that people used
fewer or more doctor's visits?

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.630
What could you do?

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.590
Or anyone?

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.740
What could you do using that
same experiment to see whether

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.230
Q* was optimal or
Qp was optimal?

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.585
Yeah.

00:25:33.585 --> 00:25:35.570
AUDIENCE: Take a look at
who gets sick less.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.365
PROFESSOR: Look at
their health.

00:25:36.365 --> 00:25:37.890
You've got a randomized
experiment.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.650
Some people are at Q*.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.130
Some people randomly
are moving to Qp.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.830
Look at their health.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:49.930
Well, it turns out, health is
totally unaffected, that the

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.295
health of people at Q* was
the same as the health

00:25:52.295 --> 00:25:53.490
as people at Qp.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.780
People who had big deductibles
and used health care a lot

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.410
less were no sicker than
people who used

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.250
health care a lot.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.210
The answer is because
in America, we

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.590
overuse health care.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.300
We do know Qp is too much.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.730
In America, we overuse health
care because it's so cheap,

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.800
and so the way we can prove
that, this experiment showed

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.710
it, that we caused people
to say stop overusing.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.110
I'll make you actually
bear the full price.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.970
Do the Q*, people were no
sicker, and they used less

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.120
health care.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.640
And that was a striking
finding out of this

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.730
experiment, that in fact, we
were overusing health care.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.650
There was a real problem
of Qp being too big.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.570
That's not the only form
of moral hazard.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.750
There's another one we even
talked about, which is

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.430
provider moral hazard.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.980
We've blamed everything so far
on people, but doctors are

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.420
people, too.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.890
And in fact, much of what's done
to you was determined,

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:59.230
not by your decision, but by
your doctor's decision.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.095
So now we have to think
about the doctors and

00:27:01.095 --> 00:27:02.345
how they make decisions.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.750
We can teach a whole course on
that, but basically, if we

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.820
think about doctors, we're going
to recognize that what

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.080
doctors primarily care
about is making

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.390
their patients better.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.480
But at the same time, doctors
are people, too, and they also

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.730
care about how much
money they make.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.240
Let's say for example, doctors
didn't care about how much

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.750
money they make.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.780
All they care about is making
their patients better.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.280
And let's say, I come into my
doctor's office, and I've got

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.900
a headache.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.390
I say, Doc, I've had a headache
for like four days

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.340
that's not going away.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.700
Well, the doctor says,
well, there's a point

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.290
0.0000000000001 chance you've
got a brain tumor.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.710
I can find that with
a CAT scan.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.830
Now, it's really so small, it's
not worth it, but the

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.370
same time, why not?

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.300
It doesn't cost you anything.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.310
It just costs you Qp,
which is $10.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.390
Just costs you $10, so you don't
care about getting it,

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.620
and I'll just order it.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.930
It's fine, why not?

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:05.070
So because I'm over insured,
that doesn't just cause me to

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.950
demand more medical care, it
causes my doctor to give me

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.690
more medical care.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.400
Now, add on top of that the fact
the doctor makes money

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.710
off the MRI.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.010
The doctor makes money
off the CAT scan.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.235
Now, he might say, gee, if it
doesn't do you any good at

00:28:19.235 --> 00:28:20.485
all, I still might
give it to you.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.910
If you're interested at all in
health care, the first thing

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:28.440
you have to read is a terrific
article in the June 9, 2009,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.280
New Yorker by a guy name Atul
Gawande, who's a practicing

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.810
physician and excellent author,
who wrote about a

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.030
place called McAllen, Texas.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.200
McAllen, Texas, is the place in
America that where people

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.160
spend the single largest amount
per person on health

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.970
care in the Medicare program.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.520
He compared McAllen, Texas, to a
nearby town, El Paso, Texas.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.090
Very similar demographically,
very similar towns, but in

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.410
McAllen, they spend twice
as much on health care.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.420
Why?

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.460
Because they get six times as
many CAT scans, they have

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.120
three times as many surgeries.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.330
Basically, doctors go nuts
treating people in McAllen,

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.750
Texas, and the doctors are
really, really rich.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.660
They're not hurting people.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.550
There's no evidence
that the over

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.340
treatment is hurting people.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.070
There's just no evidence
that it's helping them.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.770
So doctors are like why not?

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:16.930
Doesn't cost the people
anything, and I

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.250
make money off it.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.180
So that's another kind
of moral hazard.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.450
By providing insurance for
medical care, we've induced

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.610
this over provision of medical
care, both because people want

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.830
it because it's cheap, and
because doctors want it

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.110
because they get paid for it.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.780
And that's a lot of the problem
in our health care

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.180
system in the US.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.870
And once again, going back to
the question back there, if

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.580
you look at McAllen, Texas,
where they spend twice as much

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.350
on health care as El Paso,
people are no healthier.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.520
They're no healthier despite
the fact the

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.680
spend twice as much.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.710
And indeed, based on facts
such as this, the best

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.630
estimates are that the US wastes
about 1/3 of all of our

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.020
medical spending, that
we could literally

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.130
spent 2/3 as much.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.190
Or literally, at this point, we
could say we spend almost

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.670
$1 trillion less per
year on health care

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.920
and be no less healthy.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:15.170
And that is the thing we have
to grapple with now.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.880
It's the fact that if we can
deal with that problem, we

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.850
could solve this long-running
cost growth problem, and our

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.110
long-running fiscal problem, if
we just stop doing health

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.400
care that didn't make
us any healthier.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.800
The problem is that's a lot
easier said than done.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.620
It's easier said than done
for two reasons.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.040
First reason is because people
make money off that health

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.790
care we don't need, so the
first thing's political.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.630
The only way we're going to do
that is to tell some people

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.220
they can't make money
they've been making.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.470
That's a hard thing
to do politically.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:49.560
The second problem is
scientific, which is we don't

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.380
exactly know which is the 1/3rd
of health care that's

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.340
being wasted and which is
the 1/3rd that's not.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.460
So let's put it another way.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.880
Since 1950, the share of our
economy we spend on health

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.580
care has more than tripled.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.670
But you know what?

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.670
Health care is a ton
better than 1950.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.910
Health care sucked in 1950.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:14.620
In 1950, the typical baby born
had more than twice as high a

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.230
chance of dying in the first
year of life as today.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.190
Someone had a heart attack,
lived 1/3rd as long after a

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.690
heart attack as they do today.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.570
Or to put in terms young healthy
people might care

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.440
about, in 1950, if you hurt your
knee skiing, if you tore

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:30.020
your ACL skiing, you went into
the hospital for a week, had

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.080
major surgery, were on crutches
for six weeks,

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.720
couldn't really do sports or
anything effective for about

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.560
six months, and arthritis for
the rest of your life.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.900
Today, if you hurt your knee
skiing, you go to outpatient

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.640
surgery for an hour and a half,
you get it scoped, a

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.950
little camera, they fix it, and
then you're back skiing

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.510
two weeks later.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.450
No permanent long run damage.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.050
Health care is just
better today.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:51.770
It just is.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.110
That's why we don't see any
health insurance plan saying

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.160
we offer 1950s health care at
1950s prices because no one

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.710
would want it.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.720
Even though it would be 1/10th
as cheap, no one would want

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.800
because it would suck.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.850
So basically the problem is
health care's better over all,

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.360
but at the same time, we're
wasting a lot of money, and

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.560
that's why health care cost
control is really hard.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.930
That's because moral hazard
is hard to deal with.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.380
Moral hazard is hard to deal
with because it's hard to find

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.030
because it's an information
asymmetry.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.470
If every procedure had attached
to it a magic

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.270
identifier, which said this is
a waste and this is not, we'd

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.170
have no moral hazard.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:33.090
Imagine every procedure
hospitals did had a magic

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.630
identifier, which said this is
worth it, this is not, then

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.760
you could set up the optimal
insurance company.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.310
You could simply say, for those
that are worth it, we'll

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.990
insure you.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.320
For those that aren't worth it,
we won't, and you'd solve

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.440
moral hazard.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:45.920
Then we could be fine.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.860
We could insure people, we'd
solve both information

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.230
problems.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.050
But of course, we
don't know that.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:56.570
And so as we solve the first
information problem, which is

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.450
adverse selection, by getting
more people health insurance,

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.590
we're making the second problem
worse, moral hazard,

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.210
by putting more people into a
system which wastes a lot of

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.350
money because of these problems.
And that's the

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.040
difficult part about
health care.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.310
So what do we do about that?

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.580
Well, I told you what we do to
solve the first problem.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.430
What to do to solve the second
problem is a lot harder, and

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.450
we don't really know.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:19.890
But we have some ideas about
what might work.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.340
The first thing we know might
work is a lot more work on

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.930
what's call comparative
effectiveness, which is a

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.680
fancy way of saying
understanding what works and

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.670
what doesn't, and in particular,
what works better

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.770
than what else.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.810
Many of you know about the
FDA, the Food and Drug

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.110
Administration.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.970
They approve medical devices, so
if you want to introduce a

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.890
new drug or a new medical
device, it has to be approved

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.560
by the FDA.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.090
The way their approval runs is
they say, is it effective in

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.390
curing what it's supposed to
cure, and if it is they

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.580
approve it.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.290
They never say is it any more
effective than something that

00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:02.040
already exists, or even more is
it actually cost effective.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:06.000
So for example, in the treatment
of prostate cancer

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.750
over the last decade, we've
moved to more and more

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.500
expensive radioactive
laser-based treatments for

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.690
prostate cancer.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.739
We used to treat prostate cancer
about a 10th the cost

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.460
of treating it now with no
evidence that we're actually

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.980
doing men any good through
these treatments.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.699
But they don't do harm, they
work, they do what they're

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:25.469
supposed to do, so the FDA
keeps approving them.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:27.669
So comparative effectiveness
will be to actually say we're

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:29.510
only going to pay for what works
better than something

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:33.889
that exists already
more effectively.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:36.920
That's one direction
we can go in.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.750
The other direction we can go in
is we can start working to

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.150
change the financial incentives
for both patients

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.510
and providers.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.940
For patients, we can make them
pay more of the cost of health

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.679
care, so that they move back
up this curve a little bit.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.460
Still insuring them, but
making them pay more.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.739
So for example, we could move
to systems where poor people

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:58.340
are fully insured because
they can't afford it.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.370
But someone who's higher income,
they should have a

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.090
high deductible, they should
bear the cost some of their

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.610
health care because they can
afford it, and that will make

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:08.050
them make their health care
decisions more wisely.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.520
We can work on the individual
moral hazard by making people

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.440
pay more for their
health care.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.370
We can work on the provider
moral hazard by removing the

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.180
financial incentives to
providers to provide excessive

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:25.700
care, and the way we do this
is by something called

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.175
prospective reimbursement.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.550
Prospective reimbursement is
basically saying to providers,

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.690
look, the way things work now
is you do a CAT scan on the

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.610
guy we pay you for the
CAT scan on the guy.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.010
You do a surgery on the
guy, we pay for your

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:47.590
surgery on the guy.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.230
How about a different
way to approach it?

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.090
How about we say this
guy is your patient?

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.000
A guy like him, a 25 year old
healthy guy costs, on average,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.780
$1,500 a year.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.720
We will give you, at the end the
year, a check for $1,500.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.410
You do what you want.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.190
You do nothing, you
keep the $1,500.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.770
You go crazy and you make 1,000
CAT scans and it costs

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.210
$100,000, you eat
the difference.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.140
You doctors bear the risk.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.190
Pros, instead of we, the public
and the insurance

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:18.120
companies and the individuals,
bearing the costs when you

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.430
give me an extra CAT scan, you,
the doctor, bear the cost

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.520
when you get the
extra CAT scan.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.260
We've turned the financial
incentives on their head.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.360
Now, instead of making money by
giving CAT scans, you lose

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.460
money by giving CAT scans.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:30.710
Yeah.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.302
AUDIENCE: But might that have
some negative side effects on

00:36:34.302 --> 00:36:35.500
the health care of patients?

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.654
Doctors are going to want to
check how much they are going

00:36:37.654 --> 00:36:39.820
to make [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.900
PROFESSOR: Great question,
like the question before.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.480
How do we know that doesn't
go too far?

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.740
Right now, you could think about
it, we're in a place for

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.850
both patients and doctors
where there is

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:54.150
clearly over treatment.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:02.240
There, of course, exists under
treatment as a problem, and we

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.300
know that both making patients
pay more and putting risk on

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.286
providers, through making them
bear the cost of CAT scans out

00:37:10.286 --> 00:37:12.430
of their pocket, will move
us in this direction.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.680
The question is, does it move
us past the happy medium, or

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.070
does it just move us towards
the happy medium?

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.810
In the back was asked a
question about patient

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.990
payments, and here we know the
answer, which is making

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.670
patients pay more reduces
utilization but still leaves

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.950
us on the right side of a
laughter curve if we come to

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.120
our tax analysis.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.440
It still leaves us in the place
where we're still, on

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.050
average, still probably doing
too much care, but

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.450
less too much care.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.660
What about providers?

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.440
Well, we have evidence on that,
which is we've put in

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.960
prospective payment systems
in a number of different

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.790
contexts, and typically we also
find it does not hurt

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:52.410
health, that providers still
provide, if anything, too much

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.500
care and not too little.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.060
Now, we've never put
in a pure system of

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.380
the kind I've described.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.220
We've always put in sort of
mixed systems, where you get a

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.690
$1,500 check, but if you do a
lot of stuff, we'll also pay

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.140
you extra, a little bit.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.735
So we've never put in a pure
prospective system.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.440
So for example, we put in a
system like this for Medicare,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.300
the way Medicare
pays hospitals.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.550
Medicare use to pay hospitals,
that when you went to the

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.920
hospital, and the hospital
billed Medicare,

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.150
they just paid it.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.860
Medicare then put in something
which said, look, if someone

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.620
goes in the hospital with this
given diagnosis, we'll pay you

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.870
this fixed amount, so it's
more prospective.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:29.660
What they found was an amazing
reduction in how intensely

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:30.980
elders were being treated.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.930
The average length of stay for
an elderly person in the

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.430
hospital fell 20% in one year.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.590
There's an enormous reduction
in how long elders were kept

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.090
in hospital and how intensely
they were treated, yet elders

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.110
were no worse off.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:45.290
So we moved in this direction,
but we clearly haven't moved

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.250
passed the middle.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.760
Questions about that?

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.120
So basically, what the bill
does is it tries to set up

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.390
incentives, on both patients and
providers, to behave more

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.640
economically, but the answer
is it's still very small.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.260
We're still years away from
really putting those

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.420
incentives in place in a major
way, and that's sort of the

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:08.600
next round of health care reform
that has to go on.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.890
And that's all.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.520
I don't want to go
on too long.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.190
I just wanted to give you an
overview of one example of how

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.120
we take a public policy tool and
deal with these problems

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.370
that we've raised earlier
in the course.

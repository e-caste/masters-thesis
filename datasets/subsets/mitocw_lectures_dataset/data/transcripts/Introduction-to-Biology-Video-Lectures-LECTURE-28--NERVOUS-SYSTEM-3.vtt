00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, everybody.
Can we get started?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So my name is Andrew Chess. And
I'm lecturing today replacing

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Eric Lander for the day.
He had to be out of town,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
something that he could not
reschedule. He really tries to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
arrange his very busy
schedule so that he is here,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but this was something that
could not be rearranged. Anyway.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So I am a professor at
Harvard Medical School,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but I have a long history here at
MIT, including being on the faculty

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
here for a number of years. I
used to teach undergraduates.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And even going back further than
that, I actually took this class.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It was called 7.01 without
any extra number at that time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now it is what, 7.012 or 7.
13? 0-1-2. Anyway. So it was

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
called 7.01. And it was an
extremely interesting introduction

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to biology back then. It was
some time over 20 years ago.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm not sure exactly how many years.
I kind of stopped counting at 20.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So when Eric called me, when
Professor Lander called me up to ask

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
me to give this lecture, I
talked to him for a while and I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
agreed to do it. And then
I was thinking about what

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to present. And I went over the
material that he has presented to

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
earlier this week. And I
discussed with him some of

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the things that he likes to do for
the third lecture on neurobiology.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I also thought about some of
the things that I would like to do.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And so one of the things
that occurred to me,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so it's probably occurred to
you from hearing Eric talk about

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
neurobiology earlier this week that
he is very enthusiastic about the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
subject. He always talks about it
as being one of the driving forces

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that led him to enter biology from
the realm of mathematics where he

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
started his academic career.
Anyway. So he's always talked to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
me, in the years I've known him,
about how he loves neurobiology.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I was thinking about
it. It is, in some ways,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
kind of ironic that Eric loves
neurobiology so much because in some

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
ways he's been a big
trouble-maker for neurobiology.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Let me explain. So Eric,
Professor Lander is, of course,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
as you all know, was an instrumental
driving force behind the sequencing

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
of the human genome.
Before all those efforts,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
over the last decade, people used
to go around, biologists used to go

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
around to each other
and they would talk.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And they would say there are around
100,000 genes in the human genome,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
or 100,000 genes in a mouse genome.
Mammalian genomes have around

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
100,000 genes. Sometimes
some people would say 90,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
00 genes. Sometimes they
would say 110,000 genes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But generally it was around
100, 00 genes. And everybody was

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
comfortable with that. In
fact, right around the turn of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the century when the stock
market was going way up,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the Internet bubble and
biotech bubble and everything,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
estimates of the number of
genes in a human genome actually

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
went higher also. They
went up as high as 120,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
00, 150,000. And this, I think,
was because various companies were

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
competing to have the most genes
on their kind of micro array or

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
whatever they were selling. They
wanted to say we have the most,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and so they kept saying more.
The academic scientist usually

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
still stayed around 100, 00
in terms of their thinking.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
OK. The other thing
that was of a lot of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
use to neurobiologists in terms of
them feeling that their problem of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
trying to figure out how the brain
is set up as a tractable problem was

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that they thought there were going
to be lots of genes available.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So there were 100,000 genes in the
genome, and around half of them,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
people would say, are
probably brain-specific.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So there were a variety of pieces
of evidence that people would think

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that a lot of the genes in the
genome would be brain-specific.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And that still remains the case.
But, as you know from Eric Landers

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and other people's work sequencing
the genome and mouse genome and

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
other genomes now, it looks
like mammals now have only

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
around 30,000 to 40,000 genes.
Now, if Eric told you a different

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
number listen to his number.
What did he say? [20,000 to 25,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
00?]. OK. Anyway. So many
fewer than 100,000. OK?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
A small number. A fly is thought
to have only around 15,000 genes.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So Lander is now saying that humans
don't have that many more genes than

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
flies. So this presented a
problem for neurobiologists,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
because even if you have
half of them brain-specific,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
you still don't have nearly as
many genes to play with to make the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
complex structure of the brain
as you did when there were 100,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
00 genes in the genome.
So the brain, of course,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is an extremely complicated
structure. There are thought to be

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
somewhere between 100 billion and
a trillion different neurons in the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
brain, and they also fall into
many, many different neural types.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And so the developmental process,
developmental biology is something

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that some of you will study in
future courses and you'll have had

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
some introduction to here,
that's how you get from a single

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
fertilized egg, a single
cell to the complex

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
organism. In the brain it's a
particularly difficult problem

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
because you have so many different
types of cells and so many cells.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And each cell then makes all
of these complex connections.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
A given neuron might connect to 1,
00 or a few thousand different other

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
cells as a normal process. So
forming all these different kinds

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
of neurons and wiring up
is a very daunting problem.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So what I thought I would do today
would be to focus on two examples

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
where in each case, starting
with either one gene or a

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
small number of genes you
get a lot of complexity.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So this would then allow the
smaller number of total gene number

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in the human genome to allow a lot
of different kinds of proteins and

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
maybe provide some explanations
for certain parts of the complexity

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
of the brain. Now, by
no means am I going to

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
attempt to explain all
of how the brain develops.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
That would take, well,
at least one course,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
more likely a few different courses
to actually get a good appreciation

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
of that, but I'm going to go through
a couple of very intriguing examples

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that are approachable at
the level of this class.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:43.000
OK. So the
standard way that we

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
think about how genetic information
gets made into proteins is that

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
there is DNA and then RNA and then
proteins. I hope at this point in 7.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
1 this is all familiar to you.
Good. OK. So the DNA sequence

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
gets transcribed into an RNA,
and then there's a splicing event

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
which takes bits and pieces
of the RNA, puts them together,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and then there's an area of the
RNA that tells the ribosome to start

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
making protein. And
so you get the protein

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
synthesis. Everything
is following from the

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
blueprint that was in the DNA.
So what I'm going to talk about

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
today are two different examples.
One of them involves alternative

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:49.000
splicing.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And that will be causes where
instead of there being a static

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
always reproduced way of going
from DNA to RNA to a protein,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that there are different alternative
splicing events that can occur.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And this can allow one gene to make
multiple different protein products.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And then I'm going to go over
another way that you can violate

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
this central dogma,
this DNA, RNA to protein,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
which is something called RNA
editing. So, as you might imagine

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
from the common usage of the word
editing, by editing what we mean is

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that the RNA sequence itself is
actually changed so that it no

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
longer reflect the exact
nucleotide sequence of the DNA.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
This can also add diversity to the
number of potential encoded proteins.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I want to make sure that
I, I'm going to talk about

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
neural-specific examples, but
I want to mention that these

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
processes, alternative splicing and
RNA editing are used also by other

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
parts of the developing animal,
and also in other plants and other

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
organisms, but not just by the
brain to generate diversity.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So these are mechanisms that are
widely used. But some of the most

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
striking examples, as you'll
see from my lecture and in

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
further reading that you might
do in the future, some of the most

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
striking examples come
from the nervous system.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And that's not surprising given the
complexity of the nervous system and

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the fact that there are so many
genes out there ready to help with

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
this complexity. So
the first I'll turn to

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:44.000
alternative splicing.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So first, before getting into the
extremely complex case that I'm

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
going to focus on, I'm
going to just briefly,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
by way of introduction, go
over a standard alternative

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:15.000
splicing scenario.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
OK. So in a gene for which
there is no alternative splicing,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000
if I draw the exons as boxes
and the introns as lines,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000
what winds up happening is you have
the first exon spliced to the second

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
one, second to the third, third
to the forth. And so what you

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:00.000
wind up with is
a messenger RNA.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So here is the messenger RNA which
has been spliced from the primary

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
transcript. The primary transcript,
of course, reflects the actual

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
structure of the DNA in
terms of sequence also,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
because in the genomic DNA you'd
also have areas that are going to be

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
exon, intron, exon intron exactly
like this. So this is just a

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
general example of alternative
splicing, I'm sorry,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
of regular splicing. So then
alternative splicing would involve

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
something like this.
You'd have 1, 2,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000
3A, 3B, 4. So then what happens is
you have normal splicing from 1 to 2.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And then 2 could either go to 3A,
which will then go to 4 leaving 3B

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:00.000
out. Or the alternative is
that 2 can skip 3A, go to 3B,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
which will then splice to 4. So
this allows then two different

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:33.000
messengers
to be formed.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So this 3A and 3B might encode
a slightly different sequence and

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
might then allow two distinct
proteins with different functions to

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
be forwarded from one message.
So this is an example, a simple

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
example, a general example
of alternative splicing.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
So from one gene you
have two proteins.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.000
The example that
I'm going to focus

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
on today, instead of going
from one gene to two proteins,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
allows you to go from one gene
to 38, 00 different possibilities.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It's actually 38,016 to be exact,
and I'll explain to you why, but 38,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
00 will have occurred to you that
this is larger than the number of

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
genes that Eric Lander says
are in the human genome.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's certainly larger than the
number of genes in the fly genome.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And this example I'm giving you is
from a single gene in the fruit fly.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
This one gene can come
in 38,000 different forms.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The gene is called
drosophila DSCAM.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It's named for a human gene which
was cloned first and characterized

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
first which was called just plain
DSCAM. What DSCAM stands for is

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Down syndrome cell
adhesion molecule.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And let me just
explain briefly why

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
it has this name. I don't
think that this name is

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
actually relevant so much to
the biology, and it certainly not

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
relevant to the alternative splicing
because the human gene and the mouse

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
gene, neither of them have a
lot of alternative splicing.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
This is something that
is particular to the fly.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
That's something I will
return to later in lecture.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
This name Down syndrome cell
adhesion molecule came about because

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
this was cloned first from
human and it's located on human

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
chromosome 21.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Chromosome 21 is normally present
in two copies in every individual.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
In individuals who wind up with
three copies of chromosome 21,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
something called trisomy 21,
trisomy 21 causes Down syndrome,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
which is a syndrome that has some
brain manifestations like mental

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
retardation, and also has a
number of other problems associated

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
with it. When the people
who found this gene

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
found it they named it. So
they gave the first part of its

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
name, the DS comes from Down
syndrome. Cell adhesion molecule

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
comes from the fact that this gene
is similar in structure to a lot of

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
known cell adhesion molecules
that are encoded by many different

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
loci in the genome. And
they initially thought that

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
perhaps, and this gene is expressed
in the brain. And they initially

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
thought that perhaps having an
extra copy, a third copy of this gene

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
might be what's causing a
lot of the brain phenotypes.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Subsequent work has not provided
further evidence for that.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So at this point what I would say
is that the name of the gene is Down

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
syndrome cell adhesion molecule,
DSCAM. It's on human chromosome 21.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It may play a role in Down
syndrome but there isn't --

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
The name is really the best
evidence that it plays a role,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
just the fact that they named it
that. OK. But in the fly this is

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
an extremely interesting
molecule because, as I mentioned,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
it can come in 38,000 different
forms. OK. So as for why you would

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
have a cell adhesion molecule
in the brain, I just want to

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
mention briefly. So Professor
Lander went over with

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
you the structure of a neuron.
That neurons have cell bodies and

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
axons and growth cones which allow
them to get to wherever they're

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
supposed to connect. One of
the types of molecules that

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
allows an axon as it's growing,
the growth cone to lead an axon

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
along a complex path is to interact
with various structures that it

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
encounters. And so cell adhesion
molecule is one of the kinds of

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
molecules that can allow the growth
cone and then the rest of the axon

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to interact with various other cells
or other extracellular substrates,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
proteins that have been deposited
by other kinds of cells as they make

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
their way and make the appropriate
connections in the brain.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So cell adhesion molecules
are one of the mechanisms.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
There are also mechanisms that
allow cells to respond to gradients

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
of chemical signaling messengers.
Question? Yes. Could you explain

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
what a growth cone is?
Oh, I'm sorry. That was not

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
covered? OK. So the
neuron has a cell body

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
with a nucleus and all the other
stuff that's in regular cells that

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
you learned about. It
then has an axon which then

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
allows it to connect. And
this connection could be very

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
far away. In the case of, for
example, a motor neuron in the

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
spinal cord that's intermating
a muscle in the foot,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
that single cell would have its cell
body in the spinal cord and its axon

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
go all the way out to the foot.
OK? So that's just an example of

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
one very long neuron.
Some of them are very long.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Some of them are shorter. So this
is the axon. At the tip of the axon

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
is this thing which looks sort of
like my son's mitten when it's cold

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
outside. But this is the growth
cone. And basically what's going on

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
is as the axon is growing out in
this direction it's feeling its way.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And there might be cell adhesion
molecules on these different

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
protrusions that if they
attach really well --

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Like let's say that this area over
here is stickier for this particular

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
growth cone than this area over
here. Then this growth axon is more

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
likely to grow in that direction.
OK. So cell adhesion molecules are

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
well known to play important
roles in axon guidance.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
It's how axons grow in
different directions.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
So I will tell you know about the
DSCAM gene, and that will give some

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
insight into how the 38, 00
different forms might be used

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
because they're going to provide
different kinds of stickiness.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Let me explain.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
So this is a drawing of the genomic
organization of DSCAM that allows

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:13.000
the extensive
alternative splicing.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
So this diagram is similar to the
diagram that I drew by hand for the

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
more simple cases. But
basically in DSCAM what you

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
start out with is exon 1 gets
spliced to exon 2 gets spliced to

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
exon 3, and then when you reach
exon 4 there are 12 distinct

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
possibilities. And only
one of the 12 is chosen.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
In this case the diagram shows
it choosing, I don't know,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
the ninth one perhaps. Then exon
5 is regular so that always gets

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
included. And exon 6 there
are 48 distinct choices.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And again only one is chosen.
Here, in this example, this one has

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
been chosen at the expense
of all of these other ones.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Exon 7 and 8 are normal. And
exon 9 there are 33 choices.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Exon 17 there are two choices. And
if you multiple 2 x 33 x 48 x 12

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
you wind up with 38, 16.
There is evidence from a number

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
of different types of studies,
including coning and sequencing,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
lots of different messenger RNAs
that are already spliced that

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
basically almost all of these forms
can be made. So what this structure

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
allows is for there to be diversity
generated in important areas of the

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
cell adhesion part
of this molecule.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:53.000
The DSCAM molecule
starts out with a

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
number of domains which are
called immunoglobulin-like domains.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Immunoglobulin
domains are named for

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
immunoglobulins which is
another name for antibodies.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Antibodies help you fight infection.
I don't know if that's been covered.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Has it been covered? Yes.
And the particular fold that

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
they form allows recognition of
foreign antigens and it also allows

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
stickiness of molecules in general.
So cell adhesion molecules often

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
have these immunoglobulin
domains. The DSCAM starts out with,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
from the N-terminus towards
the C-terminus it starts out,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
the first nine domains are these Ig
type domains. That's then followed

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
by another kind of domain called
a fiberonectin type domain,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
which that's not important.
All of the diversity is in this

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
nine immunoglobulin domain.
The exon 4 diversity allows

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
diversity of the second of the
nine. The exon 6 alternative splicing

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
affects the third out of the
nine immunoglobulin folds.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
And the exon 9 diversity affects
the seventh. So of these nine

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
domains of immunoglobulin folds
that allow for different kinds of

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
stickiness, a lot
of them are the same.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
One is the same. 4,
5 and 6 are the same.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And 8 and 9 are the same.
But 2, 3 and 7 have these

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
differences which are encoded
by this striking kind of genomic

00:23:44.000 --> 00:24:11.000
structure and
alternative splicing.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:29.000
So how is this
diversity used?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
So the early models for how DSCAM
would be used stipulated that

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
individual different kinds of
neurons might express vastly reduced

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
subsets out of the 38,
00. So let's say that one

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
particular neuron type, of
which there might be many

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
different neurons, might
express maybe ten out of the

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
38,000 or even one out of 38,000.
These were the different kinds of

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
models that were tossed around by
people who were thinking about this

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
problem. But then people started to
study it. And what turned out to be

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
the case is that it looks like every
kind of neuron population at first

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
approximately expresses almost
all of the different forms.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
OK? So these are wrong, these
models. And each different

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
neuron type expresses a
slightly different repertoire.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
But at first approximation over 10,
00 or 20,000 forms are possible for

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
each different neuron type.
So that then caused people to

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
scratch their heads and wonder,
well, how is this used then? How is

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
this used to make different kinds
of neurons different from one another

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
or anything in the
function of them?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
So the answer to this question has
emerged in part from analyses of

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
individual single cells. So
it turns out that an individual

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000
cell, and I'm using the word cell
and neuron interchangeably because

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
neurons are cells. And not
all cells are neurons but

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
all neurons are cells. So
for one cell or one neuron it

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000
makes somewhere in the
range of 10 to 50 forms.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
These are randomly chosen,
apparently from the data that's

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
available, from the tens of
thousands of forms that are possible.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
So you can imagine that two
neighboring cells that are otherwise

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
identical, that each are picking,
let's say ten just to make it easy,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
ten different forms of DSCAM, are
going to wind up with very different

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
repertoires of DSCAM
than an adjacent cell.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
So what this allows is each
individual cell to have a unique

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
identity. The whole idea that
individual neurons might need to

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
have a unique identity actually
is a new concept that's really been

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
enlightened by this molecule.
Because the way that people used to

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
think of neurons is that they would
wind up with unique identities based

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
on the connections or experience,
what they were exposed to in terms

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
of different stimuli. But what
this indicates is that from

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
the splicing of an individual gene
and the fact that each time this

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
gene gets spliced you can wind up
with a different form that at any

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
given time each cell will have
a unique set of messenger RNAs,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
and therefore proteins
encoding this DSCAM gene.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
OK. So I mentioned earlier that
the human DSCAM does not have

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
alternative splicing. We all
like to think of ourselves,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
humans and other mammals as having
brains that are on the level of

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
complexity, at least on par with
the fly. And so it's odd to think of

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
all this complexity that's there for
flies and other insects but why is

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
it not there for humans? Well,
it turns out that there are

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
other kinds of genes that do have
extensive alternative splicing in

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
mammals. So one of them is called
neurexins. These are genes that are

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
involved in synapse, how
the different kinds of cells

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
communicate with each other at the
interface. There are genes called

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
protocadherins. And there
are also other kinds of

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
genes that all have extensive
alternative splicing in mammals.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Interestingly, these
genes tend not to have

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
extensive alternative splicing in
flies. It's as if in each lineage

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
certain genes have been chosen
to get a lot of diversity by this

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
mechanism of alternative splicing
and other genes are left with their

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
just standard single
function where it's one gene,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
one RNA, one protein. OK.
So I'm going to switch now to

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
the second example
which is RNA editing.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:41.000
So, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
RNA editing involves an actual
change in the RNA sequence so that

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
it no longer reflects the
exact DNA sequence. Now,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
this is different than splicing.
Splicing takes different pieces of

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
RNA and splices them together
leaving out intervening sequences or

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
introns. But in RNA editing you
actually change the nucleotide

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
sequence so that it no longer
is identical to the DNA.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
This is used in a number of parts of
the brain. Most of the examples are

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
brain-specific. There are
some non-brain specific

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
parts. Most of the time the
editing event changes in adenosine,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
an A in the ACGT
nomenclature, into an inosine.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:34.000
This is read
differently by the

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
ribosome than the adenosine. So
this leads, for example, in an

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
important kind of channel
called a glutamate receptor.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And the specific subtype that I'm
talking about is something called an

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
AMPA glutamate receptor. That's
for a chemical ligand that

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
activates this particular
kind of glutamate receptor.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:10.000
This leads to an important change
of a glutamine to an arginine in the

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.000
protein. So let me draw a quick
diagram of what the protein looks

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000
like so we can see what the
importance of this glutamine to

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:36.000
arginine switch in this
glutamate receptor is.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:47.000
So in the absence
of detailed

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
structural information about
different kinds of neurotransmitter

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
receptors people often draw a
diagram like this where this is the

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
outside of the cell, this
is the inside of the cell,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
this represents the cell membrane.
And here's the amino terminus.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
And then they draw a transmembrane
portion. And this is what's called

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
a reentrant loop. It doesn't
quite pass through the

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
membrane, but then it passes
the membrane again. And here's

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000
the carboxy terminus. The
glutamine to arginine change is

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.000
here. It's in this area which
is involved in making the pore.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:50.000
So the pore of the
channel has this change.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Glutamine to
arginine change.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
This vastly changes the
properties of the channel,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000
a channel that doesn't
undergo this editing event.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
So let me just state that
for the GluR2 AMPA receptor,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000
which is one of four different
genes, it is 99% edited in adults.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
So where over 99% of the time this
adenosine is made into an inosine

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
which leads to a glutamine
becoming an arginine in the protein.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
What this does to channel is
it changes its permeability.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
So this is a kind of channel that
is mostly designed to let sodium in,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
but if it doesn't get edited,
if the glutamine is there it also

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
lets calcium in. So whether
or not calcium gets into

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
the cell is very important because
they're both, both sodium and

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
calcium are cat ions and can lead
to membrane, potential disturbances

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
like you learned about earlier this
week, leading to an action potential.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
But calcium also has other effects.
It can lead ultimately to the turn

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
on and off of genes and
phosphorylation of various proteins

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
to other kinds of effects in
the neuron. So it has to be

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
regulated very tightly. So
these channels are designed to

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
just let sodium through, to
be involved in the transmission

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
of an action potential
from one neuron to the next.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
So if you had a perturbation in
this process you would then also let

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
calcium in because the glutamine
containing channel lets calcium in.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
In fact, early in development it's
probably true that you don't edit

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
100% and you let a
little bit of calcium in.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And there are also other glutamate
receptors that are not part of the

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
AMPA family but they are related.
And they're encoded by genes called,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
so this GluR1 through 4 encodes AMPA
receptors, a gene called GluR5 and 6,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
they have editing which is more
regulated. And by regulated I mean

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
that the editing is sometimes
present and sometimes not.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
So even within a given neuron you
might have some channels that have

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
the glutamine and some
channels that have the arginine.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
There are also
other sites.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
I've talked about the main site.
This is the one that has the most

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
profound impact on the function of
the protein. There are also other

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
sites in the molecule that are
edited. And then they also have

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
important but slightly less
prominent roles in the regulation of

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
these channels. So what
leads this gene to become

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
edited? Why do most genes not
become edited and this gene becomes

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
edited? Well, people are
starting to pursue that

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
kind of mechanisms. And
one of the mechanisms that's

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
become very clear is that, for
example, in the Q to R change in

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
the pore, or the adenosine to
inosine change in the messenger RNA

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
that leads to the Q to R change
in the pore, if you look at

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
the exon where that --
I'll draw it as an A.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Where that A is present.
There's an area, and then here's

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
the intron, of the intronic sequence
which actually loops back and then

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000
allows base pairing to form between
the messenger RNA and the intron.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
And then the enzymes that are
involved in mediating this adenosine

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
to inosine change recognize the base
pairing of this short area and some

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
sequence specificity to the
RNA sequence that's around here.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
It's not just any base pairing,
but the base pairing is critical.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
And then the enzymes, which
are called adenosine deaminase,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000
can mediate this change of
an adenosine to an inosine.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
So this gene has been selected
to have parts of its intron,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
in addition to allowing splicing
to occur, to actual be able to base

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
pair and allow this editing function
to happen. And so this allows an

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
individual gene then to make
more than one form of protein.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
OK. One other example that I'll
tell you about of RNA editing

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
involves the serotonin system.
It involves a serotonin receptor

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
which has RNA editing. And
this is a serotonin receptor

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000
whose name is serotonin receptor 2C,
so it's often written as 5-HT or 5

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
hydroxtryptamine 2C serotonin
receptor. This receptor is a member

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:33.000
of the G protein-coupled
receptor super family.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
G protein-coupled receptors are
7-transmembrane domain receptors.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
And the editing of the serotonin
receptor occurs in the second

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000
intracellular loop and affects
the coupling to G protein.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000
So the way that these G
protein-coupled receptors --

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Did they do this already?
G protein-coupled receptors

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
transduce the signal through a G
protein which often binds to the

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
intracellular loops,
particularly the second loop.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And the editing event which
changes adenosines to inosines,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
there are actually a few
of them in this region here,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
a few different sites which can
get changed. That affects the

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
efficiency of the transduction,
when serotonin is present the

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
transduction of a
signal inside the cell.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
There are other serotonin receptors
that are ligand gated channels but

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
they don't appear to have the same
kind of editing as this serotonin

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
receptor that is of the G
protein-coupled variety has.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:59.000
So I'll end with
just one final note

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
about this serotonin receptor which
is that a drug called fluoxetine or

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Prozac, did Eric go over
that this year? Prozac?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
No? He mentioned it. OK,
he mentioned it. So it's

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
mostly known as something which
blocks reuptake of serotonin.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
So one cell releases serotonin,
which is a neurotransmitter.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Another cell responds to it.
If you block the reuptake the

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
neurotransmitter is present in the
synapse for a longer amount of time

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
leading to increased signaling.
Prozac is widely thought to have its

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
main effect, and that probably is
its main effect to just block the

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
reuptake leading to
increased serotonin signaling.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Someone has studied the serotonin
receptor in individuals who are

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
taking Prozac versus individuals
who are not taking Prozac.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
And what they found was that there
were differences in the amount of

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
editing of various sites in this
key area in individuals taking Prozac

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
versus individuals
not taking Prozac.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
And the direction of the difference,
whether it's switching from edited

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
to unedited or back, and
it varies for the different

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
sites, the direction was the
opposite of what was seen in a

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
comparison of brains of victims
of suicide versus brains of other

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
accident victims. So it
looks like Prozac is having

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
an effect which is in the opposite
effect to the skewing of editing

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
that one sees in certain
cases of depression.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
So I bring that example up because
it's important to know that,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
you know, if you can impact on some
of these subtle differences between

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
different kinds of messages,
like whether it's edited or not or

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
whether the splicing is more towards
one kind of alternative splicing or

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
another kind of alternative splicing,
these might provide very interesting

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
pharmacologic targets for therapies
that might impact on a variety of

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
different human diseases. So
what I've hoped to do is give you

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
a sense of a couple of different
examples where you can take a single

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
gene and make more than one protein,
and this can lead to increases in

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
the diversity of neurons,
and therefore increases in the

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
complexity of the brain.
Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Are there

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
questions?

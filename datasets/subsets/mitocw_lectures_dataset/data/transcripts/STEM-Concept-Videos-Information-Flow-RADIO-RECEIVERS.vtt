00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.610
Lot's of things in our lives transmit signals.
From your cell phone when it's making a call,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.660
to your computer when it's sending an email,
to your local radio station when it's broadcasting.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.369
Here you see two objects that receive signals
- they are radio receivers. Have you ever

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.580
wondered how they pick out the signal they
want out of all of the radio waves around

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.029
them? In this video, we're going to find out.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.180
This video is part of the information flow
video series. A system is shaped and changed

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.310
by the nature and flow of information into,
within, and out of the system.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.360
Hi, my name is Elena Glassman, and I am a
graduate student in the Electrical Engineering

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
and Computer Science Department at MIT.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.490
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with basic electrical circuits, and

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.540
how inductors, capacitors, and AM radio transmitters
work.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.770
After watching this video, you will be able
to explain how a basic radio receiver circuit

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.770
functions to select particular radio frequencies.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.049
This Hammarlund HQ120 communications receiver
was introduced in 1938. It tunes in radio

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.590
waves ranging from 540 thousand cycles per
second to 30 million cycles per second. It

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.439
can decode signals encoded with Amplitude
Modulation, abbreviated as AM, or "continuous

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.408
wave" modulation, abbreviated as CW.

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:41.749
This Drake R-4 was introduced later, in 1964,
and is optimized for amateur radio bands within

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:47.819
the same frequency range covered by the HQ120.
Both of these radios were popular with amateur

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.530
radio operators.
Amateur radio operators are radio enthusiasts

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.399
who pass U.S. Federal Communications Commission
tests to receive official government call

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.170
signs and the right to broadcast on select
bands.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.009
Amateur radio operators are anything but amateur,
serving as part of an important worldwide

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.890
network. When cell phones, the internet, or
other communication networks are down, amateur

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.810
radio operators can help pass along important
information. Amateur radio operators have

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.650
historically experimented with and advanced
cutting-edge radio technologies. (viewers

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.640
hear radio making some noise)

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.099
Let's delve deeper into how these radios receive
information.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.599
Recall that radio waves are electromagnetic
waves whose frequencies fall in a certain

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.500
range. A variety of data types can be transmitted
over radio waves by systematically modulating

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.730
some property of the wave.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.739
The information we want to transmit--say speech
or music--has a much lower frequency than

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.709
the carrier radio wave. We can encode this
lower frequency by modulating the amplitude

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.140
of the carrier wave. This is called Amplitude
Modulation, which is used in AM radio.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.629
CW radio stands for continuous wave modulation
and is traditionally used to transmit Morse

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.870
code by switching the carrier signal on and
off.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.870
All of the signals being transmitted around
the globe are superimposed on to each other.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.299
Our goal is to understand how a basic radio
circuit, called the regenerative circuit,

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.150
works to pick out one frequency. This circuit
was a breakthrough in radio technology both

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.930
in terms of amplification and selectivity.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.329
It was invented in 1914 by American electrical
engineer Edwin Armstrong when he was an undergraduate

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.700
at Columbia University.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.379
This circuit was widely used in radio receivers,
called regenerative receivers, between 1920

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.379
and World War II. They are still used in low-cost
electronic equipment such as garage door openers.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.890
Our Hammerlund and Drake radios use more sophisticated
circuitry, also invented by Armstrong. However,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.890
we're going focus on the more basic and still
powerful regenerative circuit.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:22.939
The regenerative circuit seen here is a classical,
elegant electrical circuit that amplifies

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.250
while selecting a particular radio wave frequency.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.800
Let's start by identifying the elements from
this diagram in our actual radio. This is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.340
the antenna for the radio.
And this is the symbol for that antenna in

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.220
our diagram.
This dial allows us to control the frequency

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.470
we're selecting. And this is the variable
capacitance element that determines which

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.000
frequency this basic regenerative receiver
circuit will select for.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.490
This is a vacuum tube in the radio.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.680
And in the diagram. It is going to act as
an amplifier.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.400
Together the volume control and the speaker
enable us to hear the information decoded

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.360
from the radio signal.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.020
These are represented by a variable resistor
and the headphone cartoon in our diagram.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.569
Now let's understand how this circuit works!
Radio waves induce waves of alternating current

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.720
through the antenna. By the phenomenon of
inductive coupling, the radio wave energy

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.300
is picked up by this tuned circuit, which
is just an inductor and variable capacitor

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.300
in parallel. This circuit acts like an echo
chamber for radio waves.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.110
To get a better sense of how this parallel
inductor and capacitor work, let's look at

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.580
a system with which you may be more familiar--brass
instruments.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.500
Brass players create lots of sound frequencies
when they blow through their mouthpieces.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.729
[sound of buzzing]
The brass tube acts as a resonant cavity or

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.139
echo chamber. Sound waves bounce back and
forth between each end of the tube.

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.099
Particular frequencies constructively interfere
or reinforce each other, while other frequencies

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:11.370
destructively interfere, and therefore have
their amplitude diminished.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.259
As the slide is moved, the length of the tube
changes, and that changes which frequencies

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:23.680
are reinforced and which frequencies are damped.
This parallel inductor and capacitor act the

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.680
same way for radio waves. Changing the capacitance
of the capacitor is equivalent to changing

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.430
the length of the trombone's tube by moving
the slide.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.050
The noise produced by buzzing into the mouthpiece
and filtering it with the brass tube is sufficient

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.199
to produce audible sound.

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:48.990
But radio waves may be coming from transmitters
very far away, and may have very small amplitudes

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:55.909
by the time they reach us. It's not uncommon
for these receivers to pick up radio stations

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:02.810
part way around the globe. How are we going
to deal with this? We need amplification!

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:08.099
The radio waves echoing in the tuned circuit
here are applied to the input of this vacuum

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:14.810
tube, which acts as an amplifier. An amplifier
reproduces the signal applied to its input,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:21.639
but with greater magnitude. The added energy
comes from a local power source, like a battery.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:26.409
That might be enough amplification, but we
can do even better using positive feedback!

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:33.409
The tickler, located here, takes the amplified
radio signal from the vacuum tube and feeds

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:40.009
it back into the echo chamber, to reinforce
new radio waves coming in from the antenna

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:42.050
at that same frequency!

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:48.229
A frequency is strengthened by the echo chamber
alone, so it becomes even larger in amplitude

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:54.569
after amplification and positive feedback
into the same echo chamber! Likewise, any

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:59.889
frequencies that did not resonate well in
the echo chamber will be diminished further

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:06.590
with each circulation back through the loop.
This echo chamber with its output amplified

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:12.800
and fed back into itself is what is responsible
for achieving our stated goal of selecting

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.800
only one frequency to tune in to, in the presence
of all the other frequencies carrying information.

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:25.590
Now that we have selected and amplified the
carrier frequency, we still need to extract

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:31.129
the original information.

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:37.940
You might expect our signal after amplification
to look like this. But the information encoded

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:44.940
in the amplitude would be hard to decode because
the average amplitude is constant everywhere.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:50.860
Luckily for us, the vacuum tube is a nonlinear
amplifier.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:57.760
It accentuates the lower half of the signal
and diminishes the top half, giving us a signal

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.760
that looks more like this.
Since headphones are natural smoothing filters

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:11.510
that convert variations in current to air
pressure waves, the user hears the original

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:18.510
information encoded in the AM signal. If we
hadn't accentuated the lower half of the signal

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.149
before smoothing, you wouldn't hear anything.
There's one last aspect of this simple regenerative

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:21.250
receiver we'd like to point out.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:21.480
After all this selective amplification of
the carrier frequency, we must still extract

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.630
the information carried by the envelope of
its amplitude.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:21.890
We take advantage of the imperfect amplification
of the vacuum tube to accentuate the lower

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:21.959
half of the signal.

00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:22.180
Since headphones are natural smoothing filters
that convert variations in current to air

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:22.410
pressure waves, the user hears the original
information encoded in the AM signal.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:29.410
It was extremely clever to use a single tube
to amplify, provide selectivity, and demodulate

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:37.470
an AM signal at a time when tubes were very
expensive and considered cutting edge.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:43.120
This Drake R-4 radio uses more sophisticated
circuitry but even modern radio receivers

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:50.120
are built with digital circuits that operate
on the same basic principles!

00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:00.800
Radio is a cool, handy way to disseminate
information, so humans have created lots and

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:07.290
lots of electromagnetic waves and transmitted
them into the air at various frequencies.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.320
We've even standardized who can transmit and
at what frequency.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:18.320
Here's the radio spectrum that is available.
You see AM and FM broadcast within this spectrum.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.779
This radio spectrum has been divided up even
further for different uses: mobile phones,

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:31.750
amateur astronomy, satellites, space research,
amateur radio, and Earth research.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:38.060
Zooming out further we see that lots of different
communities have their own spot allocated.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.470
Out of all of that radio activity, we can
now pull out what we personally want. Maybe

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:49.220
it's finding a friend or fellow amateur radio
operator transmitting from another continent,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:56.220
or maybe it's the BBC, broadcasting international
news.

00:10:58.339 --> 00:11:04.970
To summarize, in this video, we have explained
how the components in the regenerative receiver

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:11.970
circuit work together to dampen unwanted frequencies,
while selectively amplifying and demodulating

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:19.540
a desired AM signal. This is no small feat,
given the amount of radio waves humans broadcast!

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:25.660
We've also demonstrated the tuning process
with a Drake R-4 radio receiver built for

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:32.459
amateur radio operators in the 1960s. Learning
about these radio receivers with my dad when

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:38.649
I was a kid was instrumental in developing
my own interest in electrical engineering!

00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:43.160
It was really fun to share some of the circuitry
with you. If you want to try something a little

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:49.320
more hands-on, I recommend checking out the
local amateur radio community or signing up

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.740
for a course in electrical engineering!

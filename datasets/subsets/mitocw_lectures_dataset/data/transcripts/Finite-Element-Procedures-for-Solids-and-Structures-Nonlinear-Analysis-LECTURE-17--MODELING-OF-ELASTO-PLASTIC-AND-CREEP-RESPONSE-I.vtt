00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.440
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.320
lecture on non-linear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.420
structures.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.810
In this lecture, I'd like to
continue with our discussion

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.970
of the use of constitutive
relations

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.930
in non-linear analysis.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.270
In the previous two lectures,
we talked about modeling

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.250
elastic materials in non-linear

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100
finite element analysis.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.720
We talked about the use of
linear stress-strain loss and

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.720
the use of non-linear
stress-strain laws as regard

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.110
to the T.L. and U.L.
Formulations.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.790
I'd like to now discuss with you
the modeling of inelastic

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.790
materials, in particular
elastoplasticity and creep in

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.350
finite element analysis.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.920
Let us proceed as follows.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.200
Let us first briefly discuss
inelastic material behavior as

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.910
we observe them in the
laboratory test results.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.760
Let us then briefly discuss how
we model these laboratory

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.810
test results in one-dimension
analysis.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.210
And then I'd like to generalize
these modeling

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.830
considerations to 2D and
3D stress situations.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.460
So let me now walk over here to
the view graph projector to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880
share the view grass
with you that I've

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.490
prepared for this lecture.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.000
The most distinguishing feature
of an inelastic

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.560
material is that the total
stress is not uniquely related

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.430
to the current total strain.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.270
of course, for an elastic
material, the total stress is

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.430
given uniquely by the total
current strain.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.340
For the inelastic material,
this is not the case.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.650
And to calculate the response
of the material, we need the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.050
response history.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.070
We need to work with stress
increments and strain

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.870
increments throughout
the total solution.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.630
If we look at the equation that
we will be operating upon

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.570
in the analysis, we have on
the left-hand side here a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.640
differential stress increment
given via the elastic

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.680
constitutive tensor times the
total strain increment,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.240
differential total strain
increment, I should say, minus

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.590
the differential inelastic
strain increment.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.960
Now, notice that this here is
really is the differential

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.930
elastic strain increment.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.950
Total strain minus
inelastic strain

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.670
gives us elastic strain.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.410
Of course, always the
differential of course.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.290
And this, therefore, is the
basic relation that we will be

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.070
using, that we are using,
in inelastic response

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.480
calculations.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.380
Notice that I did not include
temperature effects here,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.360
which would mean I would have to
subtract, in addition, the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.940
thermal differential
strain increment.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.250
Later on, we will also consider
such relation.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.550
The inelastic response may occur
rapidly all slowly in

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.170
time, depending on the type of
problem you're dealing with,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.020
depending on the type
of problem you

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.780
want to model in nature.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.360
If the inelastic response occurs
very rapidly, then we

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.050
model it using plasticity
rules.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.820
In other words, in plasticity,
the model assumes that the

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.420
inelastic strain increment
occurs instantaneously.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.450
In creep, however, the model
assumes that the inelastic

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.480
strain occurs as a function of
time, and in fact, this time

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.750
scale here might be hours,
days, or years.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.440
Of course, the actual response
is a combination of these two

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.540
phenomena in nature, and we
therefore use plasticity and

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.800
creep, or alternatively, we may
also use a viscoplastic

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.620
material model to model what
happens in actual nature.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.820
In our discussion now, we want
to consider materially

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.000
non-linear only conditions.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.440
In other words, we only would
focus on material

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.690
non-linearities.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.790
We know that, of course, all
the information that we are

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.250
discussing can directly be
applied in an MNO analysis,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.190
Materially Non-Linear Only
analysis, and it can also

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.520
directly be applied in a large
displacement, large rotation,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.580
by small-strain analysis, by
using the total Lagrangian

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.550
formulation.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.400
We talked in an earlier lecture
about the fact that

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.180
using second Piola-Kirchhoff
stresses and Green-Lagrange

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.140
Strains, we can directly use
the total Lagrangian

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.000
formulation with these stress
and strain measures to model a

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.700
large displacement, large
rotation response of materials

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.980
by using the same material
relationship that we use to

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.390
employ in material non-linear
only analysis, but with these

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.870
two new stress and
strain measures.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.760
Well, this is once more
summarized here, that in other

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.300
words, in the total Lagrangian
information, we use the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.450
Green-Lagrange strain component
instead of the

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.530
engineering strain component,
and the second Piola-Kirchhoff

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.310
stress component instead of
the engineering stress

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.420
component, and then we directly
can, with the

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.510
material relationship that we
have established for an M&O

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.490
analysis, directly with these
material relationships, we can

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.340
model large displacement, large
rotation, but small

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.000
strain problems.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.760
Let us now start by considering
some observations

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.880
off the material response
in laboratory tests.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.130
We only want to look at these
observations schematically,

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.450
and therefore, we do not
give any details.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.470
We also note that regarding the
notation that I want to

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.000
use now, we will not anymore
have the t superscripts on the

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.520
stress and t superscripts
on the strain.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.130
We will not have these t
superscripts when we look at

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.420
laboratory test results.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.410
So whenever we have a material
law, a laboratory material law

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.830
that we're looking on, or
a material law that is

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.630
identified by laboratory test
results, or, in fact, a

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.580
material law that we will enter
into a finite element

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.750
analysis, I will not have the t
superscript on stress and t

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.540
superscript on strain anymore.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.480
We will, however, use those
superscripts again when we

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.480
take that material law and
actually apply it in finite

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.800
element analysis in an
incremental solution.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.450
The material behavior is
obtained by performing a

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.020
tensile test in the laboratory,
schematically

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.930
shown as here.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.500
We have a force p up there,
a force p here.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.020
There is a gauge length.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.930
Given here, the initial
length is l0.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.240
There's cross-sectional area
A0, and of course, the

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.690
engineering strain, notice I now
leave out the t here, the

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.830
upper superscript t.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.130
I leave that out, as
I just explained.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.040
The engineering strain at any
time is given as shown here.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.980
The stress is given,
shown here.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.470
Where l now is the length
of this gauge

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.460
length at that time.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.480
And here we have, shown in red,
how the specimen actually

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.160
were [? deformed. ?]

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.460
Notice A0 here and
l right there.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.820
So l minus l0 is really the
extension of the gauge length.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.610
We divide that by the original
length, and we get the

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.559
engineering strain, the small
strain, measure that we are so

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:41.280
used to seeing in
linear analysis.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.630
And here the engineering stress
that we are so used to

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.830
seeing in linear analysis,
as well.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.730
So this is the test from which
we obtain our information

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.590
regarding the material
behavior.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:59.150
And let's look at,
systematically, test results.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.790
Here we have seen engineering
stress plotted vertically, and

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.950
the engineering strain
plotted horizontally.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.150
And the test result that we
would have obtained are shown

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.520
systematically in red.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.390
Notice fracture occurs
here corresponding

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.100
to an ultimate strain.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.750
Notice that the test, of course,
is performed in the

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.530
tensile region in an
actual analysis.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.952
We also want to apply a
constitutive relation in the

00:09:26.952 --> 00:09:28.090
compressive region.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.270
And it is assumed that the same
behavior that we have in

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.820
the tensile region is
also applicable in

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.150
the compressive region.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.020
So we simply reflect this curve
into the compressive

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.360
region as shown by the
blue dashed line.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.810
These are the test resides
obtained at a constant

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.130
temperature.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.830
Now let us look at the effect
of the strain rate.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:57.190
If the strain rate increases,
in other words, de dt

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.890
increases, we can see that the
test results would change

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.390
schematically, as shown here.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.550
Also, there is an effect
of temperature.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.950
If the temperature is
increasing, but of course at a

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.700
constant temperature, we perform
the test, then as the

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.170
temperature increases for the
different tests, we would see

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.260
that the behavior of the
stress-strain law is shown

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.955
here by these red curves,
schematically.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.000
This is the instantaneous
response of the material.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.510
Now let's look at the
material behavior in

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.350
time dependent response.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.560
In other words, over
a very large time.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.760
Now at a constant stress,
inelastic strains develop.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.730
And this is an important effect
for materials when the

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.320
temperatures are high.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:59.050
A typical response curve,
engineering strain, plotted

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.800
vertically here now, and time
plotted horizontally, is shown

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.020
on this view graph.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.540
Notice there is,
instantaneously, of course,

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.130
inelastic or elastoplastic
strain that occurs.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.940
That's the one we just
talked about.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.230
And then with time, there is
an increase in strain, as

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.800
shown by the red curve here.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.700
We talk about the primary range
of the creep curve, a

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.390
secondary range, and
a tertiary range

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.800
until fracture occurs.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.720
This is a curve at which sigma
is constant and the

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.770
temperature is constant,
as well.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:47.860
If we increase the stress, we,
of course, get an increase in

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.820
the instantaneous strain, as
shown here, but also the

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.670
actual creep strain
will change.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:01.390
And that is indicated
by these red curves.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.540
Once again, fracture up here.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.630
And these are the results now at
a constant temperature, but

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:12.570
at different levels of
constants stresses.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:18.230
The levels of constant stress
means here, one stress, there,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.690
another stress, there, another
stress, and another stress.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.170
But this stress is constant
with time.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.570
There's also a very significant
effect off the

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.665
temperature on the creep
strength, and that is shown on

00:12:32.665 --> 00:12:33.830
this view graph.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.670
Once again, strain plotted
here times there.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.440
There's an initial strain,
of course,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.050
instantaneously reached.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.140
That's the one we talked
about earlier.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.420
And then at a very low
temperature, almost no creep

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.250
effect, as shown here.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.530
Basically a straight line.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.300
Then as the temperature
increases, the material

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:05.940
creeps, and of course, doing
this for this curve, the

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.400
temperature is constant.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.680
For this curve, the temperature

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.130
is constant in time.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.270
For this curve, the temperature
is also constant,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.070
but at a higher level.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.980
And for this curve, the
temperature is also constant

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.150
in time, but still at
a higher level.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.910
And once again, fracture
occurring here, and of course,

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.250
sigma is constant, as well.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:34.180
For each of these curves,
we have the same stress.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.740
But a different temperature
here, then there, then there

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.270
and there, the temperature being
constant in time for

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.650
each of these curves.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.820
these are some typical
laboratory results

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.110
that we would get.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.760
And now we want to look at,
how would we model these

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.570
laboratory test results in a
finite element solution?

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:03.250
And let's look first at the
models we might use for a

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.950
one-dimensional stress
situation.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.630
So we consider a one-dimensional
situation as

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.790
shown schematically here--

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:16.060
a bar under a load p giving
a displacement u.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:20.160
Notice now we go back to
introduce our left superscript

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.580
time t, because we want to look
now at this [? grade ?]

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.210
times t.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.700
The stress at any time is
given by this formula.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.343
The area being constant, of
course, the cross-section of

00:14:31.343 --> 00:14:32.490
the area being constant.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.930
The strain at any time is given
by the displacement

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.870
measured here, at that
time, divided by

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.000
the original length.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.890
Remember, we're talking about
infinitesimally small strain

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.950
conditions.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.510
Let us assume also that the
load has now increased

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.980
monotonically to a final
value, p star.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.010
And let us assume that the time
is long, so that inertia

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.760
effects are negligible,
so we can talk

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.735
about a static analysis.

00:15:03.735 --> 00:15:09.390
If you look at the response
that we would

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.530
see, we see the following.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:18.230
The load increases as shown
here, and here we

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.670
have the time axis.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.930
Notice T star is small.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.090
It's a very small
time interval.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:31.590
And in this time interval, creep
effects would not take

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.010
place because T star
is so small.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.360
If they do take place, their
effect is negligible.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.590
That's the assumption.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.330
So plasticity effects
predominate here, and those we

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.140
take into account.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.450
And then from here onwards,
there will be no more plastic

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.510
deformations in the material.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:59.760
Now the material will
creep with time.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.570
And so all the inelastic strains
are modeled from here

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.780
onwards as creep strains,
and from here to

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.440
there as plastic strains.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.780
Now let's see how we would
model these strains.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:21.420
Here we see how we would model
the plastic strains in this

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.850
uniaxial situation.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.520
Notice we assume a bilinear
material description, bilinear

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.730
meaning a Young's modulus until
the yield stress is

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:39.420
reached, and then another
constant value of a new

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.330
Young's modulus,
if you want to.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.060
It's not really Young's
modulus.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.510
We call it ET.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.470
It's a strain-hardening model.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:53.450
Notice that ET is generally
considerably smaller than E.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.190
Typically it might be 1% of E.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.480
So we're coming up here.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.030
After the yield stress, we
have a constant Young's

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.630
modulus, and beyond the yield
stress, we have a

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:10.480
strain-hardening modulus, ET,
to describe the change in

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.180
stress as a function
of the strain.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.440
Notice now that if we had moved
up to here and we were

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:24.244
to unload from this level of
stress, we would follow the

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:30.340
original Young's modulus in the
unloading that we had in

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.630
the loading.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.850
In other words, here we had
the same E in unloading,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.660
indicated by the dashed line,
as we have for loading here.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.990
In our particular modeling
situation, we are coming up

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:52.710
here to the yield stress, then
we proceed, going along ET, up

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.650
to that point, and that point
corresponds to our time t

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.150
star, where P star
has been reached.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.310
The maximum load has
been reached.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:08.830
Notice that this part here is a
plastic strain corresponding

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:14.830
to t star, and this part here
is the elastic strain,

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.200
corresponding to t star.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.270
And that is obtained by simply
dropping a vertical line down

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:28.220
from that point t star onto
the horizontal axes.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:33.200
The stress is then given by the
Young's modulus E, that's

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:39.590
E, or the slope is E
here, times te at

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.620
any particular time.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.855
In other words, we could
have here, instead of

00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:45.445
the t, the t star.

00:18:45.445 --> 00:18:49.300
At any particular time this
holds, and the total inelastic

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.030
strain is given by simply the
plastic strain, because

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:57.290
remember in our model, we assume
that t star is so small

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.430
that all the inelastic strains
can be modeled using the

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:02.840
plasticity assumption.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.850
This assumption.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.810
Of course, once again, these
relationships hold for any

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:15.670
particular point on this curve
here, in particular, the point

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.610
time t star, where these
are the values

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.790
that we're using here.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:26.290
Now from time t star onwards,
we have creep effects, and

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.460
those would be typically
modeled as shown

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.710
on this view graph.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:34.800
Here is t star, which is very
small, almost equal to 0.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.370
And here we have the time axis,
the creep strain axis,

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.100
shown here, and here we have
a typical creep law that is

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.210
widely used in engineering
practice, the

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.290
power law, shown here.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.770
A0, A1, A2 are constant.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.980
That has to be determined from
the laboratory tests, and they

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.100
will change for different
materials.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.100
Notice that the stress is still
generated by the Young's

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.390
modulus times the elastic
strain, and the total

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.690
inelastic strain now is made
up of the creep strain

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.640
obtained by this formula plus
the plastic strain, the

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.260
plastic strain already
identified on the

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.510
earlier view graph.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.310
Another way of modeling the
instantaneous inelastic

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.590
strains, which we call plastic
strains, and the

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.850
time-dependent inelastic
strains, which we call it

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:36.590
creep strains, is to use a
viscoplastic material model.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.560
And in this case, we have this
basic relationship here where

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.710
we say that the total strain
times a time derivative of the

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:51.060
total strain, is given by the
time derivative of the stress

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.010
divided by the Young's modulus
plus a fluidity parameter

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.060
times this bracket here.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:04.900
And this bracket here needs to
be read as shown down here.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.660
Notice it is equal to 0.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.320
If sigma is smaller than sigma
yield, the yield stress, and

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.690
is equal to sigma minus sigma
yield, sigma is greater than

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.630
sigma yield.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.140
This part here is the time
derivative of the

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.760
viscoplastic strain.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.400
Of course, gamma depends
on the material--

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.540
on the particular material
that you're looking at.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:38.880
And also, sigma yield will
change possibly with time,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.810
because there might be strain
hardening in the material, the

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:46.570
same kind of strain hardening
that we have observed in our

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.920
plasticity description.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.410
Typical solutions for the 1-D
specimen would be, if you have

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.700
a non-hardening material, in
other words, the sigma yield,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.870
the value does not increase,
then we would have here in

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:10.800
elastic strain, and with gamma,
determined by gamma, a

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.410
viscoplastic strain that, of
course, varies with time.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.540
And you can see the total strain
here is made up of this

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.690
elastic strain plus a
viscoplastic strain, which

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.610
also depends on gamma.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:30.820
If we have a hardening material,
then the situation

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.770
for the total strain looks
as shown on this

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.240
side of the view graph.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.310
Total strain plotted, again,
vertically, time here.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.070
We have an elastic strain.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:48.660
And with time, a viscoplastic
strain that, however, will

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.180
reach a steady state value,
an ultimate value.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.570
This amount here depends on
the increase of the yield

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.630
stress as a function of the
viscoplastic strain.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.550
Notice that also, this curve,
this red curve, depends on the

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.130
value of gamma.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.970
As gamma increases, you are
getting a curve that goes more

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:17.020
sharply up to this green line,
this steady-state solution.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.520
Let us now look at plasticity
in more detail.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.110
In other words, how we are
more dealing plasticity

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.250
relationships.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.310
plastic materials, phenomena
of plasticity in finite

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.140
element analysis.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.880
So far, we've only considered
loading conditions.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.140
However, we of course, in an
actual analysis, might have

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:50.200
that the material is loading,
unloading, again

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.750
reloading and so on.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:56.290
So we have to look briefly at,
how do we take such situations

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.730
into account?

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.710
Well, on this view graph,
systematically, we see what

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.210
kind of load history
a material might

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.480
be subjected to.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.020
Here we have a load
increasing.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.960
Say, up to here, we have elastic
conditions, then we go

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.210
into plasticity.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:21.070
At this point, we unload
elastically, and right here,

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.300
we go back into plasticity.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.190
From here to there, plasticity,
and then elastic

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.250
behavior again.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:35.450
So how would we model such
a load situation on

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.990
the material level?

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.770
That is what we like
to discuss now.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.990
Here we show a material
assumption, or a material

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.670
relationship, that would
be typically used.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.070
Stress plotted up, strain
plotted horizontally.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:25:00.150
Here we load the material, going
to plasticity in the

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.910
loading cycle, in the loading
regime, and now we unload

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.160
elastically.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.712
Up to this point,
we are elastic.

00:25:10.712 --> 00:25:14.980
We now are plastic, and we
unload again elastically, from

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.550
the compression region.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.110
Now notice in this particular
material description, we

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.340
assume isotropic hardening.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.870
And this assumption means that
once we have loaded up to this

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:36.230
point, the new yield stress is
given by this value here.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.760
And before we would yield
again, in compression,

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:46.860
typically, or if we unload here
and come back, of course,

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.870
intention, we would have to have
a gain as stress that is

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.070
equal to this yield stress.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:00.290
So notice in compression, we
have this value being here,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.310
the same as that one.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:06.320
And that means we have to go all
the way down here until we

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.720
will get back into plasticity,
and at this point, we go into

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.150
plasticity, as shown here.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.930
The total plastic strains
is a sum of this

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.070
part plus that part.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.420
All of these are plastic
strains that have been

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.090
accumulated in the
loading cycle.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:30.550
Notice, once we have loaded in
compression further, we have a

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:34.800
new yield stress, sigma yield
2, which is larger

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.200
than sigma yield 1.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.720
So whenever we go into the
plasticity regime and load

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.250
further, our yield stress
increases, and that means we

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.280
assume isotropic hardening.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.530
I should also point out at this
point that we make an

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.660
assumption of the bilinear
material behavior, namely,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.100
bilinear in having one Young's
modulus here and one

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.150
strain-hardening modulus here.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.490
If you have a complex
stress-strain relationship

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:10.610
measured in laboratory, you may
want to use one et up to a

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:16.320
certain stress level, and then
another et from that stress

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.120
level on to the next stress
level, and maybe another et

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.110
beyond that.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.520
So you have a multilinear
description of

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.180
the material behavior.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.630
We don't have time to go
into such details.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.460
It's an extension of this
material description.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:39.700
Instead of using isotropic
hardening assumption, we may

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.580
want to use a kinematic
hardening assumption.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.880
And that assumption is depicted
on this view graph.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.650
Notice stress, again, upwards,
strain, horizontally, total

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:54.300
strain horizontally noted, and
here we're coming up in our

00:27:54.300 --> 00:28:00.740
loading cycle to this point, and
the unload now, same way

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.130
as before in isotropic
hardening--

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:07.000
the difference is right now
occurring in this regime,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.070
namely our yield stress that
will make us yield in

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:18.720
compression is not the same
yield stress that we talked

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.630
about in isotropic hardening.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:25.480
Instead, this difference in
stress is simply twice the

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.820
initial yield stress.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:32.100
So we reach yield in compression
much earlier than

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.430
in isotopically hardening.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:40.730
Namely, when the stress has
decreased by twice this amount

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:45.070
here, we come into the regime
of yielding again.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.770
And now we would be yielding all
the way along here, up to

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.420
this point, and now we unload
elastically again.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.900
Notice, this is now the
plastic strain that we

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.920
accumulate in the compression
region.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.990
This is the plastic strain
that we accumulate in the

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.960
tensile region.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.880
These were a few words regarding
how we model

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:14.260
one-dimensional elastoplastic
behavior, and let us now look

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:19.030
at the multi-axial plasticity
behavior.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.610
How we model, in other words,
plastic behavior in

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.040
multi-axial stress conditions.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.550
In that case, we need a yield
condition, a flow rule, and a

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:33.240
hardening rule, and I'd like to
consider now isothermal, in

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.810
other words, constant
temperature conditions.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.400
The yield condition flow rule
and hardening rule are

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.590
expressed using a
stress function.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:50.680
And very widely used stress
functions are the Von Metus

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.830
function and the Drucker-Prager
function.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:58.930
The Von Mises function is given
on this view graph here.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:05.160
tF is equal to 1/2 tsij
tsij minus t kappa.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.340
Of course, we're summing here
over all stress components sij

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.510
where the stress component sij
is called the deviatoric

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.190
stress, and is given as
t sigma ij minus t

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.110
sigma mm over 3.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.330
This is summing all the normal
stress components, in other

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.690
words, t sigma 11 plus t sigma
2 2 plus t sigma 3 3, and

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.160
dividing by 3.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.830
This is the Kronecker
delta that we

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.890
encountered already earlier.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:39.270
The t kappa value is
given here as 1/3

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.330
t sigma yield squared.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:45.880
Notice the yield stress here
changes as a function of

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.150
loading, as a function
of time.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:51.730
And in fact, we are here using
isotropic hardening

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.360
conditions.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.230
In the Drucker-Prager stress
function, assumption we have

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.760
this equation here.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.210
tF is equal to 3 alpha t sigma
m plus t sigma bar minus k.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.450
Notice t sigma m is
defined as here.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:13.620
Notice the sum here over all
the stress is ii, in other

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.740
words, t sigma 1 1 plus t sigma
2 2 plus t sigma 3 3.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.750
That is t sigma i i.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.860
And here we have t sigma bar
defined, again in terms of the

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.360
deviatoric stresses.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.320
We will talk in this lecture
more about the Von Mises yield

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.790
condition, which is very
widely used for

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.590
modeling metal behavior.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.340
The Drucker-Prager yield
condition is widely used to

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:47.090
model rock and solid mechanics
types of problems.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.020
We'll not talk in this
lecture about this

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.460
condition any further.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.640
Please refer to the textbook,
where there is a bit more

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.470
information given about the

00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:00.000
Drucker-Prager stress function.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.360
We will also use, in our
discussion, both matrix

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.220
notation and index notation.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.290
In matrix notation, for example,
the vector DEP of

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.570
plastic strains is defined
as shown here.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:18.050
Notice we are summing these two
components here for the

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.630
shear strains.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:28.500
The stress vector is shown
here, and if we use index

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:33.710
notation, we imply
these components.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:39.750
dep 1 2 and dep 2 1.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.080
Notice, once again, in these
vector or matrix notations,

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.920
these two components are added
to get the total plastic shear

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.190
strain, 1, 2.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:56.120
The basic equations are, then,
for the Von Mises yield

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.130
condition, as shown here.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.980
This is a yield condition.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.300
tF, t sigma ij, t kappa.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.800
t kappa is a function of
the plastic strains.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.670
These are the current
stresses.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.580
And [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.290
yielding tF is equal to 0.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.450
That's what we're saying here.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.590
The equivalent for the
one-dimensional response, in

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.460
other words, would
be this equation.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:29.490
Notice once again that tS is
equal to 0 throughout the

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:33.290
total plastic response,
throughout all of the yielding

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.800
that we observe.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.760
The flow rule, and here we use
the associative flow rule,

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.700
because tF is here the same
tF that we also use

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.160
in the yield condition.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.630
The flow rule is given
by this equation.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.050
Notice we have on the left-hand
side the plastic

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.910
strain increments.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.600
Here we have a scalar,
t lambda.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.490
And the partial of
tF with respect

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.990
to the current stresses.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:05.300
t lambda is a positive scalar.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.909
In one-dimension analysis, we
would have that the plastic

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:14.280
strains 1 1, 2 2, and 3
3 are as shown here.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.600
And notice, of course, they
only depend on the

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.469
one-dimensional stress,
or the one stress

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:20.630
that is only active.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:26.600
And notice that the sum of these
plastic strains is 0.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.060
This stress-strain relationship
is given here on

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.280
this view graph--

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:36.120
stress increment on the
left-hand side, elastic

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.330
stress-strain, material
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.920
go into the CE.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.850
Here's the total strain
increment minus the plastic

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.360
strain increment.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.260
The 1-D equivalent, in other
words, for the one-dimensional

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:53.310
stress situation, we would
have this equation here.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:35:01.430
Now our goal is to determine a
CEP matrix such that we have

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.640
on the left-hand side the stress
increment, and on the

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.760
right-hand side, that
CEP matrix times the

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.460
total strain increment.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.880
Of course, the kind of stress
conditions, yielding, et

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.510
cetera, conditions must
all go into the

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:21.570
determination off CEP.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:26.780
Let us now look at the general
derivation of this CEP matrix.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.720
This is quite a general
derivation.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.340
It's also given in
the textbook.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.790
You may want to refer to the
textbook as well while we

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.970
discuss this deviation
or afterwards.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:44.350
We define these quantities here,
tqij being the partial

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:47.650
of F with respect to the current
stresses with the

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:51.030
plastic strains fixed.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:56.090
We also define tpij equal to
minus partial F with respect

00:35:56.090 --> 00:36:00.380
to the plastic strains with
the stress fixed.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.670
These are two convenient
definitions for the

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.910
derivation.

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:08.960
If we use matrix notation,
we assemble in

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.630
this vector at tq--

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.960
we are writing actually, the
transposed here, just for ease

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.450
of writing--

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.930
these components are assembled
in this vector.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:25.660
Notice we have 2 times tq12,
2 times tq 2 0 3, and

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.810
2 times tq 3 1.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:32.070
And these tools here result
from our definition of the

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.480
plastic strain and stress
increment vectors.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:41.180
Remember in the plastic strain
vector, we had the sum of Dep

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:48.380
1 2 plus Dep 2 1 components, we
got the total plastic share

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:54.460
strain assembled in that
plastic strain vector.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.620
And because we have defined our
plastic strain vector and

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:02.370
our stress increment vectors as
shown earlier on the view

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:06.340
graph, we now carry these
two along here.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.780
tp, transposed again,
is written out here.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.640
We know determine t lambda
in terms of de.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.350
That is our first step.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:24.090
Because if we have this
relationship, then we can say,

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.210
we have the plastic strain
increment in terms of a total

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.610
strain increment.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:34.400
Using tf equal to 0, throughout
the plastic

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.310
deformations, because we know
that our yield condition has

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:41.090
to be satisfied throughout all
of the plastic deformations,

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.540
we can directly write down
this equation here.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.520
And with our definition just
given, we rewrite this

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.160
right-hand side as shown here.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:56.080
And we also substitute for
dep, t lambda times tq.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:04.370
Notice, once again, we have now
in the fourth fifth, and

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:09.390
sixth component of tq this
factor two, because of the

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.930
definition of dep
shown earlier.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:18.180
Well, there's nothing else than
a matrix rewriting of

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.070
this relationship here, of this
right-hand side here.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:28.950
And we now use this relationship
in our further

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:30.710
developments.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:34.050
But before doing so, let us see
how we can rewrite this

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.080
left-hand side here.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.550
tq times [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
t sigma.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.370
We can write this left-hand
side also as shown on the

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:45.240
right-hand side here, because we
can substitute for t sigma

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.830
simply the stress-strain law.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.060
The flow rule, of course, gives
us this relationship

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.350
here for the plastic
strain increment.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:39:01.630
Hence, if we use what we have up
here and substitute for the

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.600
plastic strain increments, we
directly obtain what I'm

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.850
circling here.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:14.560
Next we use what we derived on
the previous view graph,

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.340
namely, tq times post t sigma is
equal to what's shown here

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.860
on the right-hand side,
what I'm circling now.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.870
And this together then gives
us an equation that we can

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.810
solve for t lambda.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.980
Having solved for t lambda, and
I will show you the result

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.550
on the next few graph charts
now, we can substitute 40

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:39.300
lambda back here, and we get our
plastic strains directly.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.250
Well, let's look
at the result.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:46.620
Here we have t lambda, notice,
given in terms of the

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.670
differential total
strain increment.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:54.650
And now substituting, as I said
just now, 40 lambda, we

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.410
get the plastic strains
in terms of the

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.660
total strain increment.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.150
This relationship is
now used in the

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.570
stress-strain law again.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.490
Notice the stress-strain
law is shown here.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:19.820
And we directly obtain, by
expressing dep in terms of de

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.640
by the relation that we just
have obtained on the previous

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.625
view graph, we directly obtain
this final expression for CEP.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.940
Of course the current stresses
go in there, and the current

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.690
material conditions
go in there.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:45.260
And we will apply this general
expression to an example just

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.290
now, namely the example
of the Von Mises flow

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.600
rule and yield condition.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.330
However, before doing so, we
know need to break, because we

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.201
have to continue our discussion
on a second reel.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.460
So let us now apply this general
relationship here

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.670
which we just derived to the
case of the Von Mises yield

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:14.070
condition with isotropic
hardening.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:18.600
In that case, yielding is
reached when the principal

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.460
stress is here on the right-hand
side, substituted

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.375
into this right-hand side, give
us the yield stress, t

00:41:26.375 --> 00:41:27.110
sigma yield.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:32.240
Or another way of saying it, our
tf function is given right

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:36.290
down here, where we have here
the deviatoric stresses

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.160
squared, t kappa
is shown here.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.470
We had in fact this relationship
already on an

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:44.570
earlier view graph.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:49.260
Notice that this relationship
on TF is really the same as

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.530
what you see up here.

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.390
But of course, here we are
talking about the use of

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.660
principal stresses, whereas here
we are talking about the

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.910
use of deviatoric stresses.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:06.520
Pictorally, we can represent
the yield

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.850
surface as shown here.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.760
In plain stress analysis, this
would be the yield surface.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:18.200
In other words, t sigma 2 and t
sigma 1 are the principle of

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:24.120
stresses that are generally
non-zero, but t sigma 3 is 0.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:29.070
Here we have the yield stress,
and on the right-hand side, we

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.450
see the [? general ?]

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:32.520
yield condition in

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.660
three-dimensional stress space.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:39.200
Notice initially we have sigma
yield, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:46.240
radius of this cylinder, and
that radius expands with time,

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.280
and it expands uniformly, as
shown, with the green circle

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:54.520
here to t sigma yield.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.440
In other words, the cylinder
grows uniformly, the radius

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.370
grows with isotopically
hardening.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:05.810
Notice that for the plane stress
case, the hardening

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:11.050
would be stress by having this
ellipse grow, as briefly

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:15.370
indicated, by this green line,
which of course goes all the

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.620
way around it.

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.350
Let us now compute
the derivative

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:23.050
that we need to have.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.540
First we consider tpij.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.100
tpij was defined as
shown right here.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:33.190
And simply substituting for tf
in terms of the deviatoric

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:36.180
stress components and the
current yield stress, and

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:40.590
differentiating, we obtain
this part here.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:43.530
Notice t sigma ij is fixed.

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:48.710
Therefore, these are constant
here, and of course drop out.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.120
We get this result, and all we
have to evaluate the partial

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.790
of the yield stress with respect
to the plastic strain.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:03.600
That is achieved by the concept
of the plastic work.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.980
The plastic work per unit volume
is the amount of energy

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:12.790
that is unrecoverable when
the material is unloaded.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:17.320
This energy, in other words, has
been used up to create a

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.030
plastic deformation.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:23.080
What we will do is use
this concept for the

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.110
one-dimensional case, and then
generalize it to the

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.150
multidimensional situation.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:34.480
Pictorally, in the 1D example,
in other words, only one

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.650
stress component being non-zero,
one normal stress

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:42.972
component to be non-zero, we
have this stress-strain law.

00:44:42.972 --> 00:44:46.630
You're looking at the
bilinear case, which

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.080
we discussed earlier.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.340
And the plastic work is
simply obtained by

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.960
this integral here.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.980
Stress times plastic strain.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.300
Integrate it over
the whole path.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.680
So this shaded area is equal
to the plastic work.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.090
In general, of course, we have
the current stress times the

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.920
plastic strain and in
component forms.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.630
And we are summing over
all the components.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.750
If we look at the
one-dimensional case, we can

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:22.830
directly express twp as shown
here, in terms of the Young's

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:25.880
modulus and the strain-hardening
modulus, and

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:32.410
the yield stress at time t, this
one right there, and the

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:36.550
initial yield stress, that
one right there.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.430
This expression here gives
the shaded area.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:43.290
We can now differentiate and
obtain the yield stress

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.170
differentiated with respect
to the plastic work, this

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:49.460
expression down here.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:53.990
Using this expression in all our
general multidimensional

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:59.420
dimensional case, we directly
obtain tpij.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.500
In terms of what's shown here on
the right-hand side, notice

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:07.640
we take sigma yield stress at
time t with respect to the

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.910
plastic work corresponding to
time t, and then partial

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:14.740
plastic work with respect
to the plastic strains.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:20.740
Substituting here, we get this
bracket for the sigma yield

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:24.970
with respect to the plastic
work, and plastic work with

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:27.320
respect to the plastic
strains is equal

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.800
to the current stress.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.040
And immediately we arrive
at this final

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.395
relationship here for tpij.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.290
Alternatively, we could have
also used the effective stress

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:44.290
in effective plastic strain.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.390
The effective stress is defined
as shown here, using

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:51.140
the deviatoric stresses, and the
effect of plastic strain

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.860
is defined here.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.940
Notice this is a differential
increment in the effect of

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.200
plastic strain.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.650
And if we use these two
quantities, we can also obtain

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:07.740
tpij via this relationship, and
the result is of course

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.040
the same that I just
showed you on the

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.050
previous view graph.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:16.150
Let's now consider tqij, because
that is the other

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.660
quantity we need.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.560
And here we recognize we have to
take the partial of f with

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.520
respect to the current stresses
with the plastic

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.200
strains fixed.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:31.510
We substitute for f, and we
differentiate, recognizing now

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.740
with the plastic strains
fixed, the

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.530
yield stress is a constant.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.640
Therefore, all we need to do is
differentiate the product

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.860
of the deviatoric stresses,
and that is achieved here.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:48.160
The substitute for the
deviatoric stress is shown on

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:55.600
the right-hand side here, and
recognize that the t sigma kl

00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.160
differentiates with respect to
t sigma ij is nothing else

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.510
than the product of these
two Kronecker deltas.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.970
Delta ik, of course being equal
to 1 when i is equal to

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:13.820
k and equal to 0 when
i is not equal to k.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.800
And we also recognize that this
relationship here reduces

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:23.320
directly to that relationship,
and the whole right-hand side

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.700
then becomes simply the
deviatoric stress at time t.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:35.300
With these relationships for
tqij and tpij substituting

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:41.480
into our general derivation of
CEP, we directly obtain this

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.270
CEP matrix for the
three-dimensional case of the

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:49.060
Von Mises flow condition which
isotropic strain-hardening.

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.610
Let's look at some
of these terms.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.950
In front, we have the Young's
modulus and the Poisson's

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.570
ratio down here.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.880
Young's modulus here, Poisson's
ratio here.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.390
Notice here, again, Poisson's
ratio, the same way as we have

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:07.450
it in elastic analysis, here
we have now the deviatoric

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.750
stress component entering.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:13.890
Similarly here, the deviatoric
stress component entering.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.580
And so on.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.250
There's also a factor beta that
goes in there, and beta

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:24.830
is defined down here in terms
of the yield stress, Young's

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:28.040
modulus and strain-hardening
modulus, and Poisson's ratio.

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:34.840
So this is a general expression,
and let's now see

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.270
how good we use that
general expression.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:42.520
Well, it would enter in the
evaluation of the stresses

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.410
from time t to time
t plus delta t.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.440
We have a stress increment which
is added to the current

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.690
stress at time t to obtain the
stress at time t plus delta t.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:58.780
This relationship here is
expressed as shown here with

00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.910
the CEP matrix.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:04.070
In other words, d sigma is
given as CEP times de.

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:08.430
Now, this integration has
to be performed at every

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:12.700
integration point used in
the finite element.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.390
Here we're showing 3 by 3
integration used in an 8-node,

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:18.310
two-dimensional element.

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.330
And notice once again that this
integration has to be

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:23.620
performed at every one of these
integration points,

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.840
which of course can be
quite expensive.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.480
So we need to perform the
integration as effective as

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.100
just possible.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:37.600
One simple scheme to use is
Euler forward integration.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.810
And without subimplementation--

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:43.150
I will explain subimplementation
just now--

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:48.570
without subincrementation, we
evaluate the integral on the

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:53.480
left-hand side here by simply
saying, let us evaluate CP

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.620
corresponding to time t.

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:59.050
Since we know the stress at time
t, we know the deviatoric

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:03.830
stress at time t, we can
directly evaluate CEP,

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:07.390
entering into that matrix
equation that I gave you on

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:09.380
one of the previous
view graphs.

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.530
You can get CEP at time t, since
we know the stress at

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.440
time t, and simply multiply
it by the total

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.920
increment in strain.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.700
Now, this would be OK if the
strain increment is very

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:28.350
small, and consequently also,
say it leads to a very small

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:29.580
stress increment.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:36.130
But in general, this
linearization involved in

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:40.135
using the Euler forward method
can introduce a too-large

00:51:40.135 --> 00:51:44.250
error that we don't want to
see in the analysis, and

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.740
therefore, we use what we call
the subincrementation.

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:53.550
Within subincrements, the
subincrementation proceeds as

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:57.160
shown this view graph for the
evaluation of this integral.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:04.590
Notice CEP, times t, times delta
e the over n, where n is

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.310
the number of subincrements,
once again.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:12.910
This means that we now can
evaluate the stress at the end

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:15.180
of the first subincrement.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.870
We use that stress, which
corresponds to

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:21.240
t plus delta tau--

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.710
tau is delta t over n--

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:27.080
to evaluate this CEP matrix and
multiply the result again

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.390
by delta e/n.

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:35.200
Now this then, together, gives
us this stress at the end of

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.730
the second subincrement.

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:42.780
And like that, we proceed to
forward march the stress over

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:49.730
each of the subincrements up
to time t plus delta t.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:53.850
This is nothing else really
but the application of the

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:58.370
previous formula, the one on the
previous view graph, over

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:01.260
each subincrement, always
updating, of course, the

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:06.360
stress that goes into the
evaluation of the CEP matrix.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.790
Pictorally, we have the
following situation.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:16.800
Along here, we are plotting time
t we have here, time t

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.340
here, time t plus delta
t there at the end.

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:26.165
Here we have the subincrements
1, 2, 3, et cetera.

00:53:26.165 --> 00:53:28.000
You know that by the dot.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.820
And notice at the end of the
first subincrement, we have

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.840
time t plus delta tau.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.610
At the end of the second
subincrement, we have time t

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:39.200
plus 2 delta tau, and so on.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.800
The subimplementation
schematically proceeds by

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.790
calculating this stress
increment so that we have t

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:54.190
plus delta tau sigma, then
evaluating a new stress-strain

00:53:54.190 --> 00:54:01.000
law, based on this stress,
multiplying by the

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.430
subincrement in strain,
total strain, to

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:06.750
get a stress increment.

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:13.630
Thus you get this stress, and
like that, you proceed,

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:17.260
forward marching, again and
again, until you have the

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:21.020
final stress at time
t plus delta t.

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.150
Let us now look at the summary
of the procedure the way that

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:27.350
you would use it in a computer
program, and that summary is

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.950
given on the following
view graph.

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:32.755
We assume that the strain
corresponding to time t plus

00:54:32.755 --> 00:54:34.190
delta t is known.

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:35.930
We have calculated that.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:39.180
The stress corresponding to time
t is also known, and of

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.060
course the strain corresponding
to time t is

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.680
also known.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.720
We then, as a first,

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.040
meta-calculate a strain increment.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.830
DELEPS is equal to STRAIN
minus EPSILON.

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.287
This is a strain increment
from time t to time

00:54:52.287 --> 00:54:54.790
t plus delta t.

00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:57.740
We use that strain increment
to calculate a stress

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.980
increment, assuming
elastic behavior.

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:08.710
CE denotes a matrix of elastic
material behavior.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:13.200
In other words, in this matrix
go the Young's modulus and

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.600
Poisson's ratio, and of course
this one varies depending on

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.320
what kind of conditions,
plane-stress, plane-strain,

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.810
axis-symmetric, or
three-dimensional analysis

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:23.570
you're looking at.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:27.390
But I think you know what
I mean by that.

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:33.060
Having delsigma, we calculate
tau by updating sigma for that

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.930
stress increment.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:40.170
With this stress now, we check
whether the strain was

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.280
actually taken elastically.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.070
In other words, whether our
assumption that we have made

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:46.690
up here was correct.

00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:49.440
And that is done by entering
into the yield

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.710
condition with that tau.

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:55.640
If f of tau is smaller or equals
0, then the strain

00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.500
increment is elastic, and in
this case, tau was correct,

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:05.810
and we return If that was not
the case, then we have to

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:10.300
continue in our solution
procedure,

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.040
and we do so as follows.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:17.080
If the previous state of stress
was plastic, we set

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:22.060
this ratio to 0 and go to g,
because the whole strain,

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:26.070
then, was taken up plastically,

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.570
also in this step.

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:34.890
Otherwise, if this condition is
not true, we have to find

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:39.510
that stress value at which
yielding started.

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:45.030
And we do also by entering into
the yield function with

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:48.550
sigma plus ratio times
delsigma, where

00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:50.610
ratio is now unknown.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:54.430
Delsigma is known, sigma is
known, so we can calculate

00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:57.570
from this equation here
the value of ratios.

00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:04.080
And ratio gives us that stress
increment, which brings us to

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.770
initiation of yielding.

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:14.160
Having ratio, we update the
stress from sigma too tau, a

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:19.710
new value of tau, where ratio
goes in here, and we calculate

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:24.250
the elastic-plastic strain
increment, using also ratio.

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:28.100
And that is a total
elastic-plastic strain

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.350
increment here.

00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:37.590
This value depth now is used
integrate out the stress

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:41.160
occurring during the plastic
deformations.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:45.340
And that is done by the
subincrementation process that

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.640
we discussed earlier.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:52.100
We divide depth into
subincrements DDEPS, and we

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:57.640
calculate this tau value
by cycling through this

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.670
subincrementation here, which
we described on an earlier

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:02.620
view graph.

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:06.300
And this then completes the
calculation of the stress

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:11.760
value corresponding
to time t plus t.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:16.680
So this is a very compact
summary of how the stress

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.500
integration from time
t to time t

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.080
plus delta t is performed.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.360
Of course, there are many
important details here that we

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.900
haven't really looked at in
depth, but I think it gives

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.630
you a summary that is quite
valuable, because it tells,

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:35.660
overall, how the integration
is being performed.

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:42.340
Let us now look at two
example solutions.

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.630
First, an example solution for
which we have prepared some

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:49.380
slides, and after that, an
example solution for which we

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.180
have prepared an animation.

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:56.520
Let me walk over here to share
with you the information on

00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.680
the slides.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.190
And here we consider the
following problem.

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:06.780
You have a rigid punch here
subjected to a load, lying on

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.030
an infinite half-space.

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:16.650
As the load increases,
plasticity develops down here,

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:20.310
and there is an ultimate
load, a limit load,

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:22.410
that we want to calculate.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:26.730
In other words, there's a load
here at which there will be

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:30.330
very large deformations down
here, and the material can

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:32.520
take no higher load.

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.320
This plane strain punch problem
was considered by many

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.330
investigators, but Hill actually
predicted the plastic

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:45.200
zones, and also the ultimate
limit load.

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.830
And we want to compare our
finite element solution with

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.040
the solution given by Hill.

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:56.240
On the next slide now, we see
the finite element mesh used.

00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:03.090
Notice we are only idealizing
1/2 of the domain, as shown by

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:05.220
this boundary here.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:10.420
Notice also that we have moved
this boundary here and that

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:15.610
boundary here far enough away
from the load application.

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:18.650
Notice that we have
a fine mesh here,

01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:21.230
a coarse mesh there.

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:24.450
In the fine mesh, we use 8-node
elements, in the coarse

01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:26.450
mesh, we use 4-node elements.

01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:32.150
And there is a transition region
here, there, from the

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:39.390
8-node over to 7-node, into
6-node, and then finally into

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:41.980
4-node elements.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.680
It's an interesting
small point here.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.670
There is an incompatibility here
between this element and

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.370
these two elements.

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:55.030
An incompatibility because this
element here, being a

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:58.140
6-node element, has a parabolic
displacement

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:02.810
distribution along this line,
whereas this element here,

01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:08.190
being a 7-node element and a
linear assumption along this

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:11.690
line here for displacement,
only admits a linear

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.070
displacement distribution.

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:16.390
So there is small
incompatibility here, and

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:17.510
similarly here.

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:22.580
However, that incompatibility
we deem to be small, that it

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:26.280
would not affect the results
very considerably.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.540
Now, in an elastoplastic
plastic, analysis like in any

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.500
non-linear analysis that you
would like to perform, I

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.820
pointed out in an earlier
lecture, it is always

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:40.150
important to start with the
linear solutions, just to see

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:45.970
how well your mesh performs and
whether you have any data

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:47.470
input errors, possibly, even.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:51.710
It is good to perform first a
linear solution where you can

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:56.240
compare with analytical
or other results.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.840
This is what we have done here,
and let me show you on

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.850
the next slide what we
have considered.

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:07.710
We have applied a point load
here to the half space, used

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:12.880
the same finite element mesh
that I just showed you, and

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.350
looked at the stresses.

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:21.910
At this depth A, below the
surface, it's 0.697 inches.

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:25.290
At that depth, we're looking
at the stresses along this

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:30.780
line here on a horizontal
line.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:36.030
These stresses here are plotted
on this graph for

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:37.930
different components.

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:43.120
Sigma zz, Sigma yy, tau yz.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.020
And they are compared with the
theoretical solution, the

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.100
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.200
theoretical solution.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.610
Notice excellent comparison,
obtained really for the stress

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:58.510
components, and this means
that our mesh is quite

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:02.700
reasonable, and we can
proceed with the

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.600
elastoplastic analysis.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.790
Notice please that we have
used here two-point

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:09.870
integration, 2-by-2 integration,
for all the

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.940
elements, including the
8-node element.

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.600
We then performed the same
analysis, also one, using

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.820
three-point integration, and
these results are shown on

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.370
this slide.

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:25.160
Same picture here.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.530
Here stress is as a function
of the distance from the

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:31.460
center line in inches.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.910
Notice with three-point
integration, also excellent

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:38.370
comparison for the stress
components.

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:42.800
On the next slide now, you'll
see the elastoplastic results.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.420
And here we see the applied
load, normalized by a factor

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:51.380
plotted versus the displacement
of the punch,

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.620
also normalized by factor.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.530
And we see two curves here,
one corresponding to

01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:59.910
three-point integration and one
corresponding to two-point

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:01.500
integration.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.530
Now notice that the three-point
integration

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:07.940
results are higher
than those of the

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.760
two-point integration results.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.090
And that's a very interesting
phenomenon.

01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:17.350
It is due to the fact that the
three-point integration puts a

01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:20.980
higher incompressibility
constraint into the mesh.

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.220
In fact, a too-high
incompressibility constraint..

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.910
This is a very interesting
phenomenon, but it is best

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:29.190
discussed in another lecture.

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:34.640
Notice that however our solution
results all give us a

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.760
horizontal line here for the
two-point integration and

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.730
three-point integration, and
certainly, the two-point

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:43.700
integration results
are quite close to

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.190
the theoretical value.

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:48.630
If we were to use the finer mesh
and still use three-point

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:51.070
integration, we would
get also closer to

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:53.730
the theoretical value.

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:56.950
Of course, we have here, I
should have pointed out, an

01:04:56.950 --> 01:05:01.140
elastic, perfectly plastic
material assumption for the

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.320
material under the footing.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.430
Please refer to the details of
this example solution given in

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:12.370
the paper in which we have
reported this sample solution.

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.980
And the reference to
that paper is given

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:17.250
in the study guide.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:22.780
The second problem that I'd
like to discuss with you

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.590
concerns the analysis of a plate
with a hole that we are

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:31.760
subjecting to very large
tensile forces.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.380
And there is one interesting
feature that we observe in

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:40.340
that analysis which we have not
seen here on the slides,

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.820
namely, the spread of plasticity
through the domain.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:50.010
So let me introduce you to this
problem using just two

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:55.070
view graphs, and then show you
the animation which gives the

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:56.270
results to the problem.

01:05:56.270 --> 01:06:01.210
Here we have the plate
with a hole.

01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:04.900
It's subjected to tensile
forces, so you can see.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.440
And we want to calculate,
really, the ultimate limit

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.470
load of the plate, and we want
to see now the spread of

01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:12.780
plasticity.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:17.600
Of course, that spread of
plasticity also occurs in the

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.500
analysis of the rigid punch on
an elastoplastic footing, but

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.810
I did not show you that spread
of placiticity there.

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:27.260
I'd like to show you
the spread the

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.090
plasticity now here.

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:32.160
And you will see that the
plasticity actually spread

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.310
through the elements,
integration point by

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:38.370
integration point.

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:42.530
And of course initially, as a
load increase is not so rapid,

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:45.830
but then all of a sudden you see
a very rapid spread of the

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:50.700
plasticity, right through this
domain here, that domain

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.280
there, and so on, by symmetry
conditions.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.330
Now, because of symmetry
conditions, we also will look

01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:58.690
at only one quarter
of the plate--

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.310
this quarter right here.

01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:09.270
The material assumption that
is used in the analysis is

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:10.850
shown on this view graph.

01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:14.180
Stress here, strain there.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:17.900
Notice Young's modulus, as
shown here, Poisson ratio

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.520
there, and the strain-hardening
modulus is

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.450
shown here.

01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:23.070
We assume isotropic hardening.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.660
The same problem would also be
considered further in a later

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:34.300
lecture, when we actually use
the ADINA program to show an

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:35.460
application.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.580
So you will encounter this
problem there again.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.860
Notice that in this particular
analysis that you will be

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.140
seeing now, in the animation,
we assumed a materially

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.310
non-linear only condition.

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:51.500
In other words, we assumed
infinitesimally small

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.840
displacement and strains.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.440
However, in the very last load
steps, just before the plate

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:04.030
ruptures, we encounter,
actually, larger strains, but

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:06.950
only those last load steps.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:12.080
And in order to capture this
very last behavior of the

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:16.229
plate very accurately, one would
have to perform a large

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:21.250
strain analysis of the plate,
which we did not do here, and

01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:24.340
which really would
be the object off

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.410
another lecture, as well.

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:30.270
So let's look now at the
response of the plate.

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:35.180
Yes, it is subjected to the
tensile forces and how the

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:39.779
plasticity spread through the
plate until final rupture.

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:41.630
Let's look at the animation.

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:45.720
We will look first at a fast
animation, where the response

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.899
occurs very fast, and then
we'll look at the same

01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:52.870
animation again but slower, so
that I can better talk about

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:55.600
it while you're watching it, and
you can better understand

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.660
what I'm saying.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.420
Here we see one quarter of the
plate discretized using 288

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.670
eight-node isoparametric
plane stress elements.

01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:07.890
The time course gives
the load step.

01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:10.920
We perform the static analysis
and the load corresponding to

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.660
each solution step
is also shown.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:16.479
Here you see now the load
increasing, and in the first

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:18.254
load step, the plate
remains elastic.

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:28.069
Plasticity then developed as
a whole and spreads rapidly

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:29.799
through the plate as
the load increases.

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:40.010
The deformations of the
plate are given here

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.729
to a magnified scale.

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:45.910
This was a rather fast look at
the plate behavior, so let's

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:49.750
look at it again and over a
somewhat longer time scale.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:52.120
Here we have again the
plate at time 0--

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.300
that is at zero-load
application.

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.790
Now the load application starts,
and initially, the

01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:59.040
plate remains elastic.

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:25.760
Be sure that an element
integration point has gone

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.200
plastic by darkening the
regions around it.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.560
Since we use 3-by-3 Gauss
integration, considering an

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.780
element on an average 1/9 of
the element [? area ?]

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.070
corresponds to an integration
point.

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.130
Here you can see how the
plasticity spreads from

01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:54.670
element to element, and indeed,
from integration point

01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:57.610
to integration point.

01:10:57.610 --> 01:10:59.400
We will discuss the analysis
of the plate

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.510
again in lecture 22.

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:04.700
We will also perform analyses
and study the results,

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:08.510
including large displacement
and large strain effects.

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:11.890
Once again, the deformations of
the plate are shown here in

01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:14.410
the animation to a
magnified scale.

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.865
The actual displacements are
discussed in lecture 22.

01:11:20.690 --> 01:11:23.420
So this brings me then to
the end of this lecture.

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.580
I discussed everything I wanted
to discuss with you in

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:26.300
this lecture.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.920
Thank you very much for
your attention.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.730
PROFESSOR: All right, so today
we're going to continue our

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.250
discussion of consumer choice.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.759
If you remember the set-up
from last time, the main

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.450
motivation is you're trying to
understand what underlies

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.790
demand curves, how consumers
ultimately decide to trade off

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.860
price and quantity of goods.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.315
We said that ultimately that
came from the principle of

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:49.530
utility maximization, and that
utility is maximized when

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.770
individuals maximize the utility
function, which is

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.580
this mathematical representation
of preferences.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.730
And last time we talked about
how if individuals were

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240
unconstrained how they choose
what they want, they would

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.940
just like more of everything,
and their ranking across

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.590
different bundles would
depend on that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.520
underlying utility function.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.390
Now, of course, what's stopping
individuals from

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.300
consuming everything they want
is their budget constraints.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.690
And so today we're going to turn
to the second part of the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.930
problem, which is talking about
budget constraints.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.060
Now, we're going to make a very
simplifying assumption

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.000
here for most of the semester,
which is we are going to

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.920
assume that your income
equals your budget.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010
That is, you spend your
entire income.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.600
That is, we're going to ignore
the possibility of savings

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.370
until about the third lecture
from the end.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.430
Now, this turns out not to be a
terrible assumption for the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.230
typical American.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.600
The typical American doesn't
save. So actually, it's not a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.050
terrible assumption for us to
work with if we think about

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.680
typical consumers.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.610
In practice, savings is going
to turn out to be a very

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.650
critical part of what we're
going to do to think about

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.405
economics, so we'll
come back to that.

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.470
But we're going to ignore
savings for now and assume

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.680
that your budget equals
your income.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.910
So let's say that your parents,
probably a good model

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.020
is you guys, you guys probably
aren't in saving mode.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.780
You've got some budget saved
from your parents.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's call it y.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.979
And let's say that your parents
give you some budget

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.430
at the start of the semester,
y, and they say this is your

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.520
money you have to spend,
say each month or

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.770
for the whole semester.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.070
And let's imagine that you have
to allocate that budget

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.840
only across two goods,
pizza and movies.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.650
So once again, unrealistic,
but this is the kind of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.850
simplifying assumption that lets
us understand how people

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.260
make decisions.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.000
So that gives you your
budget constraint.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.590
You've got some income y that
your parents have given you,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.750
and you can allocate that
across pizza and movies.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.100
So how do you allocate that?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.770
Well, you can buy movies, the
number of movies you can get,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.130
plus the number of pizzas.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.790
Well, how many of each
you can get, that

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.100
depends on their price.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.130
In particular, budget constraint
is the number of

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.920
movies times the price
per movie plus the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.220
number of pizzas --

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.310
plus the number of pizzas times
the price for pizza.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.960
That's your budget constraint.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.880
It's the number of movies times
the price per movie or

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.630
the number of pizzas times
the price for pizza.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.900
And this is easiest to
see graphically.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.850
If you go to figure 5-1, this is
a graphical illustration of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.630
a budget constraint.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.450
Now, let's just carefully talk
through this for a moment.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.190
You're going to be really good
at dealing with budget

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.730
constraints.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.930
You're going to have to
be this semester.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.410
So let's carefully talk about
where this comes from.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.050
OK, the x-axis is going to be
how many movies you could have

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.850
if all you did with your income
was consume movies.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.020
Well, if all you did with your
income was consume movies, you

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.385
could have y over
p sub m movies.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.640
If you decided to devote your
income solely to movies, then

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.340
you could have y times y
over p sub m movies.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.080
If instead you decided to devote
all your income to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.360
pizza, then you could have
y over p sub p pizza.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.990
So the y-axis is going to be
the point where you consume

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.730
zero movies and all pizza.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.070
It's going to be where
you devote your

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.940
entire budget to pizzas.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.890
And then there'll be some
combination in between, which

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.220
is our budget line.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.620
Which is the combinations of
pizzas and movies you can

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.277
consume given your
total income y.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.040
And the slope of that line is
going to be the price ratio.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.620
Or the negative of
the price ratio.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:59.500
The slope of that line is going
to be minus pp over pm.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.180
The slope of that line is going
to be the change in the

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.540
ratio of the price of pizza
to the price of movies.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.030
OK, what am I doing
wrong here?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.260
Negative of the price ratio.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.400
Have I got this right?

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.493
Rise over run.

00:05:17.493 --> 00:05:18.743
Yeah.

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:27.914
Have I got this right?

00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:28.405
Yeah.

00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:31.351
AUDIENCE: I think that the pp
and the pm's are in the

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:33.806
denominators, because it's y
over pp [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:38.716
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:40.189
It's the denominators, that's
what I did wrong.

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:41.439
Right, so it is pm over pp.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.050
Sorry, my bad.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.130
OK, right.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.830
Because they're the
denominators.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.300
Because it's the rise over run
in terms of the quantity.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.290
So that's what I did wrong.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.980
OK, so basically it's the
negative of the price ratio,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.150
minus the price of movies over
the price of pizzas because

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.170
they're in the denominators as
you said, because as the price

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.790
goes up, the quantity
goes down.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.320
So the negative of the price
ratio of the price of movies

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.850
to the price of pizzas
is the slope.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.820
So let's just do a
simple example.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.490
Imagine that income
equals $96.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.080
Imagine your parents
give you $96, say

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.340
a month or a semester.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.420
Imagine that the price of movies
is $8 and imagine the

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.480
price of a pizza is $16.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.420
It's a good pizza.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.240
So what this means is that with
your income of $96, you

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.220
could either get eight
pizzas or 12 movies.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.180
So that means that the price
ratio of the slope of your

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.020
budget constraint
is minus 1/2.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.540
The price ratio is minus 1/2.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.550
So the slope of that budget
constraint is minus 1/2.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.910
Now, we have a name
for this slope.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.740
We're going to call this
the marginal rate of

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.580
transformation.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.030
The marginal rate of
transformation is our label

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.220
for this slope.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.460
Now, why do we use that name?

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.830
Well, it means that's the
marginal rate at which you can

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:17.170
transform pizzas into movies.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.320
The rate at which you can
turn pizzas into movies.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.950
Now, once again, like I talked
about last time, you're not an

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.690
alchemist. You're not actually
turning pizzas into movies.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.890
But the market essentially is
giving you a rate at which you

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.770
can do that given a budget,
given that you have a certain

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.410
amount of money.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:41.200
Given that you have a certain
amount of money, $96, and

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.340
given the prices that you face
in the market, you could

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.170
transform pizzas into movies
by trading one

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.770
pizza for 1/2 a movie.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.850
Now, once again, you're not
actually doing the physical

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.700
transformation, but that's the
trade-off that you face when

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.300
you're trying to transform
one to the other.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.760
So effectively, it's the same as
if you're trading them for

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.650
each other.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.090
As I talked about last time.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.160
it's essentially the same as
you're trading, and that's

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.350
because of the key economic
concept we'll come back to

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.540
over and over again
in this course--

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:20.360
the concept of opportunity
cost.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.660
The opportunity cost is the
value of the forgone

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.910
alternative.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.250
The value of the forgone
alternative is the opportunity

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:48.120
cost. So basically what that
means is if you decide to

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:59.970
forgo a pizza, that's the same
as forgoing two movies.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.150
Likewise, if you decide to forgo
a movie, it's the same

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.660
as forgoing half a pizza.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.270
So the opportunity cost of a
movie, what essentially the

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.780
movie is costing you,
is 1/2 a pizza.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.100
Now, really it's costing you $8
and a pizza costs you $16.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.850
But when we think about
trading off goods, the

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.770
opportunity cost of that movie
is that you've forgone the

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.300
ability to eat half a pizza.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.510
That's the opportunity cost
of the situation.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.630
So that's basically
how we're going to

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.000
think about this trade-off.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.430
We're going to think about
trading off goods as the

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.900
opportunity cost of consuming
one good instead of another.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.730
The opportunity cost of that
movie is that you haven't

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.730
gotten to eat 1/2 a pizza.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.130
The opportunity cost of the
pizza is that you've forgone

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.860
seeing two movies.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.640
And the reason is because
you have a fixed budget.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.750
If you had an infinite budget,
there'd be no opportunity

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.410
cost. But because you have a
fixed budget and you have to

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:57.570
allocate that budget, there's
an opportunity cost. If you

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.340
choose not to decide, you've
still made a choice.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.940
I don't know whether that
quote's due to Shakespeare or

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.850
Rush, I'm not sure.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.060
I have to look that up.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.880
But basically, if you choose
to have one thing, then by

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.890
definition you're forgoing
another.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.470
Now, to understand the budget
constraint, let's talk about

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.240
what happens when we shock
the budget constraint.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:29.000
Let's imagine the price of
pizzas rose from $16 to $24.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.270
Pizzas got really expensive.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.780
We decided we only want gourmet
pizzas or something.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.930
The price of pizzas went
from $16 to $24.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:38.540
What does this do?

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.180
Well, let's look
at figure 5-2.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.120
It'll show what that does.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.930
What that does is it says our
new budget constraint, instead

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:51.320
of being 16p plus 8m equals 96,
which is what the budget

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.680
constraint was in our example,
it's now 24p

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.370
plus 8m equals 96.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.020
That's the new equation for
the budget constraint.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.940
Or, more relevantly, the slope
of the budget constraint has

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.370
flattened from minus
1/2 to minus 1/3.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.240
The slope has fallen from
minus 1/2 to minus 1/3.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:18.390
The price ratio has been reduced
from 1/2 to 1/3.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.530
Now, forget utility
for a second.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.790
Forget the fact that we
thought about utility.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:29.390
Just looking at this, can you
tell whether you are better or

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.010
worse off from this
price change?

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.950
You shook your head
no, why not?

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.151
AUDIENCE: Because you don't know
if you like pizzas enough

00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:38.360
to get any.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.420
PROFESSOR: OK, well
in particular,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.180
you can almost tell.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.010
Who's the only person
who doesn't care

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.589
about this price change?

00:11:47.589 --> 00:11:49.068
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:49.068 --> 00:11:51.050
PROFESSOR: No, no no.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.080
Think about consumers, people
with different preferences for

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.960
pizzas and movies.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.850
What would your preference for
pizzas and movies have to be

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.610
for you not to care about
this price change?

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.830
All movies.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.280
So long as you care about
pizza at all,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.790
you're worse off.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.880
So in fact, the answer is your
opportunity set has been

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.940
restricted.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.960
So we can think about
the opportunity set.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.430
Your opportunity set is the set
of choices you can make

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.550
given your budget.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.470
Before, you could make choices
all the way up

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.070
to the upper line.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.540
Now your set of choices
that are

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.640
available have just fallen.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.720
Now, you're no poorer-- it's
not like your parents

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.890
have cut you off.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.390
They still give you the $96.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.990
But you're effectively poorer.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.620
You're effectively worse
off, and why is that?

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.620
Because the set of things you
could afford with that $96 has

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.850
just been restricted.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.310
And unless you truly have no
value on pizza, unless all you

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.840
care about's the movie--

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:56.600
you're gluten and cheese
allergic or something, you

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.850
have no value on pizza--

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.790
then you're worse off.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.835
Your opportunity set's
restricted.

00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:06.000
And that's the key insight here,
is that you are worse

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.410
off because the price
has increased.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.950
A price increase makes
you worse off.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.950
It restricts your opportunity
set, because with the same

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.300
amount of income, you can
now afford fewer goods.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.000
Your opportunity set has
been restricted.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.020
Likewise, now let's talk
about what happens

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.840
when your income falls.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.620
That's the next figure.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.460
Now, let's suppose your parents
are pissed at you and

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.470
they cut you down to $80.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.340
Because you didn't
do something.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.970
You don't write enough or
call enough, so they

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.280
cut you down to $80.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.490
Well, here the slope
of the budget

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.610
constraint has not changed.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.430
Because what determines the
slope of the budget

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.870
constraint?

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.260
It's prices, and no prices
have changed.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.000
The slope of the budget
constraint is unchanged

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.070
because prices haven't changed,
but your opportunity

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.400
set is once again restricted
because you

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.980
now have lower income.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.740
So you can now afford fewer
pizzas and movies.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.370
So now, instead of being able to
afford up to six pizzas and

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.010
up to 12 movies, you can now
only afford up to five pizzas

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.240
and up to 10 movies because
your income has fallen.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.620
So once again, you're
unambiguously worse off.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.560
Your opportunity set
has contracted.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.600
So your opportunity set will
contract whenever income falls

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.230
or whenever price increases.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.710
And how it affects the graph
will depend on whether it

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.170
affects prices, which affects
the slope, or just income,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.650
which affects the intercepts.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.830
Now, questions about the
budget constraints and

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.790
opportunity sets?

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.450
Armed with that--

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.214
Yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:14:36.214 --> 00:14:37.438
AUDIENCE: Is the area under
the curve at all

00:14:37.438 --> 00:14:38.688
indicative of utility?

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.410
PROFESSOR:No, it's not, because
that's going to be

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.350
determined by your
preferences.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.170
It's indicative of, if you
will, potential utility,

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.710
because that's your
opportunity set.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.240
But as the example here points
out, if you don't like pizzas

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.890
at all, you'll feel very
differently than if you like

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:56.900
pizzas a lot.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.610
So it's indicative of sort of
your potential utility, but

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.160
not your actual well-being.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.920
But now that's a great segue
to the next step.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.395
Let's put that together and talk
about constrained choice.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.820
Which is now, let's
put together--

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.200
we know what your preferences
are, we've mathematically

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.820
represented those by
utility function.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.600
We know what your budget set
is, we've mathematically

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.410
represented that based on
your income and prices.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.060
Now let's put them together
and talk about

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.580
how you make choices.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:34.940
And the basic question you want
to ask is, what's the

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.050
highest utility you can achieve
given the constraints

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.880
your budget constraints
put on you?

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.820
Or, graphically--

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.110
so let's say you wanted to
understand this intuitively,

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.530
graphically, and
mathematically.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.120
Intuitively the idea is quite
simple, I think, which is

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.775
just, what's the most you can
have given the constraints

00:15:55.775 --> 00:15:57.170
that are placed on you?

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.010
Graphically, we represent that
as asking, what is the

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.640
furthest out indifference
curve you can achieve?

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.080
Because remember,
more is better.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.260
Indifference curves that are
further out make you happier.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.190
So what's the furthest out
indifference curve that you

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.950
can achieve given your
budget constraint?

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.260
So to do that, let's actually
do an example.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.250
Let's imagine, as last time,
your utility is the square

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.640
root of pizza times movies.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.050
Once again, this has no
fundamental meaning, it's just

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.080
a mathematical representation
of your preferences.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.310
So your preferences are
mathematically represented by

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.450
utility equals square root
of pizza times movies.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.330
And let's have the same
budget constraint

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.120
that we have up here.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:38.660
Income is $96, price of movies
is $8, price of pizza is $16.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.300
Now let's go to the
next graph.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.410
Figure 5-4.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.570
What this does is put together
our indifference curve

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.670
analysis with our budget
constraint analysis.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.680
It's a little complicated.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:58.140
The budget constraint line is
the vertical line running from

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.340
a y-intercept of six to
an x-intercept of 12.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.058
The-- not the vertical line, the
straight line running from

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:07.740
a y-intercept of six to
an x-intercept of 12.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.720
That's your budget constraint.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.369
We saw that before.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:13.290
Then we have here a series
of indifference curves.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.440
These curves are drawn-- these
are a mathematical

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.230
representative of this
utility function.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.280
These are points among which
you're indifferent if you have

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.920
that utility function.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.079
And what we see is that the best
you can do is to choose

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:32.620
point D. Point D, with six
movies and three pizzas--

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:39.070
OK, that should be p on the
y-axis, not C. It should be

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.600
movies on the x-axis and
pizzas on the y-axis.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.130
That should be p
on the y-axis.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:49.170
The best you can do is
to choose a point D.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.470
Now, to see that.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.790
And that gives utility.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.820
What's the value of your
utility at point D?

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.890
We understand value's
meaningless, but just so we

00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.096
can compare, what's the value
of your utility at point D?

00:18:00.096 --> 00:18:02.620
The square root of 18.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.760
The value of utility is the
square root of 6 times 3,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:13.890
which is the square
root of 18.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.720
Which is going to be square root
of two, or three times

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.500
square root of two, but we'll
just call it square root of 18

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.090
for comparison.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.990
Now, let's talk about why that's
the best point for you.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.470
Let's think about some
alternative points.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.950
For instance, why is that
better than point E?

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.622
Somebody raise their hand and
tell me, why is point D better

00:18:35.622 --> 00:18:36.680
than point E?

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:36.900
Yeah?

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.870
AUDIENCE: E is unattainable
with your budget.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.910
PROFESSOR: E would be better,
that'd be great.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:45.270
We'd love eight movies
and four pizzas, but

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.560
we can't reach it.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.710
So E's unattainable.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.170
Why is it better than point A?

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.160
Point A you can afford.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.660
So why's point E better
than point A?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.890
You could afford point
A just like you can

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.960
afford point D. Yeah?

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.180
AUDIENCE: Because the utility's
only root 10.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:02.980
PROFESSOR: Because what?

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.700
AUDIENCE: It's only root 10.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.350
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly, because
the utilitity's only

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.140
the square root of 10.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.650
You're on a lower indifference
curve at point A. So it's true

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.110
you could afford point A,
but you're on a lower

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.795
indifference curve.

00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:17.590
Your utility's a lower value,
it's only square root of 10.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:22.420
So point A is dominated by point
D. What about point C?

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.050
Well, point C you
have the same--

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.410
point C is just an inward shift
from point D, but here

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.530
that's a dominated choice.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.480
Once again your utility's
lower.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.220
It's the square root
of 4.5 times 2.2.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.690
And basically that's dominated
because you could afford more.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.200
So basically, the point is that
the point which will make

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.040
you happiest is the point at
which your indifference curve

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.490
is tangent to the budget
constraint.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.440
Because that is the point of the
farthest out indifference

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.750
curve that you can reach given
your budget constraint.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.610
The tangency of the indifference
curve and the

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.360
budget constraint is the point
which makes you best off given

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.985
your available budget and
the available prices.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.330
And that's the point where the
slope of the indifference

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.990
curve equals the slope of
the budget constraint.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.490
The tangency is the point
where the slope of the

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.700
indifference curve equals
the slope of the budget

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.110
constraint.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.570
Or, more relevantly--

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.280
OK, let me stop there.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.850
That's the graphic intuition.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.410
With a sloping indifference
curve because the slope of the

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.850
budget constraint is the
optimum, because by

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.640
definition, that is the point
of the furthest out

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.580
indifference curve you can
reach given your budget.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.540
The point of tangency is the
point of equal slopes.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.520
Are there questions about the
graphical analysis here?

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.270
This is very, very
important, so.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.950
Yeah?

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.620
AUDIENCE: This is sort of about
the graphical analysis,

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.070
but if it only matters in terms
of the ordinal values of

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.858
the utility function and p and M
are always positive, does it

00:20:55.858 --> 00:20:57.230
matter if you got rid
of the square root?

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.210
Would anything change if
it was u equals pm?

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.700
Because the the marginal
rate of substitution,

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.080
transformation, all that would
still be the same, right?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.920
PROFESSOR: In this particular
example, it would not.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.390
So actually, you're asking
a great question.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:15.720
Because it's ordinal, you can
typically do transformations

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.220
for the ranking of bundles.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.290
You will always get the same
ranking with a monotone

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.260
transformation of the
utility function.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.510
That's exactly right.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.580
Later in the course, we'll show
different ways why the

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.940
functional form matters, and
I'll show you why I did square

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.780
root, because it's going
to turn out that

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.930
that's going to matter.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.790
But for other things--
but for the ranking

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.530
bundles, you're right.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.610
The ranking of bundles is
consistent with the

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.860
transformation.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.170
So that's the graphical.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.300
Now let's come to
the mathematical

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.080
derivation of this.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.010
So let's talk about the
mathematics of utility

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:53.970
maximization.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.790
Now what I'm going to do here
is, I'm going to do this sort

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.680
of casually, as is my wont.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.730
Friday in section, you're
going to work on the

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.240
underlying calculus that lies
behind the mathematics that

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.640
I'm going to present here.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:13.020
Now, let's talk about
what it means that

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.700
these slopes are equal.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.610
Well, remember, what is-- does
anyone remember what the slope

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.590
of the indifference curve is?

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.150
What do we call the slope of
the indifference curve?

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:20.430
Yeah?

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.490
AUDIENCE: The MRS.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.190
PROFESSOR: The MRS. The slope
of the indifference curve is

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.810
the marginal rate
of substitution.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.210
Which is defined as what?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.000
What is the marginal rate
of substitution?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.450
The ratio of what?

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.982
PROFESSOR: No, the marginal
rate of substitution.

00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:41.290
This is just about
preferences.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.125
What's the marginal rate of
substitution defined as?

00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:44.310
It's the ratio of
what to what?

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.810
Yeah?

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.074
AUDIENCE: The amount of one good
you have to get to give

00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.310
up a unit of the other good.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.810
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.872
AUDIENCE: The amount of one good
you have to get to give

00:22:49.872 --> 00:22:51.310
up a unit of the other good.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.450
PROFESSOR: So graphically
that's what

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.665
it's defined as, exactly.

00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:55.710
It's the slope of the
indifference curve.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.400
Mathematically, what was it?

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.720
What was it in terms
of utility?

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.440
Does anyone remember?

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:00.680
Yeah.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.190
AUDIENCE: The ratio
of the partials.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.000
PROFESSOR: Ratio of the
marginal utilities.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.210
In particular, it's the negative
of the marginal

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.110
utility of movies over the
marginal utility of pizza.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.622
Remember, it's the negative of
the marginal utility of the

00:23:12.622 --> 00:23:14.950
x-axis over the marginal
utility of the y-axis.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.630
So marginal rate of substitution
is the rate at

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.650
which you're willing to
substitute between movies and

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.700
pizza, which is a function of
your marginal utilities.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:30.360
If your marginal utility for
movies is very high, then you

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.560
need a lot of pizzas.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.190
Then you wouldn't trade a movie
unless you get a lot of

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.450
pizza for it.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.930
If your marginal utility of
movies is very low, you'd be

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.630
happy to give up a movie
even for a small

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.970
fraction of a pizza.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.400
So that's the marginal
rate of substitution.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.370
That's about preferences only.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:48.170
At the same time, we're saying
that that marginal rate of

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:53.060
substitution is equal to--

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.610
this slope is equal to the
slope of the budget

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.570
constraint.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.200
Well, the slope of the budget
constraint we call the

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.630
marginal rate of transformation,
which is the

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.880
price ratio.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.940
The slope of the budget
constraint is the negative of

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.610
the price ratio.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.900
That's where you were sort of
one step ahead of us here.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.320
So preferences give us this,
the marginal rate of

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.410
substitution.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.810
The mechanics of the market give
us the marginal rate of

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.310
transformation.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:31.390
And utility maximization gives
us that those are equal,

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.100
because they're equal
at that tangency.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.910
At that tangency is where you
get to the highest possible

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.490
indifference curve.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:52.790
So at the optimum, you get that
the ratio of marginal

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.400
utility equals the
ratio of prices.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.360
Now, I want to try to see you
understand this a bit more

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.170
intuitively, given
this mathematics.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.590
The way I like to think about
this is, think about the ratio

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:07.170
of the marginal utilities
as the marginal benefit.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:13.630
So it's the benefit of another
movie in terms of pizza.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.560
The marginal rate of
substitution is the benefit of

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.840
another movie in
terms of pizza.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.340
It's how much you like that
next movie relative to how

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.590
much you like that next pizza.

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:26.020
The marginal rate of
transformation, the cost, is

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.710
the price of that next movie
relative to the price of that

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.350
next pizza.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.500
So what we're saying here is
we're setting benefits equal

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.260
to the costs.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.410
In particular, we're setting
marginal benefits equal to

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.740
marginal cost.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.690
The marginal benefit, the
benefit to that next movie in

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:50.540
terms of pizza, has got to be
equal to the marginal cost,

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.820
the cost to you in terms
of that next

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.230
movie in terms of pizza.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.415
And this notion that the optimum
will be where marginal

00:25:56.415 --> 00:25:58.610
benefit equals marginal
cost will pervade

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.910
through the whole course.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.670
When we do firm maximization,
it'll be the same thing.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:07.690
Any maximization we'll do in
this course, any optimization,

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.460
will be about equating
these margins.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.180
Setting the marginal benefits
equal to marginal costs.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.500
Now, this is different than
benefits equals cost, because

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.850
it's about the next unit.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:22.205
It's saying, how do we feel
about that next movie compared

00:26:22.205 --> 00:26:24.150
to the price of that
next movie.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.100
Now, prices here we have
being constant.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.310
You could imagine prices of
movies changing as you see

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.710
more, but that gets
complicated.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:30.600
We'll worry about that later.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.030
For now, the price
is constant.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.300
But the marginal utilities
are not constant.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.980
Marginal utilities are obviously
changing the more

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.130
moves you see.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.830
Once again, with intuition,
you have to

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.240
develop your own intuition.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.220
The way that I like to think
about this intuitively is to

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.590
actually rewrite this a little
bit, and rewrite it as saying

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.560
that the marginal utility of
movies over the price of

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.390
movies equals the marginal
utility of pizza over the

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:57.640
price of pizza.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.470
At the optimum, this'll
be true.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.340
I like this because to me this
term sort of says, look, the

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.845
bang for the buck has to be
the same across all goods.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.110
For each dollar of movie
expenditure, what's it buying?

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.870
What's that next dollar of movie
expenditure buying you?

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.780
This is saying, what's that
next dollar of pizza

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.230
expenditure buying you?

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.720
And they've got to be equal.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.120
If the next dollar of movie
expenditure buys you a lot

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.720
more happiness than the next
dollar of pizza expenditure,

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.180
then you're not at
the right place.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.985
You should shift your money and
spend more on movies and

00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:34.830
less on pizza.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.080
If the next dollar of pizza
expenditure buys you a lot

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.610
more happiness than the next
dollar of movie expenditure,

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.000
then you're not in the
right place either.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.200
You should see fewer movies
and buy more pizza.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.720
So basically, it's where the
marginal benefit to you--

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.600
the bang for the buck of that
next movie is the same as the

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.830
bang for the buck of
that next pizza.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.580
So to see this, let's go back
to figure 5-4 and let's

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.230
actually think through the
mathematics of a couple of

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.110
these points.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:20.550
Let's take point A. At point
A, you have two pizzas and

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.820
five movies.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:28.990
So pizza equals two, movies
equals five at point A. So

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:35.230
utility is equal to square
root of 10 at point A.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:39.390
Now, in particular, your
marginal utility for pizzas at

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.360
that point--

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.680
what's the marginal utility
for pizzas?

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.760
Well, we can differentiate.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.630
That's the derivative of the
utility function with respect

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.230
to prices, du/dp.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:56.710
Which is going to be 0.5 times
movies over the square root of

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:02.540
p times m, which at these values
is going to be one over

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.650
the square root of 10.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.740
That's your marginal
utility of pizzas.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:14.350
Your marginal utility of movies
is going to be du/dm,

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:21.020
which is going to be 0.5 times
p over square root of p times

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:31.740
m, which is going to be 2.5
over square root of 10.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.990
So the marginal rate of
substitution between

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.350
these two is 2.5.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:47.130
The marginal rate of
substitution, 2.5.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.570
What does that mean
intuitively?

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.040
Can someone tell me what that
means intuitively, the

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.070
marginal rate of substitution
is 2.5?

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.680
What does that mean?

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.580
Someone explain that like you'd
explain it to someone

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.330
who's speaking English.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.220
What does it mean that
the marginal rate of

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.350
substitution is 2.5?

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.890
Yeah?

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.260
AUDIENCE: You'd give up one
pizza for 2.5 movies.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:06.640
Yes.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.820
No, actually, the opposite.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.420
You'd give up two
and 1/2 pizzas--

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.746
the marginal rate of
substitution is 2.5--

00:30:17.662 --> 00:30:19.620
no, that's right.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.320
You would give up 2.5--

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.440
one second, let's make sure
I have this right.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:36.305
Right, so you would give up one
pizza to see 2 and 1/2--

00:30:36.305 --> 00:30:37.580
no, it's the other way around.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.060
You're getting a lot of pizza
and not enough movies.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.640
So you would give up two
and 1/2 pizzas to

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.890
get one more movie.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.310
This is confusing, OK?

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.000
You'd give up two and 1/2 pizzas
to get one more movie.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.070
That's what it means.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.700
You would give up two and 1/2
pizzas to see one more movie,

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.100
and why is that?

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.150
Why at a point like A would you
give up two and 1/2 pizzas

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:04.120
to see one more movie?

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:04.597
Yeah?

00:31:04.597 --> 00:31:06.982
AUDIENCE: Well, if you just look
at the line tangent to

00:31:06.982 --> 00:31:09.844
the indifference curve
at A, it's really

00:31:09.844 --> 00:31:11.280
not a downward slope.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.970
PROFESSOR: It's really steep,
which means what?

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.850
AUDIENCE: Which means you get
a lot more benefit--like you

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:17.530
don't care if you
give up a lot of

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.700
pizzas to see more movies.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.820
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.470
Actually, that's a great way to
bring the graphics and the

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.830
intuition together.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.990
Here's thinking of
it intuitively.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.670
I'm getting a lot of pizza
at point A. I'm not

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.970
getting a lot of movies.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.990
So I would happily give
up a lot of pizza

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.790
to get my next movie.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.210
What you pointed out is the
tie to the graphics here.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:43.940
The indifference curve is very
steep at that point through A.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.310
A steep indifference curve in
that way means I don't really

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:53.150
care a whole lot at this point
about how many pizzas I get,

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:56.650
but I care a lot about
getting more movies.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:02.010
So at a point like A where
it's very steep, you are

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.960
willing to give up two and 1/2
pizzas to see a movie.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.050
But what do you have
to give up?

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.250
What's the market telling
you you have to

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.370
give up to see a movie?

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.910
How much pizza do you actually
have to give up to see a movie

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.340
in practice?

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.720
You're willing to give up two
and 1/2 pizzas to see a movie,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.420
but how many pizzas do you
actually have to give up?

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.350
AUDIENCE: 1/2.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.330
PROFESSOR: 1/2 a pizza
to see a movie.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.140
So that can't be the optimum.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.160
You're willing to give up two
and 1/2 pizzas to see a movie,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.710
but you only have to give up
1/2 a pizza to see a movie.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.890
So you can't be at
the right place.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:33.260
You should be changing your
consumption bundle.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.500
You should be changing your
consumption bundle, because

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.530
the market is only asking for
1/2 a pizza to see a movie,

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.846
but you're willing to
give up two and 1/2

00:32:39.846 --> 00:32:41.090
pizzas to see a movie.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.470
So at a point like A, you're
clearly not at the optimum.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.550
Because you are willing
to make a trade.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.980
Remember, we talked about-- we
can go all the way back to the

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.170
first lecture.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:55.690
The key point was-- the first
or second lecture--

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.390
inefficiency happens
when trades aren't

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.020
made that people value.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.300
Here's a trade that you value.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.030
You're willing to give up two
and 1/2 pizzas to see a movie.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.590
The market only wants 1/2
a pizza to see a movie.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.550
You're not making a trade you
value, so that's not the

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.200
efficient outcome.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.740
Likewise, let's do the same
mathematics at point B. Well,

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.390
at point B, if you do the math
and work it out, you see that

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.190
the marginal utility of
pizza is five over

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.340
square root of ten.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.160
The marginal utility of
movies is 0.5 over the

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.360
square root of 10.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.250
So the MRS is 0.1.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.960
At this point, you'd only be
willing to give up 0.1 pizzas

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.730
to see a movie.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.835
At a point like B,
the indifference

00:33:36.835 --> 00:33:38.720
curve is very flat.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.340
You're only willing to give up
0.1 pizzas to see a movie.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:49.170
But remember, the market is
willing to say, look--

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.810
you can flip it around, the
market's willing to say, look,

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.060
you can get a movie.

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:59.670
You're only willing to give up
0.1 pizzas to see a movie.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.720
Well, that means clearly that
you have too many movies and

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.190
not enough pizza.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:12.010
You're clearly at that point
happy to say, wow, you mean

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.730
that I can gain a whole pizza by
just giving up two movies?

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.850
Heck, I'd be willing to give up
10 movies to get a pizza.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.650
At the point I'm at right there,
I'd be willing to give

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.520
up 10 movies to get a pizza.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.590
You're telling me we only
have to give up two

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.239
movies to get a pizza?

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:26.960
Great.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.280
I'm going to do that trade.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.380
I'm going to move back towards
point D. So that's why this

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.719
idea of what you're willing to
do, which is the MRS, and what

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:41.170
the market's making you do, you
want to equilibrate those

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.489
to decide how much you
want to consume.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.570
Now, obviously a point like--

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.710
let's talk about point C.
Point C is interesting,

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.070
because at point
C, what's true?

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.139
The marginal rate of
substitution is equal to the

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:00.460
marginal rate of transformation
at point C. The

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.630
slope of the indifference
curve and the budget

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.980
constraint are equal.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.160
That's why you have to check
two conditions for

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.330
optimization.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.620
First of all, those slopes
have to be equal.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.660
Second of all, you've got
to spend all your money.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.040
So it's true there's a whole
host of points-- in fact,

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.330
there's a vector running through
CDE, all which are

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:25.520
points where the margin rate
of substitution equals the

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.880
margin rate of transformation.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.630
But only D is optimal, because
you also have to

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.770
remember more is better.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.700
You never want to leave
money on the table.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.770
So the two conditions you have
to meet is that you're at the

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:42.190
point where your desired
trade-off between pizzas and

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:46.460
movies is the same as the
market's, and where you're

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.050
spending all your budget.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.890
And that's the optimum.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.140
OK, questions about that?

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.820
So that's basically how we
think about optimization.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.980
That's how we think about
consumers making their

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.940
decisions deciding between
consuming pizzas and movies.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.490
Now, let's come back-- however,
this is a particular

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.190
case we've looked at.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.530
This is a case in particular
where we've imposed that

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.120
there's an interior solution.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.910
In fact, in practice you could
end up in these kinds of

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.560
choices with corner solutions.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:25.600
So let's take a look at the
last figure, figure 5-5.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:31.480
We've chosen a case where your
optimal bundle includes both

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.730
pizza and movies.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.920
But you could imagine
a situation where

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.370
your optimal bundle--

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.945
and once again, that should be
a p, not a c in figure 5-5,

00:36:43.945 --> 00:36:46.420
that should be p
on the y-axis--

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.960
where your optimal
bundle includes

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.470
only one or the other.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.300
So this is a particular case--
we have the same budget line

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.560
as before, which is you're
trading off pizza and movies.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.860
You have an income of 96, the
price of pizzas is 16, the

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.460
price of movies is 8.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.400
So same budget line as before.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.040
But now your indifference curves
look very different.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.750
Now your preferences are such
that you've got these linear

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.180
difference curves of the
form I1, I2, I3.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.030
You've got these linear
indifference curves.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.780
What that means is
you've got--

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.930
these indifference curves mean
that you have a constant rate

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.580
at which you're willing to trade
off pizza for movies.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.245
If we go back to figure 5.4,
the rate at which you're

00:37:31.245 --> 00:37:33.450
willing to trade off pizza
for movies changes.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.390
Your preferences
are such that--

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.790
because the square root function
as pointed out--

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.960
your preferences are such that
you are willing to make

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.040
different rates of trade
at different amounts.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.430
In figure 5-5, your preferences
are constant, no

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.000
matter how many movies or pizzas
you have. You're always

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.850
willing to make that trade-off
at the same rate.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.230
Well, in that case you can end
up with a corner solution,

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:10.370
where in fact, you're going
to consume only six

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.540
pizzas and no movies.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.580
And why is that?

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.930
That's because this is a
person who loves pizza

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:18.630
relative to movies.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.460
It's a very flat indifference
curve.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.520
They love pizza relative
to movies.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.140
And they love pizza so much
relative to movies that given

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.950
the prices they face, they'll
just go ahead and choose six

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:35.380
pizzas and no movies.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.330
So that's a corner solution.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:39.330
So mathematically, as you'll
go through a section on

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:44.360
Friday, you're going to have to
check for corner solutions.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.520
You may solve these problems
and end up with negative

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.640
quantities and be befuddled
about what happens.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.030
Well, if an answer looks
wrong, it is wrong.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.460
If you solve problems with
negative quantities, that's

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.670
probably because there's a
corner solution to the

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.330
problem, and actually the
optimal quantity is to have

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.230
zero of one thing and spend
your entire budget on

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.240
something else.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.490
Questions about that?

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:15.700
So now let's think about
applying this to the kinds of

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.680
decisions that you
all have to make.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.340
So I talked about this
particular example of pizza

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.270
and movies.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:27.500
And in fact, you might say,
well, that's sort of

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.150
unrealistic.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:33.120
Gee, I spend my budget
on lots of things,

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:33.960
and how do I do this?

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.460
Well, in practice, what you'd
have to do is you'd have to

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.060
draw a multi-dimensional
graph and solve a

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.840
multi-dimensional problem.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.270
And that's a bear.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.080
But in practice, in fact, we can
often think about breaking

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.220
down the choices we make
into pairs of choices.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.920
In practice, you could think
about saying, look--

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:56.440
many people do what a lot of
psychologists call mental

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:06.400
accounting, where basically they
say, look, yes, I have a

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.550
whole budget and lots
of things I can buy.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.810
But in fact, I like to think
of my budget in sort of

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:11.360
subcategories.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.790
I think of a certain amount
I'm willing to spend on

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.720
entertainment and a
certain amount I'm

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.200
willing to spend on food.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.610
And I take my budget and
I mentally put it

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.710
in different buckets.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.030
And within each of those
buckets, you can then do the

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:29.240
same kind of optimization
problem that we've done here.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.120
So even though in reality we
choose across a whole host of

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.200
goods, in practice what you're
going to see is that people

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:44.290
will do this kind of mental
accounting, where they sort of

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:48.150
divide their goods into
different buckets and optimize

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.400
within each of those buckets.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:57.100
What this means in practice is
that in fact, if we now stop

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.640
for a second and think about
the government, and how it

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.370
affects our consumption
decisions, what this means is

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.870
that in practice,
the government--

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.100
so, one way we typically of
the government affecting

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.810
consumption decisions is through
the power of taxation.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:13.120
So let's say for example,
the government decided

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.790
that pizzas were bad.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.190
They caused obesity.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:18.840
That there's too much obesity
because people are eating too

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:24.660
much pizza, and we need to
deal with that through a

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.550
government policy that
involves taxation.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:31.130
Somebody talk me through the
analysis of how we'd think

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:36.460
about analyzing a tax on pizza
given these diagrams.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.970
Let's go to figure 5-4.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:49.780
And imagine I said that
we're going to place

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.920
a 50% tax on pizza.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:42:00.040
So we're going to say that every
dollar you pay on pizza,

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.150
you're going to have to pay
$0.50 to the government.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.256
Because we're really
worried people are

00:42:04.256 --> 00:42:06.180
eating too much pizza.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.210
What would that do the
budget constraint?

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:09.640
Yeah.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.464
AUDIENCE: Well, effectively
you're increasing

00:42:10.464 --> 00:42:12.540
the price of pizza.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.604
PROFESSOR: Effectively you're
increasing the price of pizza

00:42:13.604 --> 00:42:14.260
to the consumer.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.484
AUDIENCE: The budget
constraint would

00:42:15.484 --> 00:42:17.260
shift down like this.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.350
PROFESSOR: It's actually going
to have the same effect as we

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:20.920
saw in figure 5-2.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.620
In fact, I've just replicated
figure 5-2.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:32.640
Because in figure 5-2, the price
of pizza went up by 50%,

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:40.350
from $16 to $24.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.020
That's the same thing that the
government's just done.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.460
It's raised the price of pizza
effectively from $16 a pizza

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.140
to $24 because instead of paying
your $16, you're also

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.060
going to pay $8 to the
government in tax.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.070
So what's that going to do?

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:58.440
That is going to, in general,
lower consumption of pizza.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.260
So that kind of price increase
is going to, in general, lower

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.510
the consumption of pizza.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.440
So the government has tried
to accomplish its goal by

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.750
shifting people away from pizza
towards movies, away

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:11.340
from pizza toward
other things.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.240
Yeah?

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.520
AUDIENCE: Would it be meaningful
to say that it also

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.040
affects the utility curves?

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.870
PROFESSOR: It would not be
meaningful, actually--

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.830
it will affect your
optimal choice.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.980
In general, you will choose
a different amount

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.570
of pizza and movies.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.920
We'll talk about
that next time.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.440
But it's very important, it
would not be right to say it

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.800
affects utility.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.900
Utility is like what you're
born with, it's an innate

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.350
concept about your underlying
preferences.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.730
However, you're actually getting
to my point, which is

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:44.880
in fact, the way economists
typically think about this is

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.230
the government can't affect
your preferences.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.700
But in fact, if people do
mental accounting, the

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.040
government maybe can affect
your preferences.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.410
So let's say that basically the
way I think about it is,

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:56.600
let's say I think I have a
budget for food and I have a

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.430
budget for entertainment.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:59.770
And let's say I think my budget
for entertainment's

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.870
pretty small because
I'm low income.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.100
I've gotta have a
budget for food.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.490
And so let's say I put pizza
in my budget for food, so I

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.000
allocate some of my budget
for food to pizza.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.690
And the government can then
cause me to eat less

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.110
pizza by taxing it.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.960
But what if somehow the
government could get me to

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.110
think of pizza differently?

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.670
What if somehow the government
could get me to think of pizza

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.590
as entertainment?

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:23.300
And suddenly I put it in that
bucket, where I'm trading it

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.050
off not against other food, but
against the fact that I

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.180
want to see a movie and I
want to download stuff

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.600
from iTunes, et cetera.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.460
Maybe then I'd buy less pizza at
the same price because I'm

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.610
putting it in the bucket where
I have less money.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.970
So in other words,
we've imagined a

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.750
world with two goods.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:41.083
And the only way you can affect
the choice across those

00:44:41.083 --> 00:44:42.880
two goods is to lower your
income or your price.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.030
But in fact, if people have lots
of different bundles of

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.340
goods, somehow I could shift you
mentally from considering

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.820
pizza in a bucket where you have
a lot of money to putting

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.090
pizza in a bucket where you
don't have as much money.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:57.490
I can lower your consumption
of pizza without affecting

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:02.240
prices, without an obtrusive
government tax policy.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.020
This is the kind of thing
that we call in

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.340
economic policy a nudge.

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:13.660
And there's a new book called
Nudge by Richard Thaler, who's

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.440
a famous behavioral economist,
basically bringing psychology

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.610
into economics.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:20.110
There's this very important
field now in economics called

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:27.770
behavioral economics, which is
all about, how can we bring

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.480
the lessons of psychology
into economics?

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.090
We don't do that in 14.01.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.310
14.01's all about, we assume
everybody's these perfectly

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.630
rational people who would never
really be fooled into

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:38.800
thinking about pizza differently
just because of

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.220
what the government told them.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.610
But in fact, in reality people
think about things differently

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:46.070
based on the kinds of
information they have. And

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:49.510
given that tax policies can feel
very intrusive-- imagine

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.820
some of you are like, wow,
they're raising my pizza to

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.670
$24, that seems very
intrusive.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.680
If the government could somehow
through nudging you to

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.220
think about pizza differently
change your pizza consumption,

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.940
that might be a much more
acceptable and palatable

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.480
policy to many people.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.110
And that's the kind of role the
government can play, or

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:08.340
policy-makers can play, is not
just by changing your prices

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.880
or income, but by actually
changing how you categorize

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.160
things mentally, they can change
the choices you make.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.140
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Let's march
ahead into upstate New York

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.230
and do formaldehyde.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.710
But first, there's a what
should business do issue

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.210
that I should have
brought up last time.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.690
So I'll bring it up
now, because I didn't.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.430
This is super PACs.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.310
How many people know
what the Citizens United

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.720
decision is or was?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.477
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:51.560
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
well, it's more than that.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.260
Yes, a few.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.310
Let me just walk
through a little bit.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.740
So before 2010, basically,
corporations and unions--

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.820
well, they still can't
make direct contributions

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.100
to candidates, they could
fund independent organizations

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.820
that put up political ads.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.650
But the political ads couldn't
be near elections, et cetera,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.760
et cetera.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.850
Now, after this decision they
can do essentially anything,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.430
as long as it's not
formally part of a campaign.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.360
So if you've been
following this year's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.090
Republican primary
season, there are

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.120
a lot of super PAC ads targeting
one candidate or another.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.080
Most of it's negative, and
there's a lot of money.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.190
The question is, you're the
head of a publicly traded

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.910
corporation.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.420
You can now make major
political contributions.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
The corporation can now make
major political contributions.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.930
Should you?

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.440
Should you, or when should you?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.732
Stephen, what do you think.

00:01:57.732 --> 00:01:59.440
AUDIENCE: I think they
should be able to.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
They're able to.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.875
I'm not talking about that.

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:02.995
Should they?

00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:03.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.550
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
You're the CEO of--

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.720
oh, pick your favorite.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.120
You're the CEO of Apple.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.150
Should you-- and Apple's
got a lot of cash.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.530
Should you spend some
of it to give some of it

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.840
to a super PAC which has a
political agenda that you know?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.613
That's all.

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:24.030
AUDIENCE: At the
end of the day, I

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.180
think there is no harm in doing
so, because I would recommend

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.340
or I would eventually
do that, just

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.477
because when we have all these
different candidates that

00:02:32.477 --> 00:02:34.810
could potentially move things
in a different direction--

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.070
especially for a company like
Apple that relies heavily

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.905
on foreign countries to do
some of their manufacturing,

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:44.280
or some of their new products
coming out in other related

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.190
patents, it could be
very favorable for them

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.220
see a certain type of
political candidate in office

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.340
rather than someone else.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.965
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you would do it

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:55.210
where the corporation's
interests were

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.010
likely to be directly affected.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.530
Any other reason
you might do it?

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.110
AUDIENCE: I would also do it--

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.000
as could also do it as more
of a publicity type of thing,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.430
where [INAUDIBLE]
[? saying ?] we're

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.470
in favor of this green
energy Initiative.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.040
And we would like to see
our candidates support it

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.450
in that area.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.655
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
OK, David, you with him?

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I agree that--

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.440
I mean the [INAUDIBLE]
as a CEO, I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.540
would probably donate some money
if there was a direct impact.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.445
But also, again, for PR,
[INAUDIBLE] accomplish

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.070
[? as far as the ?]
company in general,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.600
I think Apple gave money to
a political action candidate

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.090
opposing the gay marriage
[? act ?] in California.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.240
So that's [INAUDIBLE] part
of [? the ?] initiative

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.282
[INAUDIBLE] push forward.

00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:45.907
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I think that might

00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:47.360
have been Apple's regular PAC.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.318
I don't think it was a
super-- maybe I'm wrong.

00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:50.300
I think the regular--

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.550
the regular PACs,
let me describe it.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.020
They've existed for a long time.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.680
The regular PAC's where the
executives of the company

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.840
contribute money.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.290
The super PAC is where the
company contributes money.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.350
There's a big difference.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.290
One is the executive's
own money-- executives

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.680
or board members, and
the other is my money

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.280
is a shareholder of Apple.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.709
But if it directly affects the
corporation, I take the point.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.700
But you do it for
publicity and you do it

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.430
for a variety of causes.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.140
So I'm a right-wing Republican
who owns Apple stock.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.380
Do I like you giving
to a green PAC?

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.490
You don't care, OK.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.470
[LAUGHS]

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.303
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? also ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:37.303 --> 00:04:46.280
Apple shares if the [INAUDIBLE]
in the political [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.100
is really that
offensive [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Anybody from the other side

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.780
of the room?

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.200
Vivian, what do you think?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.182
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:54.182 --> 00:04:55.990
I don't really know
where we're at.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.365
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
The question

00:04:57.365 --> 00:05:00.370
is, should a corporation,
let's say Apple, take

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.790
a big corporation that has
cash, make contributions--

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.810
not the executives.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.010
But should the CEO
cause the company

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.350
to make political contributions.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.220
And if so, when?

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.140
And if not, why not?

00:05:17.514 --> 00:05:20.888
AUDIENCE: Do they make
political contributions?

00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:24.850
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Should I
go for the Reform America PAC

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.220
that favors Ron Paul or the--

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.830
I forget what it's called
PAC that favors Romney,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.852
or one of the
Obama-leaning PACs or--

00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:37.612
AUDIENCE: I think that's a
really risky position to make

00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:40.902
as a [INAUDIBLE] interests
of your shareholders, so--

00:05:40.902 --> 00:05:42.860
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Shareholders might not all

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.320
agree.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.640
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.015
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:46.030
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.988
AUDIENCE: Is it in the
interest of the company,

00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:51.940
like in regard to Apple with
imports from other countries

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.670
in terms of manufacturing.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.600
Like, it's beneficial to the
company and to the shareholders

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.150
to maximize value in that way?

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.295
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So?

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.170
AUDIENCE: I think it's
favorable that they're

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.040
doing it for the
company's best interests.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.582
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So if it's
somebody particularly focused

00:06:08.582 --> 00:06:09.755
on them.

00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:10.255
Ariana.

00:06:10.255 --> 00:06:11.460
AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.210
I think that, even if the
company has given donate money

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.842
to a cause that you don't
necessarily personally support,

00:06:17.842 --> 00:06:21.885
[INAUDIBLE] as a
shareholder, you [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:21.885 --> 00:06:23.260
[? their ?]
interests separately.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.760
Like, you have interest in
this corporation as pertains

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.680
to making a profit,
and you might also

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.760
have separate
personal interests.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.940
And so if personally,
you want to donate

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.910
to whoever you think has the
right position on gay marriage,

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.420
I think that's fine.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.840
But you should know that the
interest in the corporation

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.670
is purely about making a profit.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.970
So if the corporation
is supporting

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.273
a cause that furthers that
goal, then that's fine.

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:50.190
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But
gay marriage probably

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.570
doesn't have a lot to do with
my earnings as a shareholder.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.880
AUDIENCE: So you shouldn't be
worried about the corporation

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.710
getting involved in that.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.522
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Andrew?

00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:07.140
AUDIENCE: So one thing
about allowing companies

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.940
to do these sorts of things--

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.680
I think that whereas
in some situations,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.550
you can see the merit
directly from banks,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.420
and there's this
candidate that I

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.750
know it's going to force me to
have higher standards and all

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.220
that stuff, I might want to
go for the other candidate.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.830
But I think that having
these sorts of rules allows

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.340
for companies to go in
this murky territory,

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.570
where you're influencing
things you probably shouldn't.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.250
And you increase your--

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.040
in terms of--

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, you're

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.945
arguing you don't
like the decision.

00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:43.770
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.060
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
don't like the decision.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.250
You don't like-- but
the decision's there.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:53.130
AUDIENCE: What I'm trying to say
is that a CEO doing something

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.850
supposedly to improve
the company's position

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:02.190
is completely subjective,
because giving money

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.670
to candidate x might be
interpreted as I'm doing it

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.600
because I want him
to support this,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.040
which is good for my company.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.650
But then there are
whole other things

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.180
that you're doing
by doing, which

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.980
I think is more of
a negative publicity

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.870
than positive
publicity in the sense

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.120
that you're influencing
decision-making.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.430
Because it might be
that you're doing it

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.880
for him to support action
A. But for action B,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.230
you also have influence on him.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.480
And then that might
be that you don't

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.610
want Apple to have
influence on what

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.358
he decides on something else.

00:08:31.358 --> 00:08:33.900
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I've been
on the board of a company that

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.049
had one of these ordinary PACs.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.460
And the directors and
the officers chipped in,

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.630
and we made contributions.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.210
This was a company
located on Wall Street,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.950
and we were a regulated
company, a securities exchange.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.770
And we made contributions
to both New York senators

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.020
and to the congressmen
from Wall Street

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.320
so that they'd return our
phone calls basically.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.820
We're not going
to buy influence.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.000
If they're not concerned
about the fate of companies

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.120
on Wall Street, then
they're in a lot of trouble.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.030
But to basically
get your phone call

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.090
returned, you make a few
thousand dollar contribution.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.240
So that's different
from giving $10 million

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.720
to support Newt Gingrich.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.540
So Marie, you had a point,
or were you were waving?

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.595
AUDIENCE: No, sorry.

00:09:24.595 --> 00:09:26.775
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK, Jacob?

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
a question.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.410
Is it possible for an
international corporation

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.970
to contribute to an
American politician--

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.280
or like if it's an
American company with, say,

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.655
foreign executives
who are making

00:09:36.655 --> 00:09:38.905
the decision whether or not
appropriations [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:38.905 --> 00:09:40.428
giving money to a politician?

00:09:40.428 --> 00:09:45.360
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, if
they have a subsidiary that

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.310
is a US person.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.450
So if you have a subsidiary
that has a US charter,

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.120
then presumably,
that entity can.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.380
You can't make direct
contributions-- well, sorry.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.880
They can't make
direct contributions

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.780
to the candidate in any case.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.160
The question is, can you
contribute to a super PAC?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.040
A foreign corporation doesn't
have us rights of free speech.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.070
So I've never heard
it brought up,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.250
but I think it could be barred.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
question about

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.833
whether it should be done.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.770
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
I'd just set up a US company

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.270
if I wanted to do that.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.302
AUDIENCE: Yeah, in
which case could there

00:10:22.302 --> 00:10:24.640
be anti-American
interests that influence

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.640
[INAUDIBLE] politicians?

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.045
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yes, so I
actually found an interesting--

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.940
there's a foundation
called Sunlight Foundation.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.950
You can find them on the web.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.330
And they looked at who's
making these contributions.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:47.020
And in fact, you don't find any
publicly held contributions.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.010
I couldn't find any.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.500
Certainly no company
I'd ever heard of

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.430
is on the list for contributions
above $25,000. $20,000

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.410
actually was their cut.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.180
Lots of private corporations,
individuals, unions,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.680
partnerships.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.440
The only publicly traded
company I could find

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.280
is CONSOL, which is a coal
company as far as I can tell.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.820
I don't know them well.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.020
They gave $125,000
to a Romney PAC.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.400
And you have to
ask yourself, why?

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.280
I assume that's a
CEO who leans Romney

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.610
and whose board is
captive, which is not

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.620
unheard of-- that
the board is composed

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.940
of his friends or her friends.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.250
I don't know who the CEO is.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.990
So it's interesting that most
large corporations, Apple,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.960
et cetera, are not
playing this game,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.480
even though by law they can.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.710
I just find that interesting.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:52.690
And it has to do with what
they think their role as CEO is

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.380
and how they should behave.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.860
As I said, I could only find
one publicly traded company.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.540
There are a lot of so-and-so
family company contributes,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.190
and that's a family company.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.590
It's effectively a partnership.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.900
So not publicly traded.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.400
So--

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.870
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Which is?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.110
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.410
Yeah.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:16.860
Oh yeah.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? already that ?]

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.248
maybe all the companies don't
think Romney is going to win,

00:12:20.248 --> 00:12:22.730
so nobody's putting in
the money [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.980
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: There
is a lot of money going in.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.960
And what we don't see--

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.650
if you look at what finances
senatorial and congressional

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.520
campaigns, you will see
plain, old, ordinary PACs

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.220
contributing, like
the one I described,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.520
where I want to make sure
my phone call gets returned,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.500
and I want you to be sure that
you worry about wheat farmers--

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.950
so the wheat
Farmers Association.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:53.343
But it is interesting,
Obama has a PAC,

00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:55.260
but they're not sure
he's going to win either.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:02.240
So anyway, we'll come back to
the lobbying and contributions.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.480
It's more for access
than for votes I think.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.970
But, OK, yes, Stephen.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.700
AUDIENCE: Just a quick
question for that.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.075
You mentioned that there were
private companies that were

00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:13.650
still doing this type of stuff?

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.525
Could it be that some
of the public companies

00:13:15.525 --> 00:13:18.520
are going through those means
to make their donations?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.270
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I think-- and they've

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.760
talked about it that there
are some companies that

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.680
are dummy companies
that get set up.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.530
But mostly, it hides
rich individuals.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.470
So you can't follow
through from this website.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.170
But if you read
in the paper, they

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.240
talk about trying
to track down donors

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.160
and getting a post office box.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.330
So it's a company.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.680
It has a post office box.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.780
It's legally incorporated.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.660
Its documents aren't public
because it's closely held.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.160
So that's a mask behind which
some rich person is hiding.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.720
I don't think it would be a sane
thing for a big publicly traded

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.420
company to hide that
way, because if there

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.820
were enough money,
somebody will find it out.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.890
I mean, there's a lot.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.470
Somebody gives $1 million
and they're hiding,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.010
it's a good story if you
can figure out who it is.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.830
If it turns out to be
Apple, it's a scandal.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.720
So that's too risky.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.710
David?

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.960
AUDIENCE: Would it be possible
that some of the larger

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.010
companies, whose financial
contributions would

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.440
make a significant
impact on the campaign,

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.740
are companies that would
already have access anyway?

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.620
If Tim Cook called up the
White House and said, look,

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.410
we really need to talk to
someone in the treasury

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.840
or something, like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.340
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah, Apple
doesn't need to buy access.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.930
This mining company may.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.030
Backing Romney's not the
most obvious way to do it.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.390
So I assume that this is
just a personal preference

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.050
of somebody, and a board that
says, yeah, sure it's $125,000.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.660
Who cares?

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.160
We'll just cut your bonus.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:03.500
OK, it's an interesting issue
of the role of the corporation.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.010
But it's also interesting what
most of them choose to do.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.980
Let's go to upstate New
York and do formaldehyde.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:15.510
I just answered that question,
so we've lost that one.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.170
What's Darren's
issue in the case?

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.040
Matthew?

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:29.724
AUDIENCE: He's [INAUDIBLE] part
of [INAUDIBLE] [? opposing ?]

00:15:29.724 --> 00:15:32.958
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.250
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But what
problem is he addressing,

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.620
or what opportunities
is he addressing.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.190
What's the--

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:39.960
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
[? Other ways ?]

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.520
to heat their venting.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.890
A lot of steam.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.880
Anything else it does?

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.380
Scott?

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.730
AUDIENCE: Also, the steam
causes damage to the building,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.440
and it corrodes the
materials in the building.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.740
And it also causes an ice
sheet on the ground, which

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.330
is dangerous for employees.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Lovely stuff, lovely stuff.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.770
OK that's what he's got.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.370
He has three options
to deal with these

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.930
that he considers first of all.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.100
Do you recall what they are?

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.151
Rachel?

00:16:06.151 --> 00:16:08.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.175
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yes.

00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:13.333
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:15.500
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Lithium
bromide, bromine, yeah.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.800
Anybody got the third one?

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.300
[? Wyatt? ?]

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.450
AUDIENCE: Everyone [INAUDIBLE]
speed the flow of water

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.283
between [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:26.283 --> 00:16:28.117
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Speed the flow of water

00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:29.610
through, so it
just comes out hot,

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.220
it doesn't come out of steam.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.990
OK, why is he focused on
combined heat and power?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.590
Why is he focused
on co-generation?

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.310
What are the issues with
the others, of the advantage

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.830
of this in broad terms?

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.360
Kirsten?

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.914
AUDIENCE: The disadvantage
for speeding up

00:16:47.914 --> 00:16:50.910
the process of producing hot
water was that they didn't

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.160
have a good place to put
the hot water, especially

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:53.400
in the summer.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.930
They didn't want to just
dump it into the environment

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.800
because that might have
a detrimental effect

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.288
on the environment, [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:01.830
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And just
dump it in a cool stream, yeah.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.663
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so they
said, in the winter,

00:17:03.663 --> 00:17:05.550
they could heat the
buildings without using

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.335
too much electricity [INAUDIBLE]
going to be a problem.

00:17:08.335 --> 00:17:12.560
And [INAUDIBLE] was
that it would require

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.759
a lot more [INAUDIBLE] changes.

00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:17.480
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
OK, so we focused

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.160
on combined heat and power.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.795
Did anybody look at this?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.330
If it saves money, does it
save much money relative

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.680
to the firm's revenue--

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.165
to that plant's revenue?

00:17:34.165 --> 00:17:36.422
[? Obedah. ?]

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:41.990
AUDIENCE: In terms of, I
think, power [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.240
cleaning the water or treating
the water, so that they

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.590
can make it soft, because it's
usually hard, you save 75%.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.480
But that's only like
$10,000 or $8,000.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.865
But they make millions
upon millions of dollars.

00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:55.460
And savings are in the
low hundreds of thousands.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.710
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Low
hundreds of thousands, right.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.950
If you calculate--
there's a typo

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:06.230
in the case where it talks about
five days absence being 0.01%.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.010
It's, in fact, 1%.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.100
And if you use
the other numbers,

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.430
that plant has an annual
revenue of about $5.1 million

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.180
based on the production
numbers they give.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.680
You worked the
numbers, Veronica.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.330
Good.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.360
So what I get is
that the savings

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.990
would be maybe 2% of
revenue, the pre-tax savings,

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.700
to compare pre-tax to pre-tax.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.475
OK, so not a big deal.

00:18:31.475 --> 00:18:33.600
We're going to talk about
whether it's a good deal,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.230
and we're going to talk
about whether they'll do it.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:41.780
Let me just do a short
riff on combined heat

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.650
and power and waste energy.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.240
It's interesting, if
you look at the rejected

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.150
energy versus usable
energy by sector--

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.180
so this is waste.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.580
Transportation, 75% of what
goes in comes out as waste

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.110
energy, electric generation
just about a third,

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.850
and every place else about 20%.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.280
And you all know
the answer to that,

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.130
what form the waste takes, yes?

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:20.720
Waste energy is
usually heat, yeah.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:27.410
So, I mean, this one,
transportation's tough,

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:32.210
because cars are not all
that efficient really.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.960
But for public transportation,
this is a tough one.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.520
Residential and commercial,
an awful lot of the energy

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.120
is going into
heating and cooling.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.170
You can make it more
efficient of course,

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.240
but it's hard to capture.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.360
What's attractive
about industrial

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.020
and electricity is
you have high heat.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.670
You have large delta t.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.350
You have the ability to use a
big temperature differential.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.560
And that's the whole
combined heat and power

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.660
story, that there really
are two basic forms.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.070
And the case kind
of mentions it.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.060
The first is called
district heating, where

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.980
you take waste heat,
relatively low temperature,

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.210
from electric generation,
and you pipe it around

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.280
to heat buildings.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.710
The Danes did a lot of this.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.630
One of the readings
mentions that.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.820
It's also interesting, the
Soviets did a lot of it.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.720
It requires you to have
power plants relatively close

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.640
to offices or
factories or homes,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.380
so it's not the greatest thing.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.010
And of course, it makes more
sense in a cold climate.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.560
Using waste heat to heat
buildings in Arizona

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.600
is not necessarily a great deal.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.720
We put in subsidies in 1978--

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.570
we'll talk a little bit
about PURPA at some point,

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:05.060
that we're supposed to
encourage district heating.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.630
It didn't do much for a
variety of complicated reasons.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.300
It's generally acknowledged as
a good thing in lots of places,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.090
but we don't do very much
of it in this country

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.320
for a variety of reasons.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.460
The other is
electricity generation,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.830
and there are two versions.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.860
The first is basic
combined cycle gas turbine,

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.340
which is relatively recent--

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.500
I should be able
to date it, but I

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.250
can't, maybe the '70s, maybe
the '80s, generation technology.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.320
That's how people are
building efficient gas

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.300
plants these days.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:47.510
You run a combustion turbine
which has a hot exhaust.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.370
You recover the heat
from the hot exhaust,

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.660
which makes steam which
drives a steam turbine.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.470
Combined cycle, CC--
so you got two cycles

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.390
working and basically
two generation units.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.620
This is pulled off
a Siemens website.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.530
This can be a very
efficient technology.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.100
and it's the same notion
of capturing waste heat.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.860
All you mechanical engineers
more about this than I

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.890
do, but others may not.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.130
And this is the proposal.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.680
This is the kind of proposal--
this is pulled from the case.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.030
This is the kind of proposal
that our friend Darren

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.180
is considering.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.135
This shows a boiler, but
it has to do, as you know,

00:22:35.135 --> 00:22:37.820
with the heat from that
exothermic reaction that

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.190
makes formaldehyde.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:41.630
So this is what
he's considering.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.590
He's considering a simple
system that takes steam

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:49.250
to drive a turbine, generate
electricity for internal use,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.540
maybe for sale.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.810
You cool it down, you recycle,
it you pump it through.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:57.320
You will have to use
some water, but you'll

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.170
pull a lot of the water through.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.580
And the stuff that comes out
will be basically cooling

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.080
the condenser.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.630
So this is what he's got.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.450
There are a lot of benefits
of this kind of system

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.610
in general terms.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.673
You can reduce energy expenses.

00:23:18.673 --> 00:23:19.340
You could worry.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.680
It could avoid the risk
of varying energy prices,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.890
a lot of security, good
environmental benefits--

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.530
mom and apple pie.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:36.230
But the question that Darren
faces is, is it a good deal?

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:42.020
I want to mention two concepts
that the case kind of puts

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.010
forward and the spreadsheet puts
forward without defining them.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.570
And I'll talk
about them briefly.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:53.330
So if you've got a
vector of cash flows CT,

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.130
that's the net present value.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.950
You just discount
all the cash flows.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.910
The case talks about
the payback period.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:07.910
And the payback period
is the smallest time,

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.480
such that basically, you get
your initial investment back,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.810
assuming there's an initial
investment up front,

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.680
and then returns in
subsequent periods.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:27.230
You go out as far as you need to
recover the initial investment.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:34.070
This is a very old-fashioned way
of making investment decisions.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.650
And the problem with
it is stated there,

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.270
because it matters what
happens after that time.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.180
I tell you that you
invest $100 today,

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.250
you get $50 a year from now.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.540
$50 two years from now, the
payback period is two years.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.050
If that's all, that's
a terrible investment.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.020
You've just given me
your money for two years.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.520
What really matters is, OK,
what happens after that?

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.890
What happens after, and the
longer the payback, all else

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.890
equal, it may be the
[? worse ?] the investment.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.350
But you can have a really
terrible investment

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.840
with a short payback
period because it dies.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.990
So the case talks about it.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.960
I just want to caution
you, by any sort

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.900
of reasonable standard,
it's something

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.740
you want to look at perhaps,
because it may be a horseback

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.480
way of thinking about risk.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.480
After two years, we're
playing with house money,

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.980
because we've gotten
our money back.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.105
Andrew, you have a comment.

00:25:33.105 --> 00:25:36.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
when I was [INAUDIBLE],,

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.440
I assume that even though it's
not the best metric to make

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.320
a decision, you could
make a metric to see when

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.080
your customers are coming in
terms of if I have something

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.990
that has a payback period of
two and a payback period of 15

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:53.760
years, I just know that
I have high risk in terms

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.773
of when I get my money
back with the second one.

00:25:55.773 --> 00:25:57.690
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No,
I think that's right.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:01.140
But you also want to just look
at the nature of the risks.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.260
If I tell you it's a bond,
then you don't worry about it.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.320
If I tell you it's
a nuclear plant,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.220
OK, the nuclear plant
has a 20 year payback.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.680
But if it runs
for 40 years, it's

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.600
got a high net
present value you're

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.880
right to say, wait a minute
an awful lot can happen--

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.170
see Germany, see Japan.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.820
So maybe I don't
want to do that.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.910
But that's the main argument.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:32.700
The internal rate of return
is also sort of interesting.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.830
You can think about the net
present value as a polynomial.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.910
Well, it's a polynomial
in 1 over 1 plus r.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.800
And you can say, well, suppose--

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.690
we're doing this chalkless?

00:26:48.690 --> 00:27:03.390
Suppose that this is
the net present value,

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.400
and this is the discount rate.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.630
Then what you might
expect is that if you make

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.265
an upfront investment,
you get returns over time,

00:27:12.265 --> 00:27:13.890
the higher the discount
rate, the lower

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.720
the net present
value, this point

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.660
would be the internal
rate of return.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.090
Now, what's
interesting about that

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.150
is that when the
picture looks like that,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.330
you don't have to get too
fussy about the discount rate,

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.147
as long as it's below r star.

00:27:33.147 --> 00:27:34.230
That's what it's good for.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.750
It says, well, I know it's got
a positive net present value

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.380
back here.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.270
So if the discount rate's
somewhere in this range,

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.270
but I'm not sure
where it is, I know

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:50.660
enough to know the net
present value is positive.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:28:02.060
But the graph could
look like that.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.170
It could look like that if
[? at ?] the end of the period,

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.901
it is a nuclear reactor, and
we've got to clean it up.

00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:17.870
OK, then high discount rates
make that cleanup cost smaller

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.750
in present value terms.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.690
It's a polynomial, so the
number of sine changes

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.610
is related in ways I've
long since forgotten

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.210
to the number of real roots.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.935
If there's only one
sine change, you're only

00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:33.060
going to get one real root.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.960
But if you have negative returns
at the end, you can get two.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.520
I suppose you can
get more than two.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.300
The normal thing, and
that's what the slide says,

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.090
is to call the
smallest one r star.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.650
I think that's a little weird.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.860
The other thing
to keep in mind--

00:28:53.860 --> 00:29:07.090
again, if you just graph these,
you can say here's project A,

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:17.230
here's project B. A has a higher
internal rate of return than B.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.480
But for discount
rates back here, you'd

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.770
prefer B if you have to choose.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.450
If you have limited funds, they
have the same upfront cost.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.420
Your discount rate is in here.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.210
B has the higher net present
value, you'd pick it.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.150
So ranking by internal
rate of return

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.460
doesn't give you a
desirability measure.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.250
It just gives you some
confidence about--

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.890
it allows you to be uncertain
about the discount rate

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.670
and still make a judgment
about present value.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.470
OK, questions about those?

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.970
David?

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.678
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? talking about ?]

00:29:57.678 --> 00:30:01.046
the payback here, [INAUDIBLE]
value [INAUDIBLE]??

00:30:01.046 --> 00:30:02.934
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No.

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.530
Normally, that's how they do it.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:04.700
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.930
I don't worry about
interest rates.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.400
Don't give me that fancy stuff.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.400
When do I get my money out?

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.500
And you could see the problem.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.720
As I say, I could give you
a one year payback period.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.000
That's a lousy investment.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.690
That's pretty easy.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.160
Give me $100 today, I'll give
it back to you in a year.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.080
One year payback, fabulous.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.320
Not a good idea.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:32.030
So it's hard to imagine,
but you can read texts

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.300
in the '50s that are debating
the merits of payback

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.500
versus net present value.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.510
And you say, wait, how?

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.690
Anyway, what I want to do--
unless there are questions

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.660
about any of this, or general
questions about combined heat

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.885
and power, I want to
go to the spreadsheet.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.220
It didn't occur to me to ask,
because of course this is MIT,

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.280
but how many of you have
played with Excel before?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.070
Oh, good, that's what I thought.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.107
I feel so much better.

00:31:00.107 --> 00:31:01.190
All right, let's go there.

00:31:04.926 --> 00:31:06.510
That accords with my priors.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.870
All right, so there we
have the spreadsheet.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.790
Is that readable more
or less in the back?

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:24.770
OK, and let's walk through
a set of questions.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:28.070
Let's figure out how to walk
through a set of questions.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.350
Hiram, what's happening here?

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.152
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:31.152 --> 00:31:33.110
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's what you got to do?

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.880
Turn the side screen on?

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.660
All right.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:42.120
No.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.100
All right, this
works [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:50.670
Thank you.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:59.720
If you walk through this,
this illustrates my point

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.240
about depreciation.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:09.650
You get total savings, total
expenses, gross margin--

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.440
that is to say what does
this thing throw off

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.380
in terms of total
savings per year?

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.460
You can subtract depreciation
and get earnings before taxes

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.320
if you want to.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.820
But then you'll
notice what happens.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.500
They compute taxes and
they add back depreciation.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.540
It appears here and
it appears there.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.940
Depreciation is a game you
and your accountant play

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.310
with the tax people.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:41.500
So when calculating the after
tax in your pocket savings,

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.340
you have to say what
depreciation do I get to take.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.450
How does that affect my taxes?

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:49.930
That's it.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.550
That's it.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.610
If you get faster depreciation,
your income is lower

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:56.260
and your taxes are lower.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.000
Your income being
lower doesn't matter.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.852
Your taxes being lower does.

00:33:00.852 --> 00:33:03.420
Is that reasonably
straightforward?

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.580
Because you're going to
see this in later life,

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.290
I'll guarantee you.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.390
And it shouldn't be mysterious.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.630
It really is-- and it's
an accounting entity.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.670
You report it on taxes.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.340
Some companies use different
depreciation schedules

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.120
for taxes than for financial
reporting, which you're

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.270
allowed to do to some extent.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:29.610
OK, question, I talked
before about the difference

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.500
between doing
things in real terms

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.550
and doing things
in nominal terms.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:40.980
Assuming this is Darren, not
some Sloan student who wrote up

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.340
the case, what's Darren doing?

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.800
Is this a real analysis,
a nominal analysis?

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.700
Is he confused?

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.950
[INAUDIBLE] what do you think?

00:33:52.896 --> 00:33:54.538
AUDIENCE: I'm confused.

00:33:54.538 --> 00:33:55.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Huh?

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.910
AUDIENCE: I'm confused.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:57.650
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
You're confused.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:58.520
OK, say why.

00:34:05.408 --> 00:34:11.659
AUDIENCE: I don't [INAUDIBLE]
understand how [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:12.924
depreciation [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:12.924 --> 00:34:14.539
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: On what?

00:34:14.539 --> 00:34:17.780
AUDIENCE: I don't understand
how I will characterize it

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.440
as either [INAUDIBLE]
[? real ?] or inconsistent.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.960
Like, is this the nominal
what things should be,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.695
or a nominal like interest rate?

00:34:26.695 --> 00:34:28.070
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, what I

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.969
said last time was, if you want
to assume that prices don't

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:37.610
change, in this world,
where prices do change,

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:41.150
then you'd better use a
real discount rate that

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.070
measures purchasing power.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.780
If you want to use the kind of
rates you see in the market,

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.020
those rates are based
on people's expectations

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.409
about inflation.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:56.750
So you'd better build in
expectations about inflation.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.820
What people often do--

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:02.480
and it's a mistake, is to use
discount rates or interest

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.840
rates from the market and
assume prices don't change.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.135
So is he inconsistent like
that, or is he consistent?

00:35:11.135 --> 00:35:12.010
I'll give you a hint.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.035
A 10% real rate
would be amazing.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.190
That would be very, very high.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.900
Not amazing, it would be high.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.528
[? Mathoura? ?]

00:35:25.528 --> 00:35:28.432
AUDIENCE: [? I mean, ?]
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:28.432 --> 00:35:29.890
doing a nominal analysis

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.807
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Doing a nominal analysis,

00:35:31.807 --> 00:35:33.640
yeah, because he
builds in-- he has

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:40.240
explicit assumptions
about inflation,

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.010
and he's got an interest
rate that's 2003.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.560
That's a market rate in 2003.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.940
No reason you would know that.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.930
But you see the explicit
inflation numbers

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.220
at a fairly high interest rate.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.950
So he's doing a
nominal analysis.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:58.000
It looks consistent.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.190
Is there any defense
in the spreadsheet

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.550
or in the case as to the
choice of discount rate?

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600
Sarah?

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.058
AUDIENCE: I don't remember
there being a very specific one,

00:36:21.058 --> 00:36:23.854
but I'm assuming [INAUDIBLE]
comparable risky assets

00:36:23.854 --> 00:36:24.690
on the market.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.120
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.280
He didn't say it, though.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.290
There's no discussion of
where that 10% came from.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.560
After all of that
incomprehensible nonsense

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.360
last time about beta,
I was giving you

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.670
what you ought to do,
not what people often do.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.580
And clearly, what
he did here was

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.650
to take a horseback
reasonable rate.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.820
Let's say at 10%.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.290
That's pretty much in line
with cost of capital you see

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.750
and discount rates you see.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.440
You would like him
to have done more.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.900
This is not
necessarily an ideal.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.608
Are the inflation
assumptions reasonable?

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.900
Anybody react to those?

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.190
What do you think?

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:12.090
2% electricity, 2%
maintenance, 2% chemicals

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.230
to be added to the water.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:21.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
looking at interest rates

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.635
on a yearly basis I don't know.

00:37:22.635 --> 00:37:24.010
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I'm shocked.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:25.762
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:25.762 --> 00:37:26.795
[INAUDIBLE] shocked.

00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:28.670
I assumed that's what
people around here did.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:31.540
I certainly do.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.380
I mean, these are not
implausible numbers.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.810
I mean, if you look
historically at inflation rates,

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:45.320
they run in this country 1% 2
and 1/2% So 2% is reasonable.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.740
What you don't see
in this spreadsheet--

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.370
what you might like to see in
life is you might like to see,

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.810
well, does the choice
of discount rate matter?

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:57.920
You can check it easily.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.680
Enough we could put
another rate in.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.570
Do the inflation
assumptions matter?

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.580
Is the outcome
sensitive to these

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.660
things that don't
get defended much?

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.630
If you were doing this for
real, and it was your money,

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.160
you'd want to do that.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.720
You'd want to say,
OK, I'm not too

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.880
sure about those assumptions.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.260
Are they critical?

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.970
Do they drive the answer?

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:25.740
If they do, you'd
want to look harder.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.890
We don't see any of that.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:31.100
We may be missing a dozen
spreadsheets in the background,

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.000
but we don't see it here.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.290
OK, as you read the case where
are there risks on this sheet?

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.070
Jorge, anything here
that's not certain?

00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:00.290
You think it's all
pretty rock solid.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.190
Matthew?

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.850
AUDIENCE: I think something
that we didn't really bring up

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:09.360
is that the company [INAUDIBLE]
that the installation time took

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.576
much longer, or even a day
longer, [INAUDIBLE] production

00:39:13.576 --> 00:39:19.052
would set back the offset
of the cost [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:19.052 --> 00:39:21.510
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah, we
don't see the lost production

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:25.050
here, and there is
presumably some risk there.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:31.900
And that's related to the
installation cost for which we

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.740
have only an estimate.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.660
We don't have a guarantee.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.087
Rachel?

00:39:39.087 --> 00:39:41.045
AUDIENCE: Something that
[INAUDIBLE] jumped out

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:43.670
to me was that I'm assuming
that they did get that grant,

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.157
because there's been a lot of
policy talk about getting rid

00:39:46.157 --> 00:39:49.330
of them [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:50.830
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, I thought

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:55.600
that was pretty bold
to say, well, I know--

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.600
the text says we're
pretty sure we

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.050
can get this matching
grant for $172,500.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:06.530
So we'll just assume we get it.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.005
And there's no lost
production in here.

00:40:09.005 --> 00:40:09.505
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:09.505 --> 00:40:11.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
during that

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.100
time was much more
reasonable [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.315
I think nowadays it might
be much more difficult

00:40:16.315 --> 00:40:17.440
after the financial crisis.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.500
But before then, [INAUDIBLE]
leading up to 2007,

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.640
it wasn't very different
for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.660
I mean, comparably.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.090
If you-- I think
about [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.740
[? I'm ?] sure that argument
was probably fair for nowadays,

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.565
but not necessarily
the case back then.

00:40:30.565 --> 00:40:32.315
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
If I were a naysayer,

00:40:32.315 --> 00:40:34.740
I'd say, do you have
that in writing?

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.240
Do you have that grant?

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.720
That's big relative to
the whole upfront cost.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.240
And he didn't
quite mention that.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:43.740
Yeah.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.870
AUDIENCE: Really, I mean,
companies like Tesla

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:50.340
and Fisker Karma got like half
a billion dollar loans for their

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.810
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.870
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
but this is a New York State--

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.180
I don't know this
program, or I certainly

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.630
don't know what this
program looked like in 2003.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.240
All I know is that
the case said,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.620
can probably get the grant.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.190
I would say, gee, I'd really
like to know, how does this

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:14.370
look without getting the grant?

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.080
I mean, do we know
we're going to get it?

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.400
Suppose installation--
in fact the installation

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:26.380
cost, didn't they say $120,000,
$125,000, and he said,

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.010
I think we can get
it down to $100,000.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.090
Isn't that right?

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:32.550
Yeah, thank you.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:33.175
I need support.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:42.490
So anything else
that's uncertain here

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.300
that you might want to focus on?

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:46.230
Julian?

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.920
AUDIENCE: I don't
see any removal costs

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.522
on there [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:51.522 --> 00:41:52.980
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Removal costs?

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.110
You mean when you
scrap it at the end?

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:56.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's a good point.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:59.910
That's a good point.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:00.990
He doesn't talk about it.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.310
He runs it out for--

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.280
I forget how long
this spreadsheet runs.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.380
But he didn't talk about what--

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.580
presumably, you wouldn't
throw it all away,

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.780
since some of it's pipe.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.790
But maybe you would.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:21.630
I mean, it's a pipe with water,
so it should last pretty well.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.930
But the generator you'd have to
replace, and the turbine you'd

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.142
have to replace after a while.

00:42:27.142 --> 00:42:28.600
You're right,
there's none of that.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.210
But I guess you
could think about--

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:35.215
well, the question is,
is there a disposal cost?

00:42:35.215 --> 00:42:36.090
AUDIENCE: [? Yeah. ?]

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:36.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.040
The question isn't would
you have to replace that,

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.165
because you probably would.

00:42:39.165 --> 00:42:42.000
The question is, should there
be a negative number at the end?

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.980
Or could you sell it for scrap?

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:49.180
And he didn't mention
that anything else?

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.720
OK, do you like his
treatment of these risks?

00:42:55.055 --> 00:42:56.680
Darren is not our
favorite person here.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.250
Yes.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.650
AUDIENCE: Well, the
thing is, since we

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.515
don't know exactly how he came
up with that discount rate,

00:43:02.515 --> 00:43:05.440
then there's a possibility
that he's not really

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.990
accounting for the risks
and the cash flows.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.380
I mean, the discount
rate is low.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.980
But maybe he took
that into account

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:20.350
when he calculated the
risk premium associated

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.730
with his discount rate.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.140
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Maybe, but--

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.350
is this my next question?

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:27.850
Yes.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:33.950
Did he use pessimistic
figures, optimistic figures,

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:37.250
or more or less middle
of the road figures?

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.180
Pretty optimistic, yeah.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.920
Chad, you agree, optimistic?

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:55.700
OK, it's an interesting
presentational choice,

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.600
because Darren
knows all of this.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.620
And Darren could
just say, well, yeah,

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.870
I've been a little optimistic.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.040
But the 10% is high.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.630
This project looks so
good on his numbers

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:16.468
that the better strategy
would be to be pessimistic.

00:44:16.468 --> 00:44:18.760
So you could say, look, I
mean, I was very pessimistic,

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.000
and it still looked good.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.810
He didn't do that,
or he didn't explore.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:28.660
Again, if somebody shows you
one of these spreadsheets

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.380
in later life, or if when
you're working for McKinsey

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.440
they ask you to make
one, for heaven's sakes,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.970
think about the central case.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.560
Think about
variations around it.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.310
He didn't do that.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:40.720
He took the optimistic case.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.840
Kind of a surprise.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.230
I think what he
should have done is--

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.900
oops, let's get it up there.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.962
Yeah, he should have
been central to the road.

00:44:57.962 --> 00:44:58.920
Here's a beta question.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.450
So the discounting applies to
how do we value energy savings.

00:45:10.397 --> 00:45:11.980
Those energy savings
are going to tend

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:17.180
to be correlated with the
economy, against the economy,

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:17.920
not at all?

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.970
The energy savings,
probably two components.

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:27.940
One, what's the
production volume?

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:33.180
And let's take that as fixed
for the moment, because they do.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.180
You tend to run the thing flat
out unless things are terrible.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.660
And the electricity price--

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:42.320
which way is the electricity
price go with the economy?

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:42.820
Brendan.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.695
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? doesn't vary ?] much

00:45:44.695 --> 00:45:45.590
for the economy.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.840
I'd say that's more
[INAUDIBLE] energy in terms

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.040
of gasoline and stuff.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.913
That's more of a-- that varies
a lot more with economy, but--

00:45:51.913 --> 00:45:53.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
There's a lot more.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.390
But if you have
high demand, there's

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.800
going to be a supply curve.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.650
Particularly in New York, which
is a market-driven electricity

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:04.080
system, he'll be running
up a supply curve.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.675
So a little bit
with the economy.

00:46:05.675 --> 00:46:08.217
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wouldn't say
a very high beta [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:08.217 --> 00:46:09.550
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No, no, no.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:11.660
Not a very high beta,
but a positive beta.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.490
Yeah, so maybe-- yeah.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:17.270
AUDIENCE: But the thing is,
if he was using whatever

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:21.525
that he recovers for
generating more electricity,

00:46:21.525 --> 00:46:22.650
then maybe that's the case.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:26.630
But if is using heat
to sell to people,

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.508
then he can say that that's
something that's fairly--

00:46:29.508 --> 00:46:31.550
people wouldn't [INAUDIBLE]
[? vary by ?] prices.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:34.788
But maybe the economy-- people
will need that heat regardless.

00:46:34.788 --> 00:46:36.830
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But
what's on the table here

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.050
is generation.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.030
What's on the table is
generation, not heat.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.760
He doesn't have a scheme
to pipe the heat away.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.790
He has a scheme to use the
steam to run a turbine.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.520
So good point.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.880
It's cold in New York,
even in good years and bad.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.258
But the electricity price
is what's at issue here,

00:46:57.258 --> 00:46:58.300
the value of the savings.

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:09.360
So you could argue you should
use a somewhat higher discount

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.090
rate than the firms over--

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:15.210
than the cost of capital to
the firm as a whole, just

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:18.010
because there's a positive beta.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:19.260
We'd have to look at the firm.

00:47:22.178 --> 00:47:26.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I have no idea.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.237
Does anybody know anything
about the formaldehyde business?

00:47:32.237 --> 00:47:33.320
It's a very diverse group.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.760
No one does formaldehyde at all?

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.160
OK.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.460
I don't have a clue.

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:47.270
They wrote the case as if
you just ran the factory.

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:50.000
They didn't talk about
it being cyclical,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.970
and nobody talked about it
none of the naysayers talked

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.542
about much cyclicality.

00:47:54.542 --> 00:47:55.250
But I don't know.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.750
Brendan?

00:47:55.750 --> 00:48:00.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean,
I think people are still

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
[? Necessary ?] uses,

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:05.990
but it does have other uses,
which the case discussed and I

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:07.070
don't remember.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:11.960
But OK, what do you think of
the most important assumptions

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.953
in this spreadsheet?

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:21.680
Rachel, what do you think?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.990
Tough call, just
staring at it, yes?

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:34.480
You'd have to go and look at--

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.280
to answer that question--
and I raise it,

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.410
because that is really
the key question.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.370
If I'm a naysayer and he
gives me the spreadsheet,

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.980
I say, well what did you check?

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.960
How sensitive is this
to the discount rate,

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.140
to the electricity price, to
the electricity inflation?

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:53.050
How sensitive is it to
variations in the installation

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:53.920
cost?

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.190
Does it matter whether
or not you get the grant?

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:01.030
I can't tell here which
are the key assumptions,

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:03.240
but a little fiddling
with this can.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:03.740
Alex?

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.564
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't the grant be
the most important assumption

00:49:07.564 --> 00:49:09.320
because it's like half of your--

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It's
half the capital cost.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.650
If you go down, though, to his
net present value, you say,

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:18.700
well, that doesn't matter,
because it's $172,500,

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.770
and the net present
value is ginormous.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.170
So lose the grant.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:28.460
The question is,
what assumptions

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.390
would turn it negative?

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.050
And he didn't answer that

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:35.950
AUDIENCE: I mean,
if it saved less

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.010
than [INAUDIBLE] it would save.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:40.593
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, there
are a lot of things it'll do,

00:49:40.593 --> 00:49:43.790
but the question is
which are uncertain?

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.540
They describe the technology
as pretty vanilla.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.550
So I assume that was
not-- you're right.

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.350
That would do it.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:57.690
If you saved less [? if ?] the
electricity price collapsed,

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:00.280
if the discount rate
were much higher,

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.200
in fact for one
reason or another.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.920
I mean, you could add them up.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.840
I asked this question
not because I

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.680
expect you to be
able to answer it,

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.660
but because you always
have to ask that question.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.990
What's driving this answer?

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.700
What's driving this answer?

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.250
Finally, did anybody
see the mistake

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.985
in computing net present value?

00:50:25.985 --> 00:50:26.485
Sarah.

00:50:26.485 --> 00:50:28.765
AUDIENCE: He started in
column C instead of column B.

00:50:28.765 --> 00:50:29.890
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Bingo.

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.455
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? compare ?] savings,

00:50:32.455 --> 00:50:33.490
as opposed to cost.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:34.990
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
If you go here,

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:39.040
he takes the net
present value of--

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:44.590
it's C45, which is here.

00:50:47.432 --> 00:50:51.040
C45, which is the after
tax net cash flow,

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.310
that's the right
thing, all the way out.

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:56.615
But he forgot the initial cost.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:03.020
That's one of the most bizarre
mistakes I've ever seen.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.470
If you look, there's the
formula-- net present value

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.510
of all the savings.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:11.710
Well, what needs to
happen here, it's got to--

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:13.435
not available in protected view.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.648
Do I trust the
contents of the file?

00:51:17.648 --> 00:51:19.440
Of course I trust the
contents of the file.

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.090
We're all friends here.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.400
What he needs to--

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.530
I see, because I erased.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:31.575
What I need to do here is I need
to subtract the initial cost.

00:51:40.842 --> 00:51:42.550
That doesn't turn it
negative, but it did

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:45.470
make a significant difference.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:47.020
You see what he did.

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:51.280
It's one of these, you say OK.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.350
He took the after
tax net cash flow.

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:59.440
So he went down, added
the savings, added--

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.790
that's maintenance savings.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.790
You got savings on electricity,
maintenance, and chemicals,

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:08.660
which gets inflated.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.850
All these get inflated.

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:19.740
You'll see the inflation
rate coming in here,

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.570
coming in, coming in.

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:25.410
Adds them up, subtracts
the required maintenance,

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:30.700
gets the net, gets the
gross margin, so to speak,

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.820
subtracts depreciation to
get the impact on earnings.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.820
That would be the
increase in earnings.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:43.291
Gets the taxes, adds back
depreciation, does all that.

00:52:43.291 --> 00:52:45.280
Row 45 is the right row.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.730
Net present value, forgot
the initial investment cost.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:52.470
That's a bad move.

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:53.520
That's a bad move.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.330
OK, Darren, is not
doing real well here.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:03.350
Did anybody look at the payback
or the internal rate of return?

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:06.900
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:08.415
AUDIENCE: I just want go
back to the assumption.

00:53:08.415 --> 00:53:10.140
You're also assuming
that, for 10 years,

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:14.370
your production of formaldehyde
is going to stay the same.

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.940
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: He's
making that assumption.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.328
And we don't know
how sensible it

00:53:20.328 --> 00:53:22.870
is, because we don't know much
about the formaldehyde market.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.930
They say that they run
the plant 24 hours a day,

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:33.090
365 days a year, and it's a
highly automated facility.

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:35.460
And he's assuming
that will continue.

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.370
It's not clear what other
assumption you ought to make.

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:41.910
But you're right,
that's a key assumption.

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:45.540
If the plant shuts down
or goes to one shift,

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.601
those savings figures get cut.

00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:49.948
AUDIENCE: I meant the
actual science of it.

00:53:49.948 --> 00:53:50.990
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Huh?

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:52.532
AUDIENCE: I meant
the science-- like,

00:53:52.532 --> 00:53:55.070
if your delta e is less
and stuff like that.

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.278
Like if you have [INAUDIBLE]
less than [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:59.278 --> 00:54:01.070
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, you could do it.

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:03.320
I mean, if it's
proportional to throughput--

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.380
AUDIENCE: [? In ?] the case,
it specifically states that

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.630
the board mainly cares
about [? corruption of ?]

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:15.456
formaldehyde vis a vis
use of electricity.

00:54:15.456 --> 00:54:17.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I'm not sure I get it.

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:19.140
They mainly care
about formaldehyde,

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.553
and he's assuming
that we're just

00:54:21.553 --> 00:54:23.970
going to keep running it flat
out, because the board cares

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.320
about production.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.430
I mean, if the market dies or
if there's a plant problem, that

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:32.310
won't happen, and you just cut
the savings proportionately.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:36.330
Well, you'd cut the savings
on electricity and chemicals

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:37.050
proportionately.

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:40.210
I'd have to think
about maintenance.

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:45.830
Yeah, OK, internal
rate of return.

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.600
How did he do that?

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:52.640
It's ROA, and the
formula is up there.

00:54:55.332 --> 00:54:57.290
You could tell it's an
internal rate of return,

00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:00.530
because that's what
Excel calls the formula.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:04.760
And if you look at it, it's--

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.470
and 15% is an initial guess.

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:10.610
It's an iterative procedure.

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:18.920
It's B49 to R49, so it's
the internal rate of return

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.300
on the pre-tax cash flow.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.230
Why would you do that?

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:30.360
Why wouldn't you take into
account the effective taxes?

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.920
If you look at
that, that's weird.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.970
You should do it up
here, and we could do it.

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:37.720
I haven't.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:43.160
It's going to be significant,
but that's just strange.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.340
That's just strange.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.680
And just for humor,
you really have

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.605
to look at the formulas
in a spreadsheet.

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:58.390
He didn't actually compute the
payback per that slide I did.

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:01.240
You didn't actually see when
you get your money back.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:09.100
He went up here and took the
installed cost, divided it

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:13.540
by the C21 minus C29.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:27.740
Yeah, divided it by what amounts
to G30 at the C32 divided it

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:30.760
by the annual savings
in the first year.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:37.470
But the savings
differ year by year,

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:41.130
and he doesn't consider taxes.

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.050
So this is a
good-looking spreadsheet.

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:46.180
And what astonished me
when I looked at it was,

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:49.630
wait a minute, that's wrong,
that's wrong, that's wrong.

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:51.640
Otherwise, pretty good.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.310
Otherwise, pretty good.

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:56.920
Any questions about
the spreadsheet?

00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.030
OK, let's leave this.

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:03.760
No I don't.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.710
Let's go away.

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:06.760
And let's go back.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:20.550
I just put the spreadsheet
with the formulas in the notes.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:23.850
Those are the issues
we've talked about.

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:25.770
Now let's talk about--

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:28.680
let's see.

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.460
Let's talk about the naysayers.

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.270
So I'm guessing--

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:37.780
I haven't spent my life
doing this spreadsheet.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.890
But I'm guessing, if you run
through all of the things

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:45.070
that we've talked about, the
basic assumptions look OK.

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:53.130
The numbers, he's
too optimistic,

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:57.420
but his discount rate's
probably a little high.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:01.110
So I'm guessing that if
you fiddle and diddle,

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.720
you will come to the
conclusion that it does have

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.100
a positive net present value.

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:13.830
First objection-- you
are now Darren, folks.

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.920
First objection-- if it's
such a great idea, how

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.170
come nobody else is doing it?

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.930
And your answer is?

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:25.058
Obadiah, what do you say?

00:58:25.058 --> 00:58:26.350
You're going to just take that?

00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:27.520
You're not going
to just take that.

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.320
What's your answer?

00:58:32.568 --> 00:58:36.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:39.440
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Might be we're smart.

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.150
Might be this is a chance to
take a leadership position.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.650
Charlotte.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.983
AUDIENCE: It could be that
the reason they're doing this

00:58:44.983 --> 00:58:47.370
is because they do all that
excess heat and steam that's

00:58:47.370 --> 00:58:49.085
hurting their plant, and
maybe other people's plants

00:58:49.085 --> 00:58:51.668
are designed in a way that they
never had that problem before,

00:58:51.668 --> 00:58:53.628
so [INAUDIBLE] considered it.

00:58:53.628 --> 00:58:55.670
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Could
be, although it sounds

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:57.830
like a standard
problem the way they

00:58:57.830 --> 00:58:59.330
describe the basic reaction.

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.340
You just dump this stuff
in a vat and it gets hot.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:02.840
Martha?

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:07.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
have the same issue

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.542
with ice and [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:09.542 --> 00:59:11.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
They might not

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.220
have the same issue with ice.

00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.850
And the ice is
kind of a big deal.

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:15.710
You're right.

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:17.450
If you're in the
middle of the desert

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.460
and nobody can see you
venting a lot of steam,

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.720
you might just say--
of course, if you're

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.210
in the middle of the desert,
you may have a water problem.

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:26.090
[LAUGHS]

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.250
Actually, I think
my response would

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:30.817
be this is an opportunity
to show leadership.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.860
But let's try the next one.

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.350
What's your answer to that one?

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:44.420
This is what I got, is
I estimated the revenue.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.970
Yeah, yeah, I love
your net present value.

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:48.200
That's just swell.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.020
But there's a risk here.

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.250
There's always a risk here.

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:58.230
Yes, there's always a risk.

00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:59.580
We talked about outage.

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.170
We'll come back to outage.

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:03.480
But, I mean, it's 2% of revenue.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.790
You're going to make the
plant more complicated.

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:08.760
And if you're lucky,
we'll save 2% of revenue.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.160
Why should we do that?

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.270
It's going to be
lost in the noise

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:15.750
as production varies, as price
varies, as everything varies.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:19.750
Why should we
complicate our lives?

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:22.570
Now, these kinds
of things come up.

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:23.070
Sam.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:24.190
AUDIENCE: Well,
one, you could say

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:25.810
the whole-- you could play
the whole green angle,

01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:27.950
like as if it were to make
the environment better.

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:30.500
But also you could say,
like, in the future,

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.220
we don't know what's
going to happen

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.387
to the price of electricity.

01:00:32.387 --> 01:00:35.410
And if it rises, it's a good
insurance policy we have.

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:37.260
And also, you can
say the technology

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.500
that we're adding has a
pretty good track record.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.125
Like, it's not that complex.

01:00:42.125 --> 01:00:43.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, I mean, this

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:47.390
is not the first time this
contractor has ever done it.

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:51.310
So the risk doesn't sound
like it's that high.

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:54.070
2% is 2%.

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:54.610
Not bad.

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:55.730
Anybody else?

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:56.230
Ryan.

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.197
AUDIENCE: It's actually checking
the formaldehyde process,

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.030
so it's not complicating
it in that respect.

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:03.880
But there's also the safety
issue, and like we said,

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.570
the green issue, the safety
issue being the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:08.800
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.730
Got the safety issue.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:10.420
That's a risk.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.820
Boy, somebody slips
and falls on that ice,

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:19.060
and we get stuck with nice
negligence, big medical bills,

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.220
sympathetic plaintiff.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.340
It's really depressing.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:22.840
Scott.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.720
AUDIENCE: So I think if you look
at it in terms of percentage,

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.370
it doesn't sound like very much.

01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:29.050
Like saying [INAUDIBLE]
it's only 2%

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:31.300
of our revenue, that doesn't
sound very much at all.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:36.850
But if you say it's $300,000
we're saving, then while it may

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:38.320
be only a small
portion of revenue,

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:44.140
$300,000 is a large amount of
money to pretty much anyone.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.340
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: To
a $5 million operation?

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.200
I don't know, maybe.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:47.890
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:49.630
It's not trivial
in the absolute.

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:51.490
Anybody else?

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:52.420
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:55.630
AUDIENCE: They're also going
to use current employees

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:57.110
to run the same thing.

01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:01.465
So I presume their
salary would increase.

01:02:01.465 --> 01:02:03.730
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I
wouldn't want to presume that.

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:06.160
I'd say their job
satisfaction would

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.100
increase because it would make
their jobs more interesting.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.560
That's the pitch I'd use.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.820
And it's a good point.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:16.150
You might want to see if
you can get them behind it.

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.880
You might want to talk it up.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.795
So you could say,
well, I've talked up

01:02:20.795 --> 01:02:22.420
with the folks in
the factory, and they

01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:23.817
actually like the idea.

01:02:23.817 --> 01:02:24.400
[? Emerson? ?]

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] having
those same people [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:34.490
working [INAUDIBLE]
because they're

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:39.572
more familiar with the
[? cost is ?] [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:39.572 --> 01:02:41.210
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It helps, yeah.

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:42.440
These people know it.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.180
They want to keep
the plant running.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.420
We all want to keep
the plant running.

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.860
This actually is common.

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.110
I mean, these paraphrase
the objections in the case.

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.760
I've added a little bit
of what you always hear.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.960
This is another one.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.280
We can invest and
grow capacity, as

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.580
opposed to this
complicating investment,

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.680
and we want to
grow the business.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.770
You're not growing the business.

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:14.770
If we didn't have money,
well, then we wouldn't invest.

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:17.590
But if times are good and
we're selling this stuff,

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:20.230
we want to make more of it,
because that's how we grow.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:24.820
And your investment isn't
a growth investment.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:25.390
James.

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:28.437
AUDIENCE: Well maybe by selling
electricity and formaldehyde,

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:32.982
you're diversifying
both the [INAUDIBLE],,

01:03:32.982 --> 01:03:35.458
which is even safer, even
though [? it's not that much ?]

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:36.802
electricity.

01:03:36.802 --> 01:03:39.740
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So yeah, we're

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.650
reducing the risk of our
operation overall because

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.390
of this electricity hedge.

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:47.090
And that means growth is safer.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:48.320
You might try that.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.126
Yes.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:52.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
experience with the technology

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:54.770
that's more PR-friendly,
in the sense that you have

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:56.720
less [INAUDIBLE]
[? gas. ?] [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.610
it's easier to build
things where you

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:01.010
want to get less public outcry.

01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:03.625
And so that [INAUDIBLE]
to [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:03.625 --> 01:04:06.410
grow that in the future.

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:09.170
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, of course, except--

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:10.840
I mean, we are
making formaldehyde.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.380
We can't fake into flowers.

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.010
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:17.750
Yeah.

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:21.170
AUDIENCE: I think maybe
finding a better solution

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:27.380
to get rid of the steam could
allow you to increase capacity,

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.440
because if it's
just lying around,

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.930
there's probably a maximum
amount of formaldehyde

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:37.745
that you can produce and have
this [? thing ?] creating ice.

01:04:37.745 --> 01:04:39.870
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That's
an interesting thought.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:43.820
So you're saying we could only
do so much of this venting

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:45.800
and ice and so on.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.310
And that may someday
be a constraint on us.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:51.920
AUDIENCE: Yes, in finding
a better solution,

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:57.230
that maybe [INAUDIBLE] enable
them to expand it even more.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:59.005
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
OK, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:59.005 --> 01:05:01.770
AUDIENCE: So this process
saving money every year

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:05.290
can add [INAUDIBLE] to that
year investment [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:07.700
get your initial investment
back [INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.690
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Roughly year 3, yeah.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:10.380
Extra money.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
actually [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:14.698
capacity every year after that.

01:05:14.698 --> 01:05:16.240
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Oh, that's nice.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.890
That's nice if we play it right.

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:20.080
I mean, you get this stuff.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.640
You're getting this.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.130
They don't specify in the
case who he's talking to.

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:27.040
But presumably, this is
a middle management group

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.980
that passes on capital
spending requests.

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:35.380
So your response would be,
look, folks, if this plant is

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.710
more profitable--

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:38.740
which it will be,
we're going to be

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.915
able to use that to get more
investment money to expand.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.520
We don't necessarily get
to put it in our pocket

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.290
because it's all part
of the corporation,

01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:52.445
but it would be a
good justification.

01:05:52.445 --> 01:05:52.945
Andrew.

01:05:52.945 --> 01:05:56.980
AUDIENCE: What you could
be doing with the--

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:59.200
that's kind of a question.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.850
What you going be
doing with the money

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:03.780
you're using to build
this, [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.860
by your discount
rate essentially.

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.320
So we can just argue that--

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.288
I mean because it's kind
of an opportunity cost

01:06:10.288 --> 01:06:11.580
that they're mentioning, right?

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.642
I mean, instead of spending
the money to do this,

01:06:13.642 --> 01:06:15.100
you can spend to
grow the business.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.545
But then you can answer,
like, that's why I'm using--

01:06:17.545 --> 01:06:21.130
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It is,
except in most companies

01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:26.020
of any size, you basically do
a capital budgeting process.

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.550
We're going to invest x--

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:31.900
I mean, you
shouldn't, but you do.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.790
We're going to
invest x this year.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.490
Your job is to figure out
how best to invest it,

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:43.390
as opposed to saying anything
that has a positive net

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:45.850
present value, we'll
figure out how to fund it.

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:48.190
And if you a great project--

01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:53.200
and this is a way of just doing
a regular systematic budgeting

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:53.830
process.

01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:59.770
If you come up with a
great, big, big project,

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:01.600
then you go to top
management and you say,

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.300
I know this is over the
capital budget, but.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.060
But for little things like
this, and for this company,

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.270
this is probably a
relatively small project.

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:13.900
Darren doesn't have the
discretion to do it himself.

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.900
Routine things, he
probably has a limit.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:22.930
You have a spending limit
without approval of $20,000

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:24.190
maybe, maybe more.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:29.780
For anything above that,
up to some ceiling,

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.060
you got to clear it with
whatever this group is

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.340
that is full of skeptics.

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:38.570
Beyond that, the group has to
go and say to top management,

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:43.430
I know you only gave us $800,000
for the formaldehyde division.

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:47.510
But we have this great idea,
and we'd like to present it.

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:56.270
So it economizes is on top
management time to some extent.

01:07:56.270 --> 01:08:03.000
It also gives you an
orderly budgeting process,

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.250
so you can predict cash flows.

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:08.850
But it imposes this
kind of constraint.

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:11.790
I mean, capital
budgeting processes do.

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:14.029
At some point, somebody
sits in the room--

01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:16.029
you've got a good project,
I got a good project.

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:17.910
We don't have money for both.

01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:21.330
And they're not so good that
we can get money for both.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.939
We need to choose.

01:08:23.939 --> 01:08:27.533
And there is a tendency
to say we want to grow.

01:08:27.533 --> 01:08:28.200
We want to grow.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.010
That is an issue that
investments in efficiency

01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:35.895
and conservation
traditionally face

01:08:35.895 --> 01:08:37.520
because they're not
growth investments,

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.222
and people like growth.

01:08:39.222 --> 01:08:39.764
[? Obeida? ?]

01:08:39.764 --> 01:08:41.347
AUDIENCE: I also
[INAUDIBLE] mentioned

01:08:41.347 --> 01:08:43.319
this about the second
point, but it might

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.805
be 2% of revenue for one plant.

01:08:44.805 --> 01:08:46.305
But what if you
have several plants?

01:08:46.305 --> 01:08:46.805
[INAUDIBLE]

01:08:46.805 --> 01:08:48.680
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: If
it's like this plant,

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.110
it's 2% of revenue
for all plants, right.

01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:54.149
AUDIENCE: If you install the
system at a number of plants,

01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:56.040
you could easily
end up with revenue

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.075
like savings in the millions.

01:08:58.075 --> 01:09:00.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You could
end up with a good number.

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:03.689
It would still be 2% of
revenue probably on that order.

01:09:03.689 --> 01:09:04.550
OK, yeah.

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.460
Another way to do
that argument--

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:17.760
and it's a little variation on
the first one, would be, look,

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.740
guys, we can lead the
way for the company,

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.580
whatever this group is
that's approving the budget.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:27.240
If this works here, and we're
very confident it works,

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.090
we're going to get a lot
of points with the company,

01:09:30.090 --> 01:09:33.840
because we led the way
to 2% of revenue savings

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.329
in all of our
formaldehyde operations.

01:09:36.329 --> 01:09:38.590
Or maybe it's not 2% everywhere.

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:41.840
We've got to run the numbers.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.000
Electricity is
probably particularly

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.500
expensive in upstate New York.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.910
It would be cheaper in Ohio.

01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:49.850
But that's where
I'd go with that.

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:54.170
I wouldn't say 2% is--

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:57.050
2% is big if I multiply
it by a large number.

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:59.630
I would say it's
in our interest,

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:01.610
as the group sitting
around the table,

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:07.460
to demonstrate to the guys
up above that we can do this.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.210
OK, here's another one.

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:10.130
This is a killer.

01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:16.970
Our bonuses depend
on production.

01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:19.098
That's how we do it.

01:10:19.098 --> 01:10:21.140
And you're telling me it's
five days of downtime,

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:23.930
and we can recover from it.

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:26.270
But we don't know we
can recover from it.

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:30.320
You're putting my trip
to the Caribbean at risk,

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.480
and it's very cold in upstate
New York in the winter.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:36.470
I need that bonus.

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:39.730
This is a risk.

01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:41.190
What's your response, Casey?

01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:41.920
You look ready.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.530
You are ready on
this one, am I right?

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:45.600
AUDIENCE: Well,
first, they might

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.020
be able to switch their
production schedule to account

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.790
for take those
five days off then,

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:53.340
because they're not running
at full capacity all the time

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:53.995
anyway.

01:10:53.995 --> 01:10:55.620
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
The case leads you

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.920
to some optimism, yes.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.820
AUDIENCE: And then,
additionally, you

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.720
can just go back to the
[? handy ?] argument

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.790
that businesses need
to produce money,

01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:11.428
but they don't necessarily
need to maximize their funding.

01:11:11.428 --> 01:11:14.360
So we can do this [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.850
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
But this last point

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:19.540
isn't about the business.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.748
It's about my trip
to the Caribbean.

01:11:21.748 --> 01:11:24.500
[LAUGHS]

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.370
And I care about that.

01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:29.658
This one's tough.

01:11:29.658 --> 01:11:31.700
I don't mean to put you
particularly on the spot,

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.575
but this one's tough.

01:11:32.575 --> 01:11:37.490
If you've got the compensation
structure set in such a way

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:41.180
that it biases toward
growth and towards revenue,

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.890
this is a tough one.

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:43.418
Charlotte?

01:11:43.418 --> 01:11:44.960
AUDIENCE: You can--
back to the point

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.110
that we made on the
last objection, where

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:51.430
if you're the first plant to
start [INAUDIBLE] something

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:53.390
that saves your
company 2% in revenue,

01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:58.122
and adds other plants then
the heads of organization

01:11:58.122 --> 01:12:03.023
will look favorably on
you, and [INAUDIBLE]..

01:12:03.023 --> 01:12:04.940
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: We
can get a bigger bonus

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.760
if we can sell this.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.136
Tough argument.

01:12:09.136 --> 01:12:11.120
It's one you'd try, though.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:11.760
David.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.865
AUDIENCE: You would
get a promotion

01:12:13.865 --> 01:12:15.590
if you can
demonstrate initiative

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:17.060
among your scale of thinking.

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:20.690
Because if you don't do it,
and someone else implements it,

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:23.872
they might displace
you [INAUDIBLE]..

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It works for Darren.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:28.250
It might not work for the
guys one notch above Darren.

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.970
It might, though.

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.050
It might.

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:32.180
Look, if you guys
all get behind this,

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.430
we'll all ride up
the ladder together.

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:35.772
Martha.

01:12:35.772 --> 01:12:39.550
AUDIENCE: Going back to
what was said about how,

01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:41.090
after your investment
was returned,

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:42.890
you'll be continuing
to save money.

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:45.230
So your close may
be less this year,

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:47.506
but they do much
greater in future years,

01:12:47.506 --> 01:12:49.890
while they're able to start
expanding that growth,

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:51.390
and we're able to start--

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:53.910
so maybe instead of going
to the Caribbean this year,

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:57.030
you go to Vale or something.

01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:59.490
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:03.400
But five years down the road,
you can go to Jurassic Park.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.210
I don't know.

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:06.210
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Hey,
ski in the Adirondacks

01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:07.590
instead of skiing in Vermont.

01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:08.250
I don't know.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:11.550
OK, anybody else?

01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:12.050
OK.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.640
How about that?

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.160
The case talks about
all these policies.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.512
There's this killswitch problem.

01:13:24.512 --> 01:13:26.470
There are other policies
about interconnection.

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:28.640
They're still in flux.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.610
Maybe what we ought to
do-- it's a good idea.

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:31.750
OK, you've sold me.

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:33.290
It's a good idea.

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:37.170
Why don't we just wait?

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:38.550
Let's just let
this stuff settle.

01:13:44.615 --> 01:13:46.310
Maybe if we do it
now, we'll have

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:48.230
to take precautions
we wouldn't have

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:51.440
to take if they apply more
sensible policies down

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.780
the road.

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.280
David.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.260
AUDIENCE: You could argue
none of the competitors

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.640
are doing it now,
so doing it now

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.240
gives us a competitive
advantage versus in the future,

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.677
competitors are
already [INAUDIBLE]..

01:14:04.677 --> 01:14:06.010
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But we are.

01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:07.990
But suppose the policy
goes against us.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:11.020
Suppose instead of
making it easier

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.410
to interconnect that the
policy change makes it harder.

01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:17.560
It requires us to put on
more protective devices--

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.470
let's say $200,000 worth.

01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:22.210
And then, all of a sudden--

01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:24.910
that's extreme.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:30.550
But all of a sudden, the
policies we were counting on,

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.290
the ability to
sell excess power,

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:35.350
which is still in
flux at this point,

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:36.640
it turns out we can't sell it.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.540
Turns out we need to
have more protection.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.680
Maybe we should wait.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.040
Claudia, what do you say?

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.780
You sold up with the skeptics?

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:51.540
I mean, that's
not a crazy point.

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.330
No.

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:58.200
AUDIENCE: If it tends to
approach local regulators

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.330
directly and [INAUDIBLE]
make a point of [INAUDIBLE]..

01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:05.910
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, one
thing Darren might have done

01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:10.350
is he might have not
necessarily approached them.

01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:13.200
But he might try to
get a feel from, say,

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.460
his local representative.

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.000
A lot of this stuff is
going on at the state level.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.268
He's running a
pretty big operation.

01:15:20.268 --> 01:15:21.810
He's one of the
great polluters-- no,

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:24.900
one of the great
operations in the area.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.130
He might make a phone
call and say, look,

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:29.380
can you tell me where
this stuff stands?

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:32.970
I mean, is it going to get
resolved in six months,

01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:35.040
or is this a five-year
marathon and it'll

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.930
get changed every so often.

01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:37.650
That matters.

01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:40.260
If it's going to get resolved
in six months, let's wait.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:44.650
If it's going to be debated for
the next 10 years, why wait?

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:45.150
Ariana.

01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:46.590
AUDIENCE: I think
this is where it

01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:48.780
would have come in useful
for him to have made

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.690
a more pessimistic analysis.

01:15:51.690 --> 01:15:54.300
And so maybe you do that first.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.227
And then you say,
like, OK, well--

01:15:56.227 --> 01:15:57.810
because, I mean,
when we looked at it,

01:15:57.810 --> 01:15:59.952
it looked like, even if
some of the estimates

01:15:59.952 --> 01:16:01.410
were a little bit
more pessimistic,

01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:04.410
or you couldn't get the
grant that you wanted maybe,

01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:06.930
or you estimated it with
some of the policies

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.370
not falling your way.

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:11.370
And you could still-- maybe the
profit wouldn't be as large.

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:13.440
But in the long run,
it's still worth it.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.040
And you could come
and say like, look,

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.430
this is what I think
is going to happen.

01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:18.730
I mean, you never really know.

01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:20.460
And even if it goes
a little bit sour,

01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:22.930
like we still are making
some kind of profit.

01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:26.410
So it's worth it anyway.

01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:30.720
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK,
let me go to one last one.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.930
Who'd like to make
the elevator pitch?

01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:35.610
Is there a spin he
can put on this.

01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:39.690
So he walked in with
his spreadsheet.

01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:45.600
He got all these arguments, all
these nay-saying nitpickers.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.750
What do you stand up and say?

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.130
What do you stand up and say?

01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:52.297
Caroline, are you ready
with an elevator pitch here?

01:16:52.297 --> 01:16:54.210
You ready with a
one minute speech

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:57.330
to make the committee turn
around and charge out the door

01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:00.584
and go to the CEO and do it?

01:17:00.584 --> 01:17:03.783
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:03.783 --> 01:17:05.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Not quite ready, OK.

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.240
Anybody?

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.620
[? Albina, ?]
you're ready today?

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:09.370
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:10.710
that's good.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:11.710
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.793
I don't have an elevator
pitch, but I'm curious as

01:17:13.793 --> 01:17:16.420
to what the outcome was of
this case, because it's not

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.030
[INAUDIBLE].

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:18.550
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Let
me fish one more time

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:19.630
for an elevator pitch.

01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:22.930
And then I'll tell you what I
think happened, which is not

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.000
unrelated to that question.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.246
Max?

01:17:26.246 --> 01:17:28.704
AUDIENCE: You want to appeal
to the interests of the board,

01:17:28.704 --> 01:17:30.496
and their interest is
always the production

01:17:30.496 --> 01:17:31.610
and maximizing profits.

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:36.490
So emphasizing the fact that
this short-term investment will

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:40.600
save a lot of money in the
long run, which you can in turn

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.780
invest in greater production
in the future, which

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.190
will give them bigger bonuses.

01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:47.230
You can also appeal, I think--

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:50.380
it deals with a couple of points
to the safety of the workers

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.020
and to the integrity
of the whole plant.

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.740
In the article, it
talked about the ice

01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:56.740
being a hazard for the
workers and the corrosion

01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:01.008
of some of the structure of the
building [INAUDIBLE] as well.

01:18:01.008 --> 01:18:02.800
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
What I think happened,

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.040
and it's not unrelated, to that
my understanding-- and I've

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.850
tried to verify it and I'll
see if I can do it next time,

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:12.100
is that in fact,
when he presented it

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:15.820
to the review operation,
it was turned down

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:19.120
for all of those reasons.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.850
And he managed to get the ear,
one way or another, of the CEO,

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:29.930
and he pitched it as
industry leadership,

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:32.900
green public relations.

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.520
Economics are OK.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.755
Economics are pretty
good, so we're not

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:39.380
going to lose money
on this investment.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.920
But moreover, think about what
we can say to the community.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.960
Think about what we
can say to the workers.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.720
Think about what you can say
at the next industry convention

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.590
when you stand up and give
your leadership speech.

01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:52.553
We'll get benefits.

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:53.720
I mean, we're venting steam.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.845
It's not hurting anybody,
but it doesn't look good.

01:18:55.845 --> 01:18:57.510
It's got to look better.

01:18:57.510 --> 01:19:01.400
So he went around these
guys, is my understanding,

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.270
and pitched it as
an opportunity--

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:08.918
and not just an
economic opportunity.

01:19:08.918 --> 01:19:10.085
He overstated the economics.

01:19:10.085 --> 01:19:12.740
The economics are OK.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.080
But he pitched it
as an opportunity.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:21.410
And we'll see next week, and
we will see after the vacation,

01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:26.060
that whether you view something
as a threat or an opportunity

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:29.510
makes a lot of difference
as to how you act on it.

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:31.660
Thank you very much.

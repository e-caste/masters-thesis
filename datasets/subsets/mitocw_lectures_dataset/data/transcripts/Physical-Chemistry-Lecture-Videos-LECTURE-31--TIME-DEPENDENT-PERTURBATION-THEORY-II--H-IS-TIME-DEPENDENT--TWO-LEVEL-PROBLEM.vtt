ROBERT FIELD: My spies
tell me that there

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.800
was a good mood after the exam.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.430
And it was an exam
that was created

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.590
to show the power of intuition
and how you build intuition

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.610
based on stuff that
seems kind of ordinary.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.380
And all of a sudden
you have the power

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.300
to exercise chemical
insight in ways

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.730
which are more
than just textbook

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.510
ways of solving differential
equations, memorizing pictures,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.180
and so on.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.900
So this is my purpose, and
at the end of the course

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.990
I'm going to try to really
stretch your imagination.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.290
That's the probable schedule.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:23.870
And so I'm taking more
time with the lecture

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.480
on electronic
spectroscopy and dynamics

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.540
because this is really
the core of what I do

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.260
and what I care about.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.030
And so I don't know what I'm
going to say in this lecture.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.210
I want to spend some time
talking about Zewail's Nobel

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.020
Prize work, and certainly
that will be partly on Monday.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.220
Then, intermolecular
interactions

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.030
is basically why isn't
everything in the gas phase?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.950
You know everything
isn't in the gas phase,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.190
and this is the first step
towards not being in the gas

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.530
phase, kind of important.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.890
And then probably
photochemistry,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.979
which is a little bit more
of electronic spectroscopy

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.470
but in a different framework.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.400
Delta functions is
a way of dealing

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.270
with complicated potentials
without perturbation theory.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.310
And it's really neat
and it's very abstract,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.120
and it's called the discrete
variable representation,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.690
and it's a very powerful
way of approaching

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.080
complicated problems without
having to do a lot of algebra

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.700
because the computer
does all of it,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.480
but it does it in a funny way.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.320
And I've been putting
off this lecture

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.650
on time-dependent
Hamiltonians for a long time,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.610
and I hope that the last lecture
will be an honest approach

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.100
to time-dependent Hamiltonians.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.260
So this is kind
of a motto for me.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.960
Small is a template for large.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.970
If you really
understand everything

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.420
a diatomic molecule
can do, you're

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.410
prepared to understand most
of what big molecules do.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.690
And so this is sort of
a bottom-up approach.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.510
And what I presented
last time was

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.970
sort of a template
for everything

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.400
a diatomic molecule can do.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.050
You have a ground state,
and that dissociates

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.550
the ground-state atoms.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.500
You have a repulsive state.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.510
Now it's not always
just two states,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.220
but for H2+ or for H2 we sort of
expect this sort of structure.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.840
And then there
are excited states

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.600
which are usually less bound
than the ground states.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.500
So they have smaller rotational
constants, larger internuclear

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.760
distance.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.840
And if they don't, there's
a good reason for it

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.750
which you're supposed
to be able to produce.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.740
Now the repulsive
states often cross

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.390
through a bound state, and
this results in what we

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.040
call predissociation.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.910
In other words, it happens
before it was intended to.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.279
And it also is an
example for all sorts

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.050
of interesting
effects associated

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.230
with this curve crossing.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.290
And we'll talk more about that.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.530
And so predissociation
and autoionization,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.800
these are dynamical
effects that occur as you

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.750
approach some special limit.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.600
Now this is you're above
the dissociation limit,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.500
so it could happen.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.680
But as far as this data
is concerned, you're not,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.480
and so it happens earlier.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.740
Now here you have ionization.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.450
And below the ionization there's
a whole infinite manifold

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.000
of Rydberg states
which look almost

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.330
identical to the potential
energy curve for the ion.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.200
And there's all sorts
of stuff that you

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.760
can understand about the
electron-ion interaction

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.080
by studying Rydberg states.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.530
And that's been, for the
last 20 years, roughly half

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.155
of my research.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.100
Now encoded in Rydberg
states is autoionization.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.580
If you have a vibrational
level of a Rydberg state

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.640
which lies above the
ionization limit, well,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.980
then it can ionize, and
that's interesting too.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.610
So this is a very quick summary
of what I talked about before,

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.450
and I want to add to that.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.970
So in order for a
transition to occur,

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.430
you either need a permanent
dipole moment, a dipole moment

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.620
derivative with respect to
the displacement coordinate,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.810
or an electronic transition.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.720
So this is the rule.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.290
This is what you need for a
pure rotation transition which

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.270
is looked at in the microwave.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.220
This is what you need for
a vibrational transition.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.040
The dipole moment has to
depend on displacement

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.280
from equilibrium for
one of the coordinates.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.990
If it's a diatomic,
there's only one.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.560
If it's a polyatomic,
there's 3n minus 6.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.420
And so these two things
are very important.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.480
And then the electronic
transition moment,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.760
you can always have
transitions where

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.910
you promote an electron
from the ground state

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.640
to an excited state.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.780
But since the operator is
a one-electron operator,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.010
the strong transitions
are a very small subset

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.240
of all the possible ones.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.500
And one of the important
things for dealing

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.430
with electronic transitions is
the Franck-Condon principle.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.460
The Franck-Condon
principle is basically

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.830
a restatement of the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.620
that the electrons move
fast, nuclei move slowly.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:32.540
And as a result, delta R
equals 0, delta P equals 0.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.970
Now I'm using
capital letters just

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.350
to mean all of the coordinates.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.710
And this is what we call
a vertical transition.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:48.790
And delta P equals 0
is stationary phase.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.610
Now I like stationary phase.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.390
You have integrals of
oscillating functions,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.320
and you're integrating
usually over all space.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.010
But the integral accumulates
to its final value

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:10.160
in a very small region of
space, and that region of space

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.050
corresponds to where the momenta
on the upper and lower states,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.940
or whatever you're
looking at, where

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.510
the momentum are the same.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:26.280
And this enables you to use
classical insights because

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.120
instead of having quantum
mechanics where you're thinking

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.650
about wave functions
and thinking like I've

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.140
got an integral to do and
I can't say anything simple

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.610
about it, but if you know
that the integral accumulates

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:47.630
in a particular geometry,
then you can even estimate it.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.590
You know what determines
how big that integral is.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.420
And this is almost
always neglected

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.580
in talking about the
Franck-Condon principle,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.110
but it's a very important
part, especially for me,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.680
because I want to find
out simple things,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.210
and the simple things are always
in simple places in state space

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.986
or in coordinate space.

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:12.735
And then there's the
Franck-Condon factor.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.700
The Franck-Condon factor
is something you calculate.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.160
If you know the potential or
you have a reasonable estimate

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.620
of the shape of a
potential, you can

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.020
calculate all the
vibrational wave functions

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.930
in that potential.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.600
Not a big deal.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.770
I haven't taught
you how to do it.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.910
I will talk about it in
573, but that's next year,

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.660
and that's a different
life for most of you.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:49.150
But you can calculate the
vibrational wave functions.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.000
And the Franck-Condon
factor is the square

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
of the overlap between
the vibrational wave

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.710
function for the initial
state and the final state.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:04.260
So principle, factor,
big difference.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.470
We want ideas.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.990
Franck-Condon factors
are numerical.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.210
We want to know what's behind
the Franck-Condon factors,

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.030
and the Franck-Condon
principle and stationary phase

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.850
is what's behind it.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.360
And so you're now
charged with being

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.130
able to understand
everything that

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.870
happens in electronic
transitions guided by this very

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.810
important principle, which
is really relegated only

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.786
to calculating Franck-Condon
factors, which is just

00:10:38.786 --> 00:10:41.160
something you do as opposed
to something you think about.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:52.190
So that was kind of a summary
of what we did last time.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:04.980
So we can have an
electronic band system.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.480
So that's a transition
between two electronic states,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.370
and these electronic states
have vibrational levels,

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.930
and the vibrational levels
have rotation levels.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.320
And so it depends
on how deep you

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:24.110
want to go into understanding
electronic transitions

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.470
but what are the questions
we want to answer?

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:32.470
When we record a spectrum,
we record a spectrum

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.660
not just to publish a paper
or to fulfill an assignment

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.620
but to ask questions, and
so what do we want to know?

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:46.140
And there's how questions
and why questions.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.807
How is a particular
excited state

00:11:49.807 --> 00:11:51.140
different from the ground state?

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.790
This means excited state.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:03.800
This means ground state.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.719
Spectroscopists
use that notation.

00:12:05.719 --> 00:12:07.760
People who don't know
anything about spectroscopy

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.330
use whatever notation they feel
like, and that's really stupid.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.420
But anyway, that's a
different sort of thing.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.670
And so how are states different?

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.230
Well, they have different
equilibrium geometries.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.920
They have different
vibrational frequencies.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.720
They have different energies.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.450
It's a transition between states
pretty far apart in energy.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.840
There's permanent dipole moment.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.820
There's transition
dipole moments.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.350
There's radiative lifetimes.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.410
There's all sorts of things
that are distinct from one

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.510
electronic state to another.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.970
And so this is how they're
different, but then why?

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.760
This is much more interesting,
but you do this in order

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.670
to start asking why.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:13:00.260
And so you already have
qualitative electronic

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:07.450
structure stuff like LCAO, MO.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.570
Now you could calculate
things really accurately,

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.050
but you wouldn't be
using your brain,

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:18.430
and this is MIT for God's sake.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:23.560
You do want to use your brain
to explain why one state is

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.210
different from
another, and there's

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.070
all sorts of
qualitative theories

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.460
that are your guide or your
framework for doing this.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.490
And LCAO-MO, Huckel
theory, these

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.060
are the kinds of things
that you can use.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:45.605
And we also have ideas
about orbitals, bonding.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.440
So we have orbitals that
are bonding, nonbinding,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.370
antibonding, and we
know this by drawing

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.610
a molecular orbital diagram.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.700
And we know the
properties of what

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:06.480
happens when you have bonding
and antibonding orbitals.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.217
We have hybridization.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:22.230
So a tremendous amount is gained
by asking for a carbon atom,

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:28.920
and for many other atoms,
what is the spn hybridization?

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.950
We make a special
set of orbitals

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:38.130
which focus on the
structure around each atom.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:45.570
And again, you can be guided by
what you know from the spectrum

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.930
or what you know from
simple rules to saying, OK,

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.200
if we have this
hybridization, there

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.300
is a certain geometry
around that atom.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.730
Or if we have that
geometry or if it's

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.610
constrained to
have that geometry,

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.490
it will have this hybridization.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.860
And we haven't talked
about this very much,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.770
but it's a very important part
of understanding chemistry.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.040
And then we have these
things where we--

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.510
so we look at
families of molecules

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.820
where you have the same
number of electrons.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.300
And that was on the exam,
and it's really beautiful

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.940
how you can say,
OK, even though we

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.810
have the same
number of electrons,

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:39.000
if we change the difference
in ionization energy

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.430
between the two atoms,
terrible things happen

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.250
or wonderful, beautiful
things happen.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.450
It depends on what you like.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:50.520
And homologous is just the same
number of valence electrons

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.160
but from different rows
of the periodic table,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.030
and you had that
on the exam too.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.430
These are the tricks we use.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.925
And then there's dynamics.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.545
And some people might say we
study structure so that we

00:16:09.545 --> 00:16:10.545
can understand dynamics.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.300
I'm not quite there yet,
but dynamics is interesting

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.220
because it's harder
than structure.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.570
You have a static structure.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.830
The spectrum is telling
you what that is.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.710
But it's also
telling you, if you

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.680
look at it the right way,
what the molecule can

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.870
do when it gets excited.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:40.280
And I frequently start my talks
with two slides, one called

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.700
molecules at play where the
molecules are in the ground

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.850
state, and they're not doing
anything interesting, and then

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.040
molecules at work where
molecules are highly excited

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.230
and doing what they're
supposed to do.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.230
And our job is really
not to understand play.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.210
Let them do what
they want, but we'd

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.100
like to understand
when they're working

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.630
and how do we work with them?

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.560
So dynamics is really
that kind of a question.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.700
There's all sorts of
kinds of dynamics.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.869
There's dissociation.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.819
There's ionization.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.150
There's Born-Oppenheimer
breakdown.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:28.119
And you probably notice these
letters, and that's what I do.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:33.465
I'm known for being a specialist
in Born-Oppenheimer breakdown.

00:17:33.465 --> 00:17:35.870
It appears in many
different ways.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.400
And so there's predissociation.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.280
There's autoionization.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.940
There's avoided crossings.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:59.405
And there's adiabtic
versus diabatic.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.940
So these two things are
really different sides

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.200
of the same coin.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.965
Suppose you have two
potential curves that cross.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.520
Well, this is what we think
about as chemists where

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.490
a potential curve
corresponds to following

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.730
the energy without really
significantly changing

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.770
the electronic structure.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.130
And so these crossing curves
are what we call diabatic.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.950
But if you're a quantum
chemistry, what you would do

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.040
is you would calculate
the adiabatic curves,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.392
and they would look like that.

00:18:43.392 --> 00:18:44.100
They don't cross.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.400
And so we have two
ways of looking

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.190
at the interaction between
two electronic states,

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.060
the adiabatic one
and the diabatic one,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.150
and we use whichever
one is simpler

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.930
for the particular case.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.330
And at some point
later in this lecture

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.184
I hope to talk about a
thing called Landau-Zener.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:22.090
And it basically is
suppose you're driving

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:30.530
at night on a very curvy road.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:35.420
And you're mostly awake,
but you're driving too fast.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.230
And so if you have a
situation like this

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.730
where there's a sharp curve,
and maybe if you're lucky

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.430
there is another sharp curve
on another road somewhere

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.320
over here.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.770
You're going too fast.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.811
You're going to go off
the road, and maybe you'll

00:19:50.811 --> 00:19:56.060
end up on this other road or
you'll end up hitting a tree.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.560
So if you're going fast, you're
going to jump off the curve.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.120
That's diabatic.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.710
And that's the point of
view we take as chemists.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.480
And if you're going
really slowly,

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.610
you'll stay on the road.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.412
You won't even remember
this intersection

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:14.620
because you didn't die at it.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.730
And that's adiabatic.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:25.920
And depending on the
gap and the curvature

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.470
for a particular
situation, the molecule

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.090
knows how to either
do this or do that.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.980
And it's not fatal
for the molecule,

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.270
but if the molecule is going
through a curve-crossing region

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:42.610
fast, it's going
to jump the gap.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:46.510
And that's one of the things
that Zewail looked at.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:52.650
If you can start
a system at energy

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.930
high above the energy
where the curves cross,

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.670
you're going
through really fast.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.730
If you excite it really close
to the energy of the curve

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.670
crossing, you're
going through slowly.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.400
And so by changing
the conditions,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.560
you can understand
what's going to happen.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.360
This is really
powerful for insight.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.320
What I'm trying to
convey is that there

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.950
are very simple pictures
to describe really

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.330
complicated-looking things.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.610
And sometimes the data on
these complicated things

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:38.770
are very hard to either
obtain or to interpret

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.890
because it looks--

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.620
well, often it looks--
what would people say?

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.560
It looks statistical.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:55.120
Now statistical is
really a cop out.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.670
It says, I don't understand
what's going on here,

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.192
and so I'll approach it
as if there isn't any law.

00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:03.810
And we just count the
density of states,

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.670
and we'd use simple formulas.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:10.830
And the shameful thing is
that that usually works,

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.450
but it only works so far.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.920
It doesn't lead to insight.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.710
It just leads to
a representation,

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:21.810
and our job is to understand,
not just to represent.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:33.460
So back to this question
of electronic transitions

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.260
and the Franck-Condon principle.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.550
So if we have a transition
between two potential curves

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.120
that have the same
geometry, we get a delta v

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.080
equals 0 propensity rule.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.800
It has good and bad sides.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.420
One is the spectrum gets to
be really simple because you

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:03.020
only see transitions between
the same vibrational quantum

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.490
upstairs and downstairs.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.820
And this is true for polyatomic
and diatomics as well.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.010
You get a simple spectrum
and you say, oh crap, I

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.000
can go home early.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.870
But you don't know anything
about other vibrational levels,

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:23.750
and if you're starting
in the zero vibrational

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.740
level of the ground
state, well, you only

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.040
know about the zero vibrational
level of the excited

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.300
state if the potential
cures are the same,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.510
and there's all sorts
of stuff you don't know.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.510
And if you're doing
emission, well, maybe

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.910
in an emission spectrum you
excite more vibrational levels.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.600
But what's going to happen is
if they're all have the same--

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.350
if the potential
curves are the same,

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.240
well, then all the
vibrational transitions

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.120
are going to be on top of
each other in emission,

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.380
and you might as well
not have bothered.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.020
It's just a horrible situation.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.600
So delta v equals 0 depends
on what your point of view is.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.570
If you want to understand
things, this is bad.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.940
And then you can have
transitions between states

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.730
which have different
shapes or displaced,

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.600
and the Franck-Condon
calculation

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.390
tells you how this works.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:24.460
But here you have
delta v equals many.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.320
But now for a
polyatomic molecule

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:40.490
where you have n atoms, you
have 3n minus 6 normal modes.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.920
And some of them are going to
be like this, and some of them

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.590
are going to be like this.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.120
And that's good and bad
because what it's saying is,

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.220
yeah, you could have had a
really complicated spectrum

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.320
because there's so
many vibrational--

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.580
I mean, for example, benzene
has 30 vibrational levels, 30

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.130
vibrational modes--

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:09.920
not 1 but 30, and some of them
have relatively low frequency.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.620
And benzene for most of
you is a simple molecule.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.700
For me, it's really
just beyond complex.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.990
And what happens when you have
a lot of vibrational levels

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:24.110
is the vibrational density
states gets very high, very

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.920
fast, so high that it's
hopeless to be able to resolve

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.370
the individual eigenstates.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.060
When that happens, frequency
domain spectroscopy

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.680
stops being so useful because
a lot of the key details

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.040
are hidden.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.350
So if it's not frequency domain,
it wants to be time domain,

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.620
and you can ask
really good questions

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.630
using time-domain
techniques, which

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.750
is what I'm going to talk about
when I spend some time with Mr.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.250
Zewail.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.460
So you're going to have
certain normal modes which

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:10.970
are what we call Franck-Condon
dark because they don't

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.380
contribute to the spectrum.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.370
You only see delta
v of 0 for modes.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:22.020
And the ones that lead
to a change in geometry

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.440
or a change in bond structure,
those are the ones you see.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.930
Those are the
Franck-Condon bright ones,

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:32.100
and they're also much more
interesting because why

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.510
did the geometry change?

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.520
What part of the
molecule was responsible

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.380
for the geometry change?

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.990
This is what
chemists want to ask.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.130
So that's the framework.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:53.920
Now, I've spent the last
30 years of my life looking

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.840
at the acetylene molecule.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.490
Acetylene, for me, it's
as big as I want to get,

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:10.240
but for most of you that's
really, really small.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.620
And acetylene has
ground state which

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.930
we can denote by a zero
here, s0, lowest singlet.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.480
If we had a different
number of electrons

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.820
we might say-- if we had
an odd number of electrons,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.510
the lowest state
would be D0 or T0

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:33.960
if it had a triplet
ground state like oxygen.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.005
The notation is simple.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.450
But we also use--

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:46.720
spectroscopists use notation
where we use a Roman capital

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.000
letter with a tilde over
it for polyatomic molecules

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.480
and not for diatomics,
and the electronic state,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.330
the ground state is this.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:05.140
And have to be careful
because the notation

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:11.180
that organic chemists would
use for acetylene is just this.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.700
And my point is I want to talk
about where the hydrogens are.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.240
And so this is kind
of a cheat because it

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.790
sounds like I put a
hydrogen on a butene

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.480
because you have carbon
here, these bonds.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.380
OK, you know the [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:35.100
And then there's an excited
state which we could call S1.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.600
And the excited state
looks like this.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.910
It's trans bent.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.960
This has a triple bond.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.884
This has a double bond.

00:28:47.884 --> 00:28:49.528
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:49.528 --> 00:28:50.319
ROBERT FIELD: What?

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:51.780
AUDIENCE: There's
also [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.030
ROBERT FIELD: Yes, there's a--

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.690
you know about this paper here.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.820
But the lowest equilibrium
geometry for the excited state

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.040
is trans bent.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.400
You can have this
structure too, and we

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.000
have looked at the
isomerization between these two,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.220
and how did we do that?

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.420
How did we characterize
the transition state

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.070
for the isomerization?

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:30.690
This is 20, 30 person years of
work getting to the transition

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.670
state, and it led to
a paper in Science,

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:37.590
my first in 40 years of trying.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.750
And so this is a
molecule I really

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:46.100
like because there
are four modes which

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.600
are Franck-Condon dark and two
that are Franck-Condon bright.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.565
And we can do all sorts
of really neat things.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:09.090
So in the ground state at
high vibrational excitation,

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.572
what do we expect?

00:30:10.572 --> 00:30:12.030
Well, one thing is
nothing special.

00:30:16.431 --> 00:30:21.040
Well, the molecule could just
go on doing nothing interesting,

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.030
having four modes which are
Franck-Condon dark and two

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.150
modes that are
Franck-Condon bright.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:31.870
It will remain boring.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:43.170
And another would be just
increasing complexity

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:47.760
because there can be
anharmonic interactions

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.450
between different normal modes.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:56.970
And so when that starts to
happen people start to say,

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.060
let me out of here.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.730
It gets complicated, and
everything gets destroyed,

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.810
and the spectrum just
becomes uninterpretable,

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.690
which is wrong.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:12.210
And then there is chaos
which is another way--

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.130
or quantum chaos--
which is another way

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.480
of waving your hands and
saying it's statistical.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.650
And we know my
opinion about that

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.340
because bonds are really
sacred in chemistry

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:28.500
and if there are bonds, there
isn't bag of atoms behavior.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.670
And then there's other
possibility, isomerization.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:49.930
So this guy at high exaltation
can go to that vinylidene.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.990
And I spent a hundred person
years chasing after this.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:32:01.670
So there is a very
shallow vinylidene well,

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.840
and how is this kind
of isomerization

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.060
encoded in the spectrum?

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.830
So in order to have a chance of
understanding about vinylidene

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.420
or things that
happen in the ground

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.860
state at very high excitation,
I invented a fairly important

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.550
method for looking at
high vibrational levels.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:34.765
It's called stimulated
emission pumping,

00:32:34.765 --> 00:32:36.890
and it looks like this.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.770
So we have two--

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.890
now this initially
was demonstrated

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.040
on a diatomic molecule,
but its true importance

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.230
is for something like acetylene.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:33:03.300
So what happens is you can
excite to this distorted

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:09.720
molecule from the ground state,
and some vibrational levels

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.510
are accessible because you
have a little bit of room

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.580
between two turning points.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.160
So you can excite a
few vibrational levels

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.800
by vertical transitions.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.560
But the important thing is
that each vibrational level

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.590
has an inner turning point,
which is how you access it,

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:30.480
and an outer turning point,
which enables you to do--

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.540
so this is called the pump,
and this is called the dump.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.700
Now I'm not sure whether
I came up with pump

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.510
and dump before it was
talked about on Wall Street,

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:47.390
but it was a very apt name for
stimulated emission pumping.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.780
And so what we can
do then is to access

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.440
very high vibrational levels
in the electronic ground state

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.750
by pump and dump.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.060
And the way we detect it
is we get fluorescence

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.170
from this level.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.150
And when we hit the
dump transition,

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.850
the fluorescences
decrease in intensity.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.480
And we can do a
very significant map

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.170
of what's going on at high
excitation in the ground state.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:17.824
And when I invented SEP, I
believed in quantum chaos.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:25.940
So I expected as we went
up higher and higher

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:30.310
we would see breaking of
all the usual patterns.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.960
And I even wrote
a paper saying we

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.010
had seen quantum chaos
when we excited to very

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.480
high vibrational levels.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.719
And the reasoning for
that is complicated,

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:45.969
but the reasoning
was correct except it

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.170
didn't apply to chaos.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.650
It just applied to the spectrum
getting complicated, really

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.170
complicated.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.520
So what I really
wanted to be able to do

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:02.340
was to be able to somehow
sample this transition state.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:09.420
And that experiment
in its initial form

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:16.710
was doomed to fail because
this transition state involves

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:17.980
a local bend.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:23.430
In other words, acetylene
has normal modes, suspend,

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.280
trans bend, CH
symmetric stretch,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.630
CH antisymmetric
stretch, and CC stretch.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:36.700
And this coordinate
is mostly just that,

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.600
a large-amplitude local band.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.300
And so when I started
this, I didn't

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.190
know that local
bands would magically

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.460
emerge from the spectrum,
but they do and we saw them,

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.040
and that led to a
lot of good stuff.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.560
I should mention that I
got tenure at MIT because

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.090
of stimulated emission pumping.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.980
That was a long time ago.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:04.640
So we had not seen the
isomerization in the ground

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.880
state because we
couldn't get high enough

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.390
because Franck-Condon
factors prevented us

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.550
from getting high enough.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.380
And the spectrum also
gets complicated,

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.600
and there's all sorts of
reasons why it didn't work.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.010
But as far as the cis-trans
isomerization in the excited

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:25.190
state, we killed
that, and we killed

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:30.920
that because we saw
new patterns emerge,

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.190
and that was more robust
than normal modes.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.040
And then we saw those
new patterns break,

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.594
and the breaking is
due to isomerization.

00:36:41.594 --> 00:36:43.260
And we worked out the
theory, and that's

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.961
what the Science
paper was all about.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:37:04.650
So now, gas phase
versus condensed phase.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.470
People who work in
the gas phase don't

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.990
talk to people who work in
the condensed phase and vice

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:23.960
versa because the spectra
are profoundly different.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.940
So we have a ground state and
we have some excited state.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.800
And whether it's a
diatomic molecule

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.230
or a polyatomic molecule,
it doesn't matter that much.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.610
So what we have in the
absorption spectrum

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:41.590
is vertical transitions to
a few vibrational levels,

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:45.750
depending on the
difference in geometry.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.290
And in the condensed
phase, instead

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:50.710
of staying in the vibrational
level we populated,

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.930
there is rapid
transfer of energy

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:56.660
from the molecule
into its surroundings,

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:01.250
and you end up in v equals
0 of the excited state.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:05.620
And then the spectrum is
to a few vibrational levels

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.270
of the ground state.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:11.020
And so you get something
that looks like this.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.470
This is the sort
of classic diagram

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.160
for absorption versus
emission spectra

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.880
of a polyatomic molecule.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.270
So this is emission.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.570
This is absorption.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.200
And frequency is on the right.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:38.160
So what happens is in the
absorption spectrum you observe

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.110
transitions to
higher vibrational

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:43.140
levels-- to several
vibrational levels,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.600
v prime equals 0 and higher.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.010
And so those are to the
blue of the band origin.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.280
And in emission, you
get emission only from v

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.460
equals 0 in the excited
state, and that's

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.640
to the red of the origin.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.810
And so you get this classic
double-hump picture.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.300
And there's all sorts
of vibrational levels

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.880
that are not resolved,
and this is basically

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.550
the kind of crappy
spectrum you get

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.940
when you look at a big molecule
in the condensed phase.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.900
And so it's telling
you frequency domain

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.114
for this sort of thing
is the wrong approach

00:39:23.114 --> 00:39:24.530
because there's
nothing much here.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:37.570
So this thing, the expectation
value, the Hamiltonian

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.930
for the molecule as opposed
to the overall system

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.240
is time dependent.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.530
We're used to the Hamiltonian
being time independent.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.840
There can be
dynamics because you

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.345
excite a coherent
superposition of states.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:01.030
So for condensed-phase systems,
the Hamiltonian or energy

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.570
is not conserved
in the molecule.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.010
But of course
thermodynamics says

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.240
if you have an isolated
system it's conserved.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.180
That's irrelevant
because we always

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:15.625
want to look at something more
interesting than a bulk sample.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:25.430
Now I want to talk
about dynamics

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:30.180
that is more subtle
than the naive stuff--

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:35.360
so subtle dynamics.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:47.469
Well, let's have no collisions.

00:40:47.469 --> 00:40:49.010
Well, we can do that
in the gas phase

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.218
if the pressure's low enough.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:58.320
No breaking of molecules.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.660
So if there is no
predissociation or

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.170
autoionization--

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.880
so we can restrict ourselves
to a low enough energy

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.000
that things don't break.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:27.120
Now this is subtle.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.010
Molecules will fluoresce, and
populations in excited states

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.480
will decay.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:40.890
And as a rule, the
fluorescence lifetime,

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:50.430
if it's truly only fluorescence
and not other dynamics,

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:52.740
the lifetime is longer
than 10 nanoseconds.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:00.790
So if we're looking at times
shorter than 10 nanoseconds

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:04.290
we can say there's
no fluorescence.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.560
We're going to ignore that.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.110
That's OK because there
still can be dynamics.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:22.496
So simplest case,
two-level quantum beats,

00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:23.870
and you know about
quantum beats.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:27.440
You've already looked at
them in various problems.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.560
And so you have a system
where you have a ground state

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.610
and you have two excited states,
and one of them is bright

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.110
and one of them is
dark with respect

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.640
to transitions from this state.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.550
But there is an
interaction between them,

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.220
and so they're mixed character
and with a short pulse.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.620
You prepare a
coherent superposition

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.700
of two eigenstates.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:53.270
The intensity of
the fluorescence

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.630
oscillates, and it isolates
at the frequency difference

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.830
of these two levels.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:02.850
And the modulation depth
of the fluorescence

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:06.660
tells you something about
what is the coupling matrix

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.420
element between these two
states relative to the energy

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.430
difference between them?

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.470
So there's a lot of
information in there,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.150
and so this is something
that can happen faster

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.640
than the spontaneous
fluorescence.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.100
One is observing it in the
spontaneous fluorescence,

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:28.850
but the whole point is you're
looking at some dynamics that

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:32.744
is encoded in eigenstates.

00:43:32.744 --> 00:43:33.910
And that's one of my mottos.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.950
We know how to write
all the theory for this.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:52.870
We have something
that looks broad,

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:58.350
but in reality it's a
whole bunch of eigenstates.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.960
And the pattern of
these eigenstates

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.470
is telling you what
the dynamics is.

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:10.930
Now normally we
think of dynamics

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.900
as the width of something.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.470
And this collection of
eigenstates behaving

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:21.920
in some coherent
way has a width,

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.700
but that's only the beginning.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:31.100
What was the thing that gave
intensity to these eigenstates?

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:38.220
What was the zero-order
state, and what

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:43.320
was the coupling matrix element
between the bright state

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.330
and the dark state, and what
are the rules for these?

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:50.300
And so if you can resolve
these eigenstates,

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:55.490
you learn about much more
detailed picture of dynamics

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:58.540
than just saying, well,
dynamics is a width.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.020
If you're below the energy
where molecules can break,

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:02.770
there is no width.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.700
But if you do a
crappy experiment,

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.690
you don't resolve stuff
and it looks broad.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.420
Now, sometimes the
molecule sets the standard

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:19.980
for what's a real experiment
by having its density of states

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.830
so large you couldn't resolve
it even if you had the best

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.340
experiment in the world.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:30.530
But there's still the idea
that inside this broad thing

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:33.650
there is some
interpretable dynamics.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:34.440
That's my goal.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:44.710
Well, one kind of
interpretable dynamics

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:49.240
is, OK, so you have some excited
state and some ground state,

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:54.990
and there's a range
of vibrational levels

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.180
that you can excite.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.650
And if you have a
short pulse, you

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.780
make a coherent
superposition of all

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.000
of those vibrational levels.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.710
And then what you have is
some wave packet which has got

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:12.640
an energy, sort of
the average of these.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.100
And the wave packet starts
out at a turning point

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.850
because you started out with
essentially zero momentum.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:24.290
And the wave packet moves,
and it goes back and forth

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.220
and back and forth.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.280
And it's telling you what
the vibrational frequency

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.470
of that mode is.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:40.240
And so you can then observe the
fluorescence from this evolving

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.810
wave packet, or you can monitor
this evolving wave packet

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.450
either by looking
at fluorescence back

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.630
to where you started.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.130
And so when it's
over here, it can't

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:51.930
fluoresce to where you started.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.657
When it's over here where
it was born, it can.

00:46:54.657 --> 00:46:56.490
And so the fluorescence
is going to be doing

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.440
a kind of quantum beating.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.650
You could also use some kind
of pump-probe experiment

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.810
where you say, I'm going
to look at the wave packet

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.300
when it's here because
I have a transition

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.220
to another electronic state.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.970
And so the vertical
excitation is at that energy,

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.070
and so I wait for the wave
packet to get to a point.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:24.005
And so you have a
periodic motion.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:34.950
And you have dephasing because
this wave packet is built out

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.580
of vibrational levels
which are not harmonic so

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.490
that there is some dispersion
of the vibrational frequencies

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.220
around the average.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:48.300
As a result, that causes
this thing to dephase.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:55.320
And its dephasing time
could look like a width,

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.350
but it's actually a
particular mechanism.

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:00.570
And then there are other
things that can happen,

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.070
and I love this.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:05.340
So we've got a few minutes.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.394
So suppose we have two
electronic states that

00:48:08.394 --> 00:48:10.560
are crossing, and you're
starting out in this level.

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.518
You made a wave packet.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:18.720
So this is going back
and forth, and every half

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.619
oscillation it goes through
this critical region.

00:48:21.619 --> 00:48:22.410
What's that region?

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.620
What's special
about that region?

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.429
Come on.

00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:31.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:32.330
ROBERT FIELD: I'm sorry?

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.480
ROBERT FIELD: Not if
this is a bounce state.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.440
That's a good try.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.860
That is, in fact, if this
were a repulsive state,

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.130
then predissociation
would occur when

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.850
it cross through the region.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.350
This is the stationary
phase region.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:53.350
This is where the momentum
on the two potential curves

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.320
is the same.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:01.410
And so the molecule can make up
its mind which potential curve

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:06.470
it wants to leave on because
there's no impulse that causes

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.810
a change in its
momentum, and it just

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:11.280
makes a decision which one.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:20.580
And so when that happens, if
you're following the dynamics,

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:24.600
you have a series of beats.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.200
And I'm just sketching
them as a stick,

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.820
but really, they have width.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.250
And then at some
later type you start

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:36.900
seeing a new family
of oscillations

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.370
because now you've got some
amplitude on this other state,

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:45.080
and it has a
different frequency.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:48.500
But the important thing--
and I should stop here--

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:53.230
is that the only
time the molecule

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:55.720
has to change its
mind between one state

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.850
and another is
when it's crossing

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.130
through this stationary
phase region.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:02.890
So it's a complicated
thing, but it's

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:07.670
isolating a particular region
where the curves cross.

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.850
And where the curves
cross, instead

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.160
of having crossing
curves, you could

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.530
have something like this
and something like that.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.310
Now we're back to Mr.
Landau and Mr. Zener.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:23.060
And so if there's a
curve crossing, depending

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.460
on how far above
the curve crossing,

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.900
it tells you how fast
you're going through it.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.630
See, there's all sorts
of wonderful stuff here,

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:36.850
which is not the
trivial dynamics that--

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:40.000
this is the only way you get
broadening is the molecule

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.160
breaks.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.280
And the fluorescence
is usually so slow--

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.510
10 nanoseconds is slow--

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.770
that you don't see any
broadening because 10

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.440
nanoseconds corresponds to
a pretty high resolution,

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.480
and most people aren't looking
at that kind of resolution.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:03.200
And so we have
quantum beats which

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.060
then can show beautiful
dynamics in a way

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.730
that if you're prepared to
build a model and to say, well,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.060
we could have this
case and this case--

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.780
this is the chemists' case.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.860
We have quantum chemists' case--

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.728
you can interpret everything.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.320
This is very much related
to what Mr. Zewail does.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.630
And I will spend a
significant amount of time

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:36.150
on Monday talking about
the Zewail experiments

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:39.480
and how the whole point
of his experiments

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.045
are not just saying, OK,
I excite the molecule

00:51:44.045 --> 00:51:45.350
and it breaks.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.240
It breaks in this much time.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.940
Well, that's a useful
question, but what

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.240
did it do before it broke?

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.870
One particular bond breaks,
but what about the motions

00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:00.690
of the other bonds?

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:03.390
Or maybe you're
talking about breaking

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:06.180
in a particular normal mode.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:11.610
Does the molecule arrange
itself to be broken?

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:14.520
Or once it's excited
it goes downhill

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:19.050
to the graveyard in
a particular path,

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:22.170
but there are
wonderful things you

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:26.430
can do by asking, what is the
mechanism by which the molecule

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:27.660
breaks?

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.710
And by varying how you
excite the molecule,

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:35.580
you're looking at different
aspects of that mechanism.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:40.690
Now Zewail sold this
really hard, and it worked.

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:43.980
And so I'll leave
that for Monday.

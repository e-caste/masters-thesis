00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.950
RIK EBERHARDT: So welcome to
Creating Video Games, CMS 611

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.009
and 6073.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.180
Is everyone in the right class?

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.891
Yeah, all right.

00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:35.390
Cool.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.880
So this class is taught by--
it's a Comparative Media

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.616
Studies course.

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.740
So we'll be talking a lot
about the kinds of things

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.510
that they talk about in
Comparative Media Studies.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.500
We'll study research
and design practices,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.030
but as it relates to
software engineering,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.070
and in particular to
developing video games-- so

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.230
digital video games
for, basically, screens.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.700
The CMS department has a lot of
different, really cool research

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.120
labs that are a part of it.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.770
And we are one of them.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.370
So we are the MIT Game Lab.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.240
Basically the whole
MIT Game Lab staff

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.999
teaches this class together.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:15.290
Because we really like each
other, and it's really fun.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.670
But also because
there's a lot of you.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.753
And it's a really big,
complicated class to teach.

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:20.900
So we need all the extra
support we can get.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.194
We teach classes in game
design and game research.

00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:25.360
Those are all the course
numbers that we teach other

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.540
than this one.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.210
Maybe you've taken
one of these before.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.120
Maybe you're thinking about
some other game courses

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.580
you want to take in the future.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.780
So take a look at that.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.410
We also have UROP opportunities.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.040
So we'll advertise those
classes as they come up.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.380
We do mentor Course 6
students for the UAPs.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.050
What we usually ask
is for you to bring

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.020
to us an interesting
research topic that you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.270
want to research.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.790
And if we are also
interested, then cool.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.861
A match is made.

00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.360
Same thing when it
comes to masters.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.020
So if you're going
to get your master's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.040
of engineering here in Course 6.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.460
And you want to do it in game
design or game development,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.460
and you need a mentor,
we can be your mentor.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.160
We also host a lot of
events and outreach events

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.026
and guest lectures.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:08.400
A lot of the guest lectures
will be part of this course--

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.899
that we'll be opening
to the public,

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.010
as well, for a few of them.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.010
We've got Riot coming
up in September.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.010
We've got Japanese
developer Swery65.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.850
Does anybody play
Deadly Premonition?

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.420
Yes!

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.030
It's awesome.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.702
And he's coming
to talk about it.

00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:27.993
And some other cool stuff--
we also do a lot of events.

00:02:27.993 --> 00:02:33.800
So like game jams-- we'll
have an alumni panel.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.540
And the next big thing is the
Boston Festival of Indie Games

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.550
is going to be on
campus in 11 days.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.520
So 200 developers are
going to be showing off

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.900
their games over in the
Johnson Activity Center.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.770
And we'll have a conference
track going on here.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.750
So take a look at that.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.439
You'll get all that information
as the course goes on.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.480
So next up, we just wanted
to introduce ourselves

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.250
and our individual--
basically what we do,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.924
and why we're
teaching the course.

00:02:58.924 --> 00:02:59.590
PHILLIP TAN: Hi.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.950
I'm Phillip Tan.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.010
I've been teaching
various game courses here

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.300
at MIT for about 10 years now.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.320
I'm a research scientist
over at the MIT Game Lab.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.800
And I've worked with all of
these fine folk for many years.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.440
Up here are a couple of
projects that I've worked on.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.120
On the right is a game called
A Slower Speed of Light.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.650
If any of you are interested
in relativistic speeds

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.250
and simulating
them on a computer,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.950
you are welcome to check it out.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.630
We also have an open
source version of our code

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.170
that lives on GitHub.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.040
So you can download that
version using the same tools

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.860
that you might end up
using in this class.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.977
But basically it's, you travel
near the speed of light,

00:03:41.977 --> 00:03:43.560
and you see what
this might look like.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.330
I play a lot of StarCraft.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.232
Anybody here play StarCraft?

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:51.475
A few people.

00:03:51.475 --> 00:03:53.700
All right.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.680
I've been working with
Blizzard this past year

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.900
to work on their
spectator interface.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.260
The idea is that there
are a lot of people

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.240
who watch e-sports right
now, especially on Twitch.tv.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.440
Who watches Twitch.tv?

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.940
OK.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.439
All right.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.890
Lots of people.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.960
E-sports specifically
on Twitch.tv, or just

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.641
like Let's Play?

00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:12.140
OK.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.820
A few.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.655
Those are spectators, just as
if you're watching a football

00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:19.339
or hockey game on TV.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.830
And they need infographics
to come up in real time

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.150
when something interesting
is happening in the game.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.220
So I write code
together with UROPs

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.230
to be able to bring up cool
infographics bring the hype,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.270
basically.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.710
So that's me.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.480
SARA VERRILLI: Hi.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.450
I'm Sara Verrilli.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.430
I'm the development director
at the MIT Game Lab.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.620
I came to the Game
Lab out of industry,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.290
where I've worked as a
producer and a game designer

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.950
and originally, how I entered
it was as a QA tester.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.164
So I've held a lot
of the jobs there.

00:05:02.164 --> 00:05:03.580
I've worked with
a lot of students

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.550
on games when we were
still running the summer

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.710
program, the one we did with
Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.090
And now I have focused to mostly
seeming to work on classes

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.292
and teaching game design.

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:15.750
So that's a lot of what I've
been doing and what I've done.

00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:19.140
RIK EBERHARDT: So I'm Rick.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.806
I'm the studio manager
for the Game Lab.

00:05:20.806 --> 00:05:22.110
I teach this course.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.410
I co-teach with Sara 617,
our advanced game studio

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.790
course where you spend
the entire semester making

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.125
one game.

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.250
These are the games I've
worked on at the Game Lab.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.820
I worked on all sorts
of different games

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.650
from anything to
games about depression

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.110
to games about identity, games
that are demonstrating advanced

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.240
3D rendering techniques, and
conference games-- PAX POX,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.550
a game that was played live
action at PAX East in 2009

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.217
at our booth there.

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:52.050
So I do digital and
non-digital game design.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.140
But for the most part
I'm studying and working

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.882
on project management.

00:05:56.882 --> 00:05:57.590
ANDREW GRANT: Hi.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.570
My name's Andrew Grant.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.520
I'm the technical director
at the MIT Game Lab

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.756
and help out with
the classes too.

00:06:02.756 --> 00:06:04.630
I'll probably be helping
you out a little bit

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.160
with technical issues
or what have you.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.530
I was in the games industry.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.030
I started with Sara
at Looking Glass

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.820
and moved to
Dreamworks Interactive.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.320
And after that, I kind of
got burned out, to be honest.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.944
It's a pretty rough
industry sometimes.

00:06:15.944 --> 00:06:17.460
I spent about 10
years consulting.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.310
And I kept coming back to
games and coming back to games.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.900
And so when I got
the opportunity

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.820
to come to the Game
Lab, I said, well, yes.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.192
So anyway, here I am.

00:06:26.192 --> 00:06:28.150
I've been playing and
making games all my life.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.202
And I think we'll have fun
doing it this semester.

00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:34.660
RIK EBERHARDT: And if you can
stand up-- our TA is Paulina.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.554
Wave and say hi.

00:06:35.554 --> 00:06:37.720
She'll be helping with all
the administrative stuff.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.690
She'll be helping
us with grading.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.750
And she'll also be
helping with any questions

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.180
you might have about
some of the technology

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.240
that we're using, too.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.081
She took the course
this past last year.

00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:46.580
Great.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.712
So get down your pencils.

00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:51.170
This is the cheat sheet, the
one-line version of the class.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.890
If you learn anything,
you learn this.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.030
When you're working in this
class, the best way to succeed

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.960
is working face to face,
testing your games often,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.870
prioritize, integrate, and
cutting features early.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.470
Sleeping is awesome.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.150
Avoid doing 3D.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
Avoid doing network code.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.227
And please use version control.

00:07:14.227 --> 00:07:16.060
We're actually going
to require all of this.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.990
But every year, a team or two
doesn't do one of these things.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.900
And it's OK.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.810
But they struggle.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.120
So if you do all these
things, through the semester,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.190
you'll do really, really well.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.820
Yeah, please.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.025
What was the question?

00:07:32.025 --> 00:07:32.860
AUDIENCE: Slides.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.360
Oh, the

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.510
RIK EBERHARDT: Slides?

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.780
Yeah.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.680
All the slides will be
available on Stellar.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.820
We're posting all of
our slides to Stellar.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.546
I don't actually expect you to
take notes on all these things.

00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:41.670
But it's awesome if you do.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.628
I remember it that way.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.161
PHILLIP TAN: This
is 140 characters.

00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:47.160
RIK EBERHARDT: This was
actually Phillip's tweet

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.581
from last night, in case anybody
was following him already.

00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:53.840
SARA VERRILLI: Then they
were probably not sleeping.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.131
RICK EBERHARDT: Actually, yeah.

00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:56.900
So the next bit
of administrivia,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.320
we're going to go over
the syllabus a little bit.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.700
It's in front of
you right there.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.310
If you have any questions,
feel free to interrupt.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.410
Fellow instructors, if
I say something wrong,

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.220
or if you want to say, hey,
but also this, please do.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.280
So first thing-- the
course is structured

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.474
into four game projects.

00:08:12.474 --> 00:08:14.890
So you're going to be making
four projects over the course

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.990
of the semester.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.510
Our first three projects
are about two weeks each.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.290
The third project is
a little bit longer,

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.350
if you decide to work
over the student holiday.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.710
And then project four
is our final project,

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:27.450
our main project.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.190
And that project's
going to be done

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.730
for a client who will be
coming in to talk about what

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:37.427
he works on later today.

00:08:37.427 --> 00:08:39.385
So your first project is
a non-digital project.

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:40.549
It's a prototype.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.390
Your second and third
are small, short,

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.250
digital prototypes-- so making
a digital game very quickly.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.960
Your fourth is a longer
time period project.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.120
But it should be about the
same amount of features,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.650
the same amount of work,
the same amount of game play

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.680
as the first three.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.350
It's just you had a lot more
time to actually do it right,

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.140
and to do it well, and to
polish on it, and iterate on it.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.520
At the end of today,
we'll talk about what

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.320
we mean by these common themes.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.630
This common theme--
what did I say--

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:20.010
meaningful decision making, or
meaningful decisions in games.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.970
And each time we start a
project-- our first project

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.815
starts on Monday--
we'll introduce

00:09:24.815 --> 00:09:26.940
the theme in more detail
and talk a little bit more

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.440
about it.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.810
But you can see all of the
details about the projects

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.900
that we have available for
you at Stellar right now.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.660
Our grading rubric
for each project

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.210
is largely team-focused.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.160
So all of your projects
are worked on in teams.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.020
They start in small teams
and get a bit larger.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.770
You'll see each of these
lines is 20% of the grade.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.930
So the actual working of the
game is only 20% of your grade.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.936
Following the iterative
design process

00:09:56.936 --> 00:09:59.310
that we'll be talking about,
using the project management

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.200
practices that we'll
be talking about,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.140
doing a good presentation-- a
group post-mortem presentation

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.100
about your game--
is another 20%.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.640
And then every
student will write

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.090
an individual post-mortem,
their own one to two page essay,

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.570
at the end of-- turned in at
the same time as every project.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.860
And what we're asking for
all these things is we

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.891
want to know about your process.

00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:26.140
We want to know how you made
the game, what challenges

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.470
you had while you were making
the game, what difficulties

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.090
you faced.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.260
How did you surpass them?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.810
And even better, what are you
going to do in the future?

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.575
When you either go
into the industry

00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:38.200
or go into another
software engineering

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.080
project or another
class, what would you

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.810
do differently, after the
experience you just had?

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.480
So 80% of your grade
is team-delivered.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.650
20% percent of your
grade is your own work.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.930
So speaking of
in-class expectations,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.700
the class is a three-hour class.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.370
Holy crap.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.300
And it runs twice a week.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.540
Class time is actually allotted
for your work in teams.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.410
We don't expect you to get your
games actually built entirely

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.390
within class.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.734
But important team meetings,
test sessions, code

00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:12.150
review-- you're
going to generally

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.722
have a lot of time in class
to do a lot of that stuff.

00:11:14.722 --> 00:11:16.430
For projects one and
two, you'll probably

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.400
have about 60 minutes
at the most per session

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.610
to work on your team work
outside of an activity.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.610
But we're also going to
have a lot of activities

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.770
where you're doing
some of the work that's

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.530
required in each project as
part of a guided activity

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.815
that we're going to run.

00:11:32.815 --> 00:11:34.940
So it's actually a little
bit more than 60 minutes.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.580
Products three and
four, we're probably

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.330
going to have about
90 minutes per session

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.414
for working in your teams.

00:11:39.414 --> 00:11:41.621
And that's going to generally
be at the end of class.

00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:44.085
At the beginning of class,
we're going to have, usually,

00:11:44.085 --> 00:11:47.950
a guest lecture for
those last two projects.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.730
And then we'll have
a playtest session.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.210
And then it'll
just be open work.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.070
Our original classroom
had flat tables.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.540
This classroom-- that moved.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.550
This classroom does not.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.230
So it'll be interesting.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.840
I don't know if it's got
power on any of the stations.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.710
But the short version of it is,
bring your development station

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.660
to class, if you can.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.300
If it's a laptop,
bring it to class.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.550
You'll be using it a lot
starting Monday-- well

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.172
actually, starting
two Mondays from now.

00:12:14.172 --> 00:12:16.630
And the other thing-- teamwork
is the heart of this course.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.620
Actually, participation is
the heart of this course.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.370
So even though we're
in this tiered thing,

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.710
and I hate giving lectures
to people this way,

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.800
we're going to ask you to
talk back to us a little bit.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.640
So fill in the gaps
when you come in.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.470
Participation is
actually very important.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.770
Class participation-- so
showing up to class on time,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.020
showing up to class at all,
and participating in class

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.180
is 25% of the grade.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.590
So speaking of that,
attendance-- you

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.050
will be penalized if you
miss more than three classes

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.150
without justification.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.400
So what is that justification?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.441
It's like if you're sick.

00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:52.200
If you're sick, we
don't want you here.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.650
Stay home.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.470
Don't make us sick.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.100
Don't make your team sick.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.150
He's a real stickler about that.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.082
I'm invincible.

00:13:00.082 --> 00:13:00.790
I won't get sick.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.790
But everybody else will.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.300
Do not be late.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.330
Again, we're recording.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.610
We have very important
guest lecturers

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.580
who are in our network
that we'd really

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.430
like them to enjoy being here.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.286
So I really hate it
when people show up

00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:18.660
in the middle of
a guest lecture.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.470
It makes me feel like a jerk
for asking them to talk to MIT.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.020
So don't show up late.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.860
But do show up.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.990
So if for whatever reason,
the doors are locked,

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.740
it really just means, hey,
there's a guest lecturer here.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.460
And coming in is going
to disrupt things.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.120
The doors will get unlocked.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.920
I don't expect to
have to use that.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.870
But if I will, I will.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.170
Ha ha.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.686
And usually, guest
lectures end about 2:10.

00:13:41.686 --> 00:13:42.560
So you can come back.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.110
Come into class later
to work, and actually

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.770
get counted for the
rest of the day.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.043
So I'd rather you come
in later than at 1:15

00:13:50.043 --> 00:13:52.394
while somebody's
talking up here.

00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:54.810
Class is generally going to
start-- lectures are generally

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.110
going to start at 1:10.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.190
We'll do announcements at 1:05,
if that makes a difference.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.023
Because I know a lot
of people are coming in

00:14:01.023 --> 00:14:03.290
from recitations and whatnot.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.540
The other thing-- MIT has
an anti-harassment policy.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.592
We've also got an
anti-harassment policy.

00:14:08.592 --> 00:14:10.050
If anybody's on
Twitter these days,

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.745
or anybody's engaged in game
culture these days, it's toxic.

00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:13.590
And it sucks.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.110
And it makes me mad I don't
want to see it in this class,

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.510
please.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.032
So this is on the syllabus.

00:14:20.032 --> 00:14:21.490
It's the last page
of the syllabus.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.640
Basically, don't make
offensive verbal comments

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.660
or any other kind of
comments about all

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.201
these different
things, when it comes

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.930
to gender identity, sexual
orientation, disability,

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.440
physical appearance, body
size, race, religion.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.620
Just don't be a jerk.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.420
Don't be an ass.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.850
More importantly, though, if you
see it happening, let us know.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.170
If you are a target
of this, let us know.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.670
There's ways to get around this.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.094
There's ways to report this.

00:14:48.094 --> 00:14:50.010
In the syllabus, it
actually lists the website

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.629
for the official MIT
way to report it,

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:53.670
if you'd like to go that
way, if you'd rather not

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.360
come to either the
instructors or your TA.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.430
And our email address--
videogames-bosses@mit.edu.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.290
Email that.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.100
Don't email us individually.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.292
That makes sure that
one of us reads it.

00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:06.570
SARA VERRILLI: Can I
add just one more thing?

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.280
RIK EBERHARDT: Yes, please.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.321
SARA VERRILLI: Rick put
up a giant list of things

00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:10.752
that you should
[? worry about ?],

00:15:10.752 --> 00:15:11.248
and that you should
not be harassed about.

00:15:11.248 --> 00:15:13.232
But I will go ahead and
say that you should not

00:15:13.232 --> 00:15:13.728
be harassed about anything.

00:15:13.728 --> 00:15:14.720
Right?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.402
We have a list.

00:15:15.402 --> 00:15:19.003
It's not meant to be exclusive.

00:15:19.003 --> 00:15:21.002
So if there is for some
reason some other things

00:15:21.002 --> 00:15:23.043
coming up and bothering
you, come and talk to us.

00:15:24.454 --> 00:15:26.120
RIK EBERHARDT: We
are-- team development

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.640
and game development
is stressful.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.440
Yeah, question.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.315
AUDIENCE: One phrase
that I've heard recently

00:15:30.315 --> 00:15:32.343
that I love is, "Rights work up.

00:15:32.343 --> 00:15:34.339
Rules work down."

00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:36.335
You have a right
to be respected.

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:39.474
The rules that are listed
will be paper mached on

00:15:39.474 --> 00:15:40.224
to make that work.

00:15:40.224 --> 00:15:43.187
But in general, be respectful.

00:15:43.187 --> 00:15:44.020
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.980
That's really what
we're asking for.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.440
Just be respectful
for each other.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.877
You're going to be
working on large teams.

00:15:48.877 --> 00:15:50.210
There are going to be deadlines.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.020
It's going to hurt.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.840
It's going to be painful.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.340
Things are going to slip.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.642
Don't let that be the
way that you express it.

00:15:56.642 --> 00:15:58.350
We'll actually give
you some better tools

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.610
to express your
pain and suffering.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.790
So the class is called
Creating Video Games.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.440
How do we create video games?

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.960
We have a whole bunch
of people involved

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.242
in creating video games.

00:16:10.242 --> 00:16:11.950
Was this the slide
you were coming in on?

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:12.070
Or is it the next one?

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.160
SARA VERRILLI: This is the slide
I was going to chime in on.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.220
But you were chiming so nicely.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.928
RIK EBERHARDT: Come
in whenever you like.

00:16:15.928 --> 00:16:17.660
So basically, all
sorts of people

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.560
are required to make games.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.370
We have all those
people in the room.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.286
SARA VERRILLI: Actually,
a whole lot of skills

00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:25.126
are required to make games.

00:16:25.126 --> 00:16:26.500
You should not
come in and think,

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.040
I'm going to the
programmer on this team.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.830
You should not
come in and think,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.510
I'm going to be the game
designer on this team.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.301
Or I'm going to be the
artist on this team,

00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:34.560
or the sound designer
on this team.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.930
The teams are small
enough, even when

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.510
you hit the eight-person
team for the large project.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.657
And the projects are
always challenging enough.

00:16:41.657 --> 00:16:43.990
Even if you think you have a
short list of things to do,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.281
you have a challenging project.

00:16:45.281 --> 00:16:47.720
That's one thing we've
noticed every single year.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.820
Everybody manages to come up
with a challenging project.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.220
The team's going to need you
doing everything you can do.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.850
And that means that
if you can program,

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.266
they probably want
you to program.

00:16:58.266 --> 00:16:59.725
If they need
programmers, chime up.

00:16:59.725 --> 00:17:01.099
If you're primarily
a programmer,

00:17:01.099 --> 00:17:02.610
or you think yourself
of, they need

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.339
you to chime up
on the game design

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.432
and comment on places
where it will work better.

00:17:08.432 --> 00:17:09.890
And you understand
how it will work

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.690
better, because of your
understanding of the code.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:12.920
If you're the game
designer, you've

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.503
got to be ready to pitch in and
help make all those things you

00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:17.130
see in your head
happen, whether that's

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:22.390
creating some sketched
doodled art, so your team can

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.774
go with the little pixel
figures, or whatever.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.300
We don't-- usually these teams
aren't big enough to support

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.270
someone who does
nothing but draw art.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.130
We're not actually grading you
on the beauty of your games.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.980
I mean, yes, we want good,
well-functioning, rounded

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.710
games.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.040
We want games that are
relatively easy to use.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.200
But you don't need super
beautiful art for that.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.630
So if what you'd like to do
is primarily art for the game,

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.005
think about what else you can
be contributing to the game

00:17:50.005 --> 00:17:53.640
as well, so that your game
gets more functionality in it.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.444
And let's see.

00:17:54.444 --> 00:17:56.860
For community managers, business
analysts, and marketers--

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.360
the people who are pitching
your game and talking about it--

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.070
don't mean on the
person who ends up

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.980
stepping up to organize
your team and steps

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.996
into the producer role.

00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:07.370
They're already doing an awful
lot of job just producing.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.390
They're going to need your
help figuring out presentations

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.980
and talking about your game,
and doing the reflection,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.530
and keeping the team running.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.824
So don't think of these as a
whole bunch of individuals.

00:18:16.824 --> 00:18:18.990
Think of it as a whole bunch
of skills, one of which

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.080
may be your primary.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.060
But choose at least two
or three as your backup.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.987
That's my shtick.

00:18:23.987 --> 00:18:24.820
RIK EBERHARDT: Cool.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.111
And that's basically how
indie game development is run.

00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:29.270
When you see a game
made by three people,

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.660
they're doing all of that.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.590
And so that's basically what
we're expecting from y'all.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.220
So if we're not teaching
a lot of the skills,

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.150
the main skills that we
are teaching in this class

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.250
is giving you
hands-on experience

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.552
working on complex
projects with large teams.

00:18:45.552 --> 00:18:46.510
So what does that mean?

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.990
It's basically project
management, team management,

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.445
and communication skills.

00:18:50.445 --> 00:18:53.070
You're coming to us through your
prerequisites with some design

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.500
skills.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.541
You're coming to us with
some programming skills.

00:18:55.541 --> 00:18:57.440
You have support for
some of the game engines

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.840
you haven't seen before.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.686
But like any other
engineering course at MIT,

00:19:01.686 --> 00:19:02.830
you pick up a tool.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.200
You learn how to use
the tool in the course,

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.330
if you need to use it.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.644
So the tools that
we've chosen should

00:19:08.644 --> 00:19:10.810
be short enough that you
can be able to pick them up

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:11.630
pretty quickly.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.166
And actually, we're going to
go into that today as well.

00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:15.540
But the remainder
of the course--

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.910
particularly project
two and project three--

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.800
are going to be focused
on communication.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.626
If you're on a large team,
how do you talk to each other?

00:19:24.626 --> 00:19:26.250
How do you communicate
with each other?

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.260
Is it going to be through
email, instant message, chat,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:36.850
post-it notes, mash notes,
hate notes, karaoke?

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.840
Bottlenecks are going to
form in your work process.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.610
You're going to find out
that oh, all the assets are

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:43.630
going to one person.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.800
And they're sick today.

00:19:48.251 --> 00:19:50.300
The quality of your
code and assets

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.157
are going to quickly nosedive
if you don't have a plan.

00:19:53.157 --> 00:19:53.990
SARA VERRILLI: Yeah.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.467
This is another
one of those, don't

00:19:56.467 --> 00:19:58.550
assume that one person on
your team is going to do

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.762
all the art or all the sound.

00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:01.220
And that's all
they're going to do.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.870
Because if they get
hit by the flu truck--

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.280
as frequently
happens around here--

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.950
you'll discover
you've got nothing

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.660
to put in the beautiful
game that you've made.

00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:14.720
RIK EBERHARDT: So to
get around that, we're

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.040
going to introduce to you tools
and methods through the course

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.400
that are going to help you
get through these problems.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.150
How to do code workflow,
how to do asset workflow--

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.840
we'll talk about
that a little bit.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.460
That's actually the
first assignment.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.880
We'll talk about code review.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.754
We're not necessarily
teaching a lot of this.

00:20:28.754 --> 00:20:30.350
We'll be talking
about a lot of this.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.910
I know some of
you have done some

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.200
of this in other experiences.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.990
We actually want you to help
other people out in the course.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.490
Talk about your
previous experiences

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.180
working on a project.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.860
If you've done an
internship before,

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.318
if you've made an
app for a company

00:20:41.318 --> 00:20:44.010
before-- because everybody
has apps these days--

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.680
you've probably run
into some of this.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.011
So we want to hear about
your experiences, too.

00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:50.385
We're going to talk a lot
about product backlogs and task

00:20:50.385 --> 00:20:54.700
lists-- paper!-- using paper and
spreadsheets to tell each other

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.326
what you've been working on and
how you're going to work on it.

00:20:57.326 --> 00:20:59.158
I'll be talking a lot
about retrospectives--

00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:00.630
about how, at the
end of a project,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.640
you can talk about
what you've just done,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.452
and how you can do it quickly.

00:21:04.452 --> 00:21:06.639
But ultimately, we
can going to give you

00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:07.930
all the tools, all the methods.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.404
The best way to learn all
this, to know all this,

00:21:10.404 --> 00:21:12.070
is really just through
prior experience.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.486
So this class is going to be
that prior experience for you

00:21:14.486 --> 00:21:17.340
when you go to your
next challenge,

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.205
either working in
the industry, working

00:21:19.205 --> 00:21:20.830
doing any kind of
software engineering,

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.160
or going to another class.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.060
So again, the cheat
sheet-- work face to face.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.290
Test often.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.130
Prioritize, integrate,
and cut features early.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.280
Sleep.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.170
Avoid 3D.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.920
Don't do networking.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.194
And use version control, please.

00:21:39.194 --> 00:21:40.860
SARA VERRILLI: And
this is where the cut

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.530
I have from the last three
years of this course,

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.650
and the final presentations
from pretty much

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.540
every group that's given
a final presentation

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.310
for their final
project-- in which they

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.960
look at us sheepishly and say,
you said we should test early.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.710
And you know what?

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.590
We really should
have tested earlier.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.214
I can't actually be 15
different MIT students

00:21:59.214 --> 00:22:01.380
who have taken this course
saying this sheepishly up

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.652
on the screen.

00:22:02.652 --> 00:22:04.610
But I've heard it from
all of them, pretty much

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.680
every single group.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.740
So I'm going to give you
guys the really early

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.500
heads-up warning.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.380
Test earlier.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.090
We say it.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.080
We mean it.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.462
RIK EBERHARDT: I'd like
to introduce Pablo Suarez.

00:22:16.462 --> 00:22:21.739
He and his group will be
our client for project four.

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:23.530
So we're asking him to
give an introduction

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.180
of the kind of
work that he does,

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.600
and give a feeling for
what the kind of work

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.120
we're going to do in class.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.790
The first three
projects are going

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.080
to build slowly towards that
final project in the theme

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.941
and strength of those games.

00:22:35.941 --> 00:22:37.774
And in that fourth
project, he and his group

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:38.680
will come back in
again and tell us

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.156
more detail about what
they're really looking for,

00:22:40.156 --> 00:22:43.054
and what kind of games they're
really looking at from us.

00:22:43.054 --> 00:22:45.010
So take it away.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.010
PABLO SUAREZ: Thank you.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.510
Thanks Rick.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.480
Thanks Game Lab team.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.900
I'm very grateful for this.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.020
And you-- I am grateful
to you, even though you

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.840
don't have much of a
choice that I show up

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.480
and you have to
suffer through me.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.360
My name is Pablo, Pablo Suarez.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.450
My strange accent
comes from Argentina.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.770
I live in the Boston area,
where a fraction of my time

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:04.990
I'm a researcher.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.640
I used to be a researcher
affiliated with MIT.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.120
I just came from
the Lincoln Labs,

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.820
where I'm collaborating with
MIT folks there as well.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.700
But most of my time, I work with
a humanitarian team-- the Red

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.990
Cross/Red Crescent
Climate Centre.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.450
It's like a think tank within
the humanitarian sector.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.970
It's based in the Netherlands.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.120
We cover the planet--
187 countries.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.930
I am in charge of research,
in charge of innovation,

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.860
mostly in charge of Africa.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.890
And unfortunately for the world,
we have way, way too much work.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.660
The workload is so
ridiculously huge

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.760
that in my opinion,
especially coming from science

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.800
and technology, we need
to change the way we

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.860
think about humanitarian work.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.510
And if it is about
changing how we think,

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.120
traditional ways are
not working too well.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.350
And that's why I'm here.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.400
I love this slide.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.190
We have a comfort zone,
which is doing things the way

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.460
we've been doing them.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.270
Someone's hungry?

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.050
Go get food.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:07.900
Someone's homeless?

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.630
Go give shelter.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.120
Someone's sick?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.740
Help them heal.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.750
But we no longer have the
money, the brain power,

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.460
the equipment to deal
with all that's happening.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.670
Too much is happening.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.480
The climate is changing.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.440
Environmental
degradation, urbanization,

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.200
political instability, weird
diseases-- you name it.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.760
How can we learn more
about what we can do?

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.300
We need as humanitarian
workers to get into a new place

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.050
where we can do more
with what we have.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.590
And that place is
outside our comfort zone.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.030
Now magic can happen.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.295
But very often, we step
out of our comfort zone

00:24:46.295 --> 00:24:48.220
and we fall into the abyss.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.080
It's not easy to
find the right place.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.300
This is a risky endeavor for me.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.440
I'm here hoping
that you guys will

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.030
accomplish one of two things.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.600
One is maybe you
come up with a game

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.347
concept that has a life
after the end of your course.

00:25:03.347 --> 00:25:04.180
You get your credit.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.140
You graduate.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.210
And the Red Cross
or others can play

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.110
a game that helps
someone understand

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.300
something, helps
someone do something,

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.690
helps someone collect
data about something.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.750
And we'll talk more about
what are those things

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.420
that we want when we
get to project four.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.200
The other one is maybe we can
lure you-- even if one of you,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.090
even if one of the
Game Lab team--

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.650
to consider humanitarian
work as part

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.460
of what you may be doing
in your future life,

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.080
either as your job,
or as your hobby.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.840
It's great fun.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.000
It's a great
intellectual challenge.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.850
The head of my team, Martin
[? Van Ahls-- ?] he's

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.310
an astrophysicist by training.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.810
OK?

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:49.140
So you don't have much
awareness of the extent

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.440
to which humanitarian workers
can come from unusual places.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.760
And we hope that MIT stops
being an unusual place

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.060
for humanitarian stuff.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.280
So let me illustrate the
kinds of challenges we get.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.510
This is an actual fax that
actually arrived in May,

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.740
2008 to the office
of my colleague Yusef

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.030
[? ayd-Shaloush, ?] who at
the time was based in Dakar.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.080
Let me see if this works.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:16.750
OK.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:21.410
For those of you who know Dakar,
it's near those green pixels.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.800
That's where, at the time,
the regional office was

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.120
for West and Central Africa.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.320
28 countries going
from Mauritania--

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.534
where there have
been a military coup,

00:26:32.534 --> 00:26:34.700
and there was bloodshed in
the streets and Red Cross

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.810
volunteers needed to learn
first aid to prevent someone

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.440
bleeding to death--
all the way to Congo

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.780
Brazzaville in the southernmost
part of this area, where there

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.380
was flooding-- urban flooding.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.710
And as Red Cross,
we don't fully know

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:53.160
how to operate in rapidly
changing urban contexts.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.420
We're used to a planet where
poor, suffering people were

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.830
either in conflict
or in rural areas.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.820
And Darfur-- people going to
Chad-- needing shelter, aid,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.090
all sorts of things.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.030
Yusef has to deal with
those three and everything

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.360
in between-- chronic food
insecurity, Burkina Faso,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.010
you name it-- insufficient
training for his staff.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.380
And he gets this fax.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.050
Now I want you to think
you're a decision maker.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.520
You're someone who has to make
decisions and gets this fax.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.780
It was issued in May,
referring to the three coming

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.020
months-- June, July, August.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.772
And it says if we define
an extreme precipitation

00:27:35.772 --> 00:27:37.230
event-- extreme
rainfall-- as being

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:41.020
in the top 15% of the
historical record,

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.040
then this year-- there
was a lot of text.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.380
I won't bother you with that.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.880
This year, because of sea
surface temperature anomalies

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.980
and other things that maybe you
know if you're an MIT student,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.000
but it's not what we're
used to-- this year,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.290
because of that stuff, the
probability of extreme rains

00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:01.970
is enhanced from 15%
to between 40% and 50%.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.780
So this fax is in the office.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.960
And Yusef looks at it.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.080
And what does he do?

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.430
What do you think he does?

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.120
What do you think the
humanitarian sector

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.060
does when we get information?

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.850
First of all, to
understand it fully

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.980
you need to stop doing
everything else you're doing.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.550
You have to not answer an email.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.820
You have to not sign the check
for the fuel for the driver

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.920
for delivering the
something or other.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.220
And once you start
thinking about it,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.610
what do I do with the
place with the green pixel?

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.922
Do I send-- I don't
know, one tent?

00:28:33.922 --> 00:28:34.630
A thousand tents?

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.616
Where do I send
them, and to do what?

00:28:36.616 --> 00:28:37.490
What are the chances?

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.950
When will it happen?

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.910
So my job is to
help the Red Cross

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.550
family and the
humanitarian sector

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:50.210
at large to understand science
that can help us make smarter

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.980
decisions.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.730
Now if you want to
represent, to model,

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:01.080
with an experience of forecast,
this is how it normally works.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.590
There's information that
allegedly can support action.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.890
That is communicated with an
audience in a passive mode,

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:11.884
like a fax or an email or
a TV or radio announcement.

00:29:11.884 --> 00:29:13.300
And then you hope
that people will

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.090
get it and do the right thing.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.735
Of course, I leave a question
mark, because-- not always?

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.290
Now when I talked to people
about climate science--

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.040
about changing
climate conditions;

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.080
sea levels rise, so
we need new locations

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.850
of shelters; about El Nino
and changing risks of drought

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.860
and food insecurity;
about rainfall upstream,

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.350
therefore flooding downstream--
I would be talking science.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.350
And the people I was
talking to-- they

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.370
had something else to do.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:44.670
They had to go save lives.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.400
And they were forced into
a room just like you now.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.710
And I was talking science.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:54.120
And I could feel the extent
to which I was successfully

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.560
shrinking their brains.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.120
This is a metaphor.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.300
There are very talented
and smart people

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.710
in the humanitarian sector.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.560
But my putting them
into a passive mode,

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.930
talking jargon to them, showing
maps and graphs and so on,

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.550
was really not
accomplishing much.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.770
So I had to try something you.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:20.450
Oh, by the way, I remember
hearing the snoring

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.080
while I was talking science.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.510
So it was shocking.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.840
Because they were wasting
their time listening to me

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.800
unsuccessfully try to
communicate information

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.760
that can help save lives.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.571
So I started doing other things.

00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:36.070
And we're going to
get a five minute

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.280
flavor of the kind of
things we're doing.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.730
So let's play.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.160
You're a team.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.284
Split in half.

00:30:43.284 --> 00:30:45.700
Each one of you choose, are
you on this half or this half?

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.283
You're a team.

00:30:46.283 --> 00:30:47.280
You're a team.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.370
You're a team-- four teams.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.020
There will be one winning team.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.880
The winning team
is the team that

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.970
has the most people standing
by the end of the game.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.430
We'll have a few
practice rounds,

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.580
and then we'll play for real.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.800
OK?

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.250
You are not who
you think you are.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.820
You're not some MIT
student or something.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.780
You are magically, in the magic
circle of this game, a Red

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.070
Cross disaster manager.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.771
OK?

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:14.270
Good.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.910
Someone is celebrating.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:17.680
You're hired.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.740
We have no money,
but you're hired.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.930
So there are three kinds
of things you can do.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.230
And everyone will be standing
when the game begins.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.419
One is to go like this.

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:29.960
This means I hope
there's good rains.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.918
I'm going to take advantage
of this opportunity

00:31:31.918 --> 00:31:34.270
to do good things when
there's good rains.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.040
Train people.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.590
Change the tires of the vehicle.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.010
Build a shelter.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.530
Write a proposal for donors.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.510
Write a report to the donor
that gave me money last year.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.630
All those things, you can
do when it's a nice day.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.520
Now maybe there's
too much rain coming.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.410
Then you can invest
in preparedness

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.390
against too much rain.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.520
You make this gesture
like an umbrella.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.520
And it means you're
preparing against the risk

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.490
of too much rain.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.130
This could be
prepositioning relief items,

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.810
like tents, for those who have
to be displaced with the flood.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:05.680
But it's better to do
it before the flood.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.870
Because if you
wait for the flood,

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.430
then the bridge has
been washed away.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:12.120
And you have no way to take
tents to the other side.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.460
The other option you have is
to do a bucket-- something

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.160
to hold water from the sky.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.900
If there's a risk
of a drought, you

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.690
want to collect water
before the drought

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.520
so people can have
water to drink.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.180
So each one of you
can do three things.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.390
Good rains, you go like this.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:29.824
Too much rain, you go like that.

00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:31.240
Too little rain,
you go like this.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.560
What determines rains?

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.460
The probability distribution
function of precipitation

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.800
based on the past record.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.620
So you guys are affected
by this PDF, this die.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.580
You guys are
affected by this one.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.640
A six is what?

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.730
Too much rain-- it's a
good idea to be like this.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.620
If you're not like
this, you sit down.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.680
You got it wrong.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.940
A one is what?

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.720
Too little rain-- it's a
good idea to be like that.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.060
Otherwise, you got it wrong.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.150
You sit down.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.460
Everything in between is what?

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.200
Good rains.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.170
You better go like this,
or you got it wrong.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.160
Practice round--
everyone stand up.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:18.070
Because the winner is going to
be-- well, let me show this.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.800
Losing players
[? all ?] get it wrong.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.390
You sit down.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.720
You're basically-- not
fired, but people suffer

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.300
because of your bad decisions.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.420
And the winning team is
the team that, at the end

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.580
of the few rounds-- I will
arbitrarily declare the end,

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.650
because in the real
world, there is no end.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.810
We'll have three practice
rounds, and then for real.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.622
Most people standing-- so if you
guys have two people standing

00:33:42.622 --> 00:33:45.080
and you have 10 people standing
and they have less than 10,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.340
you are the winners.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.310
And the winning team
will win a publication.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:54.050
I will explain how you'll
have to fight over it.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:34:02.800
So let's go back
to-- actually, here.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.660
So that you remember the
three things you can do.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.650
Each one of you has
to make a decision.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.560
Two, three, four, or five,
it's a good idea to do this.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.949
Six-- good idea to do that.

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:14.219
One-- good idea to do that.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.900
You can have a
collective conversation.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.310
But each one of you has to
be making one of those three.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.435
If you're making none of
those three, you sit down.

00:34:20.435 --> 00:34:21.639
You're fired.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:27.250
You have 30 seconds to
consult with your teams.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.720
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:52.409
PABLO SUAREZ: The
rains are coming.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.270
Make your decisions.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:03.370
10, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.510
When I say stop, you have
to be in the position.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:13.160
Three, two, one, and-- be
in the position or you're

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.150
fired-- stop!

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.980
OK.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:21.350
Here we see a lot of thumbs
up, two buckets, two umbrellas.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.690
Roughly the same kind of
configuration-- all right.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.380
Let's see what
happens to this half.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.090
Camera, I wish you good luck.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.830
This is for you guys.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:34.260
It is a five.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.850
So if you're like
that, stay standing.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:36.750
Otherwise, sit down.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.750
You didn't invest in the good
things you could have done.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.670
For you guys, let's
see what happens.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.260
And it is a four.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.800
If you're like
that, stay standing.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.680
Otherwise, sit down.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.400
Moving on to your
two-- practice round.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.485
What are you going to do?

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.710
Those who are sitting, stay
sitting, but can give advice.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:59.210
OK?

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.310
Make your decisions.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:15.340
Five, four, three,
two, one, and, stop.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.670
Lots of thumbs up.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.271
Are you with these guys?

00:36:18.271 --> 00:36:18.770
All right.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.510
So you're the only
umbrella on this side.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.370
Let's see how it happens.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:23.960
There we go.

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:26.870
There's

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:27.740
A four.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.860
Thumbs up, stay standing.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.150
Otherwise, sit down.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.940
This team not
surprisingly is weak.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.260
They started with few.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:38.160
Over here, you
guys-- there we go.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.510
A two.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.520
So if you're like that
or like that, sit down.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.445
Now, the last practice round.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.130
You receive this fax.

00:36:55.683 --> 00:36:56.516
That's all you know.

00:36:56.516 --> 00:36:57.570
You got these fax.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.442
AUDIENCE: Are we
using the same dice?

00:36:59.442 --> 00:37:01.650
PABLO SUAREZ: I am answering
your question by saying,

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.290
all you got is this.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.430
There's a deliberate
scarcity of information.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.427
You have 30 seconds to
make your decisions.

00:37:13.427 --> 00:37:14.860
AUDIENCE: Wait, where are we?

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.254
PABLO SUAREZ: You are in the
place with the green pixel.

00:37:18.254 --> 00:37:20.694
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.410
PABLO SUAREZ: 10 seconds left.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:46.793
Five, four, three,
two, one, and, stop!

00:37:46.793 --> 00:37:47.293
OK.

00:37:47.293 --> 00:37:49.080
So in this team,
there's only three left.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.920
One third are investing
in too much rain.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.440
Here we have about eight or so.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.850
Half or more are
investing in this.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:59.580
No one-- oh, only one
person is going for drought.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.540
Over here-- all right.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.580
I see over here we have three.

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.900
So about half, also,
investing in flood protection.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.430
Over here we have more than
before, two out of six.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:16.050
Well, of course, what this
says is that on a normal year

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:20.270
the chances of this is
15%, or about one in six.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.850
One in six is 16%.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.140
But this year, because
of unusual conditions,

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.720
it's a flip of the coin.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.710
So for you guys, I'm
going to flip this one.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:33.620
Of course, you cannot now
change your decision, right?

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.990
It's too late now.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.570
You either sent the tents
or bought the cement

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:38.630
for the shelter.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.420
So I'm going to throw
this up in the air.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.400
If it falls like
this, no problem.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.950
It's like a three.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:48.620
If it falls like this, too
much rain-- 50% chance or so.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.420
It's a good idea to
have the umbrella.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.790
Otherwise you sit down.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.980
If it falls like this,
meaning it stops moving

00:38:53.980 --> 00:39:00.220
and it stays standing, it's
a good idea to have a bucket.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.310
You guys will get
the yellow one.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.654
Ready, set, and go.

00:39:06.654 --> 00:39:07.500
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.333
PABLO SUAREZ: Flood.

00:39:08.333 --> 00:39:10.530
Someone's very happy.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.470
We love it.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.890
So if you're not like
this, you have to sit down.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:19.380
Now notice this interesting
feature of reality.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.620
If you take the right
action, an extreme event

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.710
is not a disaster.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.880
He was prepared.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.640
He's happy that a
disaster happened.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.440
Because he was prepared.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.300
Which is a good thing.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.850
A disaster is only a disaster if
it leads to negative outcomes.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:41.210
If someone tells you it's
going to be 110 degrees today,

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.720
and you have some
health condition,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.094
you turn on the
air conditioning.

00:39:44.094 --> 00:39:45.330
There's no disaster.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.620
Unless there's no energy
for your air conditioner.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.120
OK.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.161
Let's see about you guys.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:53.367
You also got a flood.

00:39:53.367 --> 00:39:54.950
So if you're like
this, stay standing.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.070
Otherwise, sit down.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.960
If this were the end
of the real game,

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.970
we'd have three standing here.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:01.170
No other team has three.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:05.250
So you would be declared
the winning team.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.840
Oh, you got four!

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.670
So my apologies.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.850
You would be declared
the winning team.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:12.160
Congratulations.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.050
Now.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:14.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.580
PABLO SUAREZ: Thank you.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.780
Everyone sit down.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.290
And now we're going
to see what you

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:22.060
would do for real
in this scenario

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.280
where we have climate change.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.800
Have you heard of
climate change?

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.620
Things are changing.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:32.570
This is based on the past
record of precipitation.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:36.850
But the past no longer
explains the present.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.820
Things are changing.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.660
So I hereby introduce
you to climate change.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:50.060
This one is going
to be for you guys.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.930
I'm going to throw this up in
the air with some spin, just

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.060
like the dice.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.572
Look at you.

00:40:55.572 --> 00:40:56.280
I love this face.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.351
This is a very
productive silence.

00:41:00.351 --> 00:41:01.850
I'm going to throw
it up in the air.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.100
if it falls like this,
it means normal rains.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.240
No problem.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.900
It's like a three-- a
good idea to go like that.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.350
If it falls like
this, too much rain.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:12.664
It's a good idea to
invest in your umbrella.

00:41:12.664 --> 00:41:13.580
AUDIENCE: Oh I get it.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.820
PABLO SUAREZ: If it falls like
that, what is it representing?

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:21.170
It's too little rain-- bucket--
good idea to go like this.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:22.590
This is for you guys.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.629
We're going to imagine we
play three consecutive years.

00:41:25.629 --> 00:41:26.670
Can you hold this for me?

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:27.503
No spinning, please.

00:41:27.503 --> 00:41:28.560
No throwing.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.000
For the other half, we
have this other one,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.240
which is also climate change.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.210
But the climate doesn't change
in the same way in every place.

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.150
So I'm going to throw
this up in the air.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.540
If it falls like this,
it means no problem.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.670
Good idea to go for thumbs up.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.580
If it falls like
this, too much rain.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.360
If it falls like
this, too little rain.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.730
Go for that.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.430
As a team, you have two minutes
to come up with a decision--

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:56.090
or more likely, one minute.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.460
Go.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:22.360
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.735
PABLO SUAREZ: Less
than a minute.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.065
30 seconds.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.950
10 seconds.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:45.290
Everybody stand up.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.520
Make your decisions.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:59.675
Five, four, three,
two, one, and, stop!

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.590
All right.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.350
Compared to the first
round with the die,

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.280
there's much more
proportion of people

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.390
investing either in too much
rain or in too little rain.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:15.580
Can you notice any
difference between this half

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.065
and that half?

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.830
Not really.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:27.170
Very substantial, phenomenally
different climate change

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.800
projections coming
from science-- this

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.200
could be like the
IPCC report, right?

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.680
And yet, you don't know how to
interpret those differences.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.810
Thank you for incarnating what
happens in the real world.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:39.360
OK?

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.660
We just are very
confused to understand

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.550
that the risks are higher.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.929
So I will not roll it.

00:43:45.929 --> 00:43:47.970
Because I would rather
keep sharing with you some

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.150
of the things we were doing.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.440
But I can share with
you that you already

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.195
have-- no, I want to know!

00:43:55.195 --> 00:43:56.350
Let's play.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:59.530
I want to see what the
climate will bring.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:01.610
And that's exactly the point.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:05.260
We are creating your
appetite for learning.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.977
And that's what games can
help me and my colleagues do.

00:44:08.977 --> 00:44:10.685
We have a bunch of
[? reckless ?] people,

00:44:10.685 --> 00:44:13.101
and suddenly they want to know
the real climate projection

00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:14.330
for their project site.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:14.830
All right.

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:17.480
Everyone can sit down.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.650
So we went through
this-- oops, sorry.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:23.490
This is where I wanted to go.

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:28.950
So that's the fax
that Yusef received.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:31.800
You played, and you had many
more people going like that--

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.630
which is the right thing to do.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:34.880
Now it's 50-50.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.670
It could have been
that it doesn't flood.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.680
But if you understand
the risks, you

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.040
can say to the
face of your staff,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.600
to the face of your donor, or
to the face of the communities

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.870
you're helping, look.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.590
I had reasons to act that way.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:51.480
Because it went from one
in six to one in two.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.420
And games can help process that.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.020
What games can do is to
help embed information

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:02.180
into a system where
decisions have consequences,

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.200
and shape of the
information that becomes

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.120
available for the next turn.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.691
So you can have more or
less resources and so on.

00:45:09.691 --> 00:45:10.191
Yes.

00:45:10.191 --> 00:45:10.816
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:10.816 --> 00:45:12.646
I was wondering.

00:45:12.646 --> 00:45:15.592
If you have a 50-50
chances, right,

00:45:15.592 --> 00:45:20.255
and let's say it turns out
you made the right choice

00:45:20.255 --> 00:45:23.448
this year, why not invest
more into better measurement

00:45:23.448 --> 00:45:24.430
[? increments? ?]

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.700
PABLO SUAREZ: Exactly!

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:29.250
Why not invest more
in better everything?

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.190
We can.

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.100
But we don't have the money.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:32.600
Right?

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.930
So we're talking to
Lincoln Lab and donors

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.450
and so on to help us
improve our ability

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:43.351
to sense what is going on in
terms of hazards-- including

00:45:43.351 --> 00:45:45.850
too much rain, too little rain,
and other things-- including

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.750
vulnerabilities--
it's not the same

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:51.510
for me to be exposed to
100 degrees of heat wave

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.910
versus to an elderly
person with asthma.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:54.524
Right?

00:45:54.524 --> 00:45:55.940
And it's the same
with capacities.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.990
What do we have, in terms
of skills and knowledge,

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.180
in terms of equipment,
in terms of experience?

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:08.330
The disease chikungunya--
has anyone heard of it?

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.880
So what are you going to do
if an outbreak of chikungunya

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.120
comes out to MIT tomorrow?

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:13.620
Right?

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.160
Knowing can help.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.210
Sensing can help you
make better decisions.

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:22.300
In short, in my experience,
only games can do this.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.930
Only games can get a
bunch of people together,

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.680
and in a very short
time understand

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.430
the role of information in
the context of decisions

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.490
that will have
consequences-- including

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:34.990
lifesaving or
life-losing consequences.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:37.530
This is an example--
I'm going to skip it,

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:38.674
so I can get to the end.

00:46:38.674 --> 00:46:40.090
But basically,
games can also help

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.620
you collect data and compare
one scenario versus another,

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.050
and see which are the things,
the aspects of the real world,

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.600
where people are failing
to get something.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.550
And so you can
target your efforts

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:54.610
in capacity-building
training, et cetera.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.950
This is one of the things
I will talk to you about.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:04.150
I will want you want to help
us design games or playful

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:07.650
activities that can help people
make their decisions based

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.570
on forecast, as
opposed to always doing

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.840
as if it were the normal die.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.310
And then if there's a
flood, as the forecast said

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.200
was more likely, you
go, eh, I don't know.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.300
I wasn't prepared.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:22.460
Which is what happens
quite frequently.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.979
There are many advantages.

00:47:23.979 --> 00:47:25.520
One is that we get
better performance

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.040
in terms of outcomes--
fewer sick people.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.020
Better efficiency-- so you
save more per unit money

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.100
or equipment or et cetera.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.110
Flexibility-- people
can do more if they

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:36.594
understand the forecast.

00:47:36.594 --> 00:47:38.260
If you know that
Katrina is about to hit

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.600
your village or
your city, there's

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.970
more you can do in anticipation,
as opposed to waiting.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.370
And once it slams,
there's very few things

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:47.760
you can do at that point.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.020
Because if you step out of
your door, you're in trouble.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:55.590
Games can create the
appetite, through confusion.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:59.280
With the cone, you
were like, huh?

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.930
We deliberately
create systems that

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:08.020
push people to the
tolerable edge of confusion.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.260
So that they want to
figure out, to make

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.770
sense of what's going on.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.280
And then participants
themselves-- individually

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.580
or in conversation with
peers, they go like, huh.

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.470
So if we do this
and this happens,

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:21.940
I'll be better off than
if I do this other thing.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.220
The aha moment-- the
epiphany, the revelation--

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.720
is constructed by the players.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.040
And that has much
more lasting effect

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.350
than if I give you the answer.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:36.740
No one remembers the answer if
no one was asking the question.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:41.900
Very few examples-- these
cones are the result

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.784
of a collaboration with the
World Bank Chief Economist

00:48:45.784 --> 00:48:46.950
for Sustainable Development.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.510
He was trying to explain
a confusing concept called

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:51.239
deep uncertainty.

00:48:51.239 --> 00:48:52.780
[? Jana ?] over
there-- can you wave,

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.900
[? Jana? ?] She's my partner in
game design, and facilitation,

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.400
and life.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.340
She had the brilliant idea of
taking-- our cone had surgery.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:48:59.840
Sorry.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.650
Our cat had surgery.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:05.220
And she thought, how about
using the cone of shame--

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.650
you know, for the creature not
to lick its surgery-- she said,

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:12.040
how about using that for
depicting this uncertainty?

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.680
Now we had students tossing
each one of those cones

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.840
100 times to see the
probability solution,

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.851
with and without
spin, and augmenting

00:49:20.851 --> 00:49:22.600
the gap between what
you think will happen

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.480
and what actually happens.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.060
A few other cases-- this
is from Hanoi University

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.210
of Science and Technology.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:33.470
These was with 350 students
playing a game on dengue.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.075
It's like a rock
paper scissors, where

00:49:35.075 --> 00:49:36.390
three players are mosquitoes.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:40.100
And they can either bite, or
with your blood, lay eggs.

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.980
And the other
players are humans.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.950
And they can either
protect from biting

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:46.820
or attack the breeding grounds.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:51.630
This was designed by students
at game design students

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.060
at [? Parsons ?] and
professors collaborating

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.380
with the other students.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.990
This one is a
publication from NASA.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:04.040
It doesn't get more NASA
than a rocket launch.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.510
But if you look here, it says,
Erin Coughlan-- former intern

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:09.340
and now staff in my team.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.820
And the Red Cross/Red Crescent
Climate Centre project.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:17.350
You go to page 47, and you
see [? Munu. ?] [? Munu ?] is

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:20.000
a volunteer of the
Zambia Red Cross,

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.810
from the village of Kazungula
in Western Zambia on the Zambezi

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.750
River.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:30.180
I mean, there's not much
electricity or NASA-ness

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.520
in Kazungula.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.810
But he was trained as a
facilitator for a game

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.860
where, with cards
and dice, there's

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.020
rain that happens over there.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.650
So her cup gets some water.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.850
And then from her cup,
she passes the water

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:47.900
to the person next to her,
representing the upstream going

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.650
downstream.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.570
She can get more water or not.

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.100
And it keeps going
until maybe he

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.350
gets water to overflow his cup.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.820
He's in trouble, unless he
takes some action ahead of time.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.720
And the game we're
designing is not only

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.520
with cups and to mimic
the upstream/downstream.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.710
But we're also making a digital
game where people actually

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.900
monitor river levels.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.450
And they make predictions.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:15.010
They make bets as to what the
river level will be in two days

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:16.170
or so.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.680
And then the winner wins points.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.800
But they can use points to
buy information from upstream.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.310
And then with that data we're
developing a hydrological model

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.690
that can help us better know
what is going down the stream,

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:31.310
and are we going to
have more flood trouble?

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:35.170
As you can imagine, it's
awesome to have NASA report

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:39.180
on some little project in
Western Zambia, in part

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.060
because we know
that we can partner

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.600
these on-the-field
game-based data

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:48.120
collection with satellite image
for ground truthing and so on.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.870
This one-- because we
are being recorded,

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:54.840
I will not disclose
the full story.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.590
But in short, we play the
game that had the same story.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:51:59.890
You play with a 6-sided die.

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.530
You know your probabilities.

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:04.160
It was being played with
the top-level climate

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.295
scientists in this planet.

00:52:06.295 --> 00:52:07.920
And as you can see
on the left, there's

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.440
all sorts of calculations
with probability distributions

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.880
and the cost benefits and so on.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.470
Then we change the
probabilities on them.

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:16.870
And then we gave them that.

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:18.536
Just like you were
saying, what is that?

00:52:18.536 --> 00:52:19.619
What are you going to use?

00:52:19.619 --> 00:52:22.350
We just gave them that
graph and the caption.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:24.766
And some of them were
saying, but wait a second.

00:52:24.766 --> 00:52:26.390
Why are you giving
me this information?

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:29.310
It's completely useless in
the context of my decision

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:30.640
situation.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.100
And then we told them,
this is the information

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.900
that you yourselves produced
in the summary for policymakers

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.040
of climate science stuff.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.280
And they became fully
aware of the need

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:46.040
for them to improve the way they
communicate climate science.

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:52.130
This-- you may
recognize that dude.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.600
I think it's the last time I
wore a necktie-- at the White

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.460
House.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:57.880
I was given five minutes.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.840
I begged for seven.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.910
Seven minutes given, preceded
by extensive PowerPoint

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:06.450
presentations or other
forms of uni-directional,

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:11.352
so I had an audience that had
brain wave activity declining.

00:53:11.352 --> 00:53:12.060
And I said hello.

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:12.940
My name is Pablo.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.180
And this is not a Frisbee.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.030
It's a hurricane.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.684
Everybody stand up.

00:53:17.684 --> 00:53:19.100
And people were
somewhat confused.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:19.910
Some were standing.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.118
Others were distracted, and
they saw people standing,

00:53:22.118 --> 00:53:22.833
so they stood.

00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:23.300
And I said, OK.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.383
I'm going to throw this
frisbee in some direction.

00:53:25.383 --> 00:53:26.120
It's a hurricane.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.010
If it hits you in the
chest, it's trouble.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:30.520
You're suffering.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:34.430
Now if you sit down, it will
fly above your head, no problem.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:35.786
It's like evacuation.

00:53:35.786 --> 00:53:37.160
But if you sit
down and evacuate,

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.640
and the hurricane goes
in some other direction,

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.390
someone may still
your refrigerator.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:43.040
Right?

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.130
You're doing the wrong thing.

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:48.800
So where it will go will be
determined by these two dice.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.710
So you either say standing
or sit down to avoid it.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:53.170
And I throw the things.

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:53.790
And I look.

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.984
And I throw in this direction
and in this direction.

00:53:55.984 --> 00:53:56.900
People were being hit.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.120
There was huge confusion.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.050
No one understood
what was going on.

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:01.990
And then someone got it.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:03.280
Double one, I throw over here.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.000
Double six, I throw over here.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.680
Interpolate.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.764
So someone figured it out.

00:54:07.764 --> 00:54:08.679
They said, oh, a nine!

00:54:08.679 --> 00:54:10.030
It will go in that direction.

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:11.590
Everybody sat down.

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:12.590
And I threw the frisbee.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.000
And it flew elegantly
until it hit

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.910
the wall of the White House.

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:19.720
And then I said, well,
you know, climate science

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.290
can give us this.

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:22.330
Think Katrina.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.090
Think all that we could do.

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:25.310
We're here to help.

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:26.210
Thank you.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:28.760
And that game was memorable.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.830
It opened doors.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:32.270
And it created
awareness of the value

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.160
of linking climate
science with decisions

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.120
of the humanitarian sector,
of the government sector,

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.660
and beyond.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:43.210
So game play beats
PowerPoint in a million ways.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:46.070
For me, as someone who has
to help others take actions

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.390
that save lives, I'd
say first of all,

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:49.740
there's active learning.

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.080
When you were playing, and you
were confronted with that fax,

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.490
you were saying, what is that?

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:55.400
What does it mean?

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.300
And what should I do about it?

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.080
It's about action.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.590
And there's plenty of peer
to peer-- no, but look!

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.910
If it's 50%-- and people
learn from each other.

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:07.880
There are plenty
of "aha" moments.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.280
It's fun, but it's serious.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.390
And the fact that
it's fun is important.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:14.050
Neuroscientists, including
some in this building--

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:18.050
I think Satra works
here-- have evidence

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.840
that if you are
emotionally engaged,

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.440
your learning goes
deeper and lasts longer.

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.420
There is also the
ability to collect data.

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.350
I didn't go into it.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.900
But that's one of the things
I'd be keen on using with you,

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.380
if you are able to make
a digital game that

00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:35.100
can collect data and help us
understand, what do people

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:35.600
know?

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.474
What do people think?

00:55:36.474 --> 00:55:38.795
What do people want?

00:55:38.795 --> 00:55:40.920
And then we can use it as
an optimization platform.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.190
How much should we do?

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:44.180
How many people should
stand up next time

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.760
we have that forecast?

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.859
It's like a Monte Carlo
simulation, right?

00:55:48.859 --> 00:55:49.900
You do things many times.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.690
And you figure out,
what are the things

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:55.270
that you call optimal, based
on objective or subjective

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:56.370
metrics?

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.495
That's the website for my
team-- climatecentre.org.

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:04.190
Note the British spelling.

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:07.430
This is at the core--
why we love games.

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.660
There's an
experiential learning.

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.540
That's from our conversation
with your colleagues

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.630
at the Lincoln Lab.

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:17.430
You want to do things,
reflect what would happen,

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:19.900
form abstract concepts--
maybe I should do this

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.960
or that-- test it, and do
it again in a better way.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.890
And it's much safer to
do this in game play

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:27.350
than to do it in the real
world, where if you fail,

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:28.915
you can fail soundly.

00:56:28.915 --> 00:56:31.040
These are some of the
partners we have worked with,

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.710
including UN system, academic
organizations, Rockefeller

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.950
Foundation, and many other
partners like Oxfam America

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:38.900
and so on.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.990
It's been delightful.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:45.440
We have severe shortage of human
capacity to make this happen.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.990
We have Jana, who will likely
come as a resource person

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.890
to interact with you
when I'm traveling,

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:53.790
which will be a lot
over the coming months.

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:54.950
There may be other
colleagues who

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:56.280
live in New York, who may come.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.114
We also have Willow.

00:56:57.114 --> 00:56:58.863
Willow, would you like
to wave your hands?

00:56:58.863 --> 00:57:00.830
Willow is very likely
to become a consultant

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:03.940
for my team going
to Nairobi to help

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:07.920
people use digital devices
to map risks at the community

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.420
level.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:11.070
Maybe there's a way to
infuse it with games.

00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:15.310
She already developed games
for Tanzanian communities.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:20.920
So in short, I wish you all
the best-- learning a lot

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:24.900
from these guys, doing a
lot based on what you learn,

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.850
and your own motivations.

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:28.880
And whether you like
it or not, project four

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.010
will involve doing
something for us.

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.671
Thank you in advance for
accepting those rules.

00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:34.670
And there shall be more.

00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:36.270
Thank you very much.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:40.440
Oh and by the way, I will
leave this with you guys.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.550
It's our publication--
a shared endeavor

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:48.040
of my Red Cross team and Boston
University Pardee Center.

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.210
It's called, "Games
for a New Climate--

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:53.600
Experiencing the Complexity
of Future Risks."

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.940
I promise you it's fun to read.

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.365
And it's available
online for free as a pdf.

00:57:58.365 --> 00:58:00.490
ANDREW GRANT: I'm going to
talk about game engines.

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.670
And before I do, if
you want to think

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:03.380
a little bit about one of the
things that Pablo was saying.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:04.990
It's about, one of the
things that a game does

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.656
is it forces you to look at what
happened, and sort of say, huh?

00:58:07.656 --> 00:58:09.650
You figure out why
did that happen.

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:11.209
And then you try to fix it.

00:58:11.209 --> 00:58:12.750
And that's actually
one of the things

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:14.620
I think is very much
like programming.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.636
If you're trying to write
code, and something goes wrong,

00:58:17.636 --> 00:58:19.760
often that's what the
process of debugging is like.

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.360
You go, why did the
screen flip upside down?

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.425
That just makes no sense.

00:58:23.425 --> 00:58:24.800
And then you have
the aha moment.

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.520
And you can go and fix it.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.922
Turns out that making software
is a lot like playing a game.

00:58:30.922 --> 00:58:33.380
So anyway, we're going to talk
about game engine selection.

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.622
Because one of your early
tasks will be to sort of

00:58:35.622 --> 00:58:36.550
try out a game engine.

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:38.700
We're not going to be using a
game engine for the first game

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:39.395
project.

00:58:39.395 --> 00:58:40.845
But we want you
to be ready for it

00:58:40.845 --> 00:58:42.053
when it comes to project two.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.320
Now the first
thing to realize is

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:50.441
that digital games are
basically a software project.

00:58:50.441 --> 00:58:51.940
They share a lot
of things in common

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.440
with software in general.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.024
You're going to have a UI that
your user has to interact with.

00:58:56.024 --> 00:58:58.398
There's going to be something
going on in the background.

00:58:58.398 --> 00:58:59.900
For a commercial
or business offer,

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.205
it might be a
database or something.

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:04.330
There's probably going to
be either a design you're

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:04.890
working from.

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:05.849
Or you're making it up.

00:59:05.849 --> 00:59:07.265
Or maybe you've
got a customer who

00:59:07.265 --> 00:59:08.520
cares about what's going on.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.550
You've got features.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:10.340
You've got bugs.

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.230
We've got task lists.

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:13.790
All of the same sort
of managementy things

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:16.980
that happen, happen on software
projects and game projects

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:18.225
the same way.

00:59:18.225 --> 00:59:20.100
There's a little bit of
a difference, though.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.975
Games are a little bit
harder in some ways,

00:59:22.975 --> 00:59:23.850
and easier in others.

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:24.340
But we're going to
talk about the ways

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.130
that they're harder, because
that's more interesting.

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:30.109
The thing that happens with
most business software-- or even

00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:31.150
something like Photoshop.

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:32.780
Have any of you used Photoshop?

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:33.599
Excellent.

00:59:33.599 --> 00:59:35.390
Photoshop is one of
those software packages

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:39.050
that-- a lot of people like
to take classes in Photoshop

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:40.841
before they get started.

00:59:40.841 --> 00:59:42.590
If you sat down to
Photoshop, you probably

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:45.360
didn't think to yourself,
wow, this is easy.

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.780
And if you did, wow.

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:51.620
But basically, Photoshop has
hundreds, or perhaps even

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.180
thousands, of features in
there that you don't know about

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.250
until you've taken the classes.

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:56.875
And if you want to
figure out something

00:59:56.875 --> 00:59:59.450
about Photoshop, your best bet,
really, is to go to a search

00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.870
prompt.

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.411
And go to your favorite search
engine to find out what to do.

01:00:02.411 --> 01:00:03.620
Or ask someone who knows.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.161
Because actually
trying to figure out

01:00:05.161 --> 01:00:09.430
Photoshop from first principles
is really, really, really hard.

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:11.790
The thing is that with a
game, you can't do that.

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:13.100
You can't get away with that.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.720
If your game is
complex, no one's

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.679
going to take a training class
to learn how to play your game.

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:20.220
Now it might be the
case that someone

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.680
will look at a walkthrough
or a cheat sheet or something

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.370
to play your game-- after
they've played for three hours

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.890
and decided they liked it.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.090
But they're not going
to do that first.

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:31.285
That's a general, broad,
sweeping generalization.

01:00:31.285 --> 01:00:32.910
There are some people
that like nothing

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:34.670
more than to read the
manual for a game.

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:36.730
They mostly died out
about 10 years ago.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.910
But there are still
some hanging on.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:42.460
Generally speaking, nowadays,
you're going to play the game,

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.230
and then you're going
to decide if you're

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:45.864
going to read the
instructions or not.

01:00:45.864 --> 01:00:48.030
And this is going to be
true for your games as well.

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:50.310
So your UI task-- your
user interaction piece

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:52.330
for your game-- is
going to be hard.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:54.820
And the only way to make
sure that works properly

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:58.590
is to test it over and over
again, as early as possible.

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.090
So that's one way
in which games are

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.680
going to be a little bit
harder than normal software.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.320
Also, games have to be fun.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.270
And we use the word
fun kind of loosely.

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:09.780
And we're always scared
of using the word fun.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.190
Because there are serious games.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.314
There are games that are
supposed to make you think

01:01:13.314 --> 01:01:15.470
instead of get a big
smile on your face.

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:18.510
But what they have to be is
engaging, or interesting.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:19.890
Photoshop's not a great example.

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.320
If you're playing with
Photoshop as an undergrad,

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.740
you're probably thinking to
yourself, this is kind of fun.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.640
But if you're using a fancy
piece of software for work,

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.590
you're not doing that
because it's fun.

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:33.330
You're probably doing it because
someone's paying you to do it.

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:36.325
The games-- not so much.

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:38.700
People are going to play it
because they want to play it,

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.180
and for really no other reason.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.720
So your game has to be fun.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.130
And what you think is fun
they may not think is fun.

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:45.440
So the only way to make
sure that your game is fun

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.950
is to find some
users really quick,

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:50.371
and try out your game on them
as soon as you possibly can.

01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:52.620
The same thing happens with
your game play difficulty.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.220
By the time you're
done with your game,

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.053
you're going to think
the game was too easy.

01:01:56.053 --> 01:01:56.720
I guarantee it.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.090
And everyone who plays
it for the first time

01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:59.131
will think it's too hard.

01:01:59.131 --> 01:02:01.270
I guarantee that, too.

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:04.050
So you have to test it with
other users, not yourselves.

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:06.250
Because you will think
your game is too easy.

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:08.810
And you'll be wrong.

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:10.790
And then, of course,
finally, your game

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.291
may have an impact
you want to have.

01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:14.165
And I'm going to keep
saying this over again.

01:02:14.165 --> 01:02:15.860
You're going to have
to test your game.

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:18.540
Remember, there's a theme that's
going to keep going on here.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.960
And we're going to use
this theme with absolutely

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.730
everything we do.

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:22.360
When you're playing a
game, you try something.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:22.910
It doesn't work.

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:23.701
You think about it.

01:02:23.701 --> 01:02:24.760
You try something new.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.480
When you're developing a game,
you're going to try something.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.438
It's not going to work.

01:02:27.438 --> 01:02:28.360
You try something new.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.810
When you're trying to make your
team work smoothly together,

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:31.680
you're going to try something.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.800
And that's not going to work.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.950
And you'll try something new.

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:36.340
We're going to talk about that
circle over and over and over

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.131
again in the class.

01:02:37.131 --> 01:02:40.140
Because it works.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.620
So moving on, we're going
to talk about game engines.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:48.300
And if I talk to
quickly, as I have

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.140
a habit of doing-- even more
so when I'm talking to people--

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.586
let me know.

01:02:52.586 --> 01:02:53.460
Tell me to slow down.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.586
So this is the game
you want to make.

01:03:03.586 --> 01:03:04.210
It's beautiful.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.935
This is the tools
you have to make it.

01:03:09.935 --> 01:03:12.884
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:12.884 --> 01:03:15.300
ANDREW GRANT: So obviously,
what you're really going to do

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.900
is going to be somewhere in
between these two extremes.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.790
And you have to think
really hard about how

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:22.200
you're going to accomplish it.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.290
The vast majority of game
developers, especially

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.165
new ones, are going to
come into it thinking,

01:03:26.165 --> 01:03:29.064
this is the awesome, perfect
thing I want to create.

01:03:29.064 --> 01:03:30.980
And then they're going
to come to their tools.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.970
And they're going to discover
that it's really hard to do.

01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:36.020
And so I encourage you--
rather than thinking

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.290
of the big vision of
what you want to make,

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:41.560
and then figuring
out how to get there,

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.670
I recommend thinking
about what you've got.

01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:48.730
And then figure out,
what can you make?

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:50.910
Now these are a couple
things you can do here.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.410
One, reduce in
your mind the scope

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:54.960
of the thing you're
going to make.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.340
You're not going to
make your favorite RPG.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.010
You're not going to make an MMO.

01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:03.140
If you try, we
will laugh at you.

01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:10.670
You will occasionally
think about this top row.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:11.930
How do I get the awesome thing?

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:13.679
But I really want to
encourage you instead

01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:15.720
to think, as much
as you possibly can,

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.970
this is what I know how to do.

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.470
These are the tools I have.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:21.020
What awesome thing can
I do with these tools?

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.301
Rather than, how do I get over
there when I'm way over here

01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:24.800
right now?

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:33.120
This is a quote
from a discussion

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.200
I had with a game
team once where

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.650
we were talking about a
particular technical problem.

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:39.980
And I said, how hard is that?

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:42.010
And the developer
says, well, it's

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:43.660
really hard because of this,
that, and the other thing.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:43.860
I said, wait.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.500
Stop.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.040
Actually I didn't mean that.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.680
I don't care how hard it is.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.889
What I want to know is, how
long is it going to take?

01:04:49.889 --> 01:04:52.096
And we're going to say that
a lot in this class, too.

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:53.890
We're going to say,
how hard is something?

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.132
And often what we
really mean is,

01:04:56.132 --> 01:04:57.340
how long is it going to take?

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.780
Because we don't
care if it takes

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.580
an hour of really hard
thinking, to some extent.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.040
What we care is that
it takes an hour.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.620
If it's going to
take you an hour

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.775
to do an easy thing-- like
sort a bunch of yellow stickers

01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:11.650
and a bunch of orange
stickers because that's

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:12.972
part of your game prototype.

01:05:12.972 --> 01:05:14.930
If it takes an hour to
do that, that's an hour.

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:16.721
It doesn't matter that
that's an easy task.

01:05:16.721 --> 01:05:17.270
That's time.

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:18.686
And you have to
be careful how you

01:05:18.686 --> 01:05:20.989
spend your time in this
class-- actually, through all

01:05:20.989 --> 01:05:22.280
your classes at MIT, I suspect.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.140
But in this class,
we know that you

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.370
don't have enough time
to get done every thing

01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:28.760
that you want to get done.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.384
And so you have to
think very carefully

01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:32.516
about how you spend your time.

01:05:32.516 --> 01:05:35.690
It turns out that game
development is already hard.

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:37.800
You don't need to
add hard stuff to it.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.680
So a lot of what we're going to
focus on with choosing a game

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.000
engine and all the
decisions you make is you

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.050
want to write as little
code as possible.

01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:52.140
And that's not because
we're afraid of code,

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.180
but because every line of
code you write is time.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.916
Every 10 lines of code
you write is a bug.

01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:00.374
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:01.350
ANDREW GRANT: Right?

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:03.205
So what we want to do
is minimize the number

01:06:03.205 --> 01:06:04.330
of lines of code you write.

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:06.371
We want to minimize the
number of bugs you write.

01:06:06.371 --> 01:06:08.550
Because when it gets
to be the bug stage,

01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:11.050
that takes even more time--
to find it, to fix it,

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.390
to write new code to fix it.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:16.340
So we want to reduce as much
as possible all of that time.

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:23.700
So we want to use
all the tools we

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.950
can to reduce the amount of
code we're going to write.

01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:29.030
One of our big ones is we use
what we call paper prototyping.

01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:30.270
We don't actually mean paper.

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:33.680
We mean whatever materials
you can use-- chalk,

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.920
pieces of plastic,
dice, frisbees.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.260
Anything you can use to make
your game without writing

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.410
a line of code,
you should try it.

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:41.140
Test it that way.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:44.030
Because it's so much
faster to test it that way.

01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:45.749
When else do we have up here?

01:06:45.749 --> 01:06:47.790
Iterative design-- I've
talked about this before.

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:48.850
We're going to use
the phrase iterative

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.760
design to talk about that whole
cycle where you try something,

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.440
see how it worked or didn't
work, change it, try it again.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.230
That's iteration.

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:59.237
And we're going to talk about
that a huge, huge amount.

01:06:59.237 --> 01:07:01.070
And one of the big parts
of this, of course,

01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:02.110
is game engines.

01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:03.770
Which is not to say
that you're going

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.760
to build your game engine.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.690
But rather, you're
going to try stuff.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.940
And the game engines will
let you iterate faster,

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:12.580
do more with less code,
and get more done.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.060
All right.

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:18.410
So again, you're going
to use a game engine

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:19.534
to save yourself some time.

01:07:19.534 --> 01:07:21.332
You don't want to
reinvent the wheel.

01:07:21.332 --> 01:07:23.040
I'm confident that
you could write a game

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.060
engine if you wanted to.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.760
But I don't think
it's worth your time.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.472
Someone else has
already done it.

01:07:28.472 --> 01:07:30.930
They may or may not have done
a better job than you can do.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:33.140
But you can bet that
the thing that you're

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.590
going to get from
your game engine

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:36.092
will be faster than if
you stopped and wrote it

01:07:36.092 --> 01:07:36.670
from scratch.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.415
And then finally,
the game engine

01:07:41.415 --> 01:07:43.790
that you write from scratch--
for every 10 lines of code,

01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:44.577
you've got a bug.

01:07:44.577 --> 01:07:45.660
I'm making that number up.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.660
But it sounds good.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.890
That means that a game
engine you write has bugs.

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:51.800
Now I'm not going to
claim that the game

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.154
engines that we're
going to suggest you use

01:07:54.154 --> 01:07:54.820
don't have bugs.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.330
They totally have bugs.

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:59.650
But what we have is 10,000
monkeys on the internet,

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:02.130
using that game engine,
reporting the bugs.

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:04.680
And there have been a lot of
cycles of people fixing bugs.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:08.756
And so hopefully, the worst
ones are out of your way.

01:08:10.956 --> 01:08:12.830
The other thing you can
do with a game engine

01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:14.820
is you can use it
as you tinker toys,

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.149
as we talked about before.

01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:18.311
Your game engine has a list
of things it does well.

01:08:18.311 --> 01:08:18.810
Great.

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:21.069
Use those things as tools.

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:22.060
Take advantage of that.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.890
Do everything you
can with those tools.

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:27.300
And if it can't do
something, don't fight it.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.069
Don't say, game engine, darn
you, if only did this thing.

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:34.369
Think, how can we change
our design to not need that?

01:08:34.369 --> 01:08:35.910
That's another
advantage you can use,

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:37.034
another trick you can play.

01:08:37.034 --> 01:08:38.990
If you limit your
design, sometimes it

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.500
increases your creativity.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.791
And it can actually help you
get your game done faster.

01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:49.189
So throughout this
class, I use this phrase.

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:50.439
I'm not sure anyone else does.

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:53.512
But I consider certain
things to be nooses.

01:08:53.512 --> 01:08:55.720
There are some things we
will tell you you cannot do,

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.220
or that we tell you
not to do, flat out.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.870
And those things--
don't do them.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:01.370
OK?

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.453
But there are some things
that we're going to say,

01:09:03.453 --> 01:09:05.060
we recommend that
you don't do that.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:09.910
Or, you know, no team has
tried that and succeeded yet.

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:11.870
Those I consider nooses.

01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:13.510
You can try them.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:15.189
And you can put
your head in there

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:17.109
and see how comfortable it is.

01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:18.738
But probably by the
end of the class,

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.029
you'll say, wow, you know what?

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:22.760
When you said not to do
multiplayer networked play,

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.600
you were right.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.210
We have heard that every year.

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:30.720
We will hear it this
year, I suspect.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.370
But again, we're not telling
you to never try crazy things.

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:38.189
But merely be aware of
what the crazy things are.

01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:40.789
If we're suggesting that you
not try something, but not

01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:43.330
telling you you can't do it,
and we're looking kind of pained

01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:45.340
when we say it, be
aware that this is

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.756
a huge risk for your project.

01:09:46.756 --> 01:09:49.130
Be aware that this is a place
where you should be putting

01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:52.210
a lot of early attention to make
sure that you have a back-up

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:54.572
plan if it fails.

01:09:58.290 --> 01:09:58.850
All right.

01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:59.659
On we go.

01:09:59.659 --> 01:10:02.200
Now we're actually going to talk
a little bit about the thing

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.660
we're supposed to talk about.

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:05.720
Picking a game engine
is super important.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.060
Everything involved in
your game relies on it.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.660
But again, contradictorily,
don't worry about it.

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.660
Because you have four projects.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:17.055
And the first one doesn't
count for game engines,

01:10:17.055 --> 01:10:18.680
because you're not
using a game engine.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.710
But for two and three,
I'd say experiment.

01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:21.920
Try some stuff out.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.425
By the time you
hit project four,

01:10:23.425 --> 01:10:25.300
you should have some
opinions about what game

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.580
engine works well for you.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.745
And try to get there.

01:10:28.745 --> 01:10:30.870
Try to use the one you're
comfortable with by then.

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:34.729
But experiment on the first two.

01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:36.270
No game engine's
going to be perfect.

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:37.130
They all have flaws.

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:38.330
They all have advantages.

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.282
And your job is to
find the game engine

01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:42.490
whose advantages you like
and whose disadvantages you

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:44.860
can live with.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:48.570
And that will be different
for different people.

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:49.070
All right.

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.730
Here we go.

01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:50.830
So the most important
things we're

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:52.100
talking about for
game engines-- this

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.120
is not an issue for this class.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.910
We're only recommending
free game engines.

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:56.920
But in general, if you're
trying to pick a game

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.330
engine or a software of
any kind to help you,

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:01.420
these are the three
categories of cost.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.960
I call things free if you
don't care about the cost.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.140
If it's $20, it's
practically free.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:11.680
But if it's $1,000 and
you're a college student,

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.400
that's not free.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.490
That's painful.

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:16.160
And if you're corporation,
however, $1,000 is free.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.960
So these categories change.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.670
For us, we're
talking about free.

01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:24.115
Impossible is CryENGINE
or something brutal

01:11:24.115 --> 01:11:26.340
where you get the source
license and do everything.

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.160
But we're not going to do that.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.118
So this is the first one
that actually matters.

01:11:30.118 --> 01:11:31.840
It's does your game
have requirements

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.644
that the game
engine has to meet?

01:11:33.644 --> 01:11:36.060
And for most part, in this
class, this also won't be true.

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:39.272
Because you can choose your
requirements based on the game

01:11:39.272 --> 01:11:40.230
engine you're choosing.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:41.771
And our games are
pretty small scope.

01:11:41.771 --> 01:11:44.360
But basically, if you
need a special input,

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.140
if you want to
publish to iOS, if you

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:53.630
need to support network play--
which you don't, remember--

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:56.700
then that might affect which
game engine you choose.

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:04.310
This one is actually my
biggest important thing.

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:06.270
Whatever you choose
for your game engine--

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:07.810
and we're actually going
to give you a short list.

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:09.610
So it's not quite
the open free-for-all

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:11.250
you might be worried about.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:13.160
It should be easy to learn.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.920
And there's a couple
reasons for that.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.964
But the main reason is simply
the amount of time you've got.

01:12:17.964 --> 01:12:19.130
We don't have a lot of time.

01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:21.590
You don't want to spend time
mastering a game engine.

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:24.270
You want to spend time mastering
the art of creating games.

01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:26.492
So you want to pick something
that's well-documented,

01:12:26.492 --> 01:12:28.200
that's got a good
online community that's

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.670
going to help you out.

01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.170
Even if you don't
ask the questions,

01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:32.770
in a big enough
online community,

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:34.750
someone's already asked
the question you have.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.130
I suspect you're all
familiar with this point.

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:38.650
We can do a search for the
question you have on something.

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:40.880
And some forum post pops up
where someone else has already

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.050
asked the question you have.

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:43.660
And you just read the
answers and think, yay!

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:44.493
There was an answer.

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:46.080
Or probably, there
wasn't an answer.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.592
I'll look at a
couple more of those.

01:12:47.592 --> 01:12:49.550
And so you can get an
idea for your game engine

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:52.810
as to how robust the community
is, how good the support is,

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:55.050
by sort of looking and
seeing how much support there

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:55.980
is online for it.

01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:01.500
One thing on in-house experts--
it's very common for a team

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.420
to come together and
say, well, we all

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.580
know this game
engine a little bit.

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.430
But there's this one
person on our team

01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:09.637
who's just an expert
in this other one.

01:13:09.637 --> 01:13:11.970
So we're going to rely on
that person to really teach us

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:12.840
how to do it.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.620
That only, only works if
that person is really willing

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.590
to be a teacher.

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:19.670
And it's not a bad
thing if they're not.

01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:22.440
But don't choose their engine
based on their expertise

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.360
if they're not willing
to really be a teacher.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.740
And what I mean by that
is that that person will

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:30.405
have to be willing to not
write code a lot of the time.

01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:32.780
Because their time is better
spent teaching everyone else

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.810
how to write code.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.900
And that really means
that if you find yourself

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.316
in that situation,
where you think

01:13:38.316 --> 01:13:40.380
that you are the expert
in a particular engine,

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:42.254
and you're trying to
get your team to use it,

01:13:42.254 --> 01:13:45.640
really think about yourself and
how you're feeling about that.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.270
Make sure that you are willing
to not dive in and write

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.770
the code.

01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:50.894
Make sure that you're
willing to help everyone else

01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:51.990
do it instead.

01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:54.630
Because that is going to
leverage more of your team.

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:56.960
On a small enough
team, that's not true.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.419
So on your two- or
three-person team,

01:13:59.419 --> 01:14:01.210
you can probably get
away with that expert.

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:02.950
On an eight-person
team where five of you

01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:06.330
are coding something, you really
can't lean on that one person

01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:06.890
that heavily.

01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:08.306
You're going to
need to spread out

01:14:08.306 --> 01:14:09.950
the knowledge as best you can.

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:16.006
And so some game engines are
easier to learn than others.

01:14:16.006 --> 01:14:17.880
It's not just a matter
of the online support.

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:23.390
But we'll get to
that in a little bit.

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:25.850
On a team programming
project-- and this

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:27.277
is a personal bias of mine.

01:14:27.277 --> 01:14:28.860
And I admit that
some people disagree.

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:32.110
But I personally think that
a strongly typed programming

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:34.460
language is a must.

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:39.310
If you're talking about
five to eight programmers,

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:41.170
there's an additional problem.

01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:42.882
Whenever I write a
function, and you're

01:14:42.882 --> 01:14:44.340
going to call my
function, you have

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:46.610
to know what the arguments are
to know what's going to happen.

01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:48.830
And a strongly typed language
will enforce that contract.

01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:51.121
It will make sure that we're
on the same page, at least

01:14:51.121 --> 01:14:53.960
a little bit, as to what
that function is doing.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.040
A lot of you are probably
used to-- MIT teaches,

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.540
in a lot of the
programming classes,

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.970
it uses Python, which is
awesome for quick work.

01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:02.410
And it's awesome for a
single person doing work.

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:04.190
But it does kind of
start to fall apart

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:07.080
on a larger team, when you have
to read someone else's code

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.800
to know what their
function is doing,

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.870
what the arguments
are supposed to be.

01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:14.680
If instead, you have a strongly
typed from the beginning,

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.780
the compiler will enforce
this communication.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.880
And we're going to talk a lot
about teams and communication.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.690
It turns out your code is one of
your methods of communication.

01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:26.770
The actual written
text in your code

01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:28.554
is a way you talk to
your team members.

01:15:28.554 --> 01:15:29.970
And a strongly
typed language sort

01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:33.740
of forces you to keep that
communication line clearer

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:37.740
than a weakly typed
language will.

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.250
And again, this is one
of those things where

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:43.080
programmers might have battles
over whether or not it's true.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.780
But I'm pretty
confident of this one.

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.113
I would say it's a noose to
use a weakly typed language.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.140
A lot of our game engines are
going to be talking about C#,

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:56.760
or ActionScript or whatever.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.895
And I'm going to tell you
that if you know one of those

01:15:59.895 --> 01:16:02.020
languages-- if you already
know Java, for example--

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.160
it's really easy to
transition to C#.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.100
It's pretty easy to
transition to ActionScript.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:10.400
ActionScript and Haxe
are very similar.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.470
So I would say any
of those top four,

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:15.320
you can transfer back
and fourth pretty easily.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.390
JavaScript, kind of.

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:21.980
But don't try to transition
to C++ from those quickly.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:25.140
I mean obviously, you should
someday learn C++ if you are

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.480
considering yourself a
Course 6 major or whatever.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.035
But don't assume you could pick
up C++ in a weekend because you

01:16:31.035 --> 01:16:33.130
already know Java.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:37.940
They're just gotchas in C++ that
don't exist in those languages.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.370
And other important
note, if you know Java--

01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:42.972
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:42.972 --> 01:16:45.263
ANDREW GRANT: It really looks
like you know JavaScript.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.390
And you kinda do.

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:50.880
But you don't.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.740
And that's not to say that you
shouldn't make that transition.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:56.073
But be aware that it's going
to take a little bit longer

01:16:56.073 --> 01:16:57.032
than you think.

01:16:57.032 --> 01:16:58.490
There's a lot of
synthetic sharing.

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:00.740
But JavaScript is a
weakly typed language

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.330
that has a lot of weird,
very web-specific features.

01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:06.255
And just be aware that that's
not as easy a transition.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.149
I talked about ease of
understanding and learning.

01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:16.190
Actually using the engine
is also very important.

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:18.570
How are you going to
get stuff done in it?

01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:22.142
If the engine has an interactive
debugger, that is wonderful.

01:17:22.142 --> 01:17:23.850
If it doesn't, then
you're relying mostly

01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:25.190
on print statements.

01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:26.940
And that's hard.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.840
If you've never really had the
joy of using a debugger before,

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.210
I recommend you try to learn.

01:17:31.210 --> 01:17:33.730
Because it's really an
extremely powerful tool.

01:17:33.730 --> 01:17:36.322
We're not going to get into
that in detail right now.

01:17:36.322 --> 01:17:38.530
And source-control-friendly
is another important one.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:40.113
If you're on a team
with eight people,

01:17:40.113 --> 01:17:41.700
you're all going to
be making changes.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.650
We're going to talk more about
source control in the future.

01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:45.370
We're not going to go
into details on that now.

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:46.700
But basically, it's
a way for your team

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.824
the team to communicate
and make sure you're always

01:17:48.824 --> 01:17:51.340
in the same, up-to-date
source code for your project.

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.380
And if your engine
doesn't support that,

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.130
then you can be in trouble.

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:57.600
In the past, for
example, people have

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.300
talked about some of the cool,
sort of hobbyist game engines,

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:04.330
like GameMaker, or back in
the day, just bare Flash.

01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:06.297
And those are really cool tools.

01:18:06.297 --> 01:18:07.880
But they would save
the entire project

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.430
as one monolithic binary file.

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:13.016
And so if one person
makes a change,

01:18:13.016 --> 01:18:15.390
no one else can change the
code while they're doing that.

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:18.370
Because there's no way
to merge our changes.

01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:21.390
Whereas with code or text
files, or a good game engine

01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:23.020
that separates things
out a little bit,

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.440
one person can
change an art asset

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.130
while someone changes a code
file, while someone else

01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:27.610
changes yet another code file.

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:29.533
And it all merges together
pretty seamlessly.

01:18:29.533 --> 01:18:31.533
And that's what you're
looking for, if possible,

01:18:31.533 --> 01:18:32.300
on a team project.

01:18:35.281 --> 01:18:37.030
I talked about this
before, but you really

01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:39.170
want a product that's
been around a little bit.

01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:42.750
It's cool as a hobbyist
thing or a solo product

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.530
to take on something
really brand new.

01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:46.206
But I think for a
class where you're

01:18:46.206 --> 01:18:48.080
trying to get stuff done
really, really fast,

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.030
and you're working
with a team, you really

01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:54.249
don't want to go too far in the
direction of the new, latest,

01:18:54.249 --> 01:18:55.040
and greatest thing.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.330
Because you want to
have a game engine

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:57.940
that people have
put some miles on.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.190
They've tested it and
shaken out some of the bugs

01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:01.090
before you get to it.

01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:05.884
All right.

01:19:05.884 --> 01:19:07.300
Those are things
that I consider--

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.260
you've got to have
them for a game engine.

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.607
Here's some stuff
that's kind of nice.

01:19:12.607 --> 01:19:14.690
Yeah, it's nice to be able
to easily import images

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:16.810
and sounds and stuff like that.

01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:20.360
It's nice to be able to get
the source code to the engine.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.730
But it's not essential if
the engine's well documented.

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:24.530
Let's see.

01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:26.150
It's nice if you have an
integrated development

01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:27.950
environment that can help
you with auto-completion

01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:29.866
of various functions and
really help you along

01:19:29.866 --> 01:19:30.850
with your development.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.660
Definitely nice,
but not necessary.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.400
And then finally, an
editor of some kind--

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.410
if I want to lay out
my levels in some way,

01:19:38.410 --> 01:19:40.760
is there a graphical
editor for me to do that?

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.677
That's certainly nice.

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:44.051
And a profiler that would tell
me where my game is slow--

01:19:44.051 --> 01:19:45.040
that's also nice.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.738
But without these things,
you could probably get by.

01:19:51.129 --> 01:19:52.670
Bells and whistles--
this is actually

01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:57.080
relatively unimportant,
especially for a small project,

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.630
prototype-style stuff that
we're going to be talking about.

01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:01.102
For the most part,
you don't need

01:20:01.102 --> 01:20:03.310
all the fancy stuff like
particle systems and shaders

01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:04.890
and physics and all that stuff.

01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:06.810
You might use physics
in this class.

01:20:06.810 --> 01:20:09.624
But be careful.

01:20:09.624 --> 01:20:10.790
So that's one of the things.

01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:12.664
You don't need that
stuff in your game engine

01:20:12.664 --> 01:20:15.680
for most small games, at least
in the scope of this class.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.180
These are things
that I really don't

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.951
care about-- scripting languages
that your designer might use.

01:20:19.951 --> 01:20:22.450
Why is your designer not writing
code in your strongly typed

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:23.040
language?

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.070
I never understood that one.

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:27.040
Some designers are
afraid of writing code.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.498
But hopefully in
this class, you're

01:20:28.498 --> 01:20:31.852
at least willing to
try writing some code.

01:20:31.852 --> 01:20:33.810
And then finally, just
because someone has made

01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:35.299
a beautiful game
in a game engine,

01:20:35.299 --> 01:20:36.840
that has no bearing
on whether or not

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.180
your game will be beautiful
in that game engine.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:43.520
The vast majority of the time,
a game built in a game engine

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.130
is beautiful because they
have a really good art team.

01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:49.810
And we don't have a
really good art team here.

01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:51.330
We don't have the
time to do that.

01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:53.038
And we don't have the
resources to do it.

01:20:53.038 --> 01:20:55.780
So you shouldn't
measure your game up

01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.664
against the beautiful AAA games.

01:20:57.664 --> 01:20:59.080
You should be
measuring your games

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.330
up against some indie, quick,
prototype type of games.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.916
All right, so
Flixel is the thing

01:21:08.916 --> 01:21:10.790
we've been recommending
for many, many years.

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:16.030
This is the game engine that
is easiest, has the quickest

01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:17.730
learning curve I've seen.

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:19.010
It gets everything done.

01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:22.080
It's very quick
to learn, to use.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.820
And it runs on the web.

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:24.360
Great.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.970
That's pretty good easy stuff.

01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:30.440
It was developed by Adam Atomic
for a game called Canabalt,

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.800
that you can see up there.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.230
The game that, as far
as I know, sort of

01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:39.580
popularized the infinite
runner genre, which we've seen

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.160
clone after clone
after clone of.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.035
But I believe this
is at least where

01:21:43.035 --> 01:21:44.300
it entered my consciousness.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.920
And therefore, it must be where
it came into the world, right?

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.041
But anyway.

01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:51.290
The cool thing about it is
it's got a very, very, very

01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:55.120
simple object-oriented
state-based system.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.430
It's really, really good
for 2D sprite stuff.

01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:00.930
Last year, we had a bunch of
game engines for people to try.

01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:03.320
By the end, pretty much
everyone just used Flixel.

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.170
Because it was easier to use.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:08.767
And this kind of
says it all to me.

01:22:08.767 --> 01:22:10.350
Even if you haven't
used ActionScript,

01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:13.820
the learning curve
on Flixel is awesome.

01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.890
You'll spend a day
or two staring at it.

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:18.510
And then you'll know most of
everything there is to know.

01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:20.146
And you'll just be
able to do stuff.

01:22:20.146 --> 01:22:22.100
You won't be able
to do all the cool,

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.160
awesome stuff other game
engines will let you do.

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:26.480
But you'll be able to do
pretty much everything you'll

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.840
need to do on the scale
and scope of games you're

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:29.881
looking at in this class.

01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:35.570
Let's see.

01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:37.827
It doesn't so good at GUI.

01:22:37.827 --> 01:22:39.910
If you wanted a fancy GUI--
lists and lots of text

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:41.540
and buttons and
sliders and stuff--

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.530
it's kind of a pain
to code that up.

01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:46.370
Right.

01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:50.110
So Flixel is also unfortunately,
in its current form, kind

01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:51.300
of in an end of life cycle.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.060
And I've been saying that
for two or three years now.

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.280
And it's still holding on.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.610
Because Flash is
still holding on.

01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:58.370
Adobe is trying
to sort of get out

01:22:58.370 --> 01:23:00.760
of the business of maintaining
Flash as a web development

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.370
place.

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:03.657
And I'm not really sure why.

01:23:03.657 --> 01:23:05.240
Apparently, Adobe
decided a while back

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.060
that HTML5 was the future.

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:09.730
But it's been four
or five years now,

01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:12.790
and HTML5 is still
not the future.

01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:14.570
In the meantime, we're
sort of hanging on

01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:17.605
with Flash and the occasional
JavaScript HTML5 thing.

01:23:17.605 --> 01:23:19.730
I suspect it was actually
more of a financial thing

01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:22.080
than any actual HTML5
preference thing.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.960
But anyway, we're trying
to get out of Flixel

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:27.390
a little bit in the long term,
because Flash is going to be

01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:28.961
a dying platform pretty soon.

01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:31.790
PHILLIP TAN: Can I just
add something to that?

01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:33.400
ANDREW GRANT: Please.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.370
Stand near me.

01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:36.002
Because I have a microphone.

01:23:36.002 --> 01:23:36.960
PHILLIP TAN: All right.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.760
I'll stand right next to him.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.100
So the mic can pick up.

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:44.960
One thing to keep in mind-- that
are free versions of the Adobe

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:48.430
compiler for Flash, called
Flex, that you can download

01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:51.630
for Linux, Mac, and PC.

01:23:51.630 --> 01:23:54.500
However, there is also
this licensed version,

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.580
which you can download
for a 30-day trial,

01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.920
called Flash Builder.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.350
Unfortunately for Mac
users in particular,

01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:09.060
if you want to get
those, I use it.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.440
I like writing code in it.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:14.050
But as soon as that
30-day free trial is over,

01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:16.990
you are on an annual
subscription paying Adobe money

01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:18.380
every year.

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.990
So "free" with an asterisk.

01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:26.280
If you want to do free
development on a Mac

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.550
and use Flixel, be
very, very careful.

01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:34.276
And use this upcoming
exercise to actually ensure

01:24:34.276 --> 01:24:35.900
that the things that
you're downloading

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.608
and the things that
you're signing up for

01:24:37.608 --> 01:24:41.680
are actually free, and not
free for the first 30 days.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.470
For PC users, you have
the advantage of using

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:46.310
FlashDevelop, I believe.

01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:48.494
That's what it's called.

01:24:48.494 --> 01:24:50.620
That is actually a
tool that you get

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.466
without having to pay for it.

01:24:52.466 --> 01:24:54.590
For Linux, you are
pretty much stuck

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.640
to using command-line compilers.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.240
And if you really want to do
free development on a Mac,

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.990
you're also using
command-line But there's

01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:04.500
all kinds of clever things that
you can do with text editors

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.440
to sort of make that a
little bit more comfortable.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.760
But just keep that in mind.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.700
That's another reason
why Flixel isn't

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:14.130
our number one choice, nowadays,
is because Adobe's really

01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:17.450
trying to squeeze money out of
everybody, including students.

01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:19.247
Adobe's insane.

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:20.663
ANDREW GRANT: One
can't blame them

01:25:20.663 --> 01:25:21.520
for trying to make a
little bit of money.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.811
However, it's no longer as
attractive as it used to be.

01:25:23.811 --> 01:25:26.150
That's certainly true.

01:25:26.150 --> 01:25:27.740
Unity is the next
one on our list

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.260
that we've had
good success with.

01:25:32.945 --> 01:25:34.570
It's a free,
full-featured game engine.

01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:36.977
It's got all the bells and
whistles you could want.

01:25:36.977 --> 01:25:38.560
It's a little bit
dangerous to use it,

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.690
because it has all the bells
and whistles you could want.

01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:42.400
And you should probably
only use some bells, and not

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.890
the whistles, and whatever.

01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:45.680
You should be very
careful and judicious

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.050
in your use of the features.

01:25:47.050 --> 01:25:49.216
Because the tinker
toy model of, only

01:25:49.216 --> 01:25:51.590
do what the engine lets you
do is a little bit dangerous.

01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:53.630
Because it lets you do
pretty much everything.

01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:55.379
So you have to be very
careful about which

01:25:55.379 --> 01:25:57.550
features you choose to use.

01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:59.020
However, it's great.

01:25:59.020 --> 01:25:59.570
It's free.

01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:02.140
It does a whole
bunch of neat stuff.

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.620
There are paid versions.

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:07.480
But you won't need them
for the class, certainly.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.150
I call these disads.

01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:11.770
3D is harder than 2D.

01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:14.980
And 3D is at least three
times as hard as 2D, really.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:16.170
It's rough.

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.690
If you've never
done 3D before, it

01:26:17.690 --> 01:26:19.914
takes a while to get
your head into it.

01:26:19.914 --> 01:26:21.580
Even if you're doing
a 2D game in Unity,

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.038
sometimes you have to think in
3D a little bit, which makes

01:26:24.038 --> 01:26:25.660
it a little bit harder to use.

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:28.790
On the other hand, Unity
does have this nice editor.

01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:30.630
And it's possible
for a non-programmer

01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:32.690
to get some stuff done
in Unity in a way that's

01:26:32.690 --> 01:26:33.940
not possible in others.

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.090
You spend more time
learning the GUI.

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:37.048
But you can actually get
some more things done.

01:26:37.048 --> 01:26:40.430
So it's an interesting
little trade-off there.

01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:43.950
It is also, again,
not good at GUI work.

01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:46.140
They're starting to
address that a little bit.

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.290
But it's hard.

01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:49.581
You have to kind of hand code
your buttons a little bit

01:26:49.581 --> 01:26:50.160
sometimes.

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.390
That is improving, as I say.

01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:54.350
But it's not quite there yet.

01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:56.870
It suffers a little bit
from the problem of merging.

01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:59.490
Unity uses particular
objects that you really

01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:02.540
wish you could merge-- just so
they're text files or code--

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.290
but you have a whole scene
of objects, for example.

01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:07.775
And only one person can
really work with it at a time,

01:27:07.775 --> 01:27:09.200
unless you're
really very careful.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.466
So when you're using
Unity, you have

01:27:10.466 --> 01:27:11.910
to be extra careful
with your team

01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:13.630
to make sure that
people aren't messing

01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:15.300
with the same files
at the same time.

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.465
The code, however, works
the way you want it to.

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:18.970
And source control works fine.

01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:20.470
So you've got to be careful.

01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:21.981
But you can work around it.

01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:28.885
Moving on to the ones that--
you know, we want some of you

01:27:28.885 --> 01:27:29.920
to practice with these.

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.750
But-- oops, that's
the wrong one.

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:36.245
I left a slide in
I shouldn't have.

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:39.945
I will ignore that.

01:27:43.412 --> 01:27:46.420
Let me see if I
can find it here.

01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:46.946
All right.

01:27:46.946 --> 01:27:48.570
Apparently I did not
include the slides

01:27:48.570 --> 01:27:51.000
I thought I included about
the two other game engines.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.610
So I'll talk about
those instead.

01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:55.370
So there's another engine
call Haxe Flixel, which

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:59.830
is sort of a port of Flixel
to a language called Haxe.

01:27:59.830 --> 01:28:02.535
This is an engine that
we have not used yet.

01:28:02.535 --> 01:28:04.177
We've looked over
it a little bit.

01:28:04.177 --> 01:28:05.760
And it certainly
looks very promising.

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.635
It's using the very
same Flixel style.

01:28:07.635 --> 01:28:09.510
It is, however, using
an interesting language

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:11.650
named Haxe, which is mostly
based on ActionScript.

01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:15.130
But it has some Java and
C#-like features to it.

01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:16.710
It does some crazy
stuff, though.

01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:18.780
So it might be a little
bit interesting to use.

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.520
Haxe compiles down to a language
of your choice, which it then

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.270
compiles.

01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:26.526
So for example, if you want
to export your Haxe to Flash,

01:28:26.526 --> 01:28:28.900
you'll compile your Haxe to
ActionScript, which will then

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.580
get compiled to a Flash app.

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.990
Or if you want to
make an iOS app,

01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:39.500
you'll probably compile it to
the [? XCode ?] Objective-C,

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.660
and then compile that.

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.070
But basically, it tries to
be all things to all people.

01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:44.552
Which is really
kind of dangerous.

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:46.760
But hopefully, for the kind
of smallish project we're

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.370
talking about, that'll be find.

01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:51.850
I call that one a noose,
because we haven't used it much.

01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:55.370
But it has all the simplicity of
Flixel for the Haxe Flixel game

01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.870
engine.

01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:58.274
So that is a good thing.

01:28:58.274 --> 01:29:00.190
The other one we're
looking at using this year

01:29:00.190 --> 01:29:04.286
is called Phaser, which we know
not too much about in this lab.

01:29:04.286 --> 01:29:05.660
The Education
Arcade is using it.

01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:07.040
And they seemed to like it.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:12.540
And it is an ActionScript,
HTML5 style of engine.

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.775
That is not the
most mature platform

01:29:14.775 --> 01:29:16.900
to build on, because of
all the browser differences

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:17.733
and stuff like that.

01:29:17.733 --> 01:29:19.110
But it is certainly possible.

01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:21.279
I recommend if you
end up using Phaser

01:29:21.279 --> 01:29:23.070
that rather than coding
in pure JavaScript,

01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:26.080
you code in TrueScript,
which is basically a strongly

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.729
typed version of JavaScript.

01:29:28.729 --> 01:29:30.020
We'll get on to the rest of it.

01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:31.020
PHILLIP TAN: TrueScript?

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.089
TypeScript?

01:29:32.089 --> 01:29:33.380
ANDREW GRANT: Sorry TypeScript.

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.150
Yes, TypeScript.

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:40.810
So when you're
learning an engine,

01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:41.930
you start with tutorials.

01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:43.530
That's the easiest thing to do.

01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:45.280
Once you've learned
three or four engines,

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.530
you might not use tutorials.

01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:47.940
But until then, I would
say you should actually

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:50.231
go through something that
someone's written and thought

01:29:50.231 --> 01:29:52.910
about how to progress.

01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:54.270
Do something extremely small.

01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:56.770
Don't start with the be-all and
end-all game of awesomeness.

01:29:56.770 --> 01:29:59.610
Start with something
very, very easy.

01:29:59.610 --> 01:30:01.310
And then after you've
done that, you're

01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:03.464
going to discover that
you've done some things.

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:05.380
Then read the documentation
a little bit more.

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.338
Because you're going to
be better at picking up

01:30:07.338 --> 01:30:09.300
stuff after you have
questions in your head.

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.770
Even if you don't realize
what questions you've got.

01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:14.350
And we're warming
up to an assignment

01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:15.590
where we're going to
hand you a game engine

01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:17.881
and you're going to take a
look at it over the weekend,

01:30:17.881 --> 01:30:18.740
or over the week.

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.260
But the thing you
need to remember

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:24.550
is that all software
really does suck.

01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:26.125
And game engines
are no exception.

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:31.733
At this point,
invariably, somebody

01:30:31.733 --> 01:30:35.370
will claim that
Linux doesn't suck.

01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:38.110
To which I'll have to
claim that it does.

01:30:38.110 --> 01:30:39.500
But it's also awesome.

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.560
And that's the thing about
software and game engines.

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:45.490
You have to really
understand and appreciate

01:30:45.490 --> 01:30:47.990
the ins and outs of Linux to
understand the ways in which it

01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:50.573
really does suck, but there are
ways in which it's really also

01:30:50.573 --> 01:30:52.520
really awesome.

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:56.540
Operating systems all, really,
are pretty bad, I suspect.

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.590
Windows and Mac-- you
can make huge arguments

01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:59.350
about all of them.

01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:00.766
Photoshop we talked
about earlier.

01:31:00.766 --> 01:31:02.360
It's an awesomely powerful tool.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.776
But to sit down and actually
start using it as a beginner,

01:31:04.776 --> 01:31:06.697
as a newbie, is a
miserable experience.

01:31:06.697 --> 01:31:09.030
I think you've probably all
had very similar experiences

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.840
with software.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.540
It's buggy.

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.040
It's painful.

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.570
This is true for
game engines, too.

01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:14.840
You're going to try
out a game engine.

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.290
And you're going to probably
come back to class thinking,

01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:17.000
I tried Unity.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:17.750
It was terrible.

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:19.333
I didn't understand
what was going on.

01:31:19.333 --> 01:31:20.140
It was really hard.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.830
And then you'll hear someone
else talk about Flixel.

01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:24.288
And you'll think, wow, I didn't
have any of those problems.

01:31:24.288 --> 01:31:25.590
And so this is the trick.

01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:27.590
All software sucks.

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:29.820
And your job is to find
the software that sucks

01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:32.820
in ways that you can handle.

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.960
Right?

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.800
You don't mind so
much that you have

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.620
to think in 3D for
Unity, because you're

01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.810
willing to put up
with that because you

01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:42.490
get these cool,
nice, rendered look.

01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:44.200
Or maybe you have to
deal with the fact

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.890
that, yeah, Flixel's
written in ActionScript 3.

01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:48.260
And ugh, I hate that language.

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:50.120
But boy, it sure is easy to
put stuff up on the screen,

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.869
and have spaceships
moving around shooting

01:31:51.869 --> 01:31:53.703
each other in, like, a
day, with no problem.

01:31:53.703 --> 01:31:55.535
And these are the kinds
of trade-offs you're

01:31:55.535 --> 01:31:56.754
going to have to look at.

01:31:56.754 --> 01:31:58.420
So when you're trying
to evaluate a game

01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.625
engine, or any piece
of software, really,

01:31:59.625 --> 01:32:01.292
but game engines for
this class, you're

01:32:01.292 --> 01:32:03.500
going to think about the
ways in which it's terrible.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.583
But also think about the
ways in which it's great.

01:32:05.583 --> 01:32:08.370
And when you get together and
talk with a team for projects

01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:11.480
two through four about
what game engine to use,

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:13.860
you're going to want to be
able to say intelligently,

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:16.700
I don't like Flixel
because of these things.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.880
But actually I can
live with those things.

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.220
Or, I don't like Unity
because of this thing,

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:23.877
and I really just
can't get past it.

01:32:23.877 --> 01:32:25.960
And if your team's insisting
on using that engine,

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:28.170
and you really know you
really don't like it,

01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:29.860
consider another team.

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.652
And that's not bad.

01:32:30.652 --> 01:32:32.985
Different people are going
to have different preferences

01:32:32.985 --> 01:32:33.910
for different styles.

01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:35.910
And that's part of what
we're going to be doing.

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:37.010
Any time you're going
to be forming a team

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:38.580
or trying to work
with a team, you're

01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:39.760
going to have to
figure out what works

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.060
for you, what's hard for
you, what's easy for you.

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:44.470
And match yourself up with
tasks or software that

01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:46.800
matches your set of skills.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.490
Or, if you want to
challenge yourself, OK.

01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:51.490
Be ready to challenge
yourself and try something

01:32:51.490 --> 01:32:53.540
that you thought was
too hard or too painful.

01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:54.820
But be aware that
you're doing that.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.100
Because you need to
let your team know,

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.350
hey, I'm going to be on
a learning curve here.

01:32:58.350 --> 01:33:00.600
You're going to
have to help me out.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.920
So as you look at
a game engine, be

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:05.340
aware that it is going
to disappoint you.

01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:06.770
That's just the way it is.

01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:10.890
But try to figure out where
the disappointments are.

01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:16.442
To that end, one of
our assignments-- yes.

01:33:16.442 --> 01:33:19.388
AUDIENCE: Which 2D game engine
would you suggest for those who

01:33:19.388 --> 01:33:22.340
are comfortable
with Java and C#?

01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:24.125
ANDREW GRANT: With Java and C#?

01:33:24.125 --> 01:33:25.625
It kind of depends
on the situation.

01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:32.797
I would actually still
suggest, for most simple--

01:33:32.797 --> 01:33:34.380
which game engine
should I use for 2D?

01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:37.010
And the answer is, if
you have no 3D experience

01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:43.330
whatsoever, I would still
recommend Flixel today.

01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:46.460
If you are comfortable with 3D
and some of the barriers there,

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:47.770
I would go with Unity.

01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:51.490
I personally use Unity
for my own development.

01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:53.730
That said, what
we're going to do

01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:56.135
is everybody's going to take
a look at a game engine.

01:33:56.135 --> 01:33:57.760
So you'll have at
least one of the four

01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.200
that we're talking
about for the class

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.283
that you're familiar with.

01:34:00.283 --> 01:34:02.490
And hopefully in the
next couple of weeks,

01:34:02.490 --> 01:34:05.120
you'll get your own preference.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.750
Because I can easily say, sure.

01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:08.380
Flixel's great for 2D games.

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:10.900
And it is, for the
right kind of 2D games.

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:12.470
It's not good for
all the 2D games.

01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:15.090
An isometric thing with
lots of farms and stuff--

01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:16.330
you might be able to do it.

01:34:16.330 --> 01:34:18.590
But you might be more
comfortable using a 3D approach

01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:19.440
or whatever.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.870
So in other words, it really
depends on the game, too.

01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:22.970
I wish I could give
you an easy answer.

01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:24.803
But I can't, which is
why the whole lecture.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.830
So we have an assignment, which
we'll hand out to you now.

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:37.370
And we're going to talk
about it one week from now.

01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:38.310
And do stay tuned.

01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:41.345
Because we're not done talking
at you, or giving assignments.

01:34:41.345 --> 01:34:43.470
PHILLIP TAN: Do we
hand these out, too?

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:45.933
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, the
game engine tutorial?

01:34:45.933 --> 01:34:48.100
Yes.

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:53.430
What I want you to do is pick
a game engine out of this hat.

01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:56.250
And pass it on.

01:34:56.250 --> 01:34:59.550
If you do not like the game
engine that you get, trade.

01:35:05.275 --> 01:35:06.070
Um, sure.

01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:08.880
Feel free.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.520
Take a handful.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.280
If I run out, I
have more tokens.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.710
But this is what
I start with, just

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:17.706
to make sure there's
a good distribution.

01:35:17.706 --> 01:35:19.080
Just go ahead and
hand this back.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.205
I don't need to be with it.

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:35.160
So one of the things we're
going to do next Wednesday

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.969
is try to do a source
control exercise, which

01:35:39.969 --> 01:35:41.510
will introduce you
to source control,

01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:43.590
and hopefully
refresh some of you.

01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:45.284
So ideally, if you
can, we want you

01:35:45.284 --> 01:35:47.075
to bring in a development
machine, a laptop

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:50.450
if that's what you're
using, on that Wednesday.

01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:51.900
If you only have
a desktop, don't.

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:53.940
If you've got no
computer, don't.

01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.630
But you know, try to
bring in a development

01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:59.560
machine of some kind that you
can actually use on Wednesday.

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:03.880
Ideally, it's the machine
you used to do the tutorials,

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.801
so you have your code on it.

01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:06.390
Let's see.

01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:09.240
What else do we
want to say there?

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.250
We don't want you to
spend more than four hours

01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:12.530
on this exercise.

01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:15.596
There is no "turn in"
for this exercise.

01:36:15.596 --> 01:36:17.096
What we want is,
on Wednesday, we're

01:36:17.096 --> 01:36:18.420
going to be able to talk
about the game engine

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.212
that you looked at.

01:36:19.212 --> 01:36:21.711
We want to be able to talk about
its pluses and its minuses,

01:36:21.711 --> 01:36:22.770
and what was frustrating.

01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:24.186
If it took you all
four hours just

01:36:24.186 --> 01:36:26.269
to install the stupid
thing in the first place,

01:36:26.269 --> 01:36:27.060
that's information.

01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:28.510
We want to know that.

01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:30.680
Because that will help
people choose to not use

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.020
that game engine, for example.

01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.959
But basically, we want to be
able to talk intelligently

01:36:36.959 --> 01:36:39.000
in the groups, amongst
yourselves, about the game

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:39.970
engine pros and cons.

01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:40.880
That's the main goal.

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.050
OK.

01:36:49.050 --> 01:36:52.195
Any questions or
comments so far?

01:36:52.195 --> 01:36:54.278
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] can't
just pick just any one

01:36:54.278 --> 01:36:56.175
of those [INAUDIBLE].

01:36:56.175 --> 01:36:57.050
ANDREW GRANT: Pardon?

01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.150
AUDIENCE: So we can only trade.

01:36:57.150 --> 01:36:58.974
But once you have
the [? others ?]

01:36:58.974 --> 01:36:59.849
you can't [INAUDIBLE]

01:36:59.849 --> 01:37:00.730
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:01.229
Correct.

01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:03.010
Do not pick a game
engine at random.

01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:04.900
You may trade the one
you've got in your hand

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.233
with someone else who has a
different one in their hand.

01:37:07.233 --> 01:37:09.742
This is not just-- it's
partially arbitrary.

01:37:09.742 --> 01:37:11.950
But mostly it's to make sure
that all the engines are

01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:14.000
covered about equally.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.660
Also, there's two
entries for Unity.

01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.284
One is sort of thinking
about it in 3D,

01:37:17.284 --> 01:37:20.420
and one is thinking about it 2D.

01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:23.967
And because Unity has recently
added sort of a 2D layer

01:37:23.967 --> 01:37:25.550
on top of it that
you can sort of use.

01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:27.780
It's a sprite-based engine.

01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:29.770
So we want you to put
that through its paces,

01:37:29.770 --> 01:37:32.967
too, to compare to the
other 2D engines, to Java.

01:37:32.967 --> 01:37:33.800
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.250
ANDREW GRANT: So I've
never had much of a problem

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:38.621
transitioning between the two.

01:37:38.621 --> 01:37:42.360
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.945
ANDREW GRANT: Let's see.

01:37:44.945 --> 01:37:46.320
Yeah, I would
trade if you could.

01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:51.400
RIK EBERHARDT: So,
like we said, this

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.470
is a video game development or
video game production class.

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:58.300
It's about team management,
project management.

01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:00.750
We're spending a lot of time
on those kind of topics.

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:04.210
We aren't spending a ton of time
talking about design in class.

01:38:04.210 --> 01:38:05.290
But we were jerks.

01:38:05.290 --> 01:38:07.790
And we're giving you a really,
really hard design constraint

01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:10.240
to work with for product four.

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:13.720
So we're going to have
some optional assignments,

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.152
optional reading--
basically things that we're

01:38:16.152 --> 01:38:18.110
going to list on Stellar,
and a couple lectures

01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:20.420
we're going to give--
basically just kind of opening

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:22.210
your minds towards design.

01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:25.540
So you can think through some
of the big, hairy problems when

01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.760
it comes to designing
some of these things.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.290
The first thing is talking
about the theme for the course

01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:32.000
for the semester.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.208
So we're talking about
meaningful decisions in games.

01:38:36.547 --> 01:38:39.130
So we're asking you, when you're
creating these four projects,

01:38:39.130 --> 01:38:41.870
to think about what
decisions your players

01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:45.090
are making during the
game at all times,

01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:47.870
and to make sure that all
those decisions they make

01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:50.030
are meaningful.

01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:52.557
And this is going to be
the foundation for the four

01:38:52.557 --> 01:38:53.890
projects that you're working on.

01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:57.410
All the constraints are going to
be based on this kind of thing.

01:38:57.410 --> 01:39:00.520
So first off, what do we
mean by meaningful decisions?

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.500
This is what I
mean when I say it.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.110
There's other
definitions out there.

01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:06.290
But this is the bare minimum.

01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:07.370
It should do this.

01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:09.040
It should have this.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.480
So three things-- any decision
a player makes in a game

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.470
has an effect on the
game's overall state.

01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:18.840
So I make a decision.

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:20.494
Something changed.

01:39:20.494 --> 01:39:22.410
Not only did something
change, but that change

01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:25.420
ripples through the
systems within the game.

01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:27.000
It affects the
entire game state,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.220
the entire game world-- not
just what the player might have,

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:33.120
not just the
player's performance,

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.180
not just the player's abilities.

01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.880
So a jump in these
games-- it can

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.340
be meaningful in some games.

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:42.960
But for this particular game
and this particular use,

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.166
if the jump affects everything
else in the game in some form,

01:39:47.166 --> 01:39:48.290
that was really meaningful.

01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:50.244
And I'd be surprised
to see a jump do that.

01:39:50.244 --> 01:39:51.160
But it probably isn't.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.637
It's probably just a way
to get over an obstacle.

01:39:54.637 --> 01:39:55.720
So there's something else.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.095
There's some other kind of
decision a player has to make,

01:39:58.095 --> 01:40:02.220
rather than just that
one small decision.

01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.249
Third-- there should be
sufficient feedback--

01:40:04.249 --> 01:40:06.540
and we'll talk about feedback
later on and what exactly

01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:11.440
we mean by that-- that lets
the player be aware that they

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.290
made that decision.

01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:13.660
Not only did I make
a decision, but I

01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:14.830
knew that I made a decision.

01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:16.400
There was something
that happened

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:18.670
in the game that prompted
me to make that decision.

01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:20.506
And I actively
made the decision.

01:40:20.506 --> 01:40:22.130
I made the choice to
make the decision.

01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:23.750
I know I made the decision.

01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:28.820
And I actually see all those
effects happen in some form.

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:31.450
At the bare minimum,
I make a decision.

01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:32.950
I see some short-term effects.

01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:35.650
There might be long-term effects
that I don't see right now,

01:40:35.650 --> 01:40:37.964
but I will have the
opportunity to see later.

01:40:37.964 --> 01:40:39.380
That's a little
bit more advanced.

01:40:42.722 --> 01:40:44.180
So basically this
lecture is really

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.240
just going to be talking
about some example games

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.400
that, when we're talking about
the games we would like you

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:53.288
to make in class, these are kind
of the exemplar games for this.

01:40:53.288 --> 01:40:54.996
These are the games
that we think of when

01:40:54.996 --> 01:40:56.850
we think of this kind of thing.

01:40:56.850 --> 01:40:59.312
And the problem that I
think is going to come up

01:40:59.312 --> 01:41:01.770
is we're going to sometimes
call them strategy games, which

01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:05.050
is a really loaded term.

01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:06.050
What is a strategy game?

01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:09.072
Does anybody have a definition
for what a strategy game is?

01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:14.994
Somebody who took-- yeah.

01:41:14.994 --> 01:41:16.994
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:41:16.994 --> 01:41:18.410
RIK EBERHARDT:
Yeah, a game that's

01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:20.380
going to require
a lot of thinking.

01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.990
A game that's going to require--
and by thinking, there's

01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:24.420
a lot of actions
that happen when

01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:25.669
we talk about player thinking.

01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:27.370
Like all right, so I'm thinking.

01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:29.562
So if I'm thinking, I
might not be taking action.

01:41:29.562 --> 01:41:31.270
So I might be thinking
to take an action.

01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:32.520
I might be planning.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.270
That's going to be part of it.

01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:35.140
I might be thinking.

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:38.180
But there's something that's
distracting me for thinking.

01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:40.600
Maybe I have to make
actions really, really fast.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.430
Or I can make actions and I can
think a long period of time.

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:45.450
All that is the
big wide spectrum

01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:47.610
of what we're talking
about with strategy games.

01:41:47.610 --> 01:41:49.990
Can anybody list some
strategy games they've played

01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:51.169
or have heard about?

01:41:51.169 --> 01:41:52.210
AUDIENCE: Age of Empires.

01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:53.959
RIK EBERHARDT: Age of
Empires-- which one?

01:41:53.959 --> 01:41:55.190
AUDIENCE: The second one.

01:41:55.190 --> 01:41:56.231
RIK EBERHARDT: Yes it is.

01:41:56.231 --> 01:41:57.640
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.870
Civilization.

01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:59.370
Yes.

01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:00.090
Which one?

01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:00.640
AUDIENCE: V.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:01.390
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:02.370
I like that one, too.

01:42:02.370 --> 01:42:05.080
[LAUGHTER]

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.410
More.

01:42:07.410 --> 01:42:09.490
What's that?

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.560
No?

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:12.430
AUDIENCE: StarCraft.

01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:13.471
RIK EBERHARDT: StarCraft.

01:42:13.471 --> 01:42:15.018
Which one?

01:42:15.018 --> 01:42:16.375
AUDIENCE: I've only played II.

01:42:16.375 --> 01:42:18.500
RIK EBERHARDT: I played I.
But I haven't played II.

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:19.166
But he plays II.

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:19.810
A lot.

01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:21.638
More.

01:42:21.638 --> 01:42:22.610
AUDIENCE: Fire Emblem.

01:42:22.610 --> 01:42:25.068
RIK EBERHARDT: Fire Emblem--
ooh, that's a really good one.

01:42:25.068 --> 01:42:26.280
Which one?

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.396
All of them, yeah.

01:42:28.396 --> 01:42:28.895
Yeah.

01:42:28.895 --> 01:42:29.340
AUDIENCE: Go.

01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:30.140
RIK EBERHARDT: Go.

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.510
Ooh.

01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:35.250
You took the board game class.

01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:36.440
AUDIENCE: I play MOBAs.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.981
RIK EBERHARDT:
MOBAs-- so which ones?

01:42:37.981 --> 01:42:39.560
What's a MOBA, really?

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.970
AUDIENCE: Like, [? Noldor ?]
or League of Legends.

01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:42.190
RIK EBERHARDT: So what
does MOBA stand for,

01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:43.398
for people who don't play it?

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:48.220
AUDIENCE: Massive
Online Battle Arena.

01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:48.700
RIK EBERHARDT: Massive
Online Battle Arena.

01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:50.160
And you were talking
about League of Legends.

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.743
How many people
here-- raise your hand

01:42:51.743 --> 01:42:54.485
if you played League of Legends.

01:42:54.485 --> 01:42:55.200
OK.

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.680
Riot's coming September 24 to
talk about to us about that.

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.260
How many people have played
DotA, Defense of the Ancients?

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:05.054
The same people,
for the most part.

01:43:05.054 --> 01:43:05.980
Cool.

01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.080
So that's a really good spread.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.220
And actually, that's
exactly what I expected--

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.190
except for the Go
person-- to hear,

01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:15.971
are games about war, and
games about conflict,

01:43:15.971 --> 01:43:17.970
and games about fighting
against another player,

01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:20.370
or against a
computer-controlled opponent.

01:43:20.370 --> 01:43:22.220
That's not exactly
what we mean when

01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:24.560
we talk about strategy
games for the broader

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:25.397
aspect of the class.

01:43:25.397 --> 01:43:26.730
But it's a great place to start.

01:43:26.730 --> 01:43:28.870
And that's where
we're going to start.

01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:34.356
So here's Civilization V,
and here's StarCraft II.

01:43:34.356 --> 01:43:36.230
I'm going to use these
for a couple examples.

01:43:36.230 --> 01:43:38.120
And then we're
going to split off.

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.911
And each of us are
going to talk about some

01:43:39.911 --> 01:43:42.737
of our favorite games that
we think of when we say,

01:43:42.737 --> 01:43:44.070
this was a really cool mechanic.

01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:46.380
This is a really cool thing
I've seen in a strategy

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.002
game, or an aspect of strategy
or an aspect of tactics

01:43:49.002 --> 01:43:50.460
that I've seen,
and I'd love to see

01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:53.240
happen in some of the game we
make over the next semester.

01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:58.080
So there's two types of
decision-making that I see.

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.779
And again, this is all just
me in my head a couple days

01:44:00.779 --> 01:44:02.070
ago putting a lecture together.

01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:04.780
It's not an academic taxonomy.

01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:06.960
It's to help us out
when we're thinking

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.540
about the kinds of decisions
we're making in these games.

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.956
There's two kinds of decisions
that happen in these games.

01:44:11.956 --> 01:44:14.680
There's a micro-level
decision-- short-term decisions

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:17.800
I make that help
me out right now.

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.680
There's macro decisions
or long-term decisions.

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:24.040
And I'm using micro
and macro because I'm

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:26.620
obsessed with economics, even
though I don't understand it.

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:29.780
But also because
you see the games

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:31.120
represented that way sometimes.

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.450
There's the micro,
where I'm looking really

01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:34.360
tight at this one
aspect of the game,

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:37.820
and the macro, where
I can see a bigger,

01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:39.320
expanded version of the world.

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:41.800
I can see the systems
and the gears that

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:43.710
are happening behind the world.

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:45.400
And they're represented
in many ways.

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.284
And I'll talk about a
couple examples there.

01:44:47.284 --> 01:44:48.950
ANDREW GRANT: People
often use "tactics"

01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:53.087
to describe micro, and
"strategy" to describe macro.

01:44:53.087 --> 01:44:55.670
So there's actually a difference
between strategy and tactics.

01:44:55.670 --> 01:44:57.170
That's one way of
thinking about it.

01:44:57.170 --> 01:44:59.440
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.920
So for the micro--
exactly, tactical.

01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:07.214
The way this is
often represented

01:45:07.214 --> 01:45:09.130
in these kind of war
games or strategy games--

01:45:09.130 --> 01:45:11.463
there's usually some kind of
spatial component going on.

01:45:11.463 --> 01:45:13.484
There's some kind of
placement going on.

01:45:13.484 --> 01:45:15.400
There might be some
direct conflict happening.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.250
So I've got an army.

01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:18.800
And it's facing
off another army.

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.820
And we're throwing spears
or shooting each other

01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:25.250
with lasers-- basically
the same thing.

01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:26.690
But there's also firefighting.

01:45:26.690 --> 01:45:28.010
There's another kind of
conflict that happens.

01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:29.676
And by firefighting,
I don't mean fires.

01:45:29.676 --> 01:45:32.745
But I've got a problem
that just happened.

01:45:32.745 --> 01:45:33.934
And I need to solve it.

01:45:33.934 --> 01:45:34.850
I need to react to it.

01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:37.530
So it's reactive.

01:45:37.530 --> 01:45:40.760
I might have this really
long long-term strategy.

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:43.470
But unfortunately I've
got to make some decisions

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:46.169
right now that may or may not
hurt my long-term strategy.

01:45:46.169 --> 01:45:48.210
There are some tactical
decisions I need to make.

01:45:50.775 --> 01:45:52.150
It's not always
reactive, though.

01:45:52.150 --> 01:45:53.450
Sometimes what
we're talking about

01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:54.630
is you're executing a plan.

01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:56.800
I've set up a
long-term strategy.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.680
And now here's the
final dramatic moment

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.780
where I get to actually
implement the thing

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:06.390
and see if it works--
throw the dudes on the map,

01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:09.467
and they're going to die or not.

01:46:09.467 --> 01:46:11.050
And when we're talking
about tactical,

01:46:11.050 --> 01:46:13.490
there's always a
short-term resolution.

01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:15.830
So I do a thing-- feedback.

01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:16.780
I know it happened.

01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:18.794
There could be
long-term ramifications.

01:46:18.794 --> 01:46:20.710
But there's definitely
a short-term resolution

01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:23.940
to the decision I just
made at that point.

01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.370
So my example, because
I am a huge Civilization

01:46:26.370 --> 01:46:31.760
nerd-- Civilization V brought
some very tactical game

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.990
play to the series
that wasn't really

01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:37.140
there in previous installments.

01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:39.350
So in the past, you could
stack units on a tile.

01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:41.700
So Civilization is
basically a game

01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:44.870
made of tiles where you're
placing items on tiles.

01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:47.832
And the tiles give you
bonuses or whatnot.

01:46:47.832 --> 01:46:49.740
That's the very, very
basic version of it.

01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:51.990
In this case, what we have--
and it's kind of blurry--

01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:54.230
but you have a city
in the center, where

01:46:54.230 --> 01:46:56.020
that arrow is pointing to.

01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:58.940
You have these blue units
surrounding the city,

01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:01.900
and a couple small
yellow units going on.

01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:04.682
Can anybody describe what's
going on in this scene?

01:47:04.682 --> 01:47:05.390
AUDIENCE: A raid.

01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.860
RIK EBERHARDT: What's that?

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:06.600
AUDIENCE: A raid.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.516
RIK EBERHARDT: A raid.

01:47:07.516 --> 01:47:09.130
So we're fighting.

01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:10.600
What kind of
decisions is a player

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:13.280
being asked to do right now?

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.090
And the player is
the blue player

01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:16.571
that has the red arrow there.

01:47:16.571 --> 01:47:18.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:19.886
RIK EBERHARDT: What's that?

01:47:19.886 --> 01:47:20.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:20.980
RIK EBERHARDT: So yeah.

01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:22.690
You're trying to
implement the strategy.

01:47:22.690 --> 01:47:24.898
Can you kind of see--
apologies if you can't make out

01:47:24.898 --> 01:47:28.770
the quality of the slide.

01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:33.280
Can you see what is
exactly going on?

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:33.943
Yeah.

01:47:33.943 --> 01:47:36.568
AUDIENCE: They're about to make
a ranged attack with the cannon

01:47:36.568 --> 01:47:37.797
against the city.

01:47:37.797 --> 01:47:38.630
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:47:38.630 --> 01:47:40.440
So first thing is,
all right, so I've

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:45.140
got a range attack that
is really diagonally away

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:46.400
from the city.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.940
It's two hexes away.

01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.190
I can do a range attack on it.

01:47:49.190 --> 01:47:51.330
The cool thing about
this is that the city

01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:53.240
can't attack me right now.

01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:54.510
Well, actually it can.

01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:57.169
But I'm making a mistake there.

01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:58.460
But it's not the knight's turn.

01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:01.210
So the knight can't attack
the ranged attack right now.

01:48:01.210 --> 01:48:03.219
The other thing that's
happening is the player

01:48:03.219 --> 01:48:05.510
had a long-term strategy,
which meant that they brought

01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:08.980
some foot soldiers in
to surround the city,

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:11.900
protecting the ranged attacker.

01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:14.030
They've also got this thing
called Zone of Control

01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.800
going on in this.

01:48:19.728 --> 01:48:23.022
All right, here's
an enemy person.

01:48:23.022 --> 01:48:23.980
Here's an enemy person.

01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.390
Here's an enemy person.

01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:27.620
If any of these
people try to attack

01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:29.710
any of these blue
people, there's

01:48:29.710 --> 01:48:32.020
some kind of negative
modifier going on.

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:35.430
Because the blue player
has set it up such that

01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:37.120
they're being flanked.

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.930
So there's some
spatial placement

01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:41.080
going on that's been decided.

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.370
Not only did they have to
get all the units over here,

01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:44.300
but once they were
here, they had

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:46.200
to put those units
in the right places

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.800
for this tactical
maneuver to happen.

01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:54.990
So really, in
Civilization V, we're

01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:57.420
talking about tactical
in one aspect of it.

01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.250
In the combat
aspect of it, we're

01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:03.590
talking about flanking, army
positioning, Zone of Control,

01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:06.970
preventing other players
from entering into tiles,

01:49:06.970 --> 01:49:10.920
controlling areas, and making
this area basically more

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.320
effective for the
blue player to attack

01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.710
the city than for the
yellow player to defend it.

01:49:17.710 --> 01:49:19.640
So how did the player get there?

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.800
How did blue get
into that situation?

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:26.590
They had an operational
or strategic plan

01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:27.860
that they set forth.

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:30.425
They were able to develop
those weapons that they had.

01:49:30.425 --> 01:49:33.250
They were able to make
them in the right location.

01:49:33.250 --> 01:49:36.030
And then they were able
to transport them over

01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:37.410
to the right location.

01:49:37.410 --> 01:49:42.500
So if we're talking
about military strategy,

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:47.530
tactics, that might be
closer to logistics,

01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:51.515
supply chain, getting
supply into the area.

01:49:51.515 --> 01:49:53.390
The strategy that might
actually be happening

01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:55.050
is even bigger than that.

01:49:55.050 --> 01:49:57.670
So this is where it
gets into the realm

01:49:57.670 --> 01:50:00.230
that I really nerd
out in is spreadsheets

01:50:00.230 --> 01:50:02.400
of numbers and modifiers.

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.900
There's resources
you need to manage.

01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.900
I need to anticipate what's
going to be there and have

01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.510
the right things
built in time for them

01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:14.450
to be useful in that situation.

01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:17.360
There's an economic system
I need to manipulate and do

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:20.992
well with in order to afford the
units that I want over there.

01:50:20.992 --> 01:50:23.450
If I'm playing well, I need to
be proactive in my strategy.

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:26.330
All strategy really
should be proactive.

01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:29.250
And someone can argue with
me if there is such a thing

01:50:29.250 --> 01:50:30.440
as reactive strategy.

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:33.310
But really, it could
be proactive and wrong.

01:50:33.310 --> 01:50:35.390
But you did it beforehand.

01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:37.675
You set up the gears
in motion for it

01:50:37.675 --> 01:50:38.990
to play out the way it did.

01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:41.650
And you're always planning
for some long-term future.

01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:46.160
So in Civilization V, one way
that this plays out non-combat

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.060
is city placement.

01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:52.040
Where I put my city is
incredibly important.

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:56.770
Using the real world map of
Africa, what they've done

01:50:56.770 --> 01:50:59.960
is the designers put
these resources--

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:07.225
those circular items-- spices,
bananas, silk, diamonds, oil.

01:51:07.225 --> 01:51:10.490
Some of the resources
are luxury resources.

01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:12.950
So they help my cities be happy.

01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:16.120
They help my citizens work
well and be productive.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.940
There's agricultural
resources that help

01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:22.090
my cities grow and be healthy.

01:51:22.090 --> 01:51:24.310
And then there's
strategic resources--

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:25.900
and I could be mixing
these terms up.

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.420
They're things that are going
to help me build things.

01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:33.840
So oil or steel or iron will
help me build better units.

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:36.440
So my strategy here--
there's a little bit

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.240
of tactics going on,
where when I actually

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:39.680
get my settler in
the right place,

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.185
I need to then find a
very specific place to go.

01:51:43.185 --> 01:51:45.310
But long-term, if I'm
thinking about the long term,

01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:47.310
I want to place
my cities in a way

01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:49.410
where they're near resources.

01:51:49.410 --> 01:51:51.020
They're near my friendly cities.

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:51.979
They have room to grow.

01:51:51.979 --> 01:51:54.186
Because if I group my cities
too close to each other,

01:51:54.186 --> 01:51:55.790
they're not going
to be as efficient.

01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:57.570
This is really
apparent if anybody's

01:51:57.570 --> 01:52:00.760
played Civilization
II, where there's

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:02.050
one real strategy to the game.

01:52:02.050 --> 01:52:04.809
And that's just build a
city every three hexes.

01:52:04.809 --> 01:52:05.850
That's just how it works.

01:52:05.850 --> 01:52:08.681
And in the later games, they
tried to introduce some nuance

01:52:08.681 --> 01:52:09.180
to that.

01:52:12.545 --> 01:52:16.204
And again, I'm mixing
strategy and tactics

01:52:16.204 --> 01:52:17.370
as we're talking about this.

01:52:17.370 --> 01:52:18.880
They all go hand in hand.

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:21.300
A lot of the games
that we've played,

01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:24.510
and that are these strategy
games that you talked about,

01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:26.270
are actually more
tactical games.

01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:29.810
There's much more emphasis
placed on the short-term thing

01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:31.969
I do now than the long term.

01:52:31.969 --> 01:52:34.260
That's not to say there isn't
long term in these games.

01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:38.375
If anybody's played
League of Legends,

01:52:38.375 --> 01:52:43.940
the metagame about the pick
process, so what champ to pick

01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:45.110
or not.

01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:47.150
That's a strategic maneuver.

01:52:47.150 --> 01:52:48.890
You're planning for
a long-term strategy

01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:51.029
that you're going to
play out within the game.

01:52:51.029 --> 01:52:52.570
And not only are
you planning for it.

01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:54.444
You picked it, and then
you're stuck with it.

01:52:54.444 --> 01:52:56.620
So those decisions last.

01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:58.079
With StarCraft II
it's build order,

01:52:58.079 --> 01:52:59.745
which can be a little
bit more flexible.

01:52:59.745 --> 01:53:01.360
There are build
orders that you can--

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.580
that's build order
in that you are

01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:08.960
building units and buildings
and upgrades in the right order,

01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:11.530
such that you're prepared for
multiple different strategies

01:53:11.530 --> 01:53:12.560
coming into them.

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.851
And I could be butchering that.

01:53:13.851 --> 01:53:14.547
I'm not a

01:53:14.547 --> 01:53:16.588
PHILLIP TAN: That's
definitely a good [INAUDIBLE]

01:53:16.588 --> 01:53:17.569
RIK EBERHARDT: Cool.

01:53:17.569 --> 01:53:18.610
But that's more flexible.

01:53:18.610 --> 01:53:21.000
Because I actually have
time within the game

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.440
to make some tactical changes
to that long-term strategy

01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.909
that I decided on early.

01:53:25.909 --> 01:53:27.450
Unless you're playing
professionally.

01:53:27.450 --> 01:53:28.340
And then I've just
seem that they just

01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:29.570
GG after five minutes.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.490
So anybody recognize this quote?

01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:39.040
Sid Meier, the developer
for Civilization,

01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:43.640
famously said, "a good game is a
series of interesting choices."

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:45.580
It's very much the
case for the games

01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:47.340
that we're making in this class.

01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:51.270
The thing I want to note is
strive for interesting choices

01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:52.840
in your games.

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:55.690
Be prepared for your choices
not to be interesting.

01:53:55.690 --> 01:53:59.050
Try to iterate through them
and make them more interesting.

01:53:59.050 --> 01:54:01.192
But we don't have a ton
of time to really help

01:54:01.192 --> 01:54:02.900
you make the greatest
games in the world.

01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:03.400
Right?

01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.725
So we want your choices
to be meaningful.

01:54:05.725 --> 01:54:07.850
And if one or two of them
are interesting, awesome.

01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:09.510
You did a really,
really good job

01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:12.890
with the game development
process of it.

01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:15.590
I'm going to do a really,
really quick talk about how you

01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:17.220
can make things interesting.

01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.660
And we're going to come back
to it in later projects.

01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:23.570
But I just want to kind of
get these two terms out there.

01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:27.070
We're going to talk about
conflict and tension.

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:32.470
So what is conflict?

01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:34.860
If I say the words
conflict and tension,

01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:38.070
what's the definitions
you're more familiar with?

01:54:41.010 --> 01:54:43.117
Anybody heard it in
drama or writing?

01:54:43.117 --> 01:54:44.950
Like the narrative arc--
there's a conflict.

01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:48.330
There are two people
who want the same thing.

01:54:48.330 --> 01:54:50.724
Or there's an internal conflict.

01:54:50.724 --> 01:54:52.682
And that's really what
I'm thinking of when I'm

01:54:52.682 --> 01:54:53.890
saying conflict in this case.

01:54:53.890 --> 01:54:56.910
It's, what is the conflict
in the player as they're

01:54:56.910 --> 01:54:58.460
making these decisions?

01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:00.960
What are the trade-offs
they're making?

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.600
Do I send an army this way?

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.200
Or do I send an army that way?

01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:07.340
Or do I not fight at all?

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.720
If that is a really hard
decision for the player

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.570
to make-- if they can't
calculate it beforehand,

01:55:12.570 --> 01:55:16.037
if they have enough information
to know that one may be better

01:55:16.037 --> 01:55:17.870
than the other, but
they're not quite sure--

01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:19.786
that's what we're talking
about with conflict.

01:55:19.786 --> 01:55:21.400
With what Pablo was
playing with us,

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.877
the conflict in the
individual teams of,

01:55:24.877 --> 01:55:25.960
we know the probabilities.

01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:28.160
We can calculate that.

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:29.707
But are we sure?

01:55:29.707 --> 01:55:31.540
Are we sure it's going
to play out that way?

01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:33.180
I really wish he
had used to cones.

01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:34.970
Because I really want
to know how often

01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:39.170
the cone's going
to fall on its end.

01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:42.062
And then tension are ways
we can modify that conflict.

01:55:42.062 --> 01:55:43.520
Maybe there's no
conflict existing.

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:46.160
And we need to use tension
to create some conflict.

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.390
Maybe there's a little
bit of conflict going on,

01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:51.730
and tension's going to amplify
that and make it more dramatic.

01:55:51.730 --> 01:55:54.470
And there's just some basic
things you can change.

01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:57.120
And when we talk about
the example games,

01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.500
and if you play these example
games over the weekend,

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.030
think about these terms.

01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:04.230
If I were to change
the timing in a game,

01:56:04.230 --> 01:56:06.370
or the speed with which
you can make decisions,

01:56:06.370 --> 01:56:09.850
or the precision that's required
to make those decisions--

01:56:09.850 --> 01:56:11.340
would that increase
the conflict?

01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:13.790
And by increasing
the conflict there,

01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:15.300
are the choices
more interesting?

01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:18.500
Is the game more engaging,
or the game more fun?

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.750
Limitations are
awesome in games.

01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:25.400
Limitations are really how you
can design and control where

01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:27.000
and what a player can do.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.380
So how many options do
you give the player?

01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:33.429
Do you give them two, or
three, or five, or infinite?

01:56:33.429 --> 01:56:34.470
I can tell you right now.

01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:36.650
Having infinite choices is
really, really difficult,

01:56:36.650 --> 01:56:38.340
but not that interesting.

01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:44.350
Space, costs, economics,
information, fog of war--

01:56:44.350 --> 01:56:46.390
we've seen in some of
these strategy games

01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:48.250
where you can only
see things that are

01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:49.250
around where your units.

01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:51.920
And you can't see
things outside of that.

01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:55.300
These are all methods we use as
designers to create conflict,

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:57.467
to make those choices that
we're asking our players

01:56:57.467 --> 01:56:58.300
to make interesting.

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:05.712
So example games-- what
I'd love for you to do--

01:57:05.712 --> 01:57:06.920
and this is totally optional.

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:09.370
But if you're interested in
design, I totally recommend it.

01:57:09.370 --> 01:57:10.786
Over the weekend,
play some games.

01:57:10.786 --> 01:57:12.562
We're going to talk
about these games.

01:57:12.562 --> 01:57:13.770
And think about these things.

01:57:13.770 --> 01:57:17.254
And the slides are on Stellar.

01:57:17.254 --> 01:57:18.670
Think about the
types of decisions

01:57:18.670 --> 01:57:20.750
you can make, the
timing of the decisions,

01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:23.170
whether the game is
single-player or multiplayer,

01:57:23.170 --> 01:57:26.670
if there's competitive
or co-op play, if there's

01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:29.750
teams or alliances, and what
kind of conflict and tension

01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:31.054
exists in the game.

01:57:31.054 --> 01:57:32.470
All of these are
things that we're

01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:35.130
going to be asking you as
designers over the semester

01:57:35.130 --> 01:57:38.540
to decide on, to design,
to craft, to create

01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:41.810
a very particular experience
that you're trying to create.

01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:45.920
So Drew's going to kick
us off with this game.

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:48.080
ANDREW GRANT: Who's
played backgammon?

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:49.330
Wow, really?

01:57:49.330 --> 01:57:51.070
No one plays backgammon anymore.

01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:52.511
All right.

01:57:52.511 --> 01:57:54.010
Backgammon is a
pretty classic game.

01:57:54.010 --> 01:57:58.060
It was invented a good,
oh, 5,000 years ago or so,

01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:01.100
about the time that we
learned how to write.

01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:03.420
It's got a lot of
planning, oddly enough.

01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:05.560
There's a lot of probability
and randomness to it.

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:07.060
But you can plan
for that randomness

01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:08.970
by setting your pieces
in the right spots.

01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:10.470
You can choose
different strategies.

01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:11.970
Are you going to be aggressive
to take the other person's

01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:12.480
pieces?

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:13.580
Or are you going to
be defensive, and just

01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:14.800
try to protect yourself?

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.560
Are you going to leave something
in the opponent's backfield,

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.018
so if you're losing
at the end, you

01:58:18.018 --> 01:58:20.080
can maybe mess them up somehow?

01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:22.350
Or when do you change from
trying to mess them up

01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:23.710
to shooting for the end goal?

01:58:23.710 --> 01:58:25.720
There's a couple different
ways to play backgammon, oddly

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:26.000
enough.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.700
And it actually is
a fairly deep game.

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.400
There's a lot of
probability involved,

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:31.820
but some tactics
and some strategy

01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:34.030
going on in there, too.

01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:36.940
If you haven't played it
and you like board games,

01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.020
it's well worth playing.

01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:39.130
Because I think a
lot of the things

01:58:39.130 --> 01:58:41.046
that you're going to see
in modern board games

01:58:41.046 --> 01:58:43.840
really owe a lot to this game
right here, especially when you

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.830
add randomness as a mechanic.

01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:47.627
Go and chess are
obviously really,

01:58:47.627 --> 01:58:48.710
really awesome games, too.

01:58:48.710 --> 01:58:50.501
But they're a very
different style of game.

01:58:50.501 --> 01:58:52.570
Because they don't have
the randomness in there.

01:58:52.570 --> 01:58:56.699
It's a very, very different
way of thinking about it.

01:58:56.699 --> 01:58:58.990
This is another one where I
think there's more planning

01:58:58.990 --> 01:59:00.710
than people give it credit for.

01:59:00.710 --> 01:59:02.540
Who's played Twister?

01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:03.410
That's more like it.

01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:04.460
OK.

01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:06.870
So in Twister you
actually can plan ahead.

01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:08.300
You probably don't.

01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:10.990
But if you played Twister
a lot, you might start.

01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:13.310
You might realize, if I
put my right foot there

01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:15.369
I'm really screwed if
they call red next time.

01:59:15.369 --> 01:59:16.160
So I guess I won't.

01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:17.210
I'll put it over there.

01:59:17.210 --> 01:59:18.380
It kind of depends on how
many people are playing.

01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:20.440
If there's enough people
playing, you can't do that.

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.460
You just have to be fast.

01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:22.500
So Twister is an
interesting game

01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.840
where sometimes you have to
make your decision extremely

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.340
quickly.

01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:29.970
Is there strategy in Twister?

01:59:29.970 --> 01:59:31.880
Anyone?

01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:33.090
I see some nods.

01:59:33.090 --> 01:59:34.897
What decisions would you make?

01:59:34.897 --> 01:59:36.438
AUDIENCE: Maybe to
go under somebody,

01:59:36.438 --> 01:59:40.310
if you have to reach and
lift them off the board.

01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:41.310
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:41.809
Yes.

01:59:41.809 --> 01:59:44.220
So there's a strategy to
Twister if you want to play

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:48.150
Twister to win, darn it.

01:59:48.150 --> 01:59:50.842
And maybe you're thinking
that I've got better balance.

01:59:50.842 --> 01:59:52.800
Or maybe I'm a little
bit bigger than they are.

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:54.150
I bet I can nudge
them a little bit.

01:59:54.150 --> 01:59:54.816
That would work.

01:59:54.816 --> 01:59:55.430
Right?

01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:56.227
That does work.

01:59:56.227 --> 01:59:58.560
Or maybe you want to play off
in your own little corner?

01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:01.670
That works, too, unless no
one else lets you do it.

02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:03.497
Or if you get yourself
too tangled up,

02:00:03.497 --> 02:00:05.330
you can't move even
when you're by yourself.

02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:06.620
Have you done that or seen that?

02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:07.750
Someone's off by
themselves doing Twister

02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:09.590
and they fall over
with no one near them?

02:00:09.590 --> 02:00:11.634
It totally happens.

02:00:11.634 --> 02:00:13.550
There's other strategic
decisions for Twister.

02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:14.650
Are you trying to win?

02:00:14.650 --> 02:00:18.800
Are you trying to stay near
someone, or away from someone?

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:21.780
There are totally other
game goals to Twister.

02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:25.590
And they're up to the
people who are playing it.

02:00:25.590 --> 02:00:26.791
What is next?

02:00:26.791 --> 02:00:27.624
RIK EBERHARDT: Sara.

02:00:27.624 --> 02:00:28.374
SARA VERRILLI: OK.

02:00:28.374 --> 02:00:30.516
That would be me.

02:00:30.516 --> 02:00:32.926
So this is not what
everybody thinks of when

02:00:32.926 --> 02:00:33.580
they think of strategic games.

02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:35.371
But I want to point
out that decisions come

02:00:35.371 --> 02:00:37.760
in a lot of different styles.

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.900
You're not going to ever ruin
your game by any decisions

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.399
you make in FarmVille,
particularly.

02:00:42.399 --> 02:00:44.169
But it is a game
that makes people

02:00:44.169 --> 02:00:45.710
make a lot of choices
about what they

02:00:45.710 --> 02:00:46.959
want to do, relatively freely.

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:52.680
The strategy-- where strategy
and resource management

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:55.680
comes into FarmVille is
you have a limited number

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:56.680
of actions you can take.

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:58.460
Which means you can only
play the game for so long.

02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:00.650
Assuming you do not want to
become one of those people who

02:01:00.650 --> 02:01:02.775
spends a big pile of money
playing FarmVille, which

02:01:02.775 --> 02:01:05.930
I'm going to assume you are.

02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:07.600
So you need to
manage your actions,

02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:09.110
and think about how many
actions you're taking,

02:01:09.110 --> 02:01:11.409
and think about when you want
to come back to the game.

02:01:11.409 --> 02:01:12.950
And the way they do
that, and the way

02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:14.360
that you can game
that system, is

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:16.760
by looking at how long
it takes things to grow,

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.760
what you want to grow,
what you want to make.

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.968
FarmVille is actually at
this point kind of outdated,

02:01:20.968 --> 02:01:22.910
because they've
moved to FarmVille 2.

02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:25.140
But I did not actually
want to go there and play

02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.762
it to have the expertise
to tell you about it.

02:01:27.762 --> 02:01:29.470
I did spend enough
time playing FarmVille

02:01:29.470 --> 02:01:31.650
to know that there's
actually a whole lot

02:01:31.650 --> 02:01:33.755
of interesting decisions
you get to make there.

02:01:33.755 --> 02:01:35.630
And it's not a game
people think of when they

02:01:35.630 --> 02:01:36.610
think of meaningful decisions.

02:01:36.610 --> 02:01:38.151
Because they've
heard a whole lot of,

02:01:38.151 --> 02:01:41.340
oh my god, it's that click game.

02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:43.450
Just because it's
a game that doesn't

02:01:43.450 --> 02:01:46.480
have a lot of deep
consequences doesn't

02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:49.632
mean it can't have
a lot of deep play.

02:01:49.632 --> 02:01:51.340
Am I hitting the right button?

02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:52.730
Let's find out.

02:01:52.730 --> 02:01:56.630
So Plants vs. Zombies is
essentially a really popular

02:01:56.630 --> 02:01:57.510
tower defense game.

02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:59.140
And tower defense
was not very popular

02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.997
until Plants vs.
Zombies came out.

02:02:00.997 --> 02:02:02.830
Because most people
hadn't done it very well

02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:05.390
or presented it very well.

02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:09.060
But in Plants vs. Zombies,
you've got tons of choices.

02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:10.940
Who here has played
Plants vs. Zombies?

02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:11.910
Let me ask the first question.

02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:12.290
OK.

02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:13.998
So yeah, you know what
I'm talking about.

02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:18.500
They got the UI
right, absolutely.

02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.360
So it's easy to play.

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:23.870
And every time you go in to
play a level, you get to choose.

02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:25.750
Which strategy are
you going to use?

02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:27.601
You've got sort of
the long-term strategy

02:02:27.601 --> 02:02:29.100
choice for each
level, where you get

02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:30.300
to choose which
creatures you're taking

02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:31.540
or which plants you're taking.

02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:32.920
And you can go back
and play each level

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.770
with a completely
different set of plants,

02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:36.900
and still succeed,
or fail at it.

02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:40.280
In my case, it's
often more failing.

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:41.830
They give you just
enough information

02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:43.913
so you can think about
what you're going to bring.

02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:47.970
You can see what's coming in.

02:02:47.970 --> 02:02:49.520
You don't know how many of
those are going to come.

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:51.269
You don't know when
they're going to come.

02:02:51.269 --> 02:02:54.087
So you have to both
plan for, I know there's

02:02:54.087 --> 02:02:55.170
going to be a zombie need.

02:02:55.170 --> 02:02:56.530
But I don't know how
much of them it is.

02:02:56.530 --> 02:02:58.113
How much resources
do I need to devote

02:02:58.113 --> 02:03:03.810
to worrying about the
zom-- zom-- zombies.

02:03:03.810 --> 02:03:06.164
I'm not getting that
right at all, am I?

02:03:06.164 --> 02:03:08.330
How much resources do I
have to worry about devoting

02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:10.663
to that versus all the other
threats I've got coming in?

02:03:13.330 --> 02:03:16.114
Now I have to admit
something terrible.

02:03:16.114 --> 02:03:17.280
My daughters play this game.

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.904
And I have watched
them play this game.

02:03:18.904 --> 02:03:20.640
But I haven't actually
played this game.

02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:24.360
And I was going to play it last
night so I could talk about it.

02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.230
And then my daughters
hid my iPad on me.

02:03:27.230 --> 02:03:29.400
It's very hard to
download a game

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.140
when you don't have the
device to download it onto.

02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:34.440
So has anybody else
played this game?

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:34.940
OK.

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:35.689
A few people have.

02:03:38.970 --> 02:03:41.590
Your goal in this game
is you're a virus.

02:03:41.590 --> 02:03:43.610
You would like to evolve
and hopefully take out

02:03:43.610 --> 02:03:45.960
all of humanity.

02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:48.610
And as you're playing the
game as the player guiding

02:03:48.610 --> 02:03:52.960
the virus's development, you
get to make a lot of choices.

02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:54.240
How lethal is it?

02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:56.020
What kind of
symptoms do you have?

02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:58.200
How easy is it to spread?

02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:00.460
My daughters are
working on the infect

02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:04.020
the whole planet with a
completely symptomless disease

02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:06.760
tactic, and then evolve
quickly up to lethality

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:09.709
and take everybody out.

02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:11.000
They haven't succeeded at this.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.580
It sounds like the
perfect strategy.

02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.038
But they haven't
succeeded at this.

02:04:14.038 --> 02:04:16.790
Because you kind of need
symptoms to cause damage.

02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:18.819
And they can't evolve
the symptoms fast enough.

02:04:18.819 --> 02:04:20.360
Once they've gotten
everyone infected

02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:22.940
and they're going from
completely harmless to deadly,

02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:26.600
they can't manage to
evolve it fast enough.

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.496
So it's got a lot
of interesting play

02:04:29.496 --> 02:04:31.620
there, where you've got a
lot of different tactics.

02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:33.940
I think they can get it
someday, but they haven't yet.

02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:37.350
They'll need to try
a different tactic.

02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:40.710
And finally, a game I have
played an awful lot of

02:04:40.710 --> 02:04:41.680
is Pandemic.

02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:43.840
Who here has played Pandemic?

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.560
OK.

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:48.960
So what is the main
tactic and resource

02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:51.580
you have in this game,
if you've played it?

02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:55.030
AUDIENCE: Turns.

02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:57.300
SARA VERRILLI:
Turns-- well, time.

02:04:57.300 --> 02:04:57.890
Time.

02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:58.750
Yeah.

02:04:58.750 --> 02:05:00.560
In a lot of ways, in this game,
what you're playing against

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:01.060
is time.

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.010
Because when you
run out of the deck,

02:05:03.010 --> 02:05:06.930
if you haven't managed to
clear things, the game is over.

02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:09.600
And the resource you've got,
and the choices you've got,

02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:14.014
is where people are going and
which area they're fighting.

02:05:14.014 --> 02:05:15.680
The overall plan of
the game, of course,

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:19.280
is there are four
epidemics raging.

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:20.330
You're the CDC.

02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:23.110
You need to find cures
for all the plagues

02:05:23.110 --> 02:05:29.160
before they take out
the rest of humanity.

02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:31.770
And so you have to balance
both your long-term strategy

02:05:31.770 --> 02:05:33.786
of finding a cure
for each of diseases

02:05:33.786 --> 02:05:35.410
with the short-term
strategy of keeping

02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:38.529
the diseases under
control, so that you

02:05:38.529 --> 02:05:41.024
don't end up with
everything being destroyed.

02:05:44.517 --> 02:05:47.012
PHILLIP TAN: All right, my turn.

02:05:47.012 --> 02:05:52.991
[INAUDIBLE] Who's
played Dominion?

02:05:52.991 --> 02:05:54.010
OK, pretty popular.

02:05:54.010 --> 02:05:57.600
I certainly recommend it
as a good introduction

02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:01.170
to the basic idea of
deck-building games.

02:06:01.170 --> 02:06:04.710
Actually, how many people
have played Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!,

02:06:04.710 --> 02:06:06.150
Pokemon card game?

02:06:06.150 --> 02:06:06.910
OK.

02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:09.270
All right, a lot of that.

02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:12.115
In many of those games, and
in Dominion, a lot of the fun

02:06:12.115 --> 02:06:14.380
is just building
your own machine,

02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:16.490
your own little
engine, that is going

02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:18.000
to execute out your strategy.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.314
Now your engine happens
to be a deck of cards.

02:06:20.314 --> 02:06:22.730
You get shuffled up, so it's
in some sort of random order.

02:06:22.730 --> 02:06:26.025
But you get to choose
what cards go in there.

02:06:26.025 --> 02:06:28.520
In a collectible card game
like Magic: the Gathering,

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.080
you are buying those cards,
and then assembling the cards,

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:33.150
or there's a draft
[? mechanic ?].

02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:35.340
In a game like
Dominion, there is

02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:38.330
a way where you buy more cards
while you're playing the game.

02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:41.140
But in the end, what
it all comes down to is

02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:44.310
as you play this game, you get
cards that go into your deck.

02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:46.747
They are going to end up
being shuffled in your deck.

02:06:46.747 --> 02:06:48.330
And at some random
time in the future,

02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:49.640
it's going to get played out.

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:52.270
And so the cards that you
choose to put into your deck

02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:55.820
turns out to be your main
means of motivating you

02:06:55.820 --> 02:06:58.490
towards a [INAUDIBLE] strategy.

02:06:58.490 --> 02:07:01.540
There are a range of different
ways to play this game,

02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:05.620
and different possible
success criteria.

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.070
And the really interesting
thing about the Dominion deck

02:07:11.070 --> 02:07:15.170
is I think it gets something
like over 20 different kinds

02:07:15.170 --> 02:07:18.270
of cards in a box of Dominion.

02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:23.630
But you only play with 10 of
them-- 10 plus victory points.

02:07:23.630 --> 02:07:27.660
So every time you play
the game, the strategy

02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:29.370
starts by just seeing,
what are the 10

02:07:29.370 --> 02:07:33.880
cards I've got in front of
me for this session of play?

02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:36.270
And then you choose, out
of these 10 cards, what

02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:39.489
are the cards that I'm going to
select and in what proportion,

02:07:39.489 --> 02:07:41.280
in order to build this
engine that is going

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:43.134
to motivate me towards victory?

02:07:43.134 --> 02:07:44.300
So it's an interesting game.

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:45.841
I would strongly
recommend it, if you

02:07:45.841 --> 02:07:47.824
know someone who's got
a copy of this game

02:07:47.824 --> 02:07:48.865
or any of the expansions.

02:07:48.865 --> 02:07:50.031
They're all interchangeable.

02:07:55.260 --> 02:08:01.180
Drop7-- mostly played on mobile,
although I think there is also

02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:03.250
a browser version of this game.

02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:04.790
How many of you
have played this?

02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:05.600
Yeah.

02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:09.140
Perfect for a T ride, I find.

02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:12.970
You can finish a session
in a single trip on the T.

02:08:12.970 --> 02:08:15.950
The idea is that you're
just dropping one number

02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:17.770
from the top of the screen.

02:08:17.770 --> 02:08:21.440
And that number ranges
anywhere between one to seven.

02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:25.320
And if you manage to
make a row of numbers

02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:31.880
that add up to-- let's
say I have a row of sixes.

02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.800
And I have six sixes in a row.

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:35.950
Then all of the sixes
are going to disappear.

02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:37.580
And it's going to
also clear out some

02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:40.100
of those gray circles where
you don't know the numbers yet.

02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:42.680
It's going to review the
numbers behind these gray tiles.

02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:45.450
You can think of them as tiles
that were turned upside down.

02:08:45.450 --> 02:08:48.390
So what you really, really
want to make is chains.

02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:53.440
Chains are where, if I have a
six, five, four, three, two,

02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:56.295
one, then what happens is
that six is going to burst.

02:08:56.295 --> 02:08:57.670
Then that five is
going to burst.

02:08:57.670 --> 02:08:58.370
Then that four is
going to burst.

02:08:58.370 --> 02:09:00.110
Then a three, and
so on and so forth.

02:09:00.110 --> 02:09:01.870
You set up these massive chains.

02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:03.539
And basically,
you're just assigning

02:09:03.539 --> 02:09:04.830
how you're going to place this.

02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:09.270
And if you played a
game like Puyo Puyo--

02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:11.700
I'm trying to think-- certain
kinds of Match 3 games

02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:17.420
like Bejeweled, you'll get this
sort of chain reaction feeling.

02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:19.750
And some games more
than others encourage

02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:25.070
you to set up these chains
before you drop the triggering

02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.830
piece.

02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:28.140
Drop7 is very much about that.

02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:33.290
So I believe, if you can
find it on a browser,

02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:34.140
it should be free.

02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:37.000
I'm not so sure whether
the iOS versions are free.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:37.700
They are?

02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:38.200
Great.

02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:43.880
I keep forgetting the
computer is on this side.

02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:47.650
The StarCraft II visual novel.

02:09:47.650 --> 02:09:49.077
AUDIENCE: Wait, is it done?

02:09:49.077 --> 02:09:49.910
PHILLIP TAN: No, no.

02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:52.720
It's still in development.

02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:54.750
Full disclosure, I am
a Kickstarter backer

02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:56.550
of this game.

02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:58.870
As has been mentioned
many, many times,

02:09:58.870 --> 02:10:01.430
I am a StarCraft II player.

02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:04.400
But I am not encouraging
you to go and learn

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:05.350
that over the weekend.

02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:08.970
Because StarCraft II is more
of a lifestyle kind of thing.

02:10:08.970 --> 02:10:11.184
[LAUGHTER]

02:10:11.184 --> 02:10:12.600
But if you're just
kind of wanting

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:15.590
to see what the
strategy is about,

02:10:15.590 --> 02:10:18.789
this is an interesting
game where--

02:10:18.789 --> 02:10:20.330
if you've ever played
a visual novel,

02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:24.150
they're kind of like Choose Your
Own Adventure in digital form.

02:10:24.150 --> 02:10:26.080
And they are usually
very strong narrative-

02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:27.560
and character-driven games.

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:33.330
You play a teenager who has
moved to Korea in the hopes

02:10:33.330 --> 02:10:35.950
to start his or her
pro gaming career.

02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:39.920
And you go into a LAN center.

02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:42.760
And you play random
games against people.

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:45.010
Only these are the kinds of
decisions you get to make.

02:10:45.010 --> 02:10:46.920
Which strategy are
you going to go for?

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:50.890
I usually find this to be
a really, really good way

02:10:50.890 --> 02:10:54.740
of conveying the macro-level
decisions, the really, really

02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:56.517
high-level long-term
strategic decisions

02:10:56.517 --> 02:10:57.600
that you're going to make.

02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:00.040
Because you're not
actually playing StarCraft.

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:05.020
You are choosing between
two or three choices.

02:11:05.020 --> 02:11:06.700
And then it plays out.

02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:10.380
But it gives you a good idea of
the kind of high-level decision

02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:10.880
making.

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:13.569
Whereas most people see
someone play StarCraft as like,

02:11:13.569 --> 02:11:14.610
the [KEY-CLACKING NOISE].

02:11:14.610 --> 02:11:18.610
And you're not seeing
that long term strategy.

02:11:18.610 --> 02:11:22.090
So we do have a Let's Play up.

02:11:22.090 --> 02:11:23.360
And the URL is there.

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.220
But if you just Google MIT Game
Lab, StarCraft II visual novel,

02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:28.722
you'll see the YouTube video
and get an idea of that.

02:11:28.722 --> 02:11:31.180
Because I'm not so sure if you
can still download the demo.

02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:33.190
But the demo does have
some of these features.

02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:39.784
ANDREW GRANT: I am last..

02:11:39.784 --> 02:11:41.110
Mini Metro.

02:11:41.110 --> 02:11:41.610
All right.

02:11:41.610 --> 02:11:45.980
So my games that I
chose-- what's up?

02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:46.690
Oh, thank you.

02:11:46.690 --> 02:11:47.520
Cool.

02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:50.040
So this one I really
like as an example.

02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:51.800
Eww, it looks awful
on the screen, though.

02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:53.425
So I really like this
one as an example

02:11:53.425 --> 02:11:57.170
because it has not
yet been published.

02:11:57.170 --> 02:11:59.800
On their website they
have their alpha build.

02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:04.120
And if you were to buy their
game, what you would see

02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:05.080
is the beta build.

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:07.880
And then later on, when it
actually does publish-- you

02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:09.400
guys can even see
this on YouTube.

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.816
You can see what it's going
to look like when you actually

02:12:11.816 --> 02:12:13.460
buy the final game.

02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:15.370
It plays exactly the same.

02:12:15.370 --> 02:12:18.230
It looks polished.

02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:20.344
It's a really good
example of here's

02:12:20.344 --> 02:12:22.260
a game that works and
is functionally perfect.

02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:23.760
And they could have
just shipped it.

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.290
And I'm really glad that
did, because I play it a lot.

02:12:26.290 --> 02:12:27.835
And when they
finally ship it, it's

02:12:27.835 --> 02:12:29.460
still going to play
the exact same way.

02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:30.430
It's just going to be
a little bit prettier.

02:12:30.430 --> 02:12:31.070
And it really doesn't matter.

02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:32.130
I don't really care about that.

02:12:32.130 --> 02:12:34.620
That's something that we're
going to stress in this game.

02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:37.220
We're more concerned about
that, is it playable?

02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:37.900
Does it work?

02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:40.510
Can I understand how to play
it-- more so than the pretty,

02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:44.490
more so than the aesthetic
and visual polish.

02:12:44.490 --> 02:12:49.004
So in this game, it is a
game about managing a subway.

02:12:49.004 --> 02:12:50.420
All of the sudden
a subway station

02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:51.560
appears in the middle of space.

02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:53.018
And you have to
build a line to it.

02:12:53.018 --> 02:12:54.510
So you build your line.

02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:57.080
And then passengers randomly
appear on the subway trains.

02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:59.580
But you don't have to actually
get them from place to place.

02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:00.970
You don't control the trains.

02:13:00.970 --> 02:13:02.470
You just build the lines.

02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:04.170
The trains move on their own.

02:13:04.170 --> 02:13:06.290
And they're moving
at a constant rate.

02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:07.970
So you can kind of
guess when the train

02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:10.030
is going to get to the station.

02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:13.840
There are strategies
to-- you can move

02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:15.534
your lines around a little bit.

02:13:15.534 --> 02:13:17.700
But once your lines are in
place, for the most part,

02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:18.324
they're static.

02:13:18.324 --> 02:13:20.200
You can't really change
them all that much.

02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:21.740
So there's some
limitations going on

02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:24.930
between how much you
can move a line or not.

02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:26.580
At the end, if you
last a week, it's

02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:28.163
going to give you
one of three options

02:13:28.163 --> 02:13:29.810
to do a power-up, basically.

02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:33.410
Either you can build a
new line, add a new train,

02:13:33.410 --> 02:13:34.900
increase the
capacity of a train.

02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:36.650
So you're making a
permanent choice there.

02:13:36.650 --> 02:13:38.400
And that's going to
affect the later game.

02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.730
So you're making all
sorts of these decisions

02:13:40.730 --> 02:13:42.169
at both a macro and micro level.

02:13:42.169 --> 02:13:44.210
And there's a really good
write-up about the game

02:13:44.210 --> 02:13:47.570
right there, if you
just want to read that.

02:13:47.570 --> 02:13:51.150
FTL-- I lost a ton
of productivity

02:13:51.150 --> 02:13:53.630
a few months ago
because of this game.

02:13:53.630 --> 02:13:56.931
It is a game about
fighting in spaceships

02:13:56.931 --> 02:13:59.180
without actually controlling
all the fighting so much.

02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:04.470
You're actually upgrading your
ship, increasing your capacity,

02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:07.730
buying crew members-- and
hoping your crew members survive

02:14:07.730 --> 02:14:09.170
is a lot of it.

02:14:09.170 --> 02:14:13.619
You could-- and I
do this-- manually

02:14:13.619 --> 02:14:14.660
control all your weapons.

02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:17.034
And actually to succeed,
you really do have to.

02:14:17.034 --> 02:14:19.200
Because the interesting
thing with this game is it's

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:20.390
a perma-death game.

02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:22.602
As soon as you die, it's dead.

02:14:22.602 --> 02:14:23.560
You have to start over.

02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:24.768
You have to restart the game.

02:14:24.768 --> 02:14:28.150
Luckily the game only takes
about three hours to play.

02:14:28.150 --> 02:14:30.880
But you're lucky if you get
through those three hours.

02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:32.870
And when you finally
get to the last boss,

02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:36.987
and you're there-- the thing
about this game is in order

02:14:36.987 --> 02:14:39.570
to get to that boss, there's all
sorts of different challenges

02:14:39.570 --> 02:14:40.630
you're facing.

02:14:40.630 --> 02:14:42.370
And you're making
these decisions about,

02:14:42.370 --> 02:14:44.000
do I buy this weapon
or that weapon

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.740
to help me with the thing
I know that I'm going

02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:46.864
to face in the next sector?

02:14:46.864 --> 02:14:48.420
Because I'm losing health.

02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:50.530
I'm really dying here.

02:14:50.530 --> 02:14:52.280
But is this weapon
really going to help me

02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.720
when I get to the boss?

02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:56.470
You're constantly
going back and forth.

02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:59.800
So I'll often find, after three
or four, that I'm at the boss

02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:02.330
and I'm completely ill-equipped
to fight this thing.

02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:03.570
And I just die.

02:15:03.570 --> 02:15:05.900
But I do play out to the
end, because it's fun.

02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:08.200
Last game I have--
this one's free online.

02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:09.570
It's called Gridland.

02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:14.440
If anybody's played the game, A
Dark Room, a text-based supply

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:16.780
chain game, this is
the Match 3 version

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:19.100
of that game, a little bit.

02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.590
There's two stages in
the game-- day and night.

02:15:21.590 --> 02:15:24.070
It's Match 3, so you
just collect three gems.

02:15:24.070 --> 02:15:27.580
And you get whatever the
gems represent-- resources

02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:34.760
like clay, wood, and
stone, food, paper, gems.

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.190
You can upgrade your little
factories to make better gems.

02:15:38.190 --> 02:15:39.699
Every time you
upgrade one of these,

02:15:39.699 --> 02:15:41.240
though-- so if you
upgrade your wood,

02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:42.450
you'll get a better sword.

02:15:42.450 --> 02:15:44.045
If you upgrade your
clay, which you

02:15:44.045 --> 02:15:47.170
need to make the
better wood, you're

02:15:47.170 --> 02:15:49.740
going to get in the
nighttime a stronger monster.

02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:52.870
So in this case, this
is immediately daytime

02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:54.410
and then shifted over to night.

02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:55.930
The exact same layout is there.

02:15:55.930 --> 02:16:00.371
It's just the logs
have become shields.

02:16:00.371 --> 02:16:03.590
The little blue things that
are supposed to be iron

02:16:03.590 --> 02:16:04.720
become swords.

02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:08.550
And all the other
things become enemies.

02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:11.900
So a lot of the
strategy for this game

02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:14.330
is, what's going to help me now?

02:16:14.330 --> 02:16:16.257
What's going to help
me in the future?

02:16:16.257 --> 02:16:17.840
What's going to hurt
me in the future?

02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:19.465
And what's going to
hurt me immediately

02:16:19.465 --> 02:16:21.670
as I switch over to night?

02:16:21.670 --> 02:16:24.012
Once I get into the
night mode, I'll

02:16:24.012 --> 02:16:25.970
have known exactly what
I'm going to be facing.

02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:27.937
Because I set that stage up.

02:16:27.937 --> 02:16:30.520
So unlike Bejeweled where you're
just constantly just clicking

02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:32.040
things, or Candy Crush
where you're just

02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:33.139
constantly just
clicking things, there's

02:16:33.139 --> 02:16:34.430
actually no time limit on this.

02:16:34.430 --> 02:16:35.950
And it took me--
it's embarrassing

02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:38.282
how long it took me-- a day
or two to realize that I

02:16:38.282 --> 02:16:39.490
didn't have to play that way.

02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:42.495
I could just wait,
pause, and play.

02:16:42.495 --> 02:16:44.370
There wasn't going to
be a time limit pushing

02:16:44.370 --> 02:16:48.126
me to continue moving forward.

02:16:48.126 --> 02:16:50.000
And that's an interesting
presentation thing.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.466
When you're
presenting your games,

02:16:51.466 --> 02:16:53.299
especially if you're
using a previous genre,

02:16:53.299 --> 02:16:55.548
there's going to be genre
conventions that the players

02:16:55.548 --> 02:16:56.639
are going to understand.

02:16:56.639 --> 02:16:59.120
That is going to shape
their user experience.

02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:03.840
And we'll be talking about
that about project three.

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:05.674
So that's it.

02:17:05.674 --> 02:17:07.840
If you want to play these
games or watch these games

02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:09.160
on YouTube, please do.

02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:11.570
And if you want to know more
about choice and conflict,

02:17:11.570 --> 02:17:13.530
there's a nine-minute
video at Extra Credits.

02:17:13.530 --> 02:17:15.930
We use Extra Credits a
lot, because they're short.

02:17:15.930 --> 02:17:18.851
They're fun videos
on game design.

02:17:18.851 --> 02:17:20.350
I highly recommend
it for this class

02:17:20.350 --> 02:17:22.558
to give you a leg up on some
of the design challenges

02:17:22.558 --> 02:17:24.700
that we're facing here.

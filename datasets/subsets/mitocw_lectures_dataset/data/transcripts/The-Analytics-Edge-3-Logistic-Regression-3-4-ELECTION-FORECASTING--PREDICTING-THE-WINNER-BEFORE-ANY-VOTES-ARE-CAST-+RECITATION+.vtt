Hi.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.980
I'm John, and I'll be leading
the recitation this week.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.330
We'll be using pooling data
from the months leading up

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.790
to a presidential election to
predict that election's winner.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.030
We'll go over how to
build logistic regression

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.980
models in R, how to select
the variables to include

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.340
in those models, and how to
evaluate the model predictions.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.080
Let's get started.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:22.040
PROFESSOR: Right, OK.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.750
So I think this was
where we were up to.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.030
I wasn't here last time,
so I don't really know.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.320
But George told me that
this was where you're up to,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.150
so that's where I'm
going to carry on from.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.340
And so this section is all
about imaging and resolution,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.190
and it starts off
here looking in

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.250
some strange American
dictionary at the definition

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.890
of a "resolution."

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.530
Of course, myself,
coming from Oxford,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.660
I would always use
the Oxford Dictionary.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.700
I don't know what that says.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.090
But anyway, this is
quite interesting.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.480
The verb here, resolve, "to
break up its constituent parts,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.545
to analyze, to
find an answer to,

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.440
to solve, determine, and
decide," blah, blah, blah.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.500
But anyway, I think this first
part is-- the very first thing

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.380
is a good one, isn't it?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.400
So break up into its
constituent parts.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.610
So you look at an
image, and you've

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.990
got to actually determine
what the different parts

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.220
of the image really mean.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.860
And if they sort
of merge together,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.290
you won't be able
to resolve what

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.200
the image is trying to say.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.580
So that's what it means.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.170
And yeah, now, there are
lots of different ways

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.500
of determining resolution,
different definitions

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.170
that people apply.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.330
The most used one, perhaps, is
the Rayleigh resolution limit,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.670
which was proposed
by Lord Rayleigh.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.479
Lord Rayleigh was very
interested in astronomy,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.450
and so he was interested
in trying to quantify

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.480
the imaging of stars.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.370
So if you look up in
the telescope at the sky

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.890
and you've got two stars
very close together,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.810
then you'll see, like the
two images of the stars,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.720
this shows to two different
separations of those two

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.370
points.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.320
And now, it's important to
note that stars, of course,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.720
two independent stars
would be completely

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.240
incoherent with
respect to each other

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.700
because they obviously
don't know-- the one doesn't

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.390
know what the other's doing.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.210
So they emit light incoherently
with respect to each other.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.190
So to calculate the image
of these two points,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.640
you have to add together the
intensities of the two images,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.310
and that's what this shows here.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.940
And so this shows
two different spaces.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.100
And this one here,
this is what I

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.520
think is really normally taken
as the Rayleigh resolution

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.660
limit.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.313
I don't know about
this other one.

00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:22.980
I don't where Georgia
has got this from,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.790
but he talks about these
two different limits

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.330
in these notes.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.870
So in this one here, you'll
see that this peak here

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.000
is placed exactly over
the 0 of the other,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.900
the first 0 of the other image.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.530
So that's what defines
this separation shown

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.280
in this picture.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.720
And we find that if they're
separated by that amount,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.600
the total image is
given by this blue line.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.170
We get that just by adding
together the two intensities

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.960
of the two points together.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:12.130
And you can see that this
drops a bit at the center.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.210
What is it?

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.995
I think the intensity
there is 0.888--

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:20.870
I can't remember now.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.460
No, it doesn't matter.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.640
But anyway, it's
about 0.8, isn't it?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.810
0.835, so that figure sounds--

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.310
But anyway, the other
interesting thing, of course,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.960
is that because this
one is 0 at this point,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.470
it means that this maximum is 1.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.460
It's exactly 1.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.360
It's just the one point
with no contribution

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.840
from the other one.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.220
Anyway, so that is
arbitrarily taken

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.810
as being the definition of
the point being just resolved.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.750
So we say that if there are
any closer together than that,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.520
you can't resolve them.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.540
You would see a little
bit of a dip still,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.200
but we say that the dips not
really big enough for you

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.890
to really be confident that
there are two objects there.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.040
And if you make
them further apart,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.620
then, of course, they'll
become more distinguished.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.640
And this shows an example
here where you can see now,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.230
this is twice the separation.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.940
So this is where the PSF
diameter equals the point

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.565
source spacing.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.790
So the-- what does
he mean by that?

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.010
Sorry.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.100
This one, the PSF radius equals
the point source spacing.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.000
Yeah, OK.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.060
So that is the distance
between the center of the image

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.160
And the first dark ring.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.790
In this one, the PSF diameter
equals the point source

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.073
spacing.

00:06:02.073 --> 00:06:02.990
Has he got this right?

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.590
No, it's not the second zero.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.620
It's not at the second zero
exactly, anymore, is it?

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.480
So the spacing here is
twice the spacing there.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.150
Anyway, I think that's what
I'm taking at this meaning.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.600
But as Charlene
just pointed out,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.620
that means this is not
actually at a zero.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.340
This is not placed at a
zero of this other one

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.170
because, if you remember,
the zeros of the Airy disk

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.720
are irregularly
spaced, aren't they?

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.470
So they're not equally spaced,
like the light for a sink.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.480
And so because this isn't
0 at this point here,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.960
this maximum here
will be not exactly 1.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.010
It will be slightly more than 1.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.540
OK.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:03.070
And if this condition is
satisfied, then, in this case,

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.820
the delta R, the--

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.290
where does he define that?

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.226
That's the-- I guess it's
this distance here, isn't it?

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.470
PROFESSOR: It's the
separation of the peaks.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.190
Yeah, OK, it's the
separation of the peaks.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.190
It's 0.61 lambda over NA.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.700
Oh, yeah.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.200
OK.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.280
So here he's--

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.760
R and R dashed are obviously
coordinates in the object

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.690
played in the image
plane, effectively.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.190
Yeah.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.530
So, of course, it depends on--

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.430
the numerical aperture
in those two spaces

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.843
won't be the same, of course.

00:07:43.843 --> 00:07:45.760
But there will be
magnification as well, which

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.800
is going to mean that
you get the same answer

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.020
for the resolution
in both planes.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.940
So this 0.61 is
this magic figure

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.570
that comes about
basically because of the--

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.800
it's related to the first zero
of the Bessel function, j1.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.150
And the first zero of the
Bessel function j1 is 3.83,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.620
and this is 3.83
divided by 2 pi.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.360
Does that sound right?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:14.980
Yeah.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.560
Yeah, I think that sounds right.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.240
This one here is
twice the spacing,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.670
so 1.22 lambda over NA.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.710
So this is 3.83 divided by pi.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.210
Yeah.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.100
So here, actually,
these are obviously

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.370
extremely well resolved.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.020
You wouldn't have
any problem in seeing

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.270
that there's two points there.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:50.530
And so here he calls these two
definitions the safe definition

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.440
and the pushy definition.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.110
My experience is that
the pushy definition

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.670
is the one that is
normally quoted in places,

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.090
and so this is this one
where you can only just see

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.390
a bit of a dip in between them.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.760
Note that if we did the same
thing for the 1D system, i.e.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.560
for a slit aperture rather
than a circular aperture, then

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.110
you'd be looking at the
first zero of a sink rather

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.760
than a Bessel function.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.310
And so you get these expressions
rather than these, so 1.22

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:32.360
rather than 1 or
0.61 rather than 0.5.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.940
So in this case you
actually you can

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.800
see you can resolve
slightly smaller spacing

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.390
with a slit aperture than
with a circular aperture.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.550
And this is a true effect
that sometimes people

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.980
try to take advantage of.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.710
You will see that
different authors

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.320
give different definitions.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.190
So I'm not going to go into
all that because it's not

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.560
really important at this stage.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.170
Rayleigh, in his original
paper, noted the issue of noise

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.800
and warned that the definition
of just resolvable points

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.120
is system or
application dependent.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.510
Actually, what you find--

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.870
well, a lot of that
is true, of course.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.398
Here we're-- it very much
depends on the actual system

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:28.440
and what you're trying to
measure all these sorts

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.070
of things.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.460
And you can come up with
lots of different resolution

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.820
criteria for different
shaped objects,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.460
and the comparison
of different systems

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.770
doesn't always give
the same answers

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.970
according to what you chose.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:43.480
So beware.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.950
There is not one answer to
this question of resolution.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.680
The other thing is,
as he says here,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.860
is noise is an important
thing, of course.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.620
If you add noise
to these image--

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.720
we've got some
examples later where

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.850
there's noise
added to the images

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.320
so that you can see
what it does to it.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.420
But one thing that is perhaps
not quite what George is saying

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.640
there-- actually, you do find--

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.770
if you look at the image
of these two points,

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.560
as you bring them
together, you actually

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.590
do find that the
degradation in the image

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.200
is really rather sudden.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.390
So although, OK, it's
not a specific point,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.850
it is quite so sudden.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:38.140
And so you'll find that if
you change the separation

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.440
around slightly more or
slightly less than that,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.220
you'd find that this central
bit would go up and down quite

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.960
a lot, actually.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:55.860
So it is quite a sensitive
change around that spacing.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:01.990
So that gives us some idea
that maybe this resolution

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:07.280
limit as it's defined does
mean something, anyway.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.210
Now, that's for a perfect
aberration-free system.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.130
But very often,
you've got systems

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.730
where you've got aberrations,
and that's obviously

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.500
going to mean that
the resolution is not

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.160
going to be as good.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.600
So this picture shows
an example with coma.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.250
So this is with an off-axis
ray, off-axis beam going

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:34.650
through a lens, and you
get this coma spot here.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.100
So now, of course,
this spot is bigger

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.130
than it would be if there
were no aberrations,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.070
and therefore you'd expect that
the resolution would be worse.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:50.740
So this is another thing you
have to take into account.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.080
I don't think there's going
to be much more about that.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.800
But did that do something there?

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.040
Or perhaps this didn't
push it fast enough.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.770
Now, the other way of
looking at the effects--

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.100
resolution and the
effects of aberrations

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.620
is looking at the transfer
function approach.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:16.230
And so this is giving results
for a one-dimensional system.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:21.010
And it you see it's an MTF,
Modulation Transfer Function.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.050
So that means it's
an incoherent system.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:31.800
The MTF is the Fourier transform
of the point spread function.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.470
So this is for the
aberration-free case.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.450
This is a sink squared,
the point spread

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.020
function for the 1D case.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.010
And if you take the
Fourier transform,

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.850
you get the modulation
transfer function,

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.520
as he calls it, and
vise versa, of course.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.290
These are Fourier
transform pairs.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.420
This is just a
triangle function.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.390
And this shows what
would happen if you

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.270
got some aberrations there.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.200
In general, what would happen
is that this would be broader,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.150
and this would be deformed
so that you've got a lower

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.430
spatial frequency response.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.770
Here, actually, he seems to
be showing something which

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:15.910
has got an improved response
at the very high frequencies,

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.060
which is quite interesting
because what that would mean,

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.740
actually, is that
if your object only

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.050
had those high
spatial frequencies,

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.520
the system with aberrations
would actually give a better

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.120
image than the one
without aberrations.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.520
So maybe that's a bit anomalous.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.970
So now some common
misinterpretations,

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.940
attempting to resolve
object feature smaller

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.380
than the resolution limit, i.e.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.210
1.22 lambda over
NA, is hopeless.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.880
So he's saying that
that's not strictly true

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.790
because this is
not, for a start,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.030
it's not a sudden cutoff.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.920
And it depends on the presence
of noise and other features.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.310
So there is a very big no to
say that, yes, you can sometimes

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:19.560
see things which are smaller
than the resolution limit.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.520
And then also another
point is that there

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.840
are ways you can actually
improve the performance using,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.240
for example, the
CLEAN algorithm.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.820
The CLEAN algorithm is a
thing they use in astronomy

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.090
for doing deconvolution.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.280
It works particularly well--

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.550
it would be very good, actually,
for some of these microscope

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:46.140
things that people do nowadays
with these very sparse

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.780
molecules because
it's designed to work

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.220
with you know in astronomy
with isolated point images.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.630
So if it looks at
a continuous object

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.210
like a motorcar or something
like that, it wouldn't work.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:08.670
It would actually only
work on point-type images.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.290
Then vena filtering-- we'll
say something more about that--

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.960
expectation,
maximization, et cetera.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.880
So there are various digital
ways you can improve the image

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.830
and get information
out of the image,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.180
even if you can't see
it by [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.250
And then there's this other
word, super-resolution.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.430
Super-resolution,
it means, basically,

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.970
getting better resolution
than you are suppose to, i.e.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.210
beating the Rayleigh
diffraction limit.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:46.260
And various ways have been
proposed for doing this.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.200
And until recently,
I guess, most of them

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.950
were pretty unsuccessful.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.340
But more recently, nowadays,
some of these techniques

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.490
are doing really well.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.850
I think the most
noticeable one probably

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:05.910
is STED, Stimulated Emission
Depletion, microscopy,

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.079
where Stefan Hell is
getting resolutions which,

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.190
I don't know, more than a factor
of 10 better than you should

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.490
according to the Rayleigh
diffraction limit.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.550
But anyway, here he's
talking about what are

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.339
called super-resolving filters.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:29.220
What you do is you alter the
pupil function of the lens

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:34.440
by some clever trick in order
to sharpen up the point spread

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.200
function.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.280
And I think that maybe George
did mention that earlier

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.630
on at some point.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.890
But the problem is
what always happens

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.310
is that it doesn't actually--

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.810
you never get
anything for nothing.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.970
That's the problem.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:57.360
You make a central
lobe narrower,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.440
but you find that the side
lobes become stronger.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.710
And the other thing is that
very often the power transmitted

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.530
through the system
is much reduced.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.160
So you can imagine if
you've got some filter that

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:17.630
absorbs part of the power,
then you're wasting power.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.430
So both of these can be bad.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:27.120
And so, consequently, this
idea of super-resolving filters

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.440
in practice has never
really, up until now,

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.350
been very successful from
a practical point of view.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.100
But anyway, this
shows one example.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.330
This shows a circular pupil.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:49.410
And yeah, and then this
one is an annual pupil,

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.550
which you can model as
being one circular function

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.320
minus another one.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.190
And of course, once you
write it in that simple way,

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.580
as a circ function, as
the difference between two

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.450
circ functions, you can do the
Fourier transform with that

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.870
very easily and get the point
spread function of these two

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.950
cases very easily.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:17.730
And so he's working it out for
a focal length of 20 centimeters

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.320
and a wavelength of 0.5 microns.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.220
And the width of
that aperture is--

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.700
what is it?

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:35.120
It looks about 4 millimeters
diameter, something like that.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.100
Yeah.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.830
Anyway, so this is-- and he
works out what it looks like.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.530
So this is the PSF.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.640
This is supposed
to be an Airy disk.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.700
It's been sampled
a bit coarsely,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.530
so it looks a bit ragged.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:58.640
And so what you see is when
you look at the annular case,

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.720
you put this central
obscuration in the center

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.720
there, what it does is it
narrows up that central lobe.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.380
And you can see, though,
it also increases

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.260
the strength of
these side lobes,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.630
that these are much
higher than these ones.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:22.720
So although in some cases
this can give a good

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.300
an improved image compared
with this, for example,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.320
for point objects
it would do well,

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.250
but if you've got
an extended object

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.170
like an image of a
car or something,

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.080
it might not work so well.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.850
The other way of thinking on
it is in terms of the MTF.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:46.190
And this is our normal
MTF for a circular pupil.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.750
It's this so-called
Chinese hat function.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.550
And then for the annular
pupil, this is what you get.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.800
You remember, you
calculate these.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.230
This is the convolution, the
autocorrelation of a circle.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.050
So you have to--

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.490
you get two circles
and you displace

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.740
it one relative to the other.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.650
You calculate the
area of overlap,

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.740
and you plot the area of overlap
as a function of the distance

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.720
between the two center.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.000
So that's how you
actually calculate this.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.030
And you do the
same with this one,

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.840
and you can see what you
get is you see that it drops

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.090
more quickly, first of all.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.460
This is normalized to
1 because you normally

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.220
normalize transfer functions
to 1 for 0 spatial frequencies.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.930
That's the way we
normally do it.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:42.730
But I guess maybe it's not
the only way of doing it.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.690
This drops down quickly
because you can see,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.570
if you're working out the
autocorrelation at this angular

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.790
aperture, you can
see that [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:56.700
you move it a small amount,
the one the one bright region

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.610
is not going to overlap
with the other one anymore.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.100
So that's why it drops
off quickly there.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.400
And then it has
another blip out here,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.900
which basically comes about
from when the toe annularly--

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.020
where they both got their bright
bits on top of each other.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.510
And so if you compare
this one with this one,

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.290
you can see that here the
spatial frequency response

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.420
is much lower.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.153
Here, actually,
it can be higher.

00:22:29.153 --> 00:22:30.820
The cutoff of course,
is still the same.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.940
So you could calculate
the image of any object

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.540
you fancied from knowing that.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.090
And this is another example.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:47.770
This is the case of a
Gaussian apodization.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:52.040
So what we're now
doing is instead of--

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.550
the annulus is
effectively boosting up

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.500
the edges of the
pupil, which is why

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.880
you get this improved high
spatial frequency response.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.040
Here we're doing the
opposite of that.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.900
apodization-- if George was
here, he would tell us--

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.050
in fact, he already did it
one of the previous lectures--

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:16.780
apodization means to cut off
the feet in Greek, I believe.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.690
He'll probably be listening
to my lecture and tell me

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:20.950
I've got my Greek all wrong.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.240
But anyway, it's to do--

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.450
it means to cut off the feet.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.120
And what it means, why
it's given that name,

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.560
is because it cuts
off the side lobes.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:35.350
So you see the side lobes of the
Airy disk have disappeared now.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.900
So by making this shaded
aperture-- in this case,

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.030
is a Gaussian function--

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.250
you make something
which is a bit broader.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.340
Actually, in this case, doesn't
look very much broader at all.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.060
But the side lobes
have gone, and this

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:54.350
is what it's done to
the transfer function.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:24:00.100
You see now it's slower to
fall off here than this one.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.890
But the high spatial frequencies
are now reduced relative

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:04.640
to this other one.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.600
So overview on this, then.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.340
This is what we call--

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.220
or what George is calling
pupil engineering.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:25.330
And so if you try to make
the main, the central lobe

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.620
of the PSF smaller, then you're
going to get bigger side lobes.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.830
And that seems to be something
that you can't avoid.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.360
Nobody's come up with a way
of doing something clever that

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.160
avoids that.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.110
And the opposite,
of course, if you

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:47.740
make the main side lobe bigger,
the side lobes get smaller.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:52.420
No doubt, that is maybe not so
necessarily going to happen.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.010
I suspect that if
you really wanted,

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.385
you could probably
make something

00:24:55.385 --> 00:24:58.120
that had a big central
lobe and big side lobes.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.860
But nobody would really
want that anyway.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.190
And then also this
power loss problem,

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:10.120
that there is going to be some
worse signal-to-noise sort

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.890
of performance.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:16.800
So annular-type pupils
typically narrow the main lobe

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.020
at the point spread function at
the expense of high side lobes.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.660
Gaussian-type pupil
functions typically

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.760
suppress the side lobes
but broaden the main lobe.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.700
And so, as it says
here, different sorts

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.580
of filters like
this might possibly

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:41.497
be worth considering for
certain particular applications.

00:25:41.497 --> 00:25:43.080
Yeah, and then he
gives another couple

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.080
of problems with these things.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:52.570
Making a filter which is of
varying amplitude is not easy.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.040
And I guess nowadays you might
do it with some liquid crystal

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.220
device, hopefully.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.630
We might be doing that
so, won't we, Charlene?

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.350
But until recently,
this would have

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:12.150
to have been done by some sort
of photolithographic process.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:18.870
And actually getting controlling
the absorption of the filter

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:24.940
to accurately fit what you
designed is not trivial.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.950
And there's also this
energy loss problem, then.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:34.645
Yeah, nowadays people are very
interested in phase filters.

00:26:34.645 --> 00:26:36.270
You can do a lot of
these clever things

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:43.480
also by using phase masks
rather than amplitude masks.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:49.180
And of course, a phase apodizer
is going to be lossless.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.640
So that might make
it sound attractive.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.180
And so George says that
maybe it is attractive.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:02.590
Actually, it turns out, I think,
it's not quite as attractive

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.080
as it might sound
because, actually,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.810
very often what happens is if
you use an absorbing filter,

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.720
the absorption that you
can introduce actually

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.080
can reduce the size
of the side lobes.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.830
So if you do it
cleverly, you might

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:26.110
be able to make the side
lobes lower and also

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.200
still get as much energy
into the central lobe with it

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.410
with an absorbing mask as
with a pure phase mask.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.450
Yeah, and then we get on
to all these terminologies

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.980
that is obviously
annoyed by as much as me.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.360
This is one.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.570
This super cool digital
camera has a resolution

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.820
of eight megapixels.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.750
And so what's he going
to say about this?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.880
Big no again.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:03.670
So this is using
the word wrongly.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.980
This has nothing to
do with resolution.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.150
And so what they are
actually referring

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:15.400
to is the space bandwidth
product of the camera, how

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.500
many pixels there
are, which is not

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.980
really measured as resolution.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.890
The other one, as all
the people in my group

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.500
would know that I always
get very cross about,

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.230
is these interferometry
people who are always

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.570
talking about
inerferometers being

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:36.370
able to resolve one
Angstrom, which is also wrong

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:40.080
because it's nothing
about resolving.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.100
So resolving, resolution, we've
said what resolution means.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.790
So this question of
the number of pixels,

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.330
is there a connection
between the two?

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.750
Well, I guess the answer is,
there is and there isn't.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.010
There is a relationship if
you design the optical system

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.270
properly.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.810
But what George is
pointing out here

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.730
is that, actually, this is an
example where the pixels are

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.040
very much smaller
than the point spread

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.200
function of the optical system.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.460
So actually, here you're very
much over sampling this image.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.290
So all you're measuring--
you're measuring very accurately

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.480
a blurred picture.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.440
So that's not really giving
you very good resolution

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.760
and not really very--

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:39.297
the number of resolution
elements in your image

00:29:39.297 --> 00:29:41.630
is actually much smaller then
than the number of pixels.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.510
Sometimes they use
this word resels,

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.070
don't they, resolution elements.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.760
Have you seen that?

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.250
They spell it R-E-S-E-L. It's
an abbreviation for resolution

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.190
elements, so it's the number
of resolved spots you've got

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:07.160
in your device rather
than the number of pixels.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.090
Some more misstatements--
it is pointless to attempt

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:15.350
to resolve beyond the Rayleigh
criterion, however defined.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:18.440
No, the difficulty
increases gradually as

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.050
feature sizes shrink, and
difficulty is noise dependent.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:26.390
So it's not a sharp
hard and fast line.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.440
But that said, I think
you I think it probably

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.760
would be pointless
to attempt to resolve

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.930
10 times the Rayleigh limit
with an ordinary optical system

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.170
because you know you're not
going to be able to do that.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:47.180
But STED, that we were talking
about earlier, does do that.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.420
So this is [INAUDIBLE]
well, OK, so maybe it

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.260
is worth attempting to do it
because people have come up

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.600
with ways of doing it now.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.320
Apodization can be used to beat
the resolution limit imposed

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.760
by the numerical aperture.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.390
And there's a big
no there again.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:11.540
Watch the side lobe growth
and poor efficiency loss.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:16.240
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I spoke to one of--

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.830
maybe Charlene-- I
can't remember now.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:25.460
There was a paper in Nature
Methods recently by Nikolai

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.070
[? Segilev, ?] where
he gave an example

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.980
of a super-resolving
mask, and he gave the pic

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.540
this picture of a very
narrow point spread function,

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.830
improving on the Rayleigh
rate resolution limit

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:45.570
by a factor of, I don't
know, a few, I think.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.430
But I did some calculations
on the design he gave.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:53.120
It turned out that this
little central peak

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.020
was surrounded by side
lobes that went up

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.350
to something like 10 to
the power of 40-something

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.880
or something really ridiculous.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.340
And the amount of energy that
went into this central spot

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.500
was, like, nothing.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.340
And what made it even worse
was that if you actually

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.360
calculated what happened
as you went out of focus,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.770
you found that you also got
these big walls around it, very

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.780
high all around it, actually.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:29.390
So it was this like this very
small bright spot completely

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.390
surrounded by something
which was, like,

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.880
10 to the 40 times higher.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.720
So how you would ever
use that in practice, you

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.900
can think it really
obviously wouldn't

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.430
be a very practical device.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.820
Then the number of the rest
of the pixels in your camera

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.050
is not the resolution.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.730
So what is resolution?

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:05.490
Our ability to resolve to point
objects based on the image.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:09.420
However, this may be
difficult to quantify.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.800
Resolution is related
to the NA, i.e.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.880
it's proportional to the NA.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.950
The distance is inversely
proportional to the NA.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.700
That's another thing
that people sometimes

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.960
get into knots about of
course because resolution

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.060
means that the
bigger the number,

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.180
the more is the resolution.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.870
But actually, the smaller the
size, the more the resolution,

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.400
so beware.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:41.520
So sometimes, actually, people
use the term "resolving power"

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.560
to get around that problem
because otherwise-- people

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.940
say things which they don't
really mean sometimes.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:54.000
Yeah, so other factors
that can affect

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.800
resolution-- aberrations,
apodization, and noise.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.370
So is there an easy answer?

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:07.410
When in doubt, quote,
0.61 lambda over NA.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.100
And then you get the
marks in the exam.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:12.739
So that's that one done.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.320
So how are we going?

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.330
Got a bit more time yet.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.170
That was last week's lecture
I just gave then, anyway.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:31.260
So I think it must be this one.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.690
So I don't know how far we're
going to get with this one,

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.030
but we can at least start it.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.350
So what we're supposed
to be doing today,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.030
more applications
of the transfer

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.670
function, a bit
about depth of focus,

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.230
and a bit about deconvolution.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:59.270
And there's some
nice simulations

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.250
that George is
done to show that.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.940
And then he's got down
for Wednesday, which

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.230
I'm also going to be giving.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.710
I think George is not back.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.760
Do you know when
George comes back?

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.587
AUDIENCE: No.

00:35:12.587 --> 00:35:13.170
PROFESSOR: No.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.910
Anyway, so I shall be giving
the lecture on Wednesday.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:24.920
And so polarization-- what
we don't finish from today

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.620
will obviously also
be on Wednesday,

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.610
and then there's polarization,
intensity distribution

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:36.410
near the focus of
high-NA imaging systems.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.950
And yeah, I don't know what else
we're going to do, actually,

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:42.573
because George keeps changing
his mind about what we ought

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:43.740
to put in that last lecture.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.960
So defocus.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.758
So this is an
example of defocus.

00:35:50.758 --> 00:35:52.050
Anyone know what this movie is?

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:53.670
I don't.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.330
I'm out of touch with cinema.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.460
Recognize who the
other stars are?

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.750
No?

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:02.510
No.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.010
I'm only asking
because I just did--

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.180
AUDIENCE: It's Fight Club.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.360
PROFESSOR: Is that right?

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.832
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:08.832 --> 00:36:09.540
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.990
Anyway, what you'll
notice is this guy here--

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.620
is it a guy?

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.040
I can't really recognize
what it is, actually.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.320
But it's out of focus.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it could be.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.050
OK, so anyway, so that's
an example of defocus.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.910
Then this is what
happens when you

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:40.100
get a lens in the
proximal approximation

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.660
and look at the intensity
in the focal region.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.670
You get something that
looks a bit like that.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.930
It doesn't look quite
the same as [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:52.120
I don't know how George
did this calculation.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.380
But you'll notice that
this is the focal plane,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.920
so this is a cross section
through the Airy disk.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.465
So you see the central--

00:37:00.465 --> 00:37:03.180
ah, well, I can tell you
why it's different, then.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:06.420
You can see these have got
its regularly spaced zeros.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.570
So he's done this through
a slit aperture, hasn't he?

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:14.800
And so that might explain
why it looks a bit different.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.240
But what you'll see--

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.300
excuse me-- is that as
you go out of focus--

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.340
well, note one thing.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.340
It's symmetrical
about the focal plan.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.670
And this is--

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.430
I think we probably had that
somewhere before, actually,

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.620
that it's symmetrical.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:41.770
If it's calculated using the
usual Debye approximation,

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:43.630
you get a result like that.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:50.110
So if you've got, for
example, the aperture stop

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.600
is in the front focal
plane of the lens

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.760
and you look at what happens
in the back focal plane, then

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.810
that would be the case.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.460
You get this symmetrical
behavior like this.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:08.070
And you can see also
these sort of bright bands

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.150
that seem to go off at
diagonal lines here.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.660
I guess, yeah, so that
corresponds roughly

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.610
to the edge of the
aperture then, of course.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.280
And yeah, so the width of the
central spot in this direction,

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.260
then, we've said is this
0.61 lambda over NA,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.970
and this distance from
the focal plane where

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.310
you get to this
first zero is given

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.860
by some expression like this.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.380
It goes as if--
this is really only

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.150
true for the paraxial case.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:49.200
But for the paraxial
case, this NA

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.940
here, NA squared here, if it's
the high aperture case, which

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.730
we might consider
on Wednesday, you'll

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.955
find that this is not
quite right anymore.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.080
Yeah, so delta x is
the radial resolution.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.060
Delta z is the depth of focus,
today's topics, depth of focus

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.500
or depth of field.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.650
And both of those he calls DoF.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:19.540
Note the very high
numerical apertures.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.150
The scalar approximation
is no longer good.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.880
The vectorial nature of
the electromagnetic field

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.650
becomes important.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.520
That is true.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.920
There's other things
as well, though.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.520
When you do all this paraxial
stuff, if you remember,

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.760
all the time you're replacing
sine theta by theta and things

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.680
like that, making
approximations like that.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:44.590
So there are actually lots
of approximations you make.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.610
One is the fact that
the angles are small.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.970
The other is that you neglect
the polarization effects.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.260
When the apertures become big,
then the polarization effects

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.760
become very important.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.880
So we're going to look
at this sort of system.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:12.710
And so this is a 4F
system with magnification,

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.940
so the two the focal
length of the two lenses

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.040
are different in this case.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.790
And so this shows
what happens if you're

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:26.790
looking at an object which is
placed a distance F in front

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:31.350
of this lens and your screen
is placed the difference F2

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.170
behind this lens,
and your aperture

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.880
is F1 from this one
and F2 from this one.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.760
So everything there
is set up properly

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.070
as defined for a 4F system.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.880
And this is the case
where you'd expect,

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.540
as I was just describing, the
defocus point spread function

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.660
is going to be symmetric.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:41:02.580
So we place our mask there,
and we've got our pupil.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.410
So this is our object function.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:11.330
This is the angular
spectrum, the spectrum

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:14.660
of the object in
this plane here,

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.980
which is then filtered
by the aperture stop.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:26.120
And then that gives some sort
of amplitude in this plane

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.460
here, which is
going to be inverted

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.660
and also magnified or
otherwise according

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.810
to the ratio of F1 over F2.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:38.440
And there's the rays
going through it.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.220
And this is showing how--

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.040
yeah, this plane, this
is his terminology.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.510
This is x.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.980
This is x prime.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.590
This is x double prime.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:55.370
And you can see here x
double prime maximum is

00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.440
equal to the and the
radius of the aperture.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.700
So this is his terminology.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:05.420
We are going to get that in
a minute coming [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.860
This is a function of x This is
a function of x double prime.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.390
This is a function of x prime.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.180
This is the numerical
aperture of the lens

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.530
that's looking at it.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:24.540
And yeah, so the
numerical aperture

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.160
is equal to x double
prime maximum, which

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:38.740
is equal to A over F1, again
assuming that the sine theta

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.260
or tan theta are both theta.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.760
Now, what we're
going to look at now

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.470
is what happens if we
defocus this system.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.090
So now our object has been
displaced the distance delta

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:52.870
away, and we want to calculate
what the image of that

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.370
looks like now.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:59.060
And so what we can say
is that after we've

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.370
eliminated this
object, we've got

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:04.400
this GT of x, and then
that light is going

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.750
to propagate from here to here.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.290
And in order to
calculate that, we

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:14.750
have to convolve it with
the propagation kernel.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.430
So you convolve it
with this thing.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.670
For some reason, when George
converted this from his

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:28.150
whatever his other
thing's called, keynotes--

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.140
it's a PowerPoint.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.560
All the equations are
like as though someone's

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.390
had their martinis
before the lecture.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.940
So we then look at the Fourier
transform of that in this plane

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:41.970
here.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.890
So this thing convolves--

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:46.080
Fourier transforms to this.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.240
The convolution
transforms to a product,

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.110
and this Gaussian transforms
to another Gaussian.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:56.360
And notice that, as
usual, of course,

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.730
you remember that the
scaling thing for Fourier

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.460
transforms, the
bigger a function is,

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.380
the smaller it's Fourier
transform and vice versa.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:10.010
So this lambda delta at the
bottom appears now at the top.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.760
So the bigger delta
is, the bigger

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.940
this thing's going to be here.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.218
Yeah?

00:44:19.218 --> 00:44:22.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:24.973 --> 00:44:25.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.620
AUDIENCE: Is E to the
imaginary x squared a Gaussian?

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.267
Or only the E to the real
x squared a Gaussian?

00:44:31.267 --> 00:44:31.850
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:37.300
Yeah, the real Gaussian is E to
the minus x squared, isn't it?

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.910
E to the minus x
squared does that.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:45.650
This is what you might
call an imaginary Gaussian.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:49.280
But it all comes out
in the wash, actually.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.000
So just the same as
the Fourier transform

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.100
of the normal Gaussian
is another Gaussian,

00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.020
so the Fourier transform
of this imaginary Gaussian

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.750
is another imaginary Gaussian.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:06.830
So what's really converting
is a parabolic phase front

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:11.340
here to a parabolic
phase front here.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:16.040
So you can get it just by
getting the normal expression.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.810
I mean, it sometimes amazes
me having how much liberties

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.130
you can take with these things.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:25.370
But you just take the
expressions for the Gaussian,

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.290
and you put in this
complex number,

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:28.590
and it gives the right answer.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.800
So it's very nice.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.330
I guess occasionally
there might be

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.650
occasions when it doesn't work.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:45.070
Yeah, so what he's then saying
is that you can think of this--

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.290
this is the object for our--

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:50.500
this is the spectrum for
our defocused objects,

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:59.290
which is multiplied by the
pupil function of the system.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:02.200
But that is exactly
equivalent of course

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.560
to thinking of it as
the ordinary object

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:13.690
spectrum multiplied by a
modified pupil function.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:18.040
So it doesn't matter whether
you associate this with this

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.020
or with the pupil function.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.330
So that's what we can think of.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:26.770
We can think of the objects
as being the same as where

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.260
it is if it wasn't
defocused, and we

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.310
can think of the pupil
function of the thing being

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:37.150
modified to take into
account of defocus.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:41.110
We sometimes called that the
defocus transfer function.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.720
And so he's now going
to calculate that.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.660
Yeah, so the defocus--

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:51.510
he calls it here the defocus
amplitude transfer function.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.440
So remember, here
we're dealing--

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:58.140
this is dealing now
with coherent system.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.970
Before, when we were
doing the resolution,

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:03.340
we were looking at
incoherent systems.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.870
So now we've gone back
to coherent systems.

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:11.020
So you have to be wary of
that because sometimes there's

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.670
some differences.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:15.680
So all this is saying then--

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.710
yeah, you remember,
to go from the front

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:24.500
the pupil to the transfer
function, all you have to do

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.890
is a coordinate scaling.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:31.570
So the amplitude
transfer function

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:36.930
is just the scaled version
of this pupil function.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.960
And again, it comes out
to be now, of course--

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.280
it's going to be--

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.030
it's multiplied, of course,
still by the circular aperture.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.450
But inside that
circular aperture

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.880
where it's got some
value, its value

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:55.040
is given by this
complex exponential--

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.920
a complex Gaussian, like
we were just saying before.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.550
And that's what this looks like.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.490
Now, notice, so this is cosine.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.630
This is looking at
just the real part.

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.480
So actually, it was a complex--

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.630
it was an E to the
minus I something.

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:16.470
So you can break that
up into cos plus I sine.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.960
And the cos part
is the real part,

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.370
and the sine part is
the imaginary part.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:27.120
And as when we looked
at imaging earlier,

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.150
the real part
images real objects.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:34.010
So an amplitude object will
be imaged by the real part.

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:38.442
A phase object would be
imaged by the imaginary part.

00:48:38.442 --> 00:48:40.400
But we're not going to
say anything about that.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.370
We'll just keep
with the real part.

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:45.120
So this is cos, but
it's not a normal cos.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.990
It's cos of an x squared.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.640
So that's why it looks a
rather strange shape compared

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.870
with the normal cosine.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.410
You can see it's
become very flat there,

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:58.920
and then it becomes more
oscillating later on.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.590
And so this is
what it looks like.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.650
Of course, the actual
scaling of this

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:12.600
is going to depend on
the value of this delta.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.005
So here he looks at where
this crosses the axis.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:22.600
So this parameter, x double
prime over lambda F1,

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.450
is equal to u, the
spatial frequency.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:29.930
So this is just u squared here.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:33.800
And he says that this crosses
the axis where this argument is

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.200
equal to pi over 2.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:41.960
And if you solve
that, you'll get this.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.880
And so that's where
it crosses the axis.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.750
And then you have to
multiply this, of course,

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:54.290
by the circular aperture.

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:56.900
So this is the
circular aperture.

00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:01.760
This is the radium where the
object spectrum is non-zero.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:08.310
And so you can see
that only the parts

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:11.970
of this blue curve up to here
are going to have any meaning.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.380
The bits out here are
not going to do anything.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.380
So this is obviously
looking at a case

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.810
where this is almost flat.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:20.640
If you made it a bit
smaller, even, it

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.740
would look even flatter.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:27.800
So this is a not
a lot of defocus.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.270
And so here he's
got, then-- yeah,

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:35.110
so here now is labeling
where that cutoff is.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:38.140
So this is equal to NA
over lambda, as we know.

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.990
And in terms of the
x prime coordinate,

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:42.610
it's given right
by this thing here.

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:50.330
So this is talking about
what he calls mild defocus,

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.910
and the condition
for that to occur

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.790
is that this has got to
be much smaller than this.

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:06.480
And then-- yeah, and
that corresponds, then,

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.640
in terms of delta.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.500
So we've now got a condition
for this to happen.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.100
The value of delta has
to be small compared

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:17.040
with lambda over 2 NA squared.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.810
So you remember,
this is what we said

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:23.450
was the depth of field or
depth of focus of the system.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:31.870
Depth of field is measured
in the object space.

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:34.120
It doesn't say anything about
the defocus on that one.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.880
I thought I was
going to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.410
He says a bit about that later.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.210
This is showing
another case, then.

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:42.030
This is with much
more defocus now.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:45.210
So now it's oscillating
a lot more wildly,

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.900
so now this cutoff is
much smaller than this.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.550
And so this is where you've
got a lot of defocus.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:55.710
And the fact that
this goes negative

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.540
is probably the worst thing.

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:59.910
It means that some
spatial frequencies

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:02.820
are going to be imaged
with the wrong contrast.

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.060
So when you try doing
your Fourier synthesis

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:10.980
to add up to make the image,
it's not going to work right.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:14.070
And the other point he makes is
that the regions around here,

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:17.850
of course, these spatial
frequencies around these zeros

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.440
are not imaged at all.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:24.630
So that's another reason why it
doesn't give a very good image.

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:27.540
So this is the case of
strongly focus where delta

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:31.350
is much bigger than this thing,
not necessarily much bigger,

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.134
I suppose.

00:52:34.878 --> 00:52:36.170
I think we ought to stop there.

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.220
We've run over time anyway.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:43.020
So let's stop at this point and
we'll pick that up next time.

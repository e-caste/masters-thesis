00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.580
YEN-JIE LEE: So I
hope you can hear me.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.690
Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.750
I hope you have the
full energy back

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.380
from Thanksgiving vacation.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.070
Everybody, welcome back.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.470
So before we start, we'll
talk about where we are now.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.180
So this is actually the goal,
which we said, for 8.03,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.580
at the beginning.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.520
So what we have
been discussing is

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.190
to learn about how to
translate physical situations

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.430
into mathematics, simple
harmonic oscillator, coupled

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.530
oscillators, et cetera.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.360
And we tried to put together
infinite number of oscillators.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.380
And we found waves from
this interesting exercise.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.280
And of course, we learned about
Fourier decompositions of waves

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.860
and also learned about how to
put together physical systems.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.920
In order to do that, you need
to define boundary conditions.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.350
And those conditions
need to be satisfied,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.900
so that you can describe
multiple physical systems

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.550
all together.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.640
And the third part
of the course, we

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.320
have been focusing on
many, many applications,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.840
for instance, for the
phenomenon related

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.320
to electromagnetic
waves and also

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.830
many practical
applications in optics.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.020
And we are pretty close to
the discussion between wave

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.190
and vibrations and the
future course, which

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.900
is 8.04, the connections
to quantum mechanics.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.520
And if we have time, we will
talk about gravitational waves

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.660
if we manage to do that.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.030
It depends on how
fast we progress.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.380
So let's start
the lecture today.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.250
So first, we will give
you a short review.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.250
Before Thanksgiving,
we were talking

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.100
about polarizer filters.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.900
And we have been researching
how to make a very good photo so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.070
that you can post it
on Facebook, right?

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.800
So that's essentially
what we learned.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.230
So if you want to take a picture
of the sky, which is deep blue,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.390
then you need to
use a polarizer.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.620
And the reason?

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.740
We also understand that
it's because, if you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.380
look at the sky, which is
actually, roughly a 45 to 90

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.290
degree wave from the
direction of the sun.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.870
Basically, what you get is
that all those light fronts

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.730
scattering, between the
sunlight and the molecules

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.170
or little dust in the
sky, polarize the light.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.850
Therefore, you can actual
filter them using the polarizer.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.670
Of course, you have to tune
your polarizer carefully,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.140
so that you can
actually minimize

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.470
the light from the
sky, so that you get

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.710
a sharper image in your photo.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.630
And also, we discussed about,
with a polarizer, polarization

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.100
filter, we can actually filter
out also the reflected light,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.100
for example, from the water
or from the window of a car.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.090
And that is because something
which is closely related

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.250
to the boundary condition, which
we learned about from Maxwell's

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.960
equation in matter.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.950
And this is actually
the four equations,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.670
which we discussed last time.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.370
And in that issue, we were using
that to explain the incident

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.840
light, from air to
something which is denser,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.880
for example lighter gas.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.780
And then we found that, if we
start with unpolarized light--

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.620
this incident wave
unpolarized light--

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.589
what we found is that the
transmitted wave, which

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.070
is actually in the
bottom of this diagram,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.250
is actually still pretty
close to unpolarized

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.900
light but slightly polarized
because of the transmission

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.880
and the boundary condition.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.900
And the reflected light,
something very interesting

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.060
happens.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.690
Only the component,
which is actually

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.430
polarizing the direction, such
that the electric field is

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.470
oscillating in a
direction perpendicular

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.210
to the surface of this
light, will survive.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.010
And that actually gives
you polarized light,

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.260
which is actually
reflected from the surface.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.220
And this interesting
phenomenon reaches the maxima,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.860
where you get the fully
polarized light, when

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.020
you actually set the incident
angle of the unpolarized light

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.460
at so-called Brewster's angle.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.540
And this Brewster's
angle is happening

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.520
when the reflected light
and this transmitted light

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.030
direction actually are
orthogonal to each other.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.940
And that actually gives
you the maxima effect

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.040
we are looking for.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.930
So that's actually
what we have learned

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.840
from electromagnetic
wave in matter

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.460
and, also, matching
the boundary conditions

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:57.670
between the electromagnetic
waves inside the material

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.300
and in the air, such that
we actually learn about all

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.250
those interesting phenomena.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.770
And basically, we
have learned how

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.830
to describe
electromagnetic waves, how

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.210
to add electromagnetic waves
together, how they propagate

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.120
from one position to
the other position,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.090
and how the boundary
condition works

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.020
and your equation of motion,
et cetera, and something

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.230
related to dielectric material.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.990
And today what
we're going to do is

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.080
to put all the things
we have learned together

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.620
and see if we can
actually explain

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.090
a very interesting phenomenon.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.220
So before I start,
I will show you

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.580
a demonstration, which I'm not
sure if I will be successful.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.250
It's very difficult, actually.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.890
And of course, during
the break, you're

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.970
welcome to come over and
play with all those demos.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.710
And here, I have two sticks.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.690
And I am going to create a
soap bubble from this soap

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.670
and water.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.070
And let's see if I
will make it or not.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.220
So basically, I put this
into the soap water.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.450
And I will try to open it to
see if I can create a bubble.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.470
Yeah.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.290
You can see.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.720
You can see that there's a
colorful soap bubble created.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.770
You can see that it
is not always easy.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.320
Oh, it's getting very messy now.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.110
I'm trying to destroy
the classroom.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.880
But it's OK, because we are MIT.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.170
You can that it's
really beautiful.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.385
It's colorful.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:53.630
It live for a while,
then it breaks.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.060
And of course, during the break,
you are welcome to do this.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.860
And it's actually non-trivial
to create this size of bubble.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.380
So the success rate is like 50%.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.810
So as you can see from
this demonstration,

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.740
we see something
really beautiful.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.735
This bubble is colorful.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.190
And I didn't actually
shine this soap bubble

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.570
by all kinds of
different preset colors.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.659
So it appears automatically
and just shiny

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.740
with all kinds of
different-- whatever,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.260
wavelengths I get from the
lights that are in here.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.659
Pretty bright light,
there, on my face.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.980
And you can see that
it becomes colorful.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.780
And we are going to
understand what is going on

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:56.500
and where this color
is coming from.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.280
And the good news is that,
based on the knowledge we

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.940
have learned, we are
in a very good position

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.770
to understand this phenomenon.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.870
So before we start to
explain this phenomena,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.650
I would like to talk
about a phenomenon,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.080
so-called interference.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.160
So suppose we have two
electromagnetic waves.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.810
We can actually
add them together

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.160
because of
superposition principle.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
So what we can do
is that, suppose

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.300
I have two electric fields.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:40.400
E1 is actually defined as
A1 cosine omega t minus kz

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.360
plus phi 1 in the x direction.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.340
So by now, you should
know that this is actually

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.710
the electric field propagating
at angular frequency omega,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:10:00.580
with a wave number k, going
toward positive z direction.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.180
And the electric field is
perpendicular to the direction

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.500
of propagation in
the x direction.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.410
And also, this electric
field have a phase of phi 1.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.310
So that's actually what
we know already by now.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.710
What does this mean,
this expression mean?

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.540
And it's actually the harmonic
oscillating electric field.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.960
And of course, since I am
talking about interference,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.990
basically, I can add this,
the first electric field

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.660
and the second
electric field together

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.020
and see what will happen.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.300
So now, if you define
the second electric field

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.615
to be A2, which is the
amplitude, cosine omega

00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:52.630
t minus kz, basically, they have
the same wavelengths and also

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.810
the angular frequency--

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.130
plus phi 2.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.710
But they have different phase.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.650
And of course, in
this setup, I asked

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.140
them to be pointing to
the same direction, which

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.240
is the x direction.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.920
So we were wondering,
what is going

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:15.510
to happen if I consider the
superposition of these two

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.600
electric fields.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.900
And the total electric field,
which is called the E vector,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.110
is actually E1 plus E2.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.810
So before that, I would
like to remind you

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:37.970
about pointing vector and
also the so-called intensity.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.510
So pointing factor
is actually defined

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.300
as this S vector,
pointing vector,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:51.370
is equal to 1 over mu 0 E
cross B. So this is actually

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.290
the directional flux of
energy per unit area.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.520
So that should be the
pointing vector which

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.720
we have been using for a while.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:09.630
And also, another reminder is
that, given the electric field,

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.780
which is actually a
harmonic progressing wave,

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.750
the corresponding
B field would be

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:23.800
equal to 1/v. v is actually
the speed of the light

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.800
in some specific material.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.180
And k hat is actually
the direction

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.940
of propagation across
E. This will give you

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.260
the magnitude and
also the direction

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.100
of the corresponding
magnetic field

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.720
for the electromagnetic waves.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.750
So now I'm interested
in what would

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:59.770
be the resulting intensity, I,
if I try to superimpose this,

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:05.140
to try to put together
these two electric fields.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.200
As you can see, these
two electric field

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.370
have different phase.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.140
The first one has phase phi 1.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.270
The second one, has phase phi 2.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.920
So this means that they
may reach maxima or minima

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.000
at different position in space.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.970
In this case, it's
in the z direction.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:33.710
And what I'm actually defining
here is two plane waves.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.020
And so it really
depends on what would

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.230
be the relative phase
for the first and second

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.490
electromagnetic wave.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:48.920
In order to quantify how
much they cancel each other

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.000
or how much they enhance each
other, what I'm going to do

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.670
is to evaluate the
intensity of the resulting

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.470
electromagnetic waves.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.210
And what is actually intensity?

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.310
Intensity is actually
the amplitude

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.490
of the pointing vector.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:14.170
So I write this as the length of
the S vector, pointing vector.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:19.010
And I can, of course, calculate
what will be the value of this

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.440
or, say, the length of
the pointing vector.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.530
This will be equal
to 1 over mu 0,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.630
based on these equations here--

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.770
just a reminder.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.160
And I would like to know what
would be the length of the E

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.030
cross B field.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.600
That will give you the length
of the pointing vector.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:47.900
And basically, what you're going
to get is 1 over mu 0 times--

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.790
since the B field is
actually highly related

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:59.780
to the electric field, and
it takes a hit of 1/v, right,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.670
in terms of the size
of the amplitude.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:08.430
So basically, you're going
to get 1/v, E squared.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.420
And this cross product
actually is OK,

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.550
because it become E squared,
because B field and the E field

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.930
are always orthogonal
to each other.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.140
And I can now rewrite
this v. v is actually

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.830
the velocity of the
speed of light in matter.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.120
So basically, what
I can rewrite is

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:42.790
that will become
1/v will become c/n,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:49.060
which is actually the refractive
index of a specific material.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.560
And still I have E squared here.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.320
Finally, I can
rewrite this formula,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:05.320
since c is equal to 1 over
square root mu 0 epsilon 0.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.030
Therefore, I can
rewrite this expression

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.210
in terms of epsilon 0.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:16.190
And what I'm going to get
is c times n time epsilon 0,

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.120
There E squared.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.570
So basically, what I do is
I multiply both numerator

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:33.490
and the denominator
by c, and also

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.560
I actually use this expression.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.990
Then I can actually
cancel the mu 0

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:44.380
and then write everything in
terms of c, n, and epsilon 0.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.750
So until here, there
was basically no magic.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:52.290
Basically, it's just
rewriting the length

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:58.570
of the pointing vector
in terms of n and also

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.640
the electric field.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.829
So now, what I am going to do
is to plug in this expression

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:11.270
into that formula and see
what we are going to get.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:16.163
So let me evaluate what
would be the E squared,

00:17:16.163 --> 00:17:17.329
the length of the E squared.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:22.099
So basically, the definition
of the E is shown here.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.760
It's the superposition
of E1 and E2.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.910
Therefore, I can now
quickly write down

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.430
what would be E squared here.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:42.140
Basically, you are going to
get A1 squared, cosine squared,

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:47.660
omega t minus kz plus phi 1.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:53.300
Basically, that is coming
from the E1 times E1.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.540
The second term, which
I'm going to get,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.040
is actually E2 times E2.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.650
E2 times E3, you are
going to get A2 squared,

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:12.360
cosine squared, omega
t minus kz plus phi 2.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.890
Basically based on this
equation, and I square it,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.890
and then I get the
second part here.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.340
And finally, what
I am going to get

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.360
is the third term, which
is actually E1 times E2.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:36.995
Basically, you are going to
get 2 times A1 A2 cosine omega

00:18:36.995 --> 00:18:47.201
t minus kz plus phi 1
cosine omega t minus kz

00:18:47.201 --> 00:18:53.150
plus phi 2, which is actually
the cross term of this E

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.420
vector squared.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.360
Any questions so far?

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.830
I hope this is pretty
straightforward to you.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.610
And of course, I can
now rewrite this product

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.740
with 2 cosine, cosine
times cosine, right?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.920
Basically, I can
rewrite this using

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.960
the formula, which
we have related

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.730
to a cosine times a cosine.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:27.620
Basically, I can rewrite this as
1/2 cosine 2 omega t minus 2kz

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:37.510
plus phi 1 plus phi 2 plus
1/2 cosine phi 1 minus phi 2.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.850
So basically, the
first term is actually

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.400
collecting the content
of the two cosine

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.560
and their length together.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.920
The second term is
actually calculating

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.240
the difference between the
content of the cosine function.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.770
And what I'm going to get is
actually phi 1 minus phi 2.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.910
Now, based on this
definition, intensity,

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.800
I is actually equal to
the magnitude of that

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.010
pointing vector.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.290
So remember, our
goal is to evaluate

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.860
what will be the resulting
average intensity.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.740
So now I can calculate what
would be the average intensity

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.260
over one period.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.310
So this will be equal to
1/T, integration over 0

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:38.830
to T, one period, and the
instantaneous intensity, I, dt.

00:20:41.572 --> 00:20:44.170
And what I am going
to get is that--

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.090
so we have three terms.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.480
The first term is here,
which is actually A1 squared,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.200
cosine squared.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.400
It's actually
related to omega t.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.530
And the second term is here.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:01.570
It's also proportional to
cosine squared omega t.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.850
And finally, we
have two terms here,

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:09.780
which is actually proportional
to cosine 2 omega t.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:16.210
And finally, the last term is
actually independent of time.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:22.620
So what I'm going to do is to
evaluate the individual terms.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.880
For the first
term, basically, A1

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.610
squared, cosine
squared, omega t.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:32.290
So by now, it should be
pretty straightforward for you

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.560
if I integrate cosine squared
over one period of time,

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.210
basically, what you are
going to get is 1/2.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:45.220
So is actually done
several times in the p set.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.160
So basically, what
you're going to get is--

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.550
I am going to collect all
of those constants from here

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.300
and copy here.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.500
So basically, you have c
times n times epsilon 0,

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:05.110
which is actually coming from
the definition of intensity.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:10.630
And then for the first
term, what I am going to get

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.250
is A1 squared divided by 2.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.220
This 1/2 is actually
just an integral

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.630
related to cosine squared.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.960
Similarly, you are going to get
the same result, a very similar

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.350
result, for the second term.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.610
The second term is going to give
you A2 squared divided by 2.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.850
Finally, you can
have the third term.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:43.040
The third turn is going
to give you what value?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.494
Can somebody help me?

00:22:45.494 --> 00:22:46.370
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.500
YEN-JIE LEE: Yes, 0, right?

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.450
Because this is actually
cosine 2 omega t, right?

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.900
So if you integrate
over one period,

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.540
you are going to get 0 plus 0.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.940
Each period will
give you 0, right?

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.410
So 0 plus 0 is 0, so
therefore you get 0.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.030
Very good.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:07.042
How about the last term,
anybody can help me?

00:23:07.042 --> 00:23:08.797
AUDIENCE: It should
remain as it is.

00:23:08.797 --> 00:23:09.880
YEN-JIE LEE: That's right.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.680
Because it's a constant.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.040
So the average of a constant is
a constant, which is actually

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:27.080
giving you 1/2 times 2
times A1 times A2 cosine

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.470
phi 1 minus phi 2.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.680
Of course, I can
cancel this 1/2, which

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.200
is actually coming
from here, and the 2,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.742
which is coming from here.

00:23:36.742 --> 00:23:43.200
And basically, you are getting
A1 A2 cosine phi 1 minus phi 2.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.250
And I need to
close this bracket.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.790
Any questions so far?

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.100
So what we have been
doing is that I evaluated

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.530
the total electric field.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.740
I basically calculated
the superposition

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.030
of the two fields.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:05.620
And then I am interested in what
would be the average intensity

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.630
coming from this field.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.000
And I write down E
squared explicitly.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.490
There are four terms and only
three of them actually survive.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:21.550
And basically, the expression
I'm getting is like this.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.280
Basically, you have
some constant multiplied

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.790
by A1 squared over 2
plus A2 squared over 2

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:32.570
plus A1 A2 cosine
phi 1 minus phi 2.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:37.960
You can see that the intensity
depends on phi 1 and phi 2,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.100
right?

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.320
So this actually would change
the resulting intensity.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.670
So in order to get some idea
about what does that mean

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:53.800
and also how does the
average intensity change

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.060
as a function of phi 1 minus
phi2, what I'm going to do

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:03.220
is to define phi 1 minus
phi 2 to be delta, which

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.100
I will call phase difference.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.890
Then I would like to plot
the averaging intensity, I,

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:17.280
as a function of delta and
see what's going to happen.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.420
So this is actually
the result. So if I

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.840
have the x-axis
to be delta, which

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:29.780
is actually phi 1 minus phi 2,
and the y-axis is intensity.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.190
Of course, I would like to
take out the constant, which

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.520
is c times n times epsilon 0.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.740
So I am plotting the y-axis'
average intensity divided

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.150
by c times n times epsilon 0.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.210
What I'm going to
get is something

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:52.690
which is actually oscillating
up and down, like this.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:06.895
The maxima value happens
when delta is equal to 0.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:13.840
When delta is equal to 0,
what is going to happen?

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.715
This means that cosine
delta is equal to what?

00:26:18.715 --> 00:26:23.020
, Therefore what you are going
to get is A1 squared over 2

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.000
plus A2 squared
over 2 plus A1 A2.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.620
This is actually when
there delta is equal to 0.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.860
And the intensity,
as you reach maxima,

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.640
and the maxima values
is actually 1/2

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:55.870
A1 plus A2 squared, based
on these calculations.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.860
On the other hand,
you can expect

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.790
that that intensity
will reach a minima when

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.220
delta is equal to which value?

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.349
Anybody can help me.

00:27:09.349 --> 00:27:09.890
AUDIENCE: Pi.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.380
YEN-JIE LEE: Pi, yes.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.020
When delta is pi, what
is going to happen?

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.320
Cosine pi is minus 1.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.280
So therefore, what you
are getting is 1/2 A1

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.740
squared plus A2
squared minus 2 A1 A2.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:35.300
And that will give you
1/2 A1 minus A2 squared.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.960
You can see that, when
the filter is equal to 0

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.660
or when the filter is
equal to 2 pi, for example,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:51.440
if you increase the phase
difference large enough,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.890
or the filter is actually
4 pi, all of those number

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:02.530
will keep you maxima
constructive interference.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:03.490
So what does that mean?

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:08.650
That means you are adding
these two electric fields

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.550
in the most efficient way.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:18.910
On the other hand, when
the value of the filter

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:26.800
is equal to pi or equal to 3
pi or equal to 5 pi, et cetera,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.390
the intensity, the average
intensity reaches a minima.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.930
That means, instead
of adding them,

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.240
you are actually canceling them.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.330
You are canceling
the electric field

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:46.390
of the first and the second
electromagnetic wave.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:51.730
And now I give you a maxima
intensity, which is 1/2 A1

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.860
minus A2 squared.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.610
Just a reminder, this
A1 and A2 is actually

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:02.410
the amplitude of the first
and second electric field.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:07.170
So what will happen if
I set A1 equal to A2?

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:14.130
If I set A1 equal to A2,
that means the minima

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.570
would be equal to what?

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.350
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.330
YEN-JIE LEE: 0, yeah, very good.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.956
How about the maxima?

00:29:20.956 --> 00:29:21.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:25.240
YEN-JIE LEE: It will
be A1 plus A2, right?

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.130
So basically, you are going
to get four times larger value

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:35.330
compared to the intensity
before you add them together.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:41.030
So individual intensity is I.
And after adding them together,

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.120
with delta equal
to 0, you are going

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.660
to get four times
larger intensity

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.980
if the amplitude of the first
and second electric field

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.650
is the same.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.500
So very good.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.310
So that's actually the
result of the calculation.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:03.370
And you can see that the amount
of intensity we can get out

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.770
of this highly depends on
the filter, which is actually

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.790
the phase difference
between the first

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:12.650
and the second electric field.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:17.290
Can we actually get some more
feeling about this addition?

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.980
So what I am going
to do is to, again,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:27.460
write everything down in
terms of imaginary number

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.160
or, say, a complex number.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:38.220
So if I rewrite the
electric field, E1,

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:45.570
as a real part of A1
exponential i phi 1,

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:51.400
exponential i omega t minus kz.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.340
In the x direction.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.240
And I can also
rewrite the expression

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.730
for the second
electric field to be

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:07.225
the real part of A2 exponential
i phi 2, exponential omega

00:31:07.225 --> 00:31:13.180
t minus kz, again,
in the x direction

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:18.430
So if I add these two fields
together, what I am doing

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:24.520
is like in the complex plane
I have an imaginary number

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.310
contribution in the y direction.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:32.580
And the real part is
actually in the x direction.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.890
Suppose omega t minus kz is 0.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:41.260
At some instant of time omega
t minus kz is equal to 0.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:46.090
So what I'm doing is I have the
first vector, which is actually

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:52.810
presenting the contribution
of the first electric field.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:58.460
And this electric field is going
to be pointing to a direction

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:05.200
phi 1 away from the real axis
with amplitude equal to A1.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.860
This is actually what we
learned from the first lecture.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.560
And if I add the second electric
field, what I'm going to get

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:21.820
is another vector, which
is actually A2 in length.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:29.320
And the angle is phi 2, here.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:35.560
So the resulting
amplitude is actually

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:42.570
when I take the real part of
the first and second expression,

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.950
adding them together.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:51.220
Basically, I am taking a
projection to the real axis.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:56.800
And that is actually
the resulting amplitude

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.050
of the electric field, which
is actually the superposition

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.330
of the first and second field.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:16.150
So you can see
that, when phi 1 is

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:21.710
equal to phi 2, what is going
to happen is the following.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.640
So basically, what you're
actually going to get

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.260
is that you are
increasing the length

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:35.710
of the routing vector, which
is the addition of the two

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.580
vectors.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:42.310
You are actually getting a
maxima out of this addition.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:45.790
Because phi 1 is equal to phi
2, therefore, these two vectors

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.060
form a straight
line, therefore, you

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:53.950
can actually add and
get maximum amount

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:59.080
of the amplitude out of this.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:05.300
On the other hand,
when phi 1 minus phi 2

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:14.949
is pi, which I define as
delta, when this happens,

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:19.510
what we are doing is like
addition of two vectors,

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:23.409
in a complex plane,
but they are pointing

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.870
to the opposite direction.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.790
So the first one
will be like this.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.630
And the second one will
be looking like that.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:35.260
And they are actually
trying to cancel each other.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.300
So that's actually how you can
understand what is happening

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.310
with different delta values.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.330
In this case, delta
is equal to 0.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.960
The phase difference
is equal to 0.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.159
And in the second case, phase
difference is equal to pi.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:55.790
And then what happened
in between is like this.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.730
You are adding them
sort of together but not

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.830
in the most efficient way
or the most destructive way.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.290
And you are actually
evaluating what

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.830
will be the resulting
amplitude by looking

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:13.120
at the vector sum of the
first and second field.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.180
So I hope that this will give
you a some more intuition

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.450
about what we have been doing.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.380
Any questions so far?

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.150
So now, we are actually
in a very good position

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.960
once we understand
this superposition

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.410
of the two electric fields
and the interference.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.160
Basically, the size of
the resulting intensity

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.070
will be highly dependent
on the phase difference

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.170
between the two fields.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.630
Then we are in a
very good position

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:53.270
to discuss the phenomenon
which we just see in the demo.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:58.730
So before I actually
perform the calculation

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.590
and give you the
explanation, I would like

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.560
to take a vote, as of usual.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.390
So the question we are
asking is, in addition

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.630
to what we see in the demo--

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:16.310
we see a colorful bubble--

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:22.550
how thick is the soap film
such that you can see color

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.070
from the reflected light?

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:28.850
The first option is maybe
it's like 1 millimeter, which

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:30.290
is possible.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:35.090
And that is about the
size of the head of a pin.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:40.580
Or it can be 100 micron, so
that's actually about the size,

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:45.020
the thickness is about the
size of the human hair.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:50.930
Or 100 nanometer, which
is the size of the virus.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.410
How many of you
think the thickness

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.990
is roughly 1 millimeter?

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.700
Raise your hand.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.447
Nobody thinks so.

00:37:01.447 --> 00:37:01.946
Really?

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.460
Actually nobody think
that's the case.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.090
How about 100 micron?

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.680
How many of you think so?

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.250
How about 100 nanometer?

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.998
Me How many of you?

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.140
So that is actually the vote.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.570
And we are going to know
the result very soon.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.190
And how about the rest?

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:54.770
Cool.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:58.900
So now we are going
to solve the puzzle.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:03.670
So just a quick
reminder about what

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.620
we have learned from
the last lecture.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:11.090
So there is a reason why
we have the lecture first

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:15.410
on the reflection of an
electromagnetic wave before we

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.560
discuss the color of the bubble.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:26.200
So from the last
lecture, suppose

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:33.080
I have two materials, which form
an interface between material

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.640
number 1, with
refractive index n1,

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.760
and the second material
has a refractive index n2.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.020
If I have an incident
wave, incident

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:50.670
electromagnetic plane wave,
and the incident angle

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:57.960
is actually, in this case, 0,
that means this incident plane

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.680
wave is actually propagating in
a direction which is actually

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.800
hitting the surface directly.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.950
So if the initial
amplitude is A,

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.140
what we have learned
from last time

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.780
is that there will be a
reflective wave, which

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.620
is actually R times
A. R is actually

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.970
reflective coefficient.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:25.850
And finally, you have
also the transmitted wave,

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:34.510
which I call T times A, where
is the transmission coefficient.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:38.380
From the exercise, which
we actually already

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:47.270
done last time, R is equal to n1
minus n2 divided by n1 plus n2.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:51.010
And the transmission
coefficient is actually

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:58.630
T equal to 2n1
divided by n1 plus n2.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.870
So basically, what I am
actually talking about here

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.150
is a conclusion
from the exercise

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:10.960
we have done in the last
lecture, just a quick reminder.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:17.500
So I would like to discuss with
you various situation related

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.970
to R value.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:24.730
So the n1 and the n2 are
related to the property

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.790
of the first medium
and the second medium.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:36.700
So it could be that n1 is
actually greater than n2.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:42.760
So if n1 is greater than n2
in the experimental setup,

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:48.370
that means that R will
be greater than 0.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.940
Because R is
actually n1 minus n2

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.090
divided by the sum of n1 and n2.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:01.700
Therefore, what I'm going to
get is something like this.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.750
So basically, I'm going
to have an incident

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.580
wave like this, where, say,
I use the notation pointing

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.250
upwards.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:19.690
Once they got reflected, it
is actually still like this,

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:25.070
pointing upward, because the
R is actually greater than 0.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.830
There's no changing
sign in the amplitude.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:41.582
Therefore, there's an
no flip in amplitude

00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:46.960
if n1 is actually
greater than n2.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.080
On the other hand,
the transmitted wave,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.530
if you look at the functional
form of the transmitted wave,

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:57.400
and transmission
coefficient, T is actually

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.050
equal to 2n1 divided
by n1 plus n2.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.900
It's always positive.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:11.370
Therefore, will there be any
possibility to flip the sign?

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:12.400
No.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.110
You are absolutely right.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:16.750
So therefore, what
is going to happen

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:20.020
is that I will use this
little arrow to keep

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.260
track of the sign change.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.340
Basically, you'll see that after
it pass through the boundary,

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:32.290
there will be no change in
sign in amplitude no matter

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:33.910
what happens.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:41.230
On the other hand, if I have the
situation n1 smaller than n2,

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.140
what is going to happen?

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:51.520
If you calculate the R value,
it will be negative, right?

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.890
In this case, R will
be smaller than 0.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:43:03.380
So what is going to happen is
that, initially, the incident

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.130
wave has positive amplitude.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.710
And I keep track of the
sign of this amplitude

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:13.120
by this arrow pointing up.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.080
Because the R is
actually smaller than 0,

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:23.080
therefore, there is flip
in sign in the amplitude.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.770
So what is going to happen?

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:26.620
So the reflective wave
will look like this.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:32.470
And I use this arrow to keep
track of the flip in amplitude.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.540
And finally, as I
mentioned before,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.890
the transmitted wave, the
T, is always positive.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:46.780
Therefore, there will be no
change in sign in amplitude.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.390
Finally, the third
example is, if I

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.690
have somehow two
different materials,

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:55.220
but they have the same
refractive index, what

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.540
is going to happen is that
there will be no reflection,

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.240
and everything goes through.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.560
Even if you have two different
kinds of material, but if they

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:09.430
have the same refractive index,
then what is going to happen

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.240
is that everything
will pass through.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.450
And what you are going
to get is that you

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.230
will have no reflected light.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:20.610
Meaning R is
actually equal to 0.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.850
Any questions so far?

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.840
I would like to make
sure that everybody

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.440
understands the consequence
of this calculation.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.590
So if I introduce no
flip in amplitude,

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:42.350
this means that this
contribution will

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:46.310
introduce a filter equal to 0.

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:51.140
So basically, there will
be no change in the phase,

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.830
because there's no
flip in amplitude.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:45:02.120
On the other hand, if there's
a changing sign in amplitude,

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.050
what would be the
resulting filter value?

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:06.870
Can somebody actually tell me?

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.810
AUDIENCE: Pi.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.240
YEN-JIE LEE: It would be pi.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.030
Very good.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.600
So that means you
are getting hit

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.660
by a phase difference of pi.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.650
Therefore, the amplitude
changes by a factor

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:25.300
of cosine pi, which is minus 1.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.450
So that is actually
something pretty important

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:38.990
when we have the discussion
of the soap bubble reflection.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.450
So let me give you
a quick example

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:48.160
about why is actually the amount
of the reflected light and also

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.670
what is the amount
of transmitted light.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.980
Let me give you a
concrete example.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:46:01.660
For example, if I have n1
equal to 1, which is actually

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:12.070
the refractive index of the
air, and n2 equal to 1.5

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:19.210
If that happens what is
the resulting intensity?

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:25.360
Just a quick reminder, average
I, the average intensity

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:33.680
will be equal to c times
n times epsilon 0 A

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.470
squared divided by 2,
where A is the amplitude

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:42.190
of the electric field.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.420
Just a quick reminder.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:48.370
And this 1/2 is coming from the
time average, just a reminder.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:53.470
So now I can go ahead and use
these two formula, R and T,

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:57.790
to calculate the
reflection coefficient

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.650
and this transmission
coefficient.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:07.510
So R will equal to 1 minus
1.5 divided by 1 plus 1.5.

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:15.100
So basically, you get
minus 0.5 divided by 2.5.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:23.560
And that is actually going
to give you minus 0.2.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.410
Of course, I can
also calculate what

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:33.220
will be the T, which
would be a 2 divided 2.5.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:39.970
So basically what you
are getting is 0.8.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:47.020
So I can now calculate what
will be the resulting intensity

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.190
of the reflected light.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.150
Everybody's following?

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:58.340
So what would be the intensity
of the reflected light?

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:06.090
This will be equal to
minus 0.2 squared, right?

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:12.330
Because the average intensity
is proportional to A squared.

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:16.410
A is actually the amplitude
of the electric field.

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:19.020
R should tell you
what is actually

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.390
the relative amplitude
between the reflected light

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.660
and the incident light.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:31.480
Therefore, you are getting
hit by 0.2 squared multiplied

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:37.130
by the initial intensity.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.190
Basically what you
are going to get

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:47.210
is 0.04 I, initial intensity.

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:55.040
So basically 4% of the
light is reflected.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.260
That may surprise
you a bit, right?

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.610
Because when you see, for
example, the soap bubble,

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.040
you see that it is still
pretty bright, right?

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.615
But in reality, only 4% of the
light or 4% of the intensity

00:49:08.615 --> 00:49:10.610
got reflected.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:15.090
That is because your eyes is
actually having nonlinear.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.315
Your eye responds to the--

00:49:17.315 --> 00:49:22.130
or, say, receiving or
interpreting the intensity

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.380
is really highly nonlinear.

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:28.210
So basically, you
get 4% reflected.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.500
And the rest actually
goes through.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:37.450
And just to convince you that
the total intensity is 100%,

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:42.320
we can calculate what
would be the intensity

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.890
of the transmitted light.

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:47.050
This will be equal to 1.5--

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:54.470
this is actually related to
n2, because the intensity

00:49:54.470 --> 00:50:00.470
is proportional to c n
epsilon 0 A squared over 2--

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.110
times T squared.

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:09.530
So basically you
have a 0.8 squared

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:13.680
and the I initial intensity.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.860
And if I calculate this
value, basically you

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:21.450
are going to get 96% of
the initial intensity.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:25.490
So 96% of the initial
intensity actually passes

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:30.470
through the boundary and
continues and propagates

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:34.150
in the second medium, which,
actually, in this case,

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:35.214
is the soap.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.530
So the picture is the following.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:53.970
When 100% of light
intensity going

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:58.280
towards the boundary,
what is going to happen

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:06.220
is that 4% of the
light got reflected.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.030
4% of intensity got reflected.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:14.140
And also, because n1
is smaller than n2,

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:21.750
therefore, there is a flip
in sign in the amplitude.

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:27.680
And the rest
continues, 96% of them.

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:34.400
And there is no flipping
sign in the amplitude.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.180
Any questions so far?

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.515
We're really pretty close.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.480
So now we are in a position to
discuss what is actually really

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:50.290
happening to this soap bubble.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:55.070
So I'm going to keep
this result here.

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:04.330
And I will now discuss
a situation in which

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:09.002
you have two interfaces.

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:19.150
So suppose I zoom in, zoom,
and zoom in this soap bubble

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.100
and put it on the board.

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:29.990
So this is actually
the soap film.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:35.090
And I have now an incident
wave, which is actually

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:40.310
going into this bubble.

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:43.700
So now I have 100%,
which is actually

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:48.110
going toward this film.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:54.170
So after this light,
this plane wave

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:58.370
hits the film, what
is going to happen?

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:01.750
The first thing which
happens is that there will be

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:06.306
4% of the light got reflected.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.050
n2 is equal to 1.5.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.704
It's the same setup,
just a reminder,

00:53:12.704 --> 00:53:17.060
just to make sure everybody
is on the same page.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:20.350
So 4% of the light
got reflected.

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:23.225
Of course, the sign changed.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:33.880
96% of the intensity
actually continue.

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.570
And what is actually
happening is

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:45.010
that there will be no
change in amplitude in sign.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:47.830
And this is actually not
the end of the story, right?

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:51.850
Because the light will continue
and continue to propagate.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:53.680
What is going to
happen is that it

00:53:53.680 --> 00:54:02.120
will reach another boundary,
where the incident light is

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:06.630
you're traveling, from n2
refractive index material,

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:09.520
to n1, which is
actually the air.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:13.600
Now I have a situation
where the light is actually

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.080
going through the boundary
and going out of the air.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.690
That means the light is
actually going into the bubble.

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:25.280
So this is actually
inside the bubble.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.910
So what is going to
happen is the following.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:40.130
Basically, the calculation
is the same, except that now

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:46.340
the R is actually 0.2
instead of minus 0.2, right?

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:51.110
Because now n2 minus
n2 is actually 0.5.

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:55.280
0.5 divided by 2.5
is positive 0.2.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.200
So basically, what
you are going to get

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:03.486
is a reflected light, which
actually doesn't change.

00:55:03.486 --> 00:55:08.240
It doesn't change the
sign of the amplitude.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.270
And what is actually
the intensity?

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:18.280
The intensity will be 96%
times 4%, because only 4%

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.650
of the light got reflected.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.680
And of course, a large
fraction of the light

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.580
actually pass through the
bubble, 96% times 96%.

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:32.350
And this would be,
again, pointing upward,

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:36.460
because T is always positive.

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:39.437
Any questions so far.

00:55:39.437 --> 00:55:41.520
You can see that this
actually really interesting,

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.670
because most of
the light actually

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:47.990
pass through the bubble.

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:49.490
So that's actually
already one thing

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:52.010
we've learned from
this exercise.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:55.860
Now, what is going to happen
to this light if I continue

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.220
and increase the time?

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.640
What is going to happen
is that this reflected

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:06.650
light, from the second
surface or second boundary,

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:10.580
will go backward and pass
through the first boundary

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.070
again.

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:14.930
What is going to happen
is the following.

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:20.150
So basically, we're going to
get, again, transmitted light

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:21.393
and the reflected light.

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:29.360
What will be the sign
of the reflected light?

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.769
Will the arrow be
pointing up or down?

00:56:31.769 --> 00:56:32.310
AUDIENCE: Up.

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:34.055
YEN-JIE LEE: Up,
yeah, very good.

00:56:34.055 --> 00:56:36.470
Right now, if you
are bored, then that

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.560
means I am very successful.

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:44.840
So that means I'm getting
4% times 96% times 4%.

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:51.080
What would be the sign
for the transmitted light?

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.019
Pointing up or down?

00:56:52.019 --> 00:56:52.560
AUDIENCE: Up.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.226
YEN-JIE LEE: Up.

00:56:53.226 --> 00:56:56.060
Very good, so everybody gets it.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:06.151
And 96% pass through, 96%
times 96% times 4% will pass.

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:11.820
And of course, I can now
continue and continue.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:15.580
What is going to happen is
that now you have learned 8.03.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:20.350
You will see that this
is a crazy phenomenon.

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:22.050
What is going to
happen is that there

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:28.710
will be a tiny fraction of the
light which is trapped forever

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:30.620
between the two surfaces.

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:33.630
They are going to be
bouncing back and forth,

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:36.870
boo, boo, boo, boo, boo,
boo, boo, boo, forever.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:40.290
Of course, the fraction
of the intensity

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:44.010
is really, really small.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:47.130
Because every time you've
got the reflection actually

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.660
happening, you take a hit of 4%.

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:55.800
But since we are talking
about theoretical physics,

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.650
so, theoretically, that
would continue forever.

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:01.900
That's actually
pretty interesting.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:06.030
And going back to
practical situation,

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:11.490
basically, I can safely
ignore any further reflection,

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.410
because they are
hitting so hard,

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.830
because every time I
get a 4% hit, right?

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:20.200
Therefore, I can ignore
all the other contribution.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:25.710
And what we are
actually seeing is what?

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:29.200
Our eye is here.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:34.050
We see the contribution
of the first pass,

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:38.430
which is actually reflected
from the first surface.

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.560
The second pass, OK, it pass
through the first surface,

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:46.200
got reflected from
the second boundary,

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:54.090
and pass through the first
boundary, in the second round,

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:58.500
and then, also,
reaching your eye.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.960
So what are we looking at ?

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.590
We are looking at
the superposition

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:10.776
of two electromagnetic
waves coming from one,

00:59:10.776 --> 00:59:15.935
which is like this, and two,
which is actually like this.

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:31.200
The question now is what is
the thickness of the film?

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.580
Now I can define the
thickness or, say,

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:39.060
the width of this film to be d.

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.720
Now the question we
are actually asking

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.970
is, what would be
the thickness, d,

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:53.820
which is needed such that I can
have constructive interference?

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:58.010
Now the question
becomes really clear.

00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:01.770
And we can actually
calculate that

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:06.840
by evaluating the phase
difference between the path

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.780
number one and the
path number two.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:15.030
So now, in order to have
constructive interference,

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:18.420
I need a specific
phase difference.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:22.310
But before that, I need to
calculate the phase difference

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:32.100
first between path number
one and path number two.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:35.430
What will be the
phase difference?

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:42.190
The phase difference delta will
be equal to, of course, pi.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:49.560
This pi contribution is coming
from the flip of the amplitude.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:53.810
That will actually give
you an pi phase difference.

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:58.140
The second phase difference
is coming from the difference

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:01.900
in the optical path length.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:07.140
You can see that the first path,
it doesn't go into the film.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.270
It got reflected, directly.

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:15.300
And the second path,
which is path number two,

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:20.120
it takes more
effort or more time

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.740
for the light to go
back and reach your eye.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.320
How big is the path
length difference?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:33.030
The size of the path length
difference is 2 times d, right?

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.500
Of course, I need to
actually translate that back

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.330
to the phase.

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:49.020
So first, I need to actually
calculate how many period.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:54.080
So the length divided by
lambda will be the period.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.510
So lambda is actually
the wavelength

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:03.780
of the incident light.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.100
But I am missing a factor here.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.410
And can somebody help me?

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:10.110
Because this lambda is actually
inside the material, right?

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:11.948
So which factor, I'm missing?

01:02:11.948 --> 01:02:13.232
AUDIENCE: n2.

01:02:13.232 --> 01:02:14.230
YEN-JIE LEE: n2, right?

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.580
Yeah, thank you very much.

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:19.060
So basically,
inside the material,

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:23.440
since the speed of light
is 1.5 times smaller

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.870
than the speed of
light in vacuum,

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:34.840
therefore, the wavelength is
actually lambda divided by n2.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.030
And this is actually
the number of period.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:40.780
And now, I need to translate
that to phase difference.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.620
Therefore, I
multiply this by 2pi.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:49.080
So you can see that now I
have successfully evaluated

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.510
or quantified the phase
difference between path number

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.370
one and two.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.830
That is there are
two contributions.

01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:59.170
The first one is pi.

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:04.750
It's related to the
flip in amplitude.

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:08.280
The second contribution,
the blue one,

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.720
is actually coming from the
optical path length difference.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:19.600
And of course, we can evaluate
that really precisely.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.240
Therefore, we can
now quickly conclude

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:36.170
that, in order to have
constructive interference,

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:43.190
I need to have filter equal to
2N pi, where N is an integer.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.410
And in order to have
destructive interference,

01:03:51.410 --> 01:04:02.870
I need to have
filter equal to 2N

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:07.420
plus 1, pi, which is
actually the result

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:12.070
of the calculation which we
have done, I think, before.

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:12.880
Yeah, there.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.250
So this is actually
based on the calculation

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:18.730
we have done in the beginning.

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:22.120
So we are really close.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:28.660
So now we have this result,
delta is equal to pi plus 2d,

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.670
times 2 pi divided by
lambda divided by n2, right,

01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:35.680
so this complicated formula?

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.010
Now we are in the
position to evaluate what

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:43.030
would be the phase difference.

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.310
So the first thing which
I would like to discuss

01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:51.140
is that, when d goes to 0, what
does is actually the limit?

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:57.780
The limit is when
the width of the film

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.030
is really, really
small, it goes to 0.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.770
What is going to happen?

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:10.621
You are going to have
destructive interference.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.530
Why is that?

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:19.450
That is because, even when
you have d equal to 0,

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:27.120
the filter is pi because of
the flip in sign in path number

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.640
one.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.490
The second thing
is that now I can

01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:35.316
calculate what would be the
constructive interference

01:05:35.316 --> 01:05:35.816
width.

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:50.805
So this will happen when d is
equal to 2N minus 1 lambda,

01:05:50.805 --> 01:05:53.620
divided by 4 n2.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:06:01.430
So basically, you can use that
formula there and solve d.

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:04.390
Then basically that's the
formula we are going to get.

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:07.750
And I will not go
into detail with this.

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.310
Any questions so far?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:25.750
So now, the third
conclusion is that, if I

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:35.890
fix d and the change in
lambda, that is actually

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:39.100
the more practical situation.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.900
Because I have the soap bubble.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:44.120
And it have a well-defined
width, which is d.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.180
And what is happening
is that I am trying

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.285
to shine this soap
bubble with light

01:06:50.285 --> 01:06:53.140
with different
wavelengths, right?

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.900
So that is actually
the third situation.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:02.050
If I fix the width of the film,
and the change the wavelength,

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:04.640
lambda, what I am
going to get is

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:11.170
that the lambda max, which
is the wavelength needed

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:29.720
to have constructive
interference,

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:37.710
will be equal to 4d n2
divided by 2N minus 1.

01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:42.170
So basically, I can solve the
lambda if I am given a d value.

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:47.550
So actually, we
already get the answer

01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:50.520
we are asking in the beginning.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.990
The first question is,
why do we see color?

01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:57.650
The second question
is, when I see color,

01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:01.080
what is actually the
width of the soap film?

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.945
We are going to know
the result in a moment.

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.170
So now, I have this
formula in hand.

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:24.979
If I have d roughly equal
to 100 nanometer, which

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:37.790
is the third option
we were discussing,

01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:45.892
that is going to give you lambda
maxima equal to 4 times 100

01:08:45.892 --> 01:08:49.910
nanometer times 1.5--

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:56.180
n2 is 1.5-- divided
by 2N minus 1.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:00.450
So that is actually
600 nanometer

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:03.000
divided by 2N minus 1.

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:10.489
Suppose I have N equal
to 1, basically I

01:09:10.489 --> 01:09:15.319
am getting 600 nanometer.

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:22.220
Suppose I have N equal to 2, 2N
minus 1 is actually 4 minus 1

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.029
is 3.

01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:29.330
Therefore, you get 200
nanometer and 120 nanometer,

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:32.050
et cetera, et cetera,
which are the required

01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:38.870
wavelengths in order to have
constructive interference

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:42.930
between path number one
and path number two.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:46.010
Everybody is following?

01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:50.450
If I plot the spectra
of this lambda max,

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:56.720
assuming d is 100 nanometer,
what I am getting is like this.

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:06.380
So this is a situation
of very thin film.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.320
So this is the lambda.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.865
What I am getting is that there
will be a maxima here, which

01:10:13.865 --> 01:10:17.700
is actually 600 nanometer.

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:27.350
Red color is actually
roughly 650 nanometer.

01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:31.130
This is red light.

01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:35.680
And this is actually
roughly the range

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.780
of the visible light, which
is actually between lambda

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:44.290
equal to lambda violet--

01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:48.270
violet is equal
to 400 nanometer.

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:52.640
So you can see that the
first maxima, lambda maxima,

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.580
where you have
constructive interference

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.640
is at 600 nanometer.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.400
So that means you are going
to see what kind of color

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.623
in your soap bubble?

01:11:03.623 --> 01:11:04.490
AUDIENCE: Red.

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.400
YEN-JIE LEE: You are
going to see red, right?

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.760
And then the next
wavelength which

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.190
you can have constructive
interference is 200 nanometer.

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:22.130
That is actually shorter than
the wavelength of the violet

01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:23.390
light.

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:26.690
It's out of the range
of the visible light.

01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:27.820
What is going to happen?

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.050
Your eye will not see it.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:36.680
So the next one would be here,
whatever, blah, blah, blah,

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.980
blah, which I don't
care, because they

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.070
are so short in wavelength.

01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:43.280
And you cannot see them.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.770
So you can see that,
if I have a width which

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:54.560
is roughly 100 nanometer,
very same situation, what

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.580
is going to happen?

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:58.430
What is going to
happen is that you

01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:04.540
are going to get only one maxima
in the visible light range.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.205
And therefore,
you can see color.

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:10.580
Any questions so far?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:20.090
Now, what I'm going to do is
take the same formula here,

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:28.580
but now I would like
to change this d.

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.530
So now I would like
to change the d

01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:36.930
to consider a situation where
you have a very thick layer.

01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:40.280
So now I would like to change
the situation to a very thick

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:46.165
layer, so maybe I need to
erase this part of the board

01:12:46.165 --> 01:12:49.320
to make some space.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:58.130
So now if I have d equal
to 100 micron, what

01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:59.930
is going to happen?

01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:03.590
So I can now still
use this formula

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:07.320
to calculate what would
be the lambda maxima.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:15.020
So lambda maxima will be
equal to 600 micron, which

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.190
is when you have N equal to 1.

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:22.400
But this wavelength is way,
way larger, much, much larger

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.840
than the wavelength
of the visible light.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.510
So it's not going to work.

01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:32.940
Therefore, you
have to be patient.

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:41.780
You have to increase the N
value until N is equal to 500.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:46.520
So I am calculation 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, until 500.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.360
Ahh, we are in the visible
light range, right?

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.147
Now, 5000 will give
you 600.6 nanometer.

01:13:57.147 --> 01:13:58.430
Phew.

01:13:58.430 --> 01:14:02.210
Suddenly, your eye can see it.

01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:03.070
Very good.

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.520
That's very nice, right?

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.610
So I can now put
it in my diagram.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.130
This is actually the
wavelength, again.

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:14.480
And, ah, I get one line here.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.980
How about the next
one, N equal to 501?

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:23.770
I'm going to get
599.4 nanometer.

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:26.210
It's pretty close to this one.

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:37.010
And the next one would be 598.2
nanometer if N is equal to 502.

01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:38.540
And what you are
getting is that you

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:42.380
can see that, no, things
are not going very well.

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:49.962
They are full spectra,
all very, very narrow.

01:14:49.962 --> 01:14:53.600
Very, very large
number of wavelengths

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.150
can give you constructive
interference.

01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:00.600
So what is going to happen?

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:06.540
What is going to happen is that
your eye will see reflection

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:10.210
with all kinds of
different wavelengths.

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.884
And what color is that?

01:15:11.884 --> 01:15:12.800
AUDIENCE: White light.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.430
YEN-JIE LEE: White!

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:15.346
You are going to see
something which is white.

01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:22.620
So that is actually the
answer to our question.

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:26.690
So what would be the
required thickness?

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:32.410
The required thickness is
something like 100 nanometer.

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:37.190
So we can see how thin
is the water bubble.

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:39.080
That may surprise
some of you, right?

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.230
Most of you actually
didn't think

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:44.120
that's actually that thin.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.510
Secondly, if d
equal to 0, you are

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:49.710
going to have
destructive interference.

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:52.150
That means there will
be no reflected light.

01:15:52.150 --> 01:15:54.400
Everything is going
to pass through.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:58.610
And the bubble is
like transparent.

01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:03.710
Finally, when the
bubble is really thick,

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:06.920
you are going to see white.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:13.670
So let me finish this lecture
with a demonstration here.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.462
First, before I
turn off the light,

01:16:15.462 --> 01:16:16.670
I would like to turn this on.

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:28.340
So what I have here is a
very complicated machine.

01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.220
It's not that
complicated, actually.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.920
So basically, I have
a light source here,

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:41.540
which emits light with all
kinds of different wavelengths.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.810
And I have this
little device here.

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:46.340
There's soap solution inside.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.830
And I can actually
rotate from outside.

01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:52.790
You see how sweet is this setup.

01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:57.560
And I can actually create
a soap film out of this.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.670
You can see that I am rotating
and trying to actually project

01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:06.190
the result on the wall.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:14.480
You can see that, initially,
there's nothing really

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.160
striking in the beginning.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.584
You can see that the
light is which color?

01:17:21.584 --> 01:17:22.390
AUDIENCE: White.

01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:24.750
YEN-JIE LEE: It's white, right?

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:29.610
Remember, because of
the optical setup,

01:17:29.610 --> 01:17:33.440
this image is
actually upside down.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:39.190
So the upper edge of
that image is actually

01:17:39.190 --> 01:17:43.990
the lower edge of
my setup, which is

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:46.295
the lower edge of my soap film.

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:55.390
We have gravity, right,
so that I can walk around.

01:17:55.390 --> 01:18:02.514
Due to gravity,
you can see that it

01:18:02.514 --> 01:18:06.160
will form a thicker
and thicker layer

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.700
in the bottom of my
experimental setup

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.720
or in the upper
edge of the image.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.490
On the other hand,
due to gravity,

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:21.700
the upper edge or the
lower edge of the image

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:26.060
will become thinner and
thinner as a function of time.

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:31.840
At some point, the color
will start to show up.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:39.270
As you can see now, since
we wait long enough,

01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:41.950
the soap film becomes
thinner and thinner.

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:46.011
And you can see that there
are colors popping up.

01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:47.910
It's like a rainbow.

01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:48.610
Why is that?

01:18:48.610 --> 01:18:54.020
Because I am varying the
thickness of the film

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:58.180
as a function of the
vertical distance.

01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:01.160
So therefore, you can see that
this is actually showing you

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:07.760
that different d value will
give you very different colors.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.900
And if we wait long
enough, basically what

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:15.730
we are going to get is
that the whole film will

01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:18.850
become more and more colorful.

01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:21.520
And I am sure that
after this class,

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.140
you can walk out
of the classroom

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:29.320
and explain to your friend why
the soap bubble is colorful.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.530
Thank you very much.

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:34.480
And if you have any
questions, I will be around.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.750
And of course, if you want
to make your own soap bubble,

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:40.610
you can actually go ahead
and play the demo here.

01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:49.870
So hello, everybody.

01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:54.250
So we are going to show
you a demonstration, which

01:19:54.250 --> 01:20:00.060
we can see colorful interference
pattern from a soap film.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:04.270
So basically, the experimental
setup up is like this.

01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:06.040
Basically, we have
light, which is

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:11.710
trying to shine this
thin layer of soap film.

01:20:11.710 --> 01:20:17.030
And the result is actually
projected on the screen.

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:20.170
And you can see, at
first, you don't really

01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:26.640
see a lot of colorful
pattern, because the thickness

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:33.430
of the film is still
rather large, rather thick.

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:36.060
Therefore, you don't really
see a lot of pattern.

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.560
But as a function
of time, you can

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.960
see that this pattern
is actually changing.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:46.220
Because of
gravitational force, you

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:51.940
will be able to see that
the lower part of the film

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:53.740
becomes thicker and thicker.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:58.540
And the upper part of the film,
which you see that upside down

01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:03.490
on the screen, is actually
becoming thinner and thinner.

01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:08.530
As we actually discussed during
the class, when soap film is

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:16.375
thin enough, there will be
only one or only a few maximas

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:23.500
in the interference pattern
as a function of wavelengths,

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:28.600
which happened to be inside
the visible light range.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:32.910
And you can see it now,
already, this colorful pattern

01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:33.820
really develops.

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:35.470
It's really beautiful.

01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:42.620
And you can see that, in the
lower part of the experiment,

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:45.280
really have authentic
color, because there

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:51.260
are multiple maximas in
the visible light range.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.400
On the other hand, in the
upper part of the film,

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.800
you typically have very
little number of maximas

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:04.430
or only have one maxima,
in the visible light range,

01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:06.110
as a function of wavelength.

01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:08.570
Therefore, you see
really, really dramatic

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:14.310
and very, very colorful pattern
develop from this experiment.

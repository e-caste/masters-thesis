00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So in the last lecture I spent quite
a while trying to convey a sense of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
how the structure of DNA was
discovered.  The crystallographic

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
data that led to it,
as I said, was collected by Roslyn

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Franklin.  And I saw there was some
confusion about this picture that I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
showed you next.
This is not a photograph of a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
double helix.
This is what happened when she

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
bounced the x-ray off the crystal of
DNA.  This is the diffraction

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
pattern that she saw.
And then one works backwards from

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that trying to figure out what kind
of structure it was that would have

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
caused that diffraction pattern.
And you have to be a pretty good

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
x-ray crystallographer to draw any
kind of inferences from that.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And there people, including Francis
Crick, who saw the implications

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of it right away.
But the point was she collected the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
data and then two people that I told
you about then whose name you know

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so well, Jim Watson and Francis
Crick, were the two individuals that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
came up with the model that
explained the diffraction pattern.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And therefore we learned the
structure of DNA as a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
double-stranded helix.
I also tried to make the case that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
it wasn't two geniuses who sat down
in the room, took a look at this and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
popped up with the model.
It was a story of real people with

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
misadventures and mistakes and
recovery from mistakes and so on

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
getting it.  It was also a very
small group.  And I'm going to take

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
just a very small minute at the
beginning of the class because I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
have a colleague,
Vernon Ingram who's sitting down

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
here in the front,
who was a member of this very small

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
group with Jim Watson and Francis
Crick.  So here was there where all

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
this happened.
And almost nobody in the world has

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
had a chance in your generation to
hear directly from somebody who was

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
there when it happened.
So asked Vernon if he would come

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and just talk to you for a little
bit just what it was

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:54.000
like to be there.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Well, thanks, Graham.
You seem to be at a very exciting

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
state in 7.014.
This structure of the secret of life,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
no less.  And it's interesting that
immediately when Watson and Crick

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000
put together a model of the DNA
molecule that fit the x-ray data,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that was the point, how do you know
a model is correct?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Because there are certain distances
in the model, and those have to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
correlate exactly with the distances
of the x-ray spots in the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
diffraction pattern that you saw.
That's how you know that a model

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that you've built to certain
specifications corresponds to what

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the molecule of itself in the
crystal that you're examining

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
actually is composed of.
It was by sheer accident that I

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
happened to be working as a
biochemist in the MRC,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The Medical Research Council lab at
the Cavendish Laboratory where

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Watson and Crick were working.
Sheer accident.  It was a very

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
crowded lab, as Graham said.
And that's something that you should

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
remember.  When you're choosing a
lab to work in,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
always go to a lab that's
overcrowded.  Never go to a lab

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
where there's lots of space because
a really successful lab attracts so

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
many coworkers,
visitors that it rapidly gets

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
overcrowded.
And that was the case in this

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
laboratory.  The director was Max
Perutz.  Co-director John Kendrew

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
doing x-ray crystallography of
proteins for almost the first time,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and solving the protein structure.
Francis Crick was a graduate student

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
of Max Perutz's doing his PhD work.
And the first thing I remember about

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Francis was when I went there as a
biochemist to work with Max Perutz,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
when I went there, there was this
tall gangling guy constantly

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
circulating between the top floor of
the building, his office in the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
middle and the x-ray machines at the
bottom.  He was constantly going up

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and down.  And in those days the
buildings didn't have an elevators

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
or lifts as the English
called them.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So he was in excellent physical
shape.  Very crowded,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
a very modest lab.  And what's
usually forgotten is a key member of

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that group, an engineer,
Tony Broad, key person because he

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
invented what was then the world's
best and most efficient x-ray

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
machine, a rotating anode
x-ray machine.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And because to the x-ray
crystallographers in that group this

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
machine was available,
because of that they were the

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
preeminent x-ray structure group in
the world.  My job was as a

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
biochemist protein biochemistry
putting a heavy atom,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
mercury, very heavy atom into Max
Parutz's hemoglobin crystals

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
in specific places.
That has a predictable effect on the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
x-ray pattern and that enables the
Fourier diagram to be constructed

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
with real phase values for the x-ray
diffractions, for the physicists

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
among you here.
Are there any physicists here?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Yeah, I thought so.  That was a big
step forward and that was also a big

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
step in figuring out the structure
of the DNA samples semi-crystals

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that Professor Walker
just referred to.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
All dependent on the engineer Tony
Broad who is never mentioned in any

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of these histories,
but without him this would not have

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
happened.  So it was an exciting
place to work in,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
very exciting.  We were all young in
those days.  And living the lives of

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
young men and young women with all
the complications that arise when

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
you put a whole bunch of very
energetic young men,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
very energetic young women together.
And by that I mean the interpersonal

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
relationships which when you're in a
crowded, very active situation can

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
sometimes interfere.
And always very entertaining,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I can tell you that.  I could give
you chapter and verse.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
But it isn't really so very
different from people

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
your age now, right?
I mean I'm not saying it interferes

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
with you, sometimes it might.
But it was an exciting lab, an

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
exciting time to be there because we
were not the only group trying to

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
figure out the structure of DNA.
A huge competitor was Linus Pauling

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
at Caltech who had beaten that same
group once before,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
quite recently, over the alpha helix,
the crucial component of

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
protein structure.
He got the right answer first,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
1.5 angstrom reflection, the alpha
helix.  And our group,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Max Parutz and our group had been
wrong.  So the group was smarting

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
under that kind of defeat,
if you like.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And competition is a wonderful spur,
as long as you don't let it get out

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000
of hand.  Well,
needless to say we didn't,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
but the competition with the Pauling
lab was certainly so severe that we

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
awaited the next letter.
You see, in those days new

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
scientific information arrived not
by publications,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that too much too long,
but by personal letter.  And,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
in fact, the NIH has put together
all these various letters in the

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Francis Crick collection.
And when you have time you should

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
look at those.
They're quite interesting because

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
they tell you in a way a scientific
paper does not tell you.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
What I feel about my experiment
results.  What she feels about her

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
experiment results.
What it means to me as a person,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
to her as a person, to him as a
person.  So we were constantly

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
watching the mail and discussing the
news as it came in,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
mostly over a beer at the pub next
door.  It was very conveniently

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
located.
But being a small group crowded

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
together made communication within
our group very easy indeed.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And we had fights.  I don't mean
physical fights.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We had scientific fights.
And as a biochemist I was able to

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
settle a crucial fight among the
crystallographers Crick and Watson

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
who were building the model.
Because, quite frankly,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
they didn't know much chemistry.
And were trying to build a model

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
with the wrong confirmation of the
peptide bond.  They didn't realize

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that the peptide bond has two
possible confirmations.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And they had at one point a
terrible time trying to fit

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
everything together because they
were using the wrong confirmation.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I'm talking about lactam-lactim for
those of you who are organic

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
chemists and it means something,
a confirmation.  And once they got

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
the first confirmation then the
model clicked into place.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So we all helped, that's what I'm
trying to say.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
We all helped with one great aim in
mind.  It was clear.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And you know from what Professor
Walker said, that the DNA structure,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
in its structure held the clue to
crucial physiological

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
behavior of DNA.
And Crick and Watson said this in

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
their first paper,
the structure itself because of its

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
complimentarity gives you an
immediate clue as to how it

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
replicates.  And replication of DNA
structure from generation to

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
generation is,
of course, the crucial thing about

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
DNA.
The copying, the precise copying

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
from generation to generation.
And that fell out the of x-ray

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
structure.  That's why the x-ray
structure was so very important,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
because it gave you an immediate
understanding of the role of DNA in

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
modern biology.  So that's
what we did.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And eventually the people in the
group, the group got so overcrowded

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
they built a huge lab that was
beautiful, like any new lab is.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But the thing I remember most of
all was the atmosphere in that place.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So remember, when you go and choose
a lab, choose one that's overcrowded.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:45.000
It will pay off.  [APPLAUSE]

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Thank you so much.
That was really wonderful.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Thank you.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I don't know if some of you realized
quite how rare that was,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
this discovery of the structure of
DNA.  As I said,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
probably one of the big discoveries
of mankind.  Because,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
as Vernon said, you could see so
many of the secrets of life as soon

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
as you saw that structure.
Very few people have ever heard

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
from someone who was there at the
time.  Maybe you'll forget a bunch

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
of stuff down the line,
but I hope you'll remember you heard

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
somebody who was there when Wesson
and Crick were there and maybe his

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
extra piece of advice about
choosing a lab.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
To say one thing quickly,
some of you I think understood what

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I've been trying to do.
I spent quite a bit of time talking

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
about science being done by real
people doing real experiments.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Thanks for your comments.  A few of
you have gone out of your way to say

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
that this was a total waste of time
and you didn't understand why I

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
didn't teach you something instead
of doing something on the test.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Well, I'm making up the test.  And
if you don't think there'll be

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
something on scientific process on
the second exam you'll

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
be surprised.
So I'm spending a lot of time on

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
this, and the reason is because you
are MIT student.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
You know, you can go many places in
the country to many high school

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
biology courses and you can memorize,
someone will tell you to memorize

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
everything that's in the book,
and you'll get tested whether you

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
can memorize it.
You guys are at MIT because you

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
have the potential to be leaders in
whatever you do.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
I've made the transition from being
an undergrad sort of trying to

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
memorize stuff in a textbook to
working on a cutting-edge.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I've made some reasonably
significant discoveries in science,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
as have my other colleagues in the
department, some of them making

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
greater than I.
But nevertheless if you're on the

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
cutting-edge then you're dealing
with all the stuff I'm trying to

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
tell you about in this thing.
You're working as a part of a group.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
There's competition.
There are interpersonal

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
relationships.
You make mistakes.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
You recover from them.
You're making inferences.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
You're testing models.  This is a
very complex, very real,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
very dynamic, very human interaction.
I hope you got a little bit of

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
whiff of that from Vernon.
And I wouldn't be,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I'm quite capable of reproducing
diagrams from the textbook without

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
trying to give you a deeper
understanding,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
and that's what I'm trying to do
here.  And I hope if it hasn't made

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
sense to you by the end that at
least a few more of you will get it.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And those of you who I think saw
what I was doing I appreciate your

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
telling me that in the things.
These are anonymous so I don't know,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
but a couple of you are certainly
trying to make it clear that you

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
didn't think it was worth your time
coming to lecture.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I'm trying to tell you why I'm
trying to do it.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I'm trying to teach you in a deeper
way.  And this is a required course.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
It's important for your life.  I
hope some of you will see that or if

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
you don't see it now you'll see it
later in your career.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
OK.  Now, we're going to talk about
DNA replication.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
I'm going to start to drive into
some of the details that maybe are

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
more the kind of things you're
expecting.  I just want to make one

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
quick point here.
I've talked about cell division and

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
we saw this, how cells come from
other cells going to make more cells.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I showed you this little movie
you've seen a few times of a yeast

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
cell dividing,
but all cells divide.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Here's a cancer cell dividing.
If you get a cancer it's a cell

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
that's forgotten how to stop
dividing and is growing to make a

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
tumor.  There's this cancer cell
dividing.  It looks not unlike a

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
yeast on a molecular level,
very, very similar.  But there's

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
another point.
I told you how the structure of DNA

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
with the complimentary strands with
G pairing with C and A pairing with

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
T immediately gave rise to an
insight as to how the genetic

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
material could be replicated.
And you guys know that it's held

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
together by hydrogen bonds between
base pairs which are about

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
one-twentieth the strength of the
covalent bonds.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So you're able to peel the strands
apart without breaking the covalent

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
bonds.  And then by pairing A with T
and G with C and doing that on both

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
strands then you can end up with two
identical copies.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And so if you do two identical
copies and you do it again you get

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
eight.  One of the things we've
realized over the last two or three

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
years in looking through the exams
is somehow, at least some of the

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
class, didn't connect the business
about cells coming from other cells

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and DNA duplicating to give daughter
DNA.  And I'm just trying to hammer

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
home the point that these are
related.  Every time a cell divides

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
it has to duplicate its
genetic information.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
That's why I'm going to be telling
you about DNA replication.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Here's a picture of that same
cancer cell, but watch over here.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
This is the DNA.  And you see it's
doubled.  And see how the DNA,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
which is the chromosomes, has pulled
apart so that at the end you now

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
have two cells and you've got
identical copies of DNA.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
So if you're studying cancer,
for example, this sort of thing is

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
relevant to you.  OK.  So
the issue of how --

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Well, before I do that,
I'm sorry.  Just a couple of things

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
about DNA replication before I dive
into this.  So we all started out as

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
a single cell.
I've got a lot more obviously

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
because I'm made up of a lot of
cells.  If I took all the DNA in my

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
body and I wind up all the molecules
in it, do you guys have any idea how

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
long that would be?
Who thinks it would reach let's say

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
across the room?
OK.  Across campus?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Across Cambridge?  Around the world?
To the moon?  Anybody left?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
To the sun?  I've got ten to the
fourteenth cells.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
There's about a meter or two in
each cell.  10 to 20 billion miles

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
of DNA in each of our
bodies, human DNA.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
They would go back and forth to the
sun multiple times.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
So that much DNA had to get
replicated in order for the

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
fertilized egg we all started out as
to become you.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Another thing,
the accuracy of replication is about

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
ten to the minus tenth.
Most people, including myself,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
don't have a very good feel for
exponents.  So that's one

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
mistake in 10 billion.
You know, it could be one mistake in

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
10 to the ninety-ninth.
Well, what is one mistake in 10

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
billion mean?  So let's relate it to
something we know.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
If I was typing let's say an eight
letter word, 60 words a minute,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I
was as good as DNA replication,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
how often would I make a mistake?
So you can each think of how long

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
you think that is.
But if I was good on average,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I would make a mistake once every 38
years.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So I'm about to tell you about a
process that's absolutely

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
astonishing in terms of how fast and
how much you can do and with an

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
accuracy that goes beyond what we're
used to in our ordinary life.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
So how does it do this?  It has to
be more than just pulling the

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
strands apart.
And there's been some confusion as

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
to why I'm emphasizing
5 prime and 3 prime.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Well, each of these subunits,
each nucleotide, this is a 3 prime

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
hydroxyl and this is the 5 prime
position.  If we were joining

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
together subunits that had a hook
and an eye it would make a

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
difference because it's not the same
on both ends.  If we're going to

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
start hooking together it's exactly
the same thing when we get to a

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
biochemical level,
the 5 prime end is not the same as

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
hydroxyl at the 3 prime end because
the whole thing is asymmetric.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.000
So the enzymes that copy DNA are
known as DNA polymerases.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And it was a very difficult
challenge to figure out how they

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.000
operated, but Arthur Kornberg was
the first person to solve

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000
this problem.
He was an extraordinarily gifted

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000
biochemist.  He's still at Stanford.
And what he found was if we have a

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
5 prime end this would then be the 3
prime end, and there's a 3 prime

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000
hydroxyl which is this one right
here.  And this was paired,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
say, with a C and A paired with a T.
And let's say a G paired with a C

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
here.  And let's say the next
template base was,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
let's make it a T.  What Arthur
Kornberg was able to find was an

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
enzyme activity that catalyzed a
template-dependent replication of

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
DNA.  That was critical because he
had to find, if you broke the cells

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
open, somewhere in that gamish of
enzymes and things from

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
inside a cell.
There had to be something that was

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
able to copy DNA.
So in order to do that he had to

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
work out an assay.
And he also had to have some kind

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
of guess as to what the cell would
be using in order to carry out the

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
synthesis.  But one thing that was
sort of obvious was a DNA template

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
because that was being copies.
But the other part was you had to

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
have energy to form
a covalent bond.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
So somehow there had to be something
that was sort of activated with the

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
energy built into the molecule so
that thermodynamically the whole

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
thing would slide downhill when you
made a bond.  And he knew that the

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
cell had triphosphates,
just the same type that we talked

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:36.000
about when we talked about ATP.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
So this would be a
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:51.000
And he was able to make a guess,
because he had to try things until

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:59.000
he found something that would work,
that this was what's used in DNA

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
synthesis.
So this hydroxyl ultimately attacks

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
this phosphate here.
And these two other phosphates then

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:21.000
come off as a leaving group.
So if we thought of it as a pea

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
like this with two more peas here,
these two come off and you get a new

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:36.000
bond formed to the phosphate.
And so what Kornberg then was able

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:45.000
to find by using a DNA template that
had this sort of structure and

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:54.000
[TTATA?] like this,
that he was now able to get an A

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:04.000
added here.  This hydroxyl here
became the new hydroxyl.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
And so the direction of synthesis,
this strand is the other way, so the

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
direction of synthesis of a DNA
polymerase, it's polymerizing in the

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
5 prime to two 3 prime direction.
This was again an amazing discovery

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
because it was the first time that
anyone had found an enzyme

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
that could copy DNA.
Arthur Kornberg got a Nobel Prize

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
for it.  But at this point actually
genetics came in because there was a

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
scientist John Cairns who was at
that point down at Cold Spring

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Harbor, as I told you the other day.
And John, in spite of the fact that

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Arthur had found a DNA polymerase
that had all the properties that you

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
would expect for copying DNA,
didn't think that was the one that

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
actually copied the DNA necessary
for cellular replication.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So he reasoned if he was right he'd
be able to find a mutation that

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
would eliminate the activity of that
enzyme and the cell would still live.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
And so they did a screening,
and it was a lot of work, but they

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
eventually found a mutant of E.
coli that lacked this DNA polymerase

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
that Arthur Kornberg had discovered.
And the cell was still alive and

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
was still replicating its DNA.
So it told both John and then

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Arthur there must be another
enzyme in the cell.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And so Arthur went back.
And now working in a mutant that

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
was missing this first polymerase he
discovered he found the one that

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
really replicates the DNA.
The first one is important,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
too.  It's needed for DNA repair.
I'm going to talk to you about that

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
in next lecture,
but it's not absolutely crucial for

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
life.  And there's an interplay of
genetics and biochemistry.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
And you'll see I'm just sort of
foreshadowing what we're going to

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
get to when we talk about
the genetics of this.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
And I know a couple of you clearly
were frustrated about me showing you

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
pictures of the people who did this,
but nevertheless since this was such

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
a historic event a couple of years
ago at Cold Spring Harbor.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
This you see the helix model down
there.  There was Jim Watson opening

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
the symposium.
When I got up to talk I said,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
well, I told my students that I'd
let them know what it was like when

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
I was there, so I took out a camera
and I took a picture of the audience.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
And so there are a bunch of Nobel
Laureates and types here who were

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
sitting there smiling for you guys
in the class.  And there was Arthur

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Kornberg giving his talk.
Now, these DNA polymerases are

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
incredible protein machines.
The crystal structures of DNA

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
polymerases operating their template
have been solved.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And you can solve,
depending on how many diffractions

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
you can get, you can get a model
that's more and more detailed.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
And there have been very high
resolution models of DNA polymerases.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
This blue and white stuff is the
surface of the protein,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
and this is sort of a template and
the various parts.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Just to give you an idea here are
these tracings of the shapes of the

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
electron density.
You can see how the

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
crystallographers have fit the
nucleotides right in the crystal

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
into these electron densities.
And here putting it together a bit

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
in the blue is the secondary
structure of the protein and the

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
templates and whatnot.
And I don't expect you to see very

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
much in that, but the point is I
wanted to sort of just set you up to

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
show you this little movie.
Because DNA polymerases are

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
incredible machines.
They copy at about a thousand

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
nucleotides a second and their
accuracy is really amazing.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And I'll tell you all the tricks to
the accuracy in the next lecture,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
but I want to show you this little
movie because this is sort of a

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
simulation of what must happen every
time a nucleotide is added.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Now, we'll see this over and over
again so I'll take it in pieces.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
The yellow and the orange are the
secondary structures.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
That's an alpha helix.
And certainly one thing you can see

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
is happening, as we're looking at
this, is the parts of the protein

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
are moving during this.
So you can see this alpha helix

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
that's sort of swinging up and
swinging back down.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Now, what's over here is the
template base.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
That's the base that correspondents
to the T that I was just

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
showing you here.
This is the incoming nucleotide.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
There is the triphosphate coming
down here.  And,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
in fact, you just see those two
phosphates going.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
So what's happening here,
this is going to be the end of the

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
growing chain.
It's going attack right there,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
join the phosphate and the
pyrophosphate will leave.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
And if you'll take a look,
when you see this movement of this

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
helix from the beginning state to up
to here, you'll see what happens.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
It's squeezing the template base and
the incoming nucleotide together.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
What it's really doing is testing
for the correct shape.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Remember the shape of an A-T base
pair and a G-C base pair is the same.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
And if those of you who are
confused about guanine and the

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
keto-enol thing,
try to draw hydrogen bonds with the

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
enol form of guanine and see how you
do.  I think you'll begin

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
to understand a bit.
So at the heart of life is something

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
that can copy DNA.
And there are these exquisitely

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
beautiful machines.
The replica machine in E.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
coli has 18 proteins and the ones in
our bodies are even more

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
sophisticated with even more parts.
OK.  But to replicate a DNA

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
molecule there's another
problem that comes up.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Because DNA polymerases copy --

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
-- and grow chains in a 5 prime to 3
prime direction.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:36.000
And they need a 3 prime hydroxy

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000
terminus.  So they won't work if you
just gave it a single strand of DNA.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000
No DNA polymerase can handle that.
It has to have something like this

00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:03.000
where there's a template strand --

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
-- and there's what's known as the
primer strand.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
So there has to be something that
has the 3 prime hydroxyl and there

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
has to be something that's going to
provide the template that's going to

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
be copied.  So if we pull strands
apart like this with 5 prime to 3

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
prime then they'll be 5 prime to 3
prime running in the opposite

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
direction.
If we have a template like this,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:39.000
this is OK because the strand here
can be copied 5 prime to 3 prime.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000
This is the new strand being
synthesized by the DNA polymerase.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:56.000
But what about the other strand?
The replication fork is moving in

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000
this direction, but if the --
So here is the 3 to 5 prime

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
direction here.
So if the DNA polymerase is going

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
to be copying this strand it's going
to be moving backwards to the

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
direction of the replication fork.
Now, I guess evolution and nature

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
could have selected for two types of
DNA polymerases,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
one that copies 5 prime to 3 prime
and one that copies in the opposite

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
direction.   But it didn't.
And there are a number of

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
theoretical reasons that we could
discuss in a more advanced course

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
perhaps for why that is true.
But, in fact, what it does is it

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
uses the same polymerase.
So as these things peel apart the

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
polymerase works in the other
direction, but there's another

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
problem.  If I just peel it apart
like this there's no 3 prime

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
hydroxyl.  So it took people quite a
few years to figure out the strategy

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
that's used in nature.
Nature has a special enzyme that

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.000
makes a little piece of RNA.
It's called an RNA primer.  And

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.000
what it does is it provides a 3
prime hydroxyl.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And once you have the 3 prime
hydroxyl at the end of the little

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
RNA chain then the
DNA polymerase --

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:39.000
-- can be made 5 prime to 3 prime.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000
So as you peel open the replication
fork then little pieces of RNA are

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:55.000
used to make a new strand of DNA and
it goes this way.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Now that obviously doesn't give you
a new intact DNA strand.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
And part of the clue to this working
out what was going on at DNA

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
replication was the recognition that
newly synthesized DNA was made as

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
little pieces.
And then later it got joined into

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
longer pieces.
And the person who discovered this

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
was Okazaki.  So these fragments of
DNA that are synthesized initially

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
are called Okazaki fragments,
after the person who discovered this.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
It was rather puzzling because when
you tried to look at the synthesis

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
of DNA you're looking at a long
molecule, and you found some of the

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
newly synthesized material was in
short pieces.  And as you watched

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
over time it got longer.
So the cell, I think you can sort

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
of see from first principles what
has to happen here then.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:06.000
That in order to come and make --

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
This strand is pretty easy to do,
but what the cells have to do now is

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
they've got these little
RNA primers.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:38:25.000
And then they remove the RNA by an

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000
enzyme that's capable of degrading
the DNA or clipping it

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
at the junction.
And that then leaves the cell in

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
this sort of situation where there
are little tiny gaps in between

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
these pieces of DNA.
But at the end of each one of these

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
is a 3 prime hydroxyl.
So another polymerase or one or

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
another polymerase in the cell can
fill those little pieces

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.000
of DNA out.
And then there's one little nick

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
that needs to be sealed.
And so what you finally end up with

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000
is a 3 prime hydroxyl here,
a 5 prime phosphate that's at the

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
other end, and then these are joined
together.  This is one nucleotide

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000
here and the other here.
These are then joined together to

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
give the ordinary phosphodiester
bond that links --

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
-- the two nucleotides together like

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
that.  And the enzyme that does that
is an enzyme called DNA ligase.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
You can almost think about it as
DNA Scotch tape that will take a

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
little nick in DNA,
if we've got a phosphate and

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
hydroxyl, and it will
join them together.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
So this process of replication,
which can go at about a thousand

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000
nucleotides a second with this
amazing degree of accuracy,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
uses two different DNA polymerases,
both of which biochemically can only

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
go in one direction.
But you can see they have to be

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
somehow oriented so that one of them
is able to move in this direction

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
and the other one is able to move in
that direction.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
The key part in this sort of the
course is to try and understand this

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
5 to 3 prime and to get this basic
idea that nature had to do something.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
It was fairly easy to copy one
strand because that was sort of the

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
direction of the polymerase movement
was the same as the replication for

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
it movement, but the other strand
had to have been much

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
more a problem.
And so when you get down to a

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
biochemical level,
though, it's very conceptually easy

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
to say, oh, you've got complimentary
strands so we just take it apart,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
we take the photograph and the
negative and we make the opposite

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
one and now we've got two copies.
When you get down to the

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
biochemical details there is this
major biochemical issue of whether

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
the polymerase can go in the 3 prime
or the 5 prime direction.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
And nature has chosen to do it all
or has been selected to do it all

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
somehow with a polymerase
going in one direction.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
There are many other aspects to DNA
replication.  And one of the tricks

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
that I find most fascinating is that
these polymerases,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
once they get on DNA they stay on.
And that's part of the secret

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
because it takes about a millisecond
to add a nucleotide,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
but if it comes off the DNA it has
to get back on.  Then it

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
takes about a minute.
So the whole trick to being a very,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
very fast DNA polymerase is to
somehow hang onto the DNA.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
So what biochemists did was they
purified the actual enzymatic

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
activity that could carry out this
process, and then they started to

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
look for other protein factors that
would help the process to work

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
better.  And they discovered
something called a processivity

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
factor which made the polymerase
stay on the DNA.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
And people wondered for a lot of
years how that worked and why did

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
this system work so well.
And finally the crystal structure of

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
the processivity factor was
discovered.  And if I go back to

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
this sort of diagram where this is
the piece of DNA that's copied,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
what it turned out was that the
processivity factor is basically a

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
doughnut that kind of gets clamped
around the DNA like that.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
So it's sort of like taking a
washer with a place where you can

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
pry it apart opening it up,
putting it around the DNA like this.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And then the polymerase,
more or less since this is

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
topologically linked to the DNA,
is like a washer sliding on a wire.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
This DNA polymerase hangs onto that
and it doesn't come off.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
And I think there's a little
picture of it.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Here's a little movie.
There's the DNA going through and

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
this is one of these clamps.
It's virtually the same structure

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
in a bacterium and inside of us.
But, in fact, the amino acids are

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
almost all different.
But the underlying structure of the

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
protein is almost identical.
And there are special machines

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
called clamp loaders that pry open
this clamps, clamp them around DNA,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
and that's part of the secret to how
these polymerases are able to

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
polymerize DNA so fast.
There are a lot of other pieces of

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
this machinery.
If you go on you'll hear more about

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
them.  I just want to give you one
of the most recent insights.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
I mean this, as you might guess,
since DNA replication is at the

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
heart of life it's been studied very,
very hard, ever since the discovery

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
of DNA helix.  My colleague,
Alan Grossman, made quite a

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
discovery just probably three or
four years ago.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
He took that green fluorescent
protein that we've seen a few times,

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
and he actually joined the gene
encoding green fluorescent protein

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
to the backend of a piece
of the DNA polymerase.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
So wherever the DNA polymerase went
now there was a little fluorescent

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
molecule.  And he looked to see
where it was in the cell.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
And I, like many other people,
had for years taught, and this is

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
why, you know,
I have respect for the fact that I'm

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
just teaching you the current model.
For much of my career I taught, so

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
DNA polymerase is sort of like a
train going down the tracks a

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
thousand molecules per second.
And we're doing all this stuff with

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
the leading and with the two strands.
So let me just put those words up

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
while I'm up there.
This one is called,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000
this strand that's easy to replicate
is called the leading strand.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
And this one where you have to do
the primer and whatnot is called the

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
lagging strand.
In any case, what I had taught was

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
that polymerase was like a train
running on tracks.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
You could calculate how fast it
would move.  What Alan,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
to his amazing I imagine,
found was when he looked to see

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
where the DNA polymerase was,
it wasn't spread out all over the

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
cell as if you thought it was a
thing running on tracks.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
In fact, it was in the center of
the cell.  And then late in cell

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
division it split into two spots
that went to the midpoints of what

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
would be the daughter cells.
And so what he ended up realizing

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
from that was that instead it was
more as if the polymerase was a

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
factory and it pulled the DNA
through it rather than it traveling

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
down the tracks of the DNA.
And that was a very surprising

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
discovery that went against all the
dogma and all the pictures in the

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
textbook. And it was
a discovery at MIT.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
That was published in,
I think it was 2001, something like

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
that, a very recent discovery.
Things keep changing.  That's again

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
why I keep emphasizing I cannot
teach you a fact in biology.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
I can teach you the best
understanding we have that explains

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
the experiments to date.
But somebody may make a discovery

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
tomorrow.  That means we'll have to
change our understanding.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
OK?  So good luck on the exam.
I'll see you on Monday, OK?

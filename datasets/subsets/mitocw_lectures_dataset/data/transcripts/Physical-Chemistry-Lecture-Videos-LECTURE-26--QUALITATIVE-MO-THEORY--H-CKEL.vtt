00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.530
ROBERT FIELD: Last time
I talked about LCAO-MO

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.690
for diatomic molecules.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.140
And I didn't finish,
but the important point

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.690
was that this is a toy model.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.840
This is based on a
little bit of extension

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.980
from something which is not
really a toy model, H2 plus,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.830
to, basically, an
interpretive framework

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.140
that can be applied
to, basically,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.200
all diatomic molecules.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.710
And the logic is
relatively simple.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.470
We know this one.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.200
We get the molecular
orbitals for H2 plus.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.470
There are basically two.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.230
There's a binding one
and the anti-binding one.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.110
Of course, there's many more,
but we don't care about them.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.200
And then we go to H2.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.560
And again, there's
basically only two orbitals

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.240
that we care about because the
next higher principle quantum

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.290
number has such high energy that
we can just forget about them,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.620
because those states that
derive from the higher principle

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.300
quantum number are Rydberg
states or complicated things,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.410
because they're at
such high energy.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.200
And then it's a very small step
to go from hydrogen to the AH

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.530
molecules, because,
well, we've got

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.940
the electronic structure for the
A atom, which is complicated--

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.350
more complicated than hydrogen.
But because hydrogen only

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.610
can make sigma bonds, because
the p orbitals in hydrogen

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.520
are so high that it's
a simpler picture

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.460
and can easily be understood.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.850
This is in all the
textbooks, and it's

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.150
more or less given to you
as something to memorize.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.720
But there is a lot more to
it than just memorization.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.890
And the important thing
is that everything

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.780
in LCAO-MO for diatomics is
based on the periodic table.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.060
And the periodic table tells
you about the ionization

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.080
energies-- the periodicites
of ionization energies.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.920
And so we can say
for any non-integer--

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.190
Well, if we know
what the ionization

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.730
energy from a
particular state is,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.310
we can use that
ionization energy

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.021
to derive a non-integer
principle quantum number.

00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.370
This is all empirical.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.960
And then use that empirical
principle quantum number

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.500
to get the size of the orbital.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.290
And basically, the
size is everything.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.450
Because everything
is based on overlap,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.450
And the internuclear
distance molecule

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.790
is based on the relative
sizes of the different atoms.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.826
And for different electronic
states of the atoms,

00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:33.450
these sizes are
different, because they

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.050
have the ionization energy
from that level implicitly

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.640
expressed.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.390
So because you know
about orbital sizes,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.830
and that the different atomic
orbitals have different sizes,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.470
you can do an
enormous amount as far

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.870
as understanding the
electronic structure

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.920
of all diatomic molecules.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.060
Now, this-- when you have two
states which have different

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.170
energies--

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.204
We do something like this to
describe the molecular orbitals

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:16.079
that arise from them.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.450
That that's perturbation theory.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.490
So the solid line is
the dominant character.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.260
The dotted line is the admix
character of the other orbital.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.630
And this is all
qualitative, but you

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.500
have these different
atomic orbital energies.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.600
You know them from the
periodic table, basically.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.701
And so you can say, yes.

00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:43.450
There's going to be
two orbitals arriving,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.720
derived from these two states.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.050
And one is polarized
towards this atom.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.550
The other is polarized
towards that atom.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.050
And so you get the
shape of the orbital.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.360
And it's actually
useful for saying, well,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.920
if I were to do chemistry, which
end of this is electronegative,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.540
and which end is positive?

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.370
Or which end of this would
attach to a metal surface?

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.080
Would it attach pointing into
the surface or lying down?

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.510
And there's all
sorts of insights,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.240
if you can draw these
sorts of pictures.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.330
And this is what we do
as physical chemists.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.380
We take the crudest
model, and we say, OK.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.140
We understand the
important features.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.190
And as we discover new,
important features,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.230
we build them in, or
we forget about them

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.440
because they're too subtle.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.550
And we're always looking
for something where

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.950
the crude picture doesn't work.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.610
And we then find the important
thing that is needed.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.640
And for example,
if you were to look

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.670
at the molecular orbital
diagram for C2, which

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.689
is a perfectly legitimate
gaseous molecule,

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.980
you'll see that there's a
little bit of ambiguity about

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.330
which is the ground state.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.030
And this is an important thing.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.700
And there was a big
controversy about this that

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.690
was settled by spectroscopy.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.190
OK.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.750
So if you can build
an intuitive picture

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.850
for all diatomic
molecules, you can also

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.100
build an intuitive
picture for what

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.006
we could call chromophores.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.820
So there are a lot
of molecules that are

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.640
larger than diatomic molecules.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.650
But the electronic
structure is mostly nothing,

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.900
except a few atoms that are
close to each other, where

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.960
there's a double bond or
there's something special.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.620
And so if you can do LCAO-MO
for diatomic molecules,

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.250
you can also address
electronic structure

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.740
in much larger
molecules, because it's

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.400
really due to a
few important atoms

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.210
or several different
groups of important atoms.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.700
And so the idea
is, in here, enable

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.495
you to talk about the electronic
structure of almost anything.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.010
And one of the things that we
care about is spectroscopy.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.600
How do we learn about the
structure of a molecule?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.760
And mostly, you learn
about it from doing

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.200
electronic spectroscopy.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.290
You do transitions between the
ground state and some higher

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.640
states.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.800
And you want to
be able to predict

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.670
what you are going to see.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.320
And for example-- and I
think you may hear about this

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.840
a little bit more--

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.280
if you know the
spectrum of nitrogen,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.140
it doesn't start absorbing
until far into the vacuum UV.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.480
And then go one atom over--

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.730
the spectrum of oxygen. Well,
that defines the vacuum UV.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.640
It starts to absorb
around 200 nanometers.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:25.520
And 2 and 1/2 billion
years ago, oxygen

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.060
started to enter into the
atmosphere and profoundly

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.890
changed life on Earth.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.890
Because with the
vacuum UV radiation,

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.950
nothing could live on
the surface of land,

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.820
because it would all be
killed by this hard UV.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:49.110
And so everything was underwater
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:54.370
But all of a sudden, when oxygen
appeared, there was protection.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.600
And then there's additional
protection farther out

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.310
towards the visible from ozone.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:09.210
It's not such a good shield, but
it absorbs between 200 and 350

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.380
nanometers.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.100
And it protects us, too.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.340
But the big thing is oxygen.
And why should oxygen

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.107
be so different from nitrogen?

00:09:20.107 --> 00:09:21.690
And maybe you should
think about that.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:24.760
OK.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.870
I should have mentioned
the schedule up there.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.630
I'm going to give another
lecture on perturbation

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.360
theory-- one of my favorites,
which I thought I wasn't

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.930
going to get to give on Friday.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.570
And then Troy is going
to give two lectures

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.710
on quantum chemistry.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:46.690
And there's going to be
significant lab experience.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.270
And you'll hear about
that from the TAs.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.380
And so you will do
real calculations.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:10:01.300
So LCAO-MO could be the
organization structure

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.000
for quantitative calculations.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.740
But quantitative calculations
are usually huge basis sets,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.130
and you lose the
LCAO completely.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.820
One could take the results
of such a calculation,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.637
and then project it
onto a LCAO-MO picture.

00:10:20.637 --> 00:10:21.970
And that's generally what we do.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.410
We reduce experiments, we
reduce theory, to something

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.730
that we can intuit.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.601
And it's really important
to have intuition.

00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:32.100
OK.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:42.860
Huckel theory-- Huckel
theory is another kind

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:49.570
of non-rigorous theory.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.070
In fact, it's laughable
in its simplicity.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:59.770
And the idea is that even such a
crude theory can make sense out

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.790
of huge families of
molecules and enable

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.910
you to be quantitative
about things without having

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.550
to do a huge calculation.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:15.090
Now, you almost always
have to diagonize a matrix.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.050
And because usually,
in Huckel theory,

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:25.420
you're dealing with more than
two or three relevant orbitals,

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.110
it's a big deal.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.070
I don't know whether
you have experience

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.200
with matrix
diagonalization routines,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.670
but there are many of them.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.620
And you're going to have
experience with them.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.300
But the things you put into
them have absolutely nothing

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.730
to do with a real Hamiltonian.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.130
It's a make up picture.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.610
It's a picture based on,
basically, two parameters--

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.810
alpha and beta.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.000
And I'll talk about this.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.590
And these are parameters
that are agreed upon

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.450
by international committee--

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.650
It's not a committee.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.020
But people say, OK.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.850
This is the value
of alpha and beta

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.805
that we're going to use
to describe many problems.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.700
But I just want to make
sure you understand

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.270
that Huckel theory is
only a little bit more

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:25.250
ridiculous than LCAO-MO theory.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:32.120
Because in LCAO-MO, you really
have some semi-empirical sense

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.360
of how big orbitals are.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.984
And once you know
how big orbitals are,

00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:36.900
you know what's going on.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.840
In this, you just have a couple
of parameters that says, OK.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.910
These are the rules.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.360
Let's now apply that.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:45.860
OK.

00:12:48.788 --> 00:12:50.730
I'm carrying around
too much stuff.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:13:00.420
So organic chemists
are really wonderful,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.740
because they give you an
abbreviated way of drawing

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.660
a molecular structure.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.570
And almost everyone
in this room is

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.880
gifted in being
able to visualize

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.860
three-dimensional structures.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.800
Physical chemists tend
not to be so gifted.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.100
But here is something where
we don't have any hydrogens--

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.590
I mean, there are hydrogens,
but they're implied.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.720
And we don't put carbons here.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.780
We just say, at every vertex,
there is a carbon atom.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.140
And so we consider these things.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.070
And every organic chemist knows,
if I draw something like this,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.390
that either I was
stupid and I drew

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:44.110
something that was impossible
or what the structure is.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.610
OK.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.770
Now, this is a
conjugated system.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.630
We have double bonds
and single bonds.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:55.980
And that kind of thing is
known to be unusually stable.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.870
And in order for it to
work, it has to be planar.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.890
If you have a conjugated
system which is not planar,

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.180
then it's not as stable.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:17.280
So Huckel theory is based on the
existence of unusual stability

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.600
of conjugated systems.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:28.730
And it can be extended to
non-conjugated systems--

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.870
to non-planar systems-- and we
have rules for how to do that.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:41.220
But the simple rules are,
you start with a picture,

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.660
and you can write
down a Hamiltonian.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.130
And it's a toy model,
but it's still something

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.990
that the computer
has to diagonalize.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.990
So when we're doing a
variational calculation

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.790
expressed in matrix language--

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.740
We have a Hamiltonian matrix.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:15.210
We have eigenvectors,
and we have eigenvalues.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.600
And we have the overlap matrix.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:26.580
And we have something
where this is the alpha--

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.580
where, here, we can have
non-orthonormal basis

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.050
functions.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.640
And this makes them normalized.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.290
So these are the orthonormalized
basis functions or basis

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.470
vectors.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.010
And this is the kind of
equation we have to solve.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.340
It's the generalized
eigenvalue equation.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.420
And we don't like
this, because it

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.930
doesn't have the simplicity
of just a Hamiltonian, where

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:02.040
we have matrix elements along
the diagonal and somewhere

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.090
else.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:08.790
And the idea is, we want to
take the secular determinate

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:14.400
and make it 0 by adjusting
values of the energy

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.830
differences along the diagonal.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.770
But when we have this overlap
matrix, it's complicated.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.360
Now, there's a way of dealing
with the generalized eigenvalue

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:31.890
equations, but one way to
deal with it is to say s

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.065
is equal to the unit matrix.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.900
You can do anything you want.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:47.620
And it's basically saying, there
is no overlap between orbitals

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.902
on adjacent atoms.

00:16:49.902 --> 00:16:51.610
We're going to neglect
it, and then we're

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.520
going to bring it
back if we need it.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.500
But it's a wonderful
simplification,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.840
because it enables you to
write a simple, effective

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:09.230
Hamiltonian, which looks
just like h c alpha is

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.800
equal to e alpha c alpha.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.300
OK.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.530
This, we know how to solve.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.890
And we can use the
same procedure.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.940
OK.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.960
So these are the rules.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:45.760
If we have a planar molecule, we
can say there are p orbitals--

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.030
one on each carbon atom
or one on each atom that's

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:54.980
not hydrogen, which are
perpendicular to the plane

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.260
of the molecule.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.730
So easy orbitals.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.330
And those are special.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.510
They give rise to pi bonds.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:14.470
Pi bonds are bonds where
there is one plane of symmetry

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:25.510
containing the bond, And then
there are p x, and p y, and s.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.255
And these give rise
to sigma bonds.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:35.210
So we have pi bonds
and sigma bonds.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.554
Never the twain shall meet.

00:18:38.554 --> 00:18:40.220
And we don't care
about the sigma bonds,

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.530
because anybody can
make sigma bonds.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:48.950
But only the special,
perpendicular-to-the-plane

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.280
guys, which are responsible
for the fact that the molecule

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.690
likes to be planar.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.280
And so we're only going to
consider these p z orbitals--

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.530
one on each atom.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:12.080
So we don't care about
no pi-sigma interactions.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.160
And we're going to neglect the
sigma orbitals, because they

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.571
take care of themselves.

00:19:22.277 --> 00:19:25.610
And we can do anything we want.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.130
It's just a question
of, if we make

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.700
too many ridiculous assumptions,
we'll get ridiculous results.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.880
And this has been
time tested, and it

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.830
gives pretty useful stuff.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.980
And it provides a framework
for making arguments

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.030
about molecular structure
and molecular reactivity.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.060
In organic chemistry you
learn about resonance forms.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.340
And this is compatible with
generating the resonance forms

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.650
and saying, what is the
relative importance?

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.930
And what is the
charge distribution,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.360
and bond strength, and
everything like that?

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.080
So it's really useful using
the most primitive tools

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.240
that organic chemists
introduce at an early stage

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.829
in your education.

00:20:09.829 --> 00:20:11.870
And that's one of the
reasons why a lot of people

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.395
become organic chemists,
because it's so beautiful.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.990
OK.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:25.270
So our h i j matrix--

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.550
So we have a bunch of matrix
elements, and we say, OK.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:34.080
h i i is equal to alpha.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:41.950
So every carbon atom
has its alpha value.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.760
It's the same for
all carbon atoms,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.395
regardless of who is nearby.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:56.970
And we have h I i plus or
minus 1 adjacent atoms,

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.240
and it's beta.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:20:59.850
That's it.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.380
That's the whole ball game.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.670
And it's really a simple--

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.750
There's far less
here than in LCAO-MO.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.390
But it's still a toy.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.380
Both are toy models, and
they're both very useful

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.880
OK.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:31.875
And everything else which is not
diagonal or off diagonal by 1--

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:32.375
0.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.080
That's really convenient.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.830
And so you can
draw the h matrix,

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:46.210
regardless of what it looks
like, as alpha, alpha, alpha,

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.120
alpha, et cetera,
along the diagonal,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:56.430
and beta, beta, beta, et cetera,
beta, along the near diagonal.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.240
And if it's a ring, you have
a beta here, here, and here.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.060
So that's pretty simple.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.200
So we have 0s, 0s--

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.410
so that it has a tri-diagonal
structure with something

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.360
up here and there.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.880
Never forget this
thing here and there,

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.280
which is present
when you have a ring,

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.440
and it's not present
when you don't.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:23.940
That's it.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.680
That's Huckel theory.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.710
It's just there.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.290
OK.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:34.960
And so now, things can
be more complicated.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.150
So if we're not
content with what

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.370
we get from the really
primitive theory,

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.370
we can do something
like saying, well, we

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:53.450
can make beta be dependent
on internuclear distance.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.240
If the molecule,
for some reason,

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.550
is constrained to have
not equal bonds lengths.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.690
So we can add an additional
parameter-- some kind of reason

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.500
for this beta to
be dependent on r.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.230
But that's already
getting sophisticated.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:16.770
And heteroatoms--
In other words,

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.970
if you have a nitrogen instead
of a carbon in a benzene-type

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.700
ring, you can have--

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.550
So, well, nitrogen is
different from carbon.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.465
It has a different--

00:23:29.465 --> 00:23:32.740
In LCAO theory, the distance--

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.110
The ionization
energy for nitrogen

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.520
is different from carbon.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.550
It's larger.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:42.290
And so heteroatoms
can be included if you

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.990
use a different value of alpha.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:50.160
And now, alpha and
beta are both negative.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.821
Now, this is a little
bit fraudulent.

00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:53.320
Yeah.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.540
AUDIENCE: Do you also
have to pick a new beta?

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.360
Or--

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.190
ROBERT FIELD: Yes.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.900
But the main thing is alpha.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.660
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.870
Why is that?

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:02.980
ROBERT FIELD: Why is that?

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:11.410
Because beta comes from overlap,
even though we're neglecting

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.950
overlap.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:19.150
And so the bond distances
between normal and heteroatoms

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.880
are not usually that different.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.320
But the thing is, you put
what you need into the model.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.870
And the first thing
you do is, you

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.400
solve the most simple model.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.160
And you say, this is
not quite what I wanted.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.920
And so I allow a couple of
extra degrees of freedom.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.760
And it's really instructive
how these things work.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.950
But the thing is, you're not
calculating the matrix element

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.930
of a real operator.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.920
It's all make believe.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.810
But it's really powerful,
because what you're comparing

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.090
is families of molecules.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.400
And the reality might
be really complicated,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.940
but the complexity in
each member of the family

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.320
is pretty much the same.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.960
And what it's
allowing you to see

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.042
is, what are the differences?

00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:10.890
It allows you to
see the big picture.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.420
I love this.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.900
And in fact, at an early
stage of my education,

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.250
I thought Huckel
theory was wonderful.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.130
And it was what got me
interested in quantum

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:21.630
mechanics.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.327
Because you normally see
Huckel theory before you

00:25:24.327 --> 00:25:25.910
know anything about
quantum mechanics,

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.190
because it's just a game.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.120
OK So heteroatoms--

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.570
You can fiddle with alpha.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:40.180
Now, the ionization energies
for carbon and nitrogen

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.371
are not that different.

00:25:42.371 --> 00:25:42.870
I'm sorry.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.410
They're very different,
but the effect

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.910
on the alpha value in
Huckel theory is very small.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.000
Well, so it is.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.170
But the more electronegative
or the higher the ionization

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:05.660
energy, the alpha value
becomes increasingly negative.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.790
Now, I was starting to say
something is fraudulent,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:12.590
and I was distracted by
a really good question.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.840
Alpha is on the diagonal.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:21.840
And we know we can determine
the sign of a diagonal element.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.400
And we know we can't
determine the sign

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.070
of an off-diagonal element.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.300
But we say that alpha and
beta are both less than 0.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:39.350
And the reason for this is
that, when you saw the secular

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.600
equation, especially--

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.820
You get two
eigenvalues-- one where

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.360
you have minus beta and one
where you have plus beta.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.640
And so in a sense,
beta is present,

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.680
but it's just a sign choice.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.520
And since alpha and beta
have to do with stability,

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.200
we just say alpha is negative.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.000
We know that.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.900
And beta is chosen to
be always negative.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.310
There's no, you could
have had beta be positive.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:13.840
And you could do all the theory.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.961
It's just a lot more complicated
explaining all the cases.

00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:19.460
All right.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.738
So let's continue with this.

00:27:23.738 --> 00:27:25.490
And so we can do heteroatoms.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.150
So if we have a
non-planar system,

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:42.190
we can say that beta is a
function of the dihedral angle.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:43.160
We can put that in.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.290
We can do anything we want.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.840
We have a molecule.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.840
We're trying to
describe its properties

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.020
relative to the normal
members of the group, which

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.570
are planar and no heteroatoms.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.120
And we can do stuff
that will accommodate

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.020
these interesting differences,
which you can impose

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.310
by you putting the molecule
in a constrained environment

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:11.970
or doing stuff that
distorts the geometry.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.855
So we do this.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.700
So when we do this,
we get a Hamiltonian.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:25.960
We get the energies
of the orbitals,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:35.370
and we get the eigenvector that
corresponds to each energy.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.570
And the total energy
involves the sum

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.500
over the energies of each of the
occupied orbitals-- the number

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.240
of electrons in that.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:50.485
And we can also get
bond order and charge.

00:28:53.608 --> 00:28:58.660
So sometimes, we
want to know, what

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.990
is the charge on each
atom if the charge is

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.880
going to be different from 0?

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.570
Because that also
controls chemistry.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.110
Negatively charged
atoms are sought out

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.300
by certain classes of reactants.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.370
Anyway, so you get
all this stuff.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.510
And of course, some
of it will require

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:27.000
a little bit of patchwork, but
you do this for your career.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.160
And you discover that
there are certain things

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.210
that I know how to handle.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.510
And I use my favorite
parameters for it.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.520
And you get closer to the truth.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.400
And you always want
to be surprised,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:46.150
because when the crude theory
cannot be made consistent with

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.630
observations, you know
you did something special.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:54.040
You have a molecule, which has
a property which is unexpected,

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.880
and we like that.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.930
OK.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:05.820
So when you're doing
quantum chemistry,

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.900
there are five steps--

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:11.060
or when you're doing
molecular orbital theory.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:15.200
And this is one of Troy's rules.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.210
We have a five-step procedure.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:25.580
And we define the atomic
orbital basis set.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.550
And the basis set is one
p z orbital per atom.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:45.280
And so we can have a molecular
orbital, which is the sum i

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:52.260
equals 1 to n c i u p z i.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.160
So this is the p z
orbital on the i-th atom.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.116
This is the coefficient for this
particular linear combination.

00:31:04.141 --> 00:31:04.640
OK.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.190
So we have a bunch of
molecular orbitals.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:16.140
Next step-- compute h and s.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:21.860
But s is 0 because we made
this ridiculous assumption.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.510
It's convenient.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.090
This is called the complete
neglect of overlap.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.430
And we can do that.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.730
It's wrong.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.900
But when you include
overlap, it leads

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.300
to greater complexity
of the calculation,

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.550
and not much improvement
in the results.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:47.160
And so we normally don't
worry about the overlap.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.770
So all we care about is this.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:56.040
And as I said, h
has this structure

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:01.360
of alpha, beta, beta--

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.301
tri-diagonal structure and
maybe something up here.

00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:04.800
That's it.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:15.360
Then we diagonalize
the Hamiltonian.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:24.680
And so this gives us the
eigenvectors or eigenvalues--

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.010
the energies and
eigenvectors associated

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.070
with each orbital energy.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.870
So we fill electrons
into orbitals.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:40.710
Now, for benzene,
what you would get--

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.150
Now, this is important.

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:47.340
How many carbon
atoms in benzene?

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.310
Right.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.890
And how many
orbitals will you get

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.240
from six primitive orbitals?

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.440
Right.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.800
And so there are
six energy levels.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.530
And it happens that when you
solve the secular equation,

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:05.940
you get this pattern.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.090
This is a problem where
the number of nodal planes

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.160
determines the order of energy.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.070
And so if you have
benzene, you can

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:29.740
imagine that the orbitals that
you can have will be no nodes--

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.830
nodal planes-- one nodal plane.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.130
And you could have the nodal
planes between the atoms

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.410
or through atoms--

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:42.860
and two nodal planes or three.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.680
You can't have any
more with six atoms.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:52.490
And so you almost don't have
to solve this secular equation

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.210
at all.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.480
You can anticipate
what the structure

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.630
is going to be just by saying,
no nodes, one node, two

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.240
node, three node.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.140
And you can even anticipate
double degeneracies,

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.989
because if you have
two nodal planes,

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:17.489
you can put them
through opposite bonds

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.540
or through opposite atoms.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:25.060
And those are examples of the
forms that you would deal with.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.949
The only thing you can't do
is to know what the order

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:31.389
the energies are.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:32.860
But there are tricks
for that, too.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.380
The tricks for that include--

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.244
The sum of the eigenvalues
is equal to sum

00:34:42.244 --> 00:34:43.160
of the diagonal nodes.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:50.080
And so we know that the
six orbital energies

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.530
will sum to 0--

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.557
will sum to 6 alpha.

00:34:55.557 --> 00:34:58.100
The betas go away.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.620
And there are other
tricks that you can do,

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.780
but generally, you
solve the equation.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:09.110
You don't want to push your
requirements for symmetry

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.010
too far.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.040
So we end up doing that.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.550
And then stick diagrams--

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:27.500
We fill electrons into
orbitals in energy order.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.970
And for benzene,
there are six of them.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:35.675
And so this is, then, the
lowest energy state of benzene.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:43.570
This is called the independent
electron approximation.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.010
They don't know
about each other.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.860
This is illegal.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.360
But it's legal in
a sense, if you

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.730
have two electrons
in every orbital,

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:54.950
you have nothing
but singlet states.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:58.040
The ground state is always
going to be a singlet state

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.130
unless you have something
really weird going on--

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.450
like in O2--

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.690
But that's not Huckel theory.

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:09.190
But it's examinable.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.180
OK.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.660
Why does oxygen have a
triplet ground state?

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.465
That's something that
every textbook says.

00:36:18.465 --> 00:36:19.340
You got to know that.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.830
And of course, they don't
really tell you anything more

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.301
except something to memorize.

00:36:24.301 --> 00:36:24.800
OK.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.950
So generally, you
have two electrons

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:30.940
in each orbital in singlets.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.190
Now, if you're going
to do spectroscopy

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.850
you would perhaps promote one
of these guys to a higher state.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.270
And so you'll have
singlets and triplets.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.400
But of course the only
transition you would see

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.590
would be a singlet-to-singlet
transition.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:50.040
So you might as well
forget about triplets.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.570
And you might as well
forget about having

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.650
to add [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:56.270 --> 00:37:00.750
You can get away with murder,
especially with Huckel theory.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.230
So we have a stick diagram.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.750
We fill electrons
into the thing.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:17.440
And then we compute the energy
of the many electron problem.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.990
And so let's just do this.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.490
And you've all seen this.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.980
So we number the atoms.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.580
We have our symmetric structure.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:52.375
And psi mu is going to be
sum from i equals 1 to 6.

00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:59.106
C i mu p z i.

00:37:59.106 --> 00:38:12.140
And c mu is c 1 mu
c 2 mu to c 6 mu.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.690
These are the
mixing coefficients.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.430
Well, for benzene,
it's pretty simple

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:24.370
because you know that if you
have no nodes and symmetry,

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.470
all of these are
going to be the same.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.540
And so if you put 1s here, you
put a 1 over square root of 6

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.410
out in front for normalization.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:38.160
And you can figure out the
eigenvectors for benzene--

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.490
all of them-- just by
counting the number of nodes.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:45.660
And that's useful, because if
you know the eigenvectors, then

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.480
you can show what
the eigenvalue is

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.993
by multiplying the original
Hamiltonian by an eigenvalue.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:39:01.380
So anyway, we have this.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.580
And then the Hamiltonian--

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:12.700
we have alpha,
beta, and then 0s.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:17.610
And beta, alpha, beta,
and then 0s, et cetera.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:22.710
And so we have this
tri-diagonal structure.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:29.420
And because it's a ring, we
have a beta here and here.

00:39:32.885 --> 00:39:35.360
OK.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.270
So then, we ask our computer
to diagonalize this,

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:45.320
or we use clever tricks
from linear algebra

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.340
to find the eigenvalues,
but I don't recommend it.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.700
I mean, the general
problem is going

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.070
to be something where you
have to use a computer.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.730
So don't develop
tricks unless you

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.040
want to check to see
whether you programmed

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.602
the computer correctly.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:13.380
And so when you
do this, you get--

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:19.090
E 1, the lowest energy,
is alpha plus 2 beta.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:23.575
E 2 is alpha plus beta.

00:40:23.575 --> 00:40:27.280
And E 3 is alpha minus beta.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.110
I'm sorry.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.080
E 2 and e 3 are both this.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.820
And E 4 and e 5 are this.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:46.482
And e 6 is alpha minus 2 beta.

00:40:46.482 --> 00:40:48.440
Now, we don't really care
about these orbitals,

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.148
because they don't
put electrons in them.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.200
And so when you put the
electrons in the orbitals,

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.661
you get 2 for this, 2
for this, 2 for that.

00:40:59.661 --> 00:41:00.160
OK?

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.580
And so we just calculate
the sum of the energies.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:12.520
And we end up getting the
energy levels for benzene.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:21.790
The ground state is
going to be 2 alpha,

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:36.580
plus 2 beta, plus 2 alpha, plus
beta, plus 2 alpha, plus beta.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.370
Right?

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:44.330
So this gives you 6
alpha plus 8 beta.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.620
Now, this-- You might
have guessed it,

00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:59.620
but you didn't guess it.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.236
Your computer told you that.

00:42:02.236 --> 00:42:07.590
And the computer actually likes
numbers rather than symbols.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:14.120
And so you actually obtain
this simple structure

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.000
from the computer-- requires
a little bit of manipulation.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.960
But you still get 6
alpha plus 8 beta.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:29.750
And you also get
the eigenvectors.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.530
And that's the
stuff that you know.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:38.330
So c 1 is 1 over
square root of 6.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:38.830
1.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:39.330
1.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:39.920
All of those.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:48.020
And c 2 is going to be something
a little bit more complicated.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:53.050
We can have the nodal
plane going through atoms.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.780
And so if it goes
through atom one,

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.030
it's also going to
go through atom four,

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:03.370
and so we have 0
and 0, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:09.900
And now, to figure out how
to normalize that, we just--

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.040
1 over square root
of 4, and so on.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.970
We can figure these things out.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:20.020
C 3 is going to
be an eigenvector.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.880
Now, instead of having the
nodal plane going through atoms,

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.710
it's going between atoms.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.770
And so instead of
having any 0s, you're

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:33.760
going to have something
more complicated.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:41.200
And now I can see that there
is something in my notes

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:51.170
which is subject to how you'd
actually impose the symmetry.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:53.630
But suppose you have
something like this--

00:43:53.630 --> 00:44:02.830
2, 1, minus 1,
minus 2, minus 1, 1.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.380
So why did I use these numbers?

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:14.080
Well, I had to have a nodal
plane here between atoms two

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.310
and three.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:19.467
And the corresponding
guy will be--

00:44:19.467 --> 00:44:21.300
Well, that should have
been 2 at the bottom.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.481
Let me just make sure
I'm doing this right.

00:44:27.481 --> 00:44:27.980
No.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.621
I had a 2.

00:44:28.621 --> 00:44:29.120
OK.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.280
It's a 1.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:30.860
OK.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:37.790
And so the last 1 is here.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:42.530
So the sign change occurs twice.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:46.160
And those correspond
to opposite bonds.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.590
Why were there 2s?

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:59.180
Well, the 2s are between
two atoms that have 1s,

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.070
and so it's going to have
a larger eigenvector.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.830
And you can figure
it out lots of ways.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:07.610
You can also say, well,
every atom has to be used up.

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:08.840
Yes.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.870
AUDIENCE: So should there
also be a sign change?

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:11.828
ROBERT FIELD: I can't--

00:45:11.828 --> 00:45:14.276
AUDIENCE: Should there also
be a sign change in c 2?

00:45:14.276 --> 00:45:15.942
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:15.942 --> 00:45:22.182
In c 2 eigen c 2 6
should be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:22.182 --> 00:45:23.390
ROBERT FIELD: Did I screw up?

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:24.015
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:29.110
No, not-- in c 2.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.030
Not c 3.

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.600
ROBERT FIELD: I'm sorry?

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.725
AUDIENCE: The previous one.

00:45:33.992 --> 00:45:34.950
ROBERT FIELD: Oh, yeah.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:35.449
Yeah.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.540
So opposite sides.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:42.040
OK?

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:45.940
All right.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.990
It doesn't matter.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:48.280
The computer tells you.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:52.360
But sometimes you can approach
the problem very quickly,

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.042
and just say, I know what the
eigenvalues are going to be,

00:45:55.042 --> 00:45:56.250
and I have to normalize them.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.270
But one of the
things that you often

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:08.970
do if you're trying to be smart
and skip steps is to say, OK.

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.950
We have six eigenvectors.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:17.070
And each of the atomic orbitals
gets used up completely

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.560
among the six eigenvectors.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.170
And I do that all the
time, because it's

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:26.410
a very useful way of making
sure I haven't screwed up.

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:27.870
OK.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:37.510
So we get this, and
that's perfectly OK.

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.120
We don't know how
significant it is,

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.405
but say we had three of these--

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.900
three ethylenes-- I
guess an organic chemist

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.060
would just do that, right?

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:56.580
But anyway, if we had three
of these, when you do this

00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:03.464
you get 2 alpha plus 2 theta.

00:47:03.464 --> 00:47:04.350
OK?

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:08.330
So we get 6 alpha plus 6 beta.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.670
And alpha and beta
are both negative.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:14.660
And so the energy
for three ethylenes--

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:15.890
did I screw up again?

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.265
AUDIENCE: How are
those ethylenes

00:47:17.265 --> 00:47:18.950
arranged with one another?

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:20.306
ROBERT FIELD: They're separate.

00:47:25.584 --> 00:47:26.500
We could draw benzene.

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.720
And so we could say, we
have three isolated bonds.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.210
And since we don't care
about the sigma structure,

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:39.880
and no bonds are adjacent, you
know that they're additive.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.730
And so we represent benzene.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.300
The primitive structure for
benzene is three ethylenes.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.280
And benzene is 2 beta better.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.270
ROBERT FIELD: That's the
resonant stabilization.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.910
That's a great thing.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.110
OK.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:48:02.760
So we get a resonant
stabilization.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:09.250
And now, the more subtle
and wonderful stuff

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:16.550
is, we have these eigenvectors.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:18.120
And we have the energies.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.370
And we can do stuff with them.

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:20.930
And one thing is bond order.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:29.410
And so we have a formula.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:37.925
The bond order between atoms
i and j is equal to the sum

00:48:37.925 --> 00:48:50.160
for mu equals 1, including only
the occupied orbitals, of c i

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.650
mu c j mu.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:56.320
So we have the new
molecular orbitals,

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.040
and we have the adjacent atoms.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.900
And this gives you
the bond order.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.180
And so we can calculate
the bond order.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:09.340
And we find that every
bond is a pi bond

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:20.510
order of 2/3, which is neat,
because the non-resonant

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:24.050
structure says,
three of the bonds

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:31.900
have a pi bond order of 0,
and 3 have a bond order of 1.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.340
And so the average is 1/2.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:40.477
And this is bigger than 1/2.

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:41.185
And it's uniform.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.900
So you can do this,
and you can say, OK.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.250
The 1, 2 bond order--

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.580
the 2, 3 bond order-- you do
the laborious calculation--

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.360
always get 2/3.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:07.890
Now, you could also calculate
the charge on atom i.

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:13.800
And that is, again, mu
for the occupied orbitals.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:20.580
And that would be c i mu c i mu.

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.610
And so for benzene,
you would expect

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:24.780
this to come out to be 0.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.680
And it does.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.095
So there is no charge.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.740
Let me just make
sure that that--

00:50:43.921 --> 00:50:47.640
Well, there is an equal
charge on each atom,

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:53.080
whether it's 0 or 1/6.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.600
That I haven't done.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.225
And I am a little
uncertain about what this

00:50:57.225 --> 00:50:58.350
is going to come out to be.

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:03.250
But they're going to be equal
on every atom in benzene.

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:10.770
And so now, suppose, instead
of benzene, you have amylin.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.630
Well, you can do stuff.

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:17.840
And you could say, well,
the amylin out here

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.290
is going to affect the
alpha value here a lot,

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:23.840
and here less and less.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.260
And then you do the calculation.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.880
And you find when you
do this calculation,

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.710
you get unequal charges.

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:36.950
And you get the normal
rules for ortho versus meta.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.170
And everything is great.

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.530
And you also, when
you do this, you

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.240
can actually write
resonance structures

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.250
and you could
calculate, well, what

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.260
is the energy of that
resonance structure--

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.010
in a Huckel-like theory.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:58.640
So there are lots of things
you can do in order to say, OK.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.760
We do Huckel theory to
get this 0 in our picture.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.120
And then-- I'm way over time.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.460
And then we can add
special effects,

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.600
and we know how to
parameterize them.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.750
And if we're close
to being OK, we'll

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:17.140
get results that
correspond to experiment.

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:21.300
And this is so much
better than you deserve,

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.430
because it's all garbage.

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:26.510
But it's
empirically-calibrated garbage.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:30.950
And it it's calibrated over an
enormous number of molecules

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:33.850
and a huge amount of experience.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.360
And that's good.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.860
That's what we do.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.730
OK.

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:42.230
So I'll see you on Friday
with some perturbation theory.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.570
One of my favorite
problems, too.

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.120
OK.

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:29.570
PROFESSOR: Are we ready?

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.560
So good afternoon.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.260
Just a reminder, this week we
see each other three times--

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.080
today on Wednesday and
Friday in this other lecture

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.680
hall for our mid-term exam.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.740
Today we will finish
the big chapter

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.939
on light-atom interaction.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.730
But we're not getting
rid of it, because we

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.290
will be transitioning
to an important aspect

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.800
of light-atom interaction.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.490
And these are line shifts
and line broadening.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.910
So today we start the next big
chapter-- line shifts and line

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.880
broadening.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.980
But before I do that, we have to
finish light-atom interaction.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.750
And I want to come back
to the rotating wave

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.190
approximation revisited.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.490
So I'll revisit the revisit
of the rotating wave

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.810
approximation.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.650
And sometimes when
I have discussions

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.850
with students after
class, I realize

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.220
that something which I
sort of casually mentioned

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.811
is either confusing or
interesting for you.

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.310
And there are two
aspects I actually

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.040
want to come back here.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.640
So several people
reacted to that,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.260
but some felt it was maybe a
little bit too complicated.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.440
Or others asked me
about some details.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.150
So let me come back
to two aspects.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.220
And I hope you find
them interesting.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.300
One is when we sorted
out all those terms,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.200
those [? need two ?] angular
momentum selection rules.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.470
But I made sort of the
innocent comment-- well,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.560
if you have omega minus omega
in a time-dependent Hamiltonian,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.950
one term is responsible
for absorption,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.460
one is for emission.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.110
And when more than one
person asked me about it,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.810
I think many more than
one person in class

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.220
would like to know
more about it.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.530
So therefore, let me spend the
first few minutes in explaining

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.210
why is a time-dependent
term in the Hamiltonian

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.660
with plus or minus
omega, why is one of them

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.890
responsible for
absorption, and one

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.680
is responsible for emission?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.170
Well, we have
Schrodinger's equation,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.810
which says that the change
of the amplitude in state one

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.890
has a term.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.100
And if it started out with
population in state two--

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.460
let's say perturbation theory,
we start in state two--

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.270
then it is the only term where
the differential equation,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.280
through an off-diagonal
matrix element

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.790
puts amplitude from
state two into state one.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.550
So what I'm writing down here
is just Schrodinger's equation.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.550
And the operator V
is the drive field

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.790
connecting state
two to state one.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.870
And so if I just
integrate this equation

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.000
for a short time between
time t and t plus delta t,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.400
and I'm asking, did we
change the population

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.270
of state one, which is
now our final state?

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:38.390
Well, then you integrate over
that for time interval delta t.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.930
But now comes the point
that the initial state has,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.570
in its time-dependent
wave function,

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.600
a vector which is e to
the minus i omega 2 t.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.140
The final state,
which I called one,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.840
has-- because it's a complex
conjugate-- plus omega 1 t.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.380
And let's just
assume we have here

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.562
the proportionality
to e to the i omega t.

00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:11.020
And let me just say omega can
now be positive and negative.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.746
It will be part of
the answer whether it

00:04:12.746 --> 00:04:14.550
should be positive or negative.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.910
Well, this integral here becomes
an integral of e to the i,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.990
omega 1 minus omega 2 plus
omega t integrated with time.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.770
And this is an
oscillating function,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.360
where if you integrated
with over time,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:48.320
it will average to
zero unless omega

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.350
is equal or at least
close to the frequency

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.560
difference between
initial and excited state.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.540
So actually, what
you encounter here

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.520
is-- well, what I've derived
for you here is actually,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.380
you can say energy conservation.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.180
I didn't assume it.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.480
It is built into the time
evolution of the Schrodinger

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.890
equation, that you can
only go from state one

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.290
to state two or state two to one
if the drive term has a Fourier

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.110
component omega, which
makes up for the difference.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.030
Or I'm using different
language now.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.210
If, through the drive
term, you provide photons,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.260
you provide quanta of
energy, where omega fulfills

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.760
the equation for
energy conservation.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.630
And you also see from this
result, when omega 1 is higher

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.330
than omega 2, omega
has to be negative.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.360
When the reverse is true,
omega has to be positive.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.530
So that's why I said,
the e to the plus

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.350
i omega t term is
responsible for absorption.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.175
The e to the minus
i omega t term

00:05:56.175 --> 00:06:03.610
is responsible for
stimulated emission.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.380
You also see, of
course-- but I stop here,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.400
because I think you've
heard it often enough.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.220
If you integrate over
short time delta t,

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.420
this equation has
to be fulfilled

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.490
only to within 1 over delta t.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.120
This is sort of the
energy-time uncertainty.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.120
For short times,
the photon energy

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.720
does not need to match
exactly the energy difference.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.480
And you also realize
when we think

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.950
about omega is
close to resonance,

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.840
then e to the i omega
t does absorption.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.510
But if you're in
the ground state,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.947
e to the minus i
omega t, leads now

00:06:43.947 --> 00:06:46.440
to a very rapid
oscillation here,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.930
which is close to [? 2 ?]
omega oscillation.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.240
And we've discussed that in the
context of the AC stark shift,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.650
that this gives rise to
the [? proxy ?] shift.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:01.690
We've also discussed that this
term is rapidly oscillating

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.442
and it's nothing else than the
counter-rotating term which

00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:07.400
we usually neglect when
we do the rotating wave

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.740
approximation.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.140
So everything we've
discussed in this context--

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.130
counter-rotating term, energy
conservation, Heisenberg's

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.210
uncertainty,
time-energy uncertainty

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.520
actually comes from
this kind of formalism.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.115
Any question?

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:33.010
Of course, if you quantize
the electromagnetic field,

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.890
then you don't have a drive
term with e to the i omega t.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.050
You just have a and a
[? degas ?] for the photons.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.675
And the question, which
term absorbs a photon

00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:45.640
or creates a photon,
does not exist.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.239
Because you know it whether
it's a or a [? dega. ?] But

00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:49.780
you have the two
choices, whether you

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.120
want to use a fully quantized
field with photon operators

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.890
or whether you want to use
the time-dependent formalism,

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.119
using a semi-classical
or classical field

00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:00.285
in the Schrodinger equation.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:10.160
The second comment
I wanted to do

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.840
is using the
semi-classical picture,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.750
I was sort of going with you
through some examples when

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.120
the rotating wave approximation
is necessary, when not.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.410
When do you have
counter-rotating terms.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.780
And yes, everything I
told you is, I think,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.211
is the best possible way
how you can-- I assume,

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.710
because I haven't found a better
one-- the best possible way

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.360
to present it and
explain it to using

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.030
the time-dependent
electromagnetic field.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.190
But I realized
after class that it

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.930
may be useful to
quickly state what

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:52.990
I have said in using
the photon picture.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:09:00.360
If we have circular
polarization,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.200
we have, for given frequency,
annihilation and creation

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.300
operator.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.970
But let's assume that the
mode we are considering

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.620
is right-handed
circularly polarized,

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.350
so the operator creates a
photon at frequency omega

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.910
with this right-handed
circular polarization.

00:09:27.665 --> 00:09:34.880
So that means now if
we start from a level m

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.900
and we have now
light-atom interaction,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:46.620
the operator which
annihilates a photon

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.080
with circular polarization
because of angular momentum

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.410
conservation can only
take us to a level

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.750
where the magnetic quantum
number is n plus 1.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.700
Well, the operator A
[? dega ?] creates a photon

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.760
through stimulated emission.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.515
And so this is now
our two-level system.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.050
And now we should ask the
question, in terms of rotating

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.480
wave approximation,
is necessary or not,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.410
are there
counter-rotating terms?

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.300
Well, the counter-rotating terms
are the non-intuitive terms,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.970
where you start out
in the lowest state.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.060
But now instead of absorbing
a photon, you emit a photon.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:47.410
And the operator for
emission is this one.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.465
So I can now ask, is
there another term?

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.230
Why don't we stick to the
blue color for the photons?

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:03.810
That there is a term which
is driven by the operator

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.800
A [? dega ?]
circularly polarized.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.570
Well, the answer is,
there may be such a term,

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.000
but the state we need has
now a magnetic quantum

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.920
number of m minus 1 because
of angular momentum selection

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.780
rules.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:29.220
So this here is the
counter-rotating term,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.440
which you may or may not
neglect, depending whether you

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.710
want to make the rotating
wave approximation or not.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.270
So therefore, if you got
a little bit confused

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.330
about the different
cases I considered

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:46.440
at the end of the
last lecture, then

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.520
you may just summarize the
many examples I gave you

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.770
in the lecture just
as a note which

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.740
you should keep in
the back of your head,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.820
namely-- let me first
phrase it in words

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.910
and then write it down.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.580
If you have circular
polarization and angular

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.260
momentum selection rules,
then the counter-rotating term

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.320
may require a third level and is
not part of two-level physics.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.560
So if you have a situation where
the third level does not exist,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.030
you do not have a
counter-rotating term.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.480
However, in all situations
I've encountered in the lab,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.015
this third level does exist.

00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:26.180
OK.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.360
So let me just write that
down-- counter-rotating term

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:49.530
for circularly
polarized radiation

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:58.900
requires a third level
which may not exist.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.420
And then you don't
have this term.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.550
But it does exist in most cases.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.510
Anyway, just an additional
clarification for the topics

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.980
we had on Wednesday.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.411
Any questions about that?

00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:20.910
Yes.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.210
STUDENT: Are there cases other
than a spin-1/2 system where it

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.360
doesn't exist?

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.020
PROFESSOR: Well, I mentioned
the example last class--

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.700
if you do spectroscopy
of an S2P transition

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.090
in the magnetic field
of a neutron star.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.250
Then the same one
splitting is so huge

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.867
that, well, you can assume that
this has been shifted so far

00:13:43.867 --> 00:13:45.700
away that it has been
completely suppressed.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.580
Other than that, well, we
have the trivial situation

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.190
which we discussed in NMR.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.040
If you simply have
spin one half,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.670
then the total number
of levels is only two,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.290
because we're talking about
spin up and spin down.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.320
Or I constructed,
in the last class,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.050
the forbidden transition, a
doublet S to doublet S state.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.790
So that's two pairs
of S equals one half.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.530
And then we are
missing this state

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.880
to couple any counter-rotating
term into the system.

00:14:23.636 --> 00:14:24.135
OK.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.380
The next subject is saturation.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.290
Now, in this chapter,
I want to talk

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.080
about saturation in general.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.740
I want to discuss monochromatic
light but also broadband light.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.810
And I want to introduce
concepts of saturation intensity

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.080
of absorption cross section,
certain things which

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.432
I find extremely useful if I
want to understand what happens

00:15:08.432 --> 00:15:09.890
when light interacts
with a system.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.420
Just sort of to
whet your appetite,

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.890
I will sort of show you
that the absorption cross

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.270
section of a two-level
system is independent

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.920
whether you have a strong
or weak transition.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.170
Some people think the
cross section should be--

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.670
but there is a
difference which is

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.240
important between monochromatic
and broadband light.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.340
But in the end, the
concepts are very simple.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.300
I should say, sometimes
I feel it's almost too

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.762
simple to present it in class.

00:15:39.762 --> 00:15:41.470
On the other hand, if
I don't present it,

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.770
I can't make a few comments
and guide you through.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.710
So my conclusion
now is, at least

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.050
for now, I show you
some prepared slides,

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.240
and I sort of step you through,
and make a few annotations,

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.470
and point out certain things.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.690
We have already
partially transitioned

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.730
to teach you this material
through homework assignment.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.570
This week's homework assignment,
which is due on Wednesday,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.400
is almost completely
on saturation.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.930
And I will make a few comments
where what I present you today

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.999
is an extension or different
from what you're learning

00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:16.290
in the homework and vice versa.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.370
Yes.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.100
If I wanted to present
you saturation,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.560
power broadening, and all
that in the purest form,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.020
I would just preset you with
the Optical Bloch equations.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.180
We can solve them.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.650
And then we have everything
we want-- a result which

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.450
explains saturation
and a result which

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.740
explains power broadening.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.760
And you do some of
it in your homework.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.410
However, what I
want to show here

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.430
is that saturation is
actually a general feature

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.920
of a two-level system if you
have sort of three rates, which

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.480
I will explain to you in
a moment-- very similar

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.350
to Einstein's A
and B coefficient--

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.030
that all such systems
have saturation.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.339
And then you may immediately
solve the Optical Bloch

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.500
creation for
monochromatic radiation.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.430
But for broadband
radiation, we usually

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.900
don't use the Optical
Bloch equations,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.369
because for infinitely
broad light,

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:20.920
there is no coherence
for which we

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.589
need Optical Bloch equations.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.859
If you only have the
Optical Bloch equations,

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.216
you have solved for saturation
in one limiting case,

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.215
and you don't see that
the concept of saturation

00:17:32.215 --> 00:17:34.400
is much broader.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:40.270
So therefore, let us assume
that we have a two-level system.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:46.140
And we have the
couple two levels

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.040
with a rate--
which you can think

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.060
of the rate of absorption, the
rate of stimulated emission.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.310
And I call the rate
the unsaturated rate.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.080
In addition, there
is some dissipation,

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.710
some spontaneous decay
described by gamma.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.000
So Ru is the unsaturated
rate for absorption

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and for stimulated emission.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:24.110
Of course, you know even before
you solve those equations

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.830
that there must be some
saturation built in.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.970
If you would look at
the fraction of atoms

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:36.440
in the excited state and
you change the laser power,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:43.240
which means changing
the unsaturated rate,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.140
things cannot shoot up forever,
because you cannot put more

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.980
than 100% of the population
into the excited state.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.810
However, the effect that when
we increase the laser power,

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.810
we do upwards absorption
and downward stimulation--

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.710
means you won't even get 100%.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.470
The maximum you can get is 50%.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.140
And what I'm just
drawing for you is

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.916
this is a phenomenon
of saturation,

00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:10.665
and now we want to
understand the details.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:25.720
So using this rate
equation, we are

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.930
defining-- this is now a
definition-- the saturated rate

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:36.410
is the net transfer from A to B.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.090
Because we have an absorption
and stimulated emission,

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.070
the net transfer is the
[? unsaturated ?] rate

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.080
times the population difference.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.420
And this is our saturated rate.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.200
But of course, we normalize
everything for atom.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.590
So therefore, our saturated
rate has a rate coefficient S

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.830
times the total number of
atoms, or the total population

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.710
in both states.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.460
Eventually, we are
interested in steady state.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.890
We can immediately
solve the rate equation

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.460
in terms of steady state,
which is done there.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.450
And we find that for
those, we can now

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:20.040
eliminate one of the
states from the equation,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.320
because we have the
steady state ratio.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.190
And then we find that
the saturated rate

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.070
is gamma over 2 times
an expression which

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.390
involves a saturation parameter.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.270
So in other words, it's just
almost trivial solutions

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.780
of very simple equations,
which describe the saturation

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.005
phenomenon I outlined
for you at the beginning.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.830
This solution has the
two limiting cases

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:55.080
which we want to see-- that at
a very low unsaturated rate,

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.580
the saturated rate is the
unsaturated rate because there

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.990
is no saturation.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.390
And secondly, if we would
go to infinite power,

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.780
the saturated rate
becomes gamma over 2,

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.620
because we have equalized
the population between ground

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.850
and excited state.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.820
One half of the atoms
are in the excited state,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.340
and they dissipate or scatter
light with the rate gamma.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.150
All right.

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:30.895
Any questions?

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.530
We now want to specialize it
to a situation which we often

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.360
encounter, namely
monochromatic radiation.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.120
And for monochromatic
radiation, the unsaturated rate

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.510
follows-- well, I factored
out something here.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:59.334
But it follows the
normalized line shape,

00:21:59.334 --> 00:22:00.250
which is a Lorentzian.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.170
And therefore, our
unsaturated rate

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.530
is proportion to
the laser power.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.410
But I usually like to express
the laser power through a Rabi

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.660
frequency or the Rabi
frequency squared.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.685
So our unsaturated rate
follows this Lorentzian.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:28.980
And on resonance,
this part is one.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.100
Our rate is omega Rabi
squared over comma.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.300
And the definition for the
saturation parameter of one,

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.440
or for the saturation intensity
is that the unsaturated rate

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.110
has to be gamma over 2.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.550
So therefore, by
omega Rabi squared

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.830
over gamma is the
unsaturated rate,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.720
it should be gamma
over 2 for saturation,

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.830
for saturation parameter of one.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.040
So therefore, our saturation
pentameter resonance

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.850
is given by this expression.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:06.880
And if you use the
previous result

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.450
and apply it to this
unsaturated rate,

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:16.270
we find a saturated
rate which shows now

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.200
the new phenomenon
of power broadening.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:26.530
Let me illustrate
it in two ways.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.000
The saturated rate involves
a saturation parameter,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.030
and the unsaturated
rate is a Lorentzian.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.230
But this Lorentzian appears
now in the numerator

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.350
and the denominator.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.370
So it appears twice.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.900
But with a one-step
manipulation,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.740
you can transform it
into a single Lorentzian.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.160
But this single Lorentzian
is now power-broadened.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.735
It no longer has
[? width ?] of gamma

00:23:55.735 --> 00:23:58.160
over-- of the natural
line with gamma.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.028
It has an additional term,
and this is power broadening.

00:24:02.028 --> 00:24:02.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:06.310
PROFESSOR: No.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.620
It's still-- the resonance
is at [? 0 ?] [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.350
The equations are trivial.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.750
It's really just
substituting one

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.970
and getting from an
expression, simplifying it

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.650
to simple Lorentzian.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.260
I just want to
emphasize the result.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.640
If you drive a
transition, we have

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:44.290
now-- the [? width ?] of the
Lorentzian is now gamma over 2

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.940
if we have no saturation.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.610
But then if we crank up
the saturation parameter,

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.246
the [? width ?] increases with
a square root of the power.

00:24:51.246 --> 00:24:52.370
That's an important result.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.420
The square root of the
power leads to broadening.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.170
Now let me give you a
pictorial description

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.490
of what we have done here.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:09.410
If we start with the Lorentzian
and we increase the power,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.470
you sort of want to drive
the system with the stronger

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.950
Lorentzian.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.460
But we know we have a
ceiling, which is saturation.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.080
And of course, when
you drive it stronger,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.640
you reach the
ceiling on resonance

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.720
earlier than you reach the
ceiling when you transfer it

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.630
away from resonance.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.790
So therefore, if you
start with the red curve,

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.732
crank up the power,
you will get more

00:25:34.732 --> 00:25:37.830
of a factor, more of
a result in the wings

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.420
because you are not
yet saturated there.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.540
And this graphical construction,
which I have just sort of

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:49.160
indicated to you, lead now to
a curve which is broadened,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.980
broader than the
original Lorentzian.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.190
And this is the reason
behind power broadening.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.130
I want to mention
one thing here.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.570
For the classroom
discussion, I have

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:09.100
assumed that the light-atom
interaction can be described

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.090
by Fermi's golden rule, which
we know is a limitation.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.080
When the system is,
in effect, incoherent

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.750
or no longer coherent,
we had a long discussion

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.820
about Rabi oscillation,
Fermi's golden rule

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.420
in the last two weeks.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.590
But what I'm doing is
mathematically correct.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.800
The Optical Bloch
equation, which

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.160
you'll use in your
homework assignment,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.450
will include the transition
from Rabi oscillation

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.822
towards Fermi's golden rule.

00:26:43.822 --> 00:26:46.030
And I'm just considering
this [? fundamental ?] case.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.740
OK.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.750
I've talked about
saturation of a transition.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.880
I've mentioned that we
have defined the saturation

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.440
parameter such that when we have
saturation parameter of one,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.440
we sort of get into
the non-linear regime

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.110
where saturation happens.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.230
And of course, for
an experimentalist,

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.930
the next question is, at what
intensity does that happen?

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.420
This is summarized
in those equations.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.250
It's as simple as
possible algebra.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.080
You just combine two equations.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.940
I don't want to do it here.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.150
And we have a result for the
saturation intensity, which

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.870
has two features, which
I want to point out.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:43.620
One is [? its case ?]
with omega cube.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.470
So the higher the frequency
of your transition is,

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.030
the harder it is to saturate.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.040
Of course, it has something
to do with that in saturation,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.130
you have an
unsaturated rate, which

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.420
is one half of the
spontaneous emission rate.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.640
And you remember that the
spontaneous emission rate

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.080
was proportional to omega cube.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.230
So that's why we have,
again, the omega cube factor.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:25.571
And in addition, the larger--
actually, it depends.

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:26.070
Sorry.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.778
I made a mistake.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:41.120
Well, you can write the
results in several ways.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.420
If you have an intensity
and you go back to photons,

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.970
you get factors of omega.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:50.660
So when I said omega cubed comes
from the natural line widths,

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.590
yes, it does, but it's
not the only omega factor.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.810
You can write the
result actually

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.690
that you have a gamma
squared dependence,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.370
because one gamma comes from
the matrix element squared

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.240
and one comes because you need
to compete in your excitation

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.540
with spontaneous emission.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.760
So anyway, this is
sort of the result.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.820
And you can calculate it
for your favorite atom.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.400
And for alkaline
atoms, we usually find

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.620
that the saturation
intensity is a few milliwatt

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:37.250
per square centimeter

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:42.410
Well, we can now repeat
some of this exercise

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.690
for the broadband case.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:48.910
In the broadband case,
the unsaturated rate,

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.980
which is the rate for absorption
in stimulated emission,

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.070
following Einstein's treatment
of the AB coefficient

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.060
is used by using
Einstein's B coefficient

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.200
times the spectral intensity.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.630
And now we want the same
situation as before.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.440
We want to reach saturation.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.960
And saturation happens when
this is comparable with gamma.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.600
And it's purely a
definition that we

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.160
say it should be gamma over 2.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.620
But we are consistent
with what we did before.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.870
And if you just
take this equation

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.550
and calculate what the
saturation intensity is,

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:29.770
well, gamma is nothing else
than the Einstein A coefficient.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.420
Here we have the
Einstein B coefficient.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.300
And if we take the ratio
between the Einstein A and B

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.240
coefficient, the matrix
element, everything

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.810
which is specific to
the atom, cancels out.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.710
And the saturation intensity,
or the spectral density--

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.870
it's the spectral density
now for broadband--

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:52.430
only depends on speed of light
and the transition frequency

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.980
cube.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.120
And it doesn't make a
difference whether you

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.370
have a two-level system which
has a strong matrix element

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.380
or weak matrix element.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.510
I could explain it to
you now at this point,

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.530
but we want to hold
the idea that there

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.330
is a difference
between single mode

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.310
monochromatic and
broadband excitation

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.545
until I have discussed
one more concept.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.980
And this is the cross section.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.660
Just to check, are
there any questions?

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.707
Yes, Nancy.

00:31:30.707 --> 00:31:32.695
AUDIENCE: So in
the broadband case,

00:31:32.695 --> 00:31:34.683
the line shift
doesn't matter at all?

00:31:34.683 --> 00:31:36.174
Because in the
monochromatic case,

00:31:36.174 --> 00:31:38.162
we had a line shift [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.110
Well, hold your question.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.160
The line shape matters.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.860
I will now discuss what is
the line shape of the atom.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.630
And the quick answer is, if
the atom has a line shape,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.670
we have to take the
atomic line shape

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:59.230
and do a convolution with
the line of the radiation.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.620
And we have the two
situations where in one case,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.850
the monochromatic
light is narrower

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.480
than the line
shape of the atoms.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.270
In the other case, it's broader.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.680
And this difference,
in the end, will

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.430
be responsible for the
effect that the line widths

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:16.600
of the atom, which is
the natural line widths,

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.210
will cancel out in one
case and not in the other.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.204
But that's actually the result
of the next five minutes.

00:32:23.204 --> 00:32:23.870
Other questions?

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:32.250
I know this topic
can get confusing,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.599
because we go from one
definition to the next.

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:35.640
So let me just summarize.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.230
What I've said so far is
we [? derive ?] an atom.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.180
We have absorption, we
have stimulated emission.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:46.620
And we want to understand
the phenomenon of saturation.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.360
And based on the effect how
we define saturation, namely

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.910
that the unsaturated
rate is gamma over 2,

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.410
we got some nice results
for the saturation intensity

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:59.410
and for power broadening
of a Lorentzian.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:04.250
So it's pretty much having a
definition and running with it.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:11.150
And now we want to
express the same physics

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.470
by using the concept
of a cross section

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.980
for the following reason.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.960
You can do physics, you
can do atomic physics

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.049
without ever thinking
about a cross section.

00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:26.590
You can just say, I have a laser
beam of a certain intensity,

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.900
and I scatter light.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.970
But often, when we
scatter something--

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.910
and you may be familiar,
from atomic collisions--

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.700
you often want to write
the scattering rate

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.800
as a density times cross
section times relative velocity.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.150
And this sort of has
this intuitive feeling.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.400
If you have a stream of
particles in your accelerator

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.060
or a stream of photons
in your laser beam,

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.400
you can now hold
onto the picture

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.620
that each atom in your
target is a little disk.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.970
If the particle of photons hits
the disk, something happens.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.790
If it misses the
disk, nothing happens.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.199
And the area of the disk
is this cross section.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.469
So in other words, we
want to now understand

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:15.060
how big is the disk of the
atom which will, so to speak,

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.719
cast the shadow, which is
synonymous with absorption,

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.389
when we illuminate those
atoms with laser light.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:25.980
So for me, a very
intuitive quantity.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:32.030
Anyway, so all we do
is we have already

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.850
discussed the rate
of excitation,

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:39.110
which is now the
unsaturated rate.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.570
But now we express
the unsaturated rate

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:47.280
by the density of photons
times the cross section.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.860
And the relative velocity
is the speed of light.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:58.160
And from this equation, we
find-- because everything

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.390
is known, we have talked about
that on the last few pages--

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:07.600
we find that the cross section
is-- and this is the result.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.560
6 pi lambda bar square.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.740
Lambda bar is the wavelengths
of light divided by 2 pi.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:21.150
So we find that for
monochromatic radiation,

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:25.430
the cross sectional
of a two-level system

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.130
is independent of the
strength of the transition,

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.170
independent of the
matrix element.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.540
It just depends on the
resonant wavelengths.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.610
Now you would say,
well, but what is now

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:47.700
the difference between a
strong and a weak transition?

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.750
And this is shown here.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:54.490
If you take your monochromatic
laser and you scan it,

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.020
you scan it through
the cross section.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:03.980
When you are on resonance, you
have 6 pi lambda bar square.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.960
And the difference between
a narrow transition

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.270
with a small Einstein
A coefficient

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.400
and a strong transition with
a large Einstein A coefficient

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.090
simply means that in
one case, it's narrower.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.350
In the other case, it's wider.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:34.310
We talked about the
phenomenon of saturation.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:38.870
6 pi lambda bar squared
is the cross section

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:43.950
in the perturbative limit, or
the unsaturated cross section.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:46.680
Of course, if you
increase the laser power,

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.320
you saturation the transition.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.170
The atom will have a smaller
and smaller cross section.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:57.680
Actually, that's something
important you should consider.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.080
When you have an atom and
you increase the laser power,

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.470
you scatter light.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:06.770
And the scattered light, or
the absorbed light, saturates.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.700
But with the cross
section, we want

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.060
to know what fraction of the
laser light is scattered.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.680
And the fraction of the
laser light scattered

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.060
goes to zero, because
you make your laser

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.610
light stronger and stronger.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.780
And the total amount of laser
light which is scattered

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.340
saturates.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.530
So in other words,
you have a saturation

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:27.600
of the scattered light.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.200
You have a saturation of
the net transfer of atoms

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.130
through the excited state in the
limit of infinite laser power.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.500
But since the cross section is
sort of normalized by the laser

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.490
power, the cross section has
this dependence, 1 over 1

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:46.440
plus saturation
parameter, and goes to 0.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.490
And that means--
and this is sort

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.210
of the language we use-- that
the transition bleaches out.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.300
If you saturation
the transition,

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.120
the cross section
becomes smaller.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.980
So when you saturation the
transition in an absorption

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.490
imaging experiment,
which many of you do,

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.970
the shadow is less
and less black

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:11.940
exactly because the cross
section is bleaching out.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.660
But the amount of
light you would scatter

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.450
you would observe
in fluorescence

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.510
is not getting
less, it saturates.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.960
This is sort of just the
two flip sides of the coin.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.045
If anybody is confused,
please ask a question.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:29.920
OK.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:37.100
So now in this picture,
we can immediately

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.170
understand why we
have differences

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:45.190
between monochromatic radiation
and broadband radiation.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.920
If you want to
saturation a transition

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:54.650
with monochromatic radiation,
we have our narrow laser.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:58.790
We absorb with a cross section
6 pi lambda bar square.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:02.280
And we have to increase
the intensity of the laser

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:07.534
until the excitation
rate equals gamma over 2.

00:39:07.534 --> 00:39:09.075
That's our definition
for saturation.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.730
So therefore, the
laser intensity

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.610
is proportional to
gamma, because we

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.760
have the cross
section is constant,

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.560
but the product of cross
section and laser intensity

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.210
has to be equal to gamma over 2.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:32.445
However, now consider
the case that you

00:39:32.445 --> 00:39:34.450
use broadband radiation.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.200
The spectrum is
completely broad.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.830
Now, if an atom has a
stronger transition,

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:44.880
its cross section is
wider, and the atom

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.480
can sort of absorb a wider
part of the incident spectrum.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.530
So therefore, if the atom
has a stronger transition,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:59.530
it automatically takes, absorbs
more of your spectral profile.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:05.130
And therefore, the
result for the saturation

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.760
and for the spectral
saturation intensity

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.230
is independent of
the matrix element

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.730
and the strengths
of the transition.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.020
In general, if
you're not in either

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.240
of the extreme cases
of monochromatic light

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.220
or broadband light,
what you have to do

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.750
is you have to use
this cross section

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.300
as a function of
frequency, and convolve it

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.640
to a convolution with a
spectrum of the incident light.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:43.200
And this is exactly done here.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.920
You take your
frequency-dependent cross

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.890
section.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:52.110
You do the convolution with the
spectrum of the incident light.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:58.890
And if you assume the incident
light is spectrally very broad,

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:08.110
you simply integrate over
the Lorentzian line shape

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.940
of the cross section.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.750
And then you find
exactly the same result

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:17.230
as we had two slides ago,
that the saturation intensity

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:20.040
is independent of the
strengths of the transition.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:25.640
OK.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:36.490
Can you think of a
very intuitive argument

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:45.320
why for spectrally
broad radiation,

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.500
all the properties of
the atoms cancel out?

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:02.540
If you think about one physical
example for, let's say,

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.910
black body radiation--
this is spectrally broad.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.390
So you have an atom in
a black body cavity.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:11.535
And the atom experiences
a very broad spectrum.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:20.130
For what number of photons,
black body photons per mode

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.960
would we find saturation?

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.190
Think about it.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.370
It's a simple criterion you
can formulate for black body

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.860
radiation to saturation
your transition in terms

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:36.832
of the number of
photons per mode.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:05.000
You crank up the
temperature in your cavity.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.240
How high do you have to
go with the temperature

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:14.140
in order to saturate an atom
which is inside your black body

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:14.640
cavity?

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.596
AUDIENCE: One photon.

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:24.010
PROFESSOR: Pretty close.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.626
AUDIENCE: 1 over
[? degenerates. ?]

00:43:25.626 --> 00:43:27.170
PROFESSOR:
[? Degenerates. ?] OK.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.430
No [? degenerates. ?] I
hate [? degenerates. ?]

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.070
That's your private homework
to put in [? degenerates ?]

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:32.569
afterwards.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.100
The answer I came was
n equals 1/2, I think.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.465
I run the risk that I'm
off by a factor of 2 now.

00:43:49.465 --> 00:43:50.590
But the argument was that--

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:55.739
AUDIENCE: The rate equals
[? degeneracy ?] by n by gamma.

00:43:55.739 --> 00:43:58.650
So if the rate equals
gamma over 1/2,

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:02.400
that mean that [? degenerates ?]
by n equals 1/2.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.770
And if [? degenerates ?]
equals 1, n equals 1/2.

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:09.445
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:44:09.445 --> 00:44:10.090
OK.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.610
So spontaneous emission, we
know that spontaneous emission--

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.510
from our derivation of
spontaneous emission--

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.420
corresponds to one
photon per mode.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.910
And our criterion now is that we
want to have an absorption rate

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:34.070
or stimulated rate
which is gamma over 2.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.640
So we get sort of 1/2 the effect
of spontaneous emission when

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.010
we have 1/2 a photon per mode.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:51.200
So therefore, spontaneous
emission absorption

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.560
is proportional to n.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.740
And I think if n
equals 1/2, then

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:05.330
we have the unsaturated
rates equal to gamma over 2.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:07.430
So this is a very
physical argument.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:11.570
When we put an atom into
a black body cavity,

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.870
and we have 1/2 a photon
per mode occupation number,

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.440
then we saturate
any atom we put in.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:23.970
Because using Einstein's
argument, we have now the rate

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.730
coefficient for
absorption emission

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.660
for stimulated emission
and absorption is just 1/2

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.865
of the rate coefficient
for spontaneous emission.

00:45:31.865 --> 00:45:34.320
And that explains that
all atomic properties

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.150
have to cancel out.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:44.040
So now question for you.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:50.170
We talked about the fact that if
you have hyperfine transitions,

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.980
that it would take--
what was the value?

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.795
1,000 years for
spontaneous emission?

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:01.370
So that we can completely
neglect spontaneous emission.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:05.427
On the other hand, we've just
learned that saturation only

00:46:05.427 --> 00:46:06.760
comes from spontaneous emission.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.540
Without spontaneous emission,
we wouldn't have saturation.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.170
But now I'm telling you
that any atom should really

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:18.530
be saturated if we put
it in a black body cavity

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.660
where n bar is 1/2.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:29.030
So what is the story now if we
put an atom into a black body

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.890
cavity, and we are asking
about, will we saturate?

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.990
The hyperfine transition.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:40.640
Will we eventually
have-- saturation

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.780
means we have [BLOWS AIR], 1/4
of the atoms in the excited

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.310
state, 3/4 in the ground state.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:52.410
So the delta n has been reduced
from 1, which it was initially,

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.900
to 3/4 minus 1/4, which is 1/2.

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.460
What will happen?

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:01.610
I mean, this was almost like
a thermodynamic argument.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:06.910
Will we equilibrate and
saturate hyperfine transitions

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.535
in a black body cavity
based on this argument

00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:13.360
that for n bar equals
1/2, we should really

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.225
saturate everything?

00:47:20.312 --> 00:47:24.094
AUDIENCE: Yes, but it's
going to take a long time?

00:47:24.094 --> 00:47:24.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.960
So for those conditions,
if your black body cavity

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.040
was n bar equals 1/2, you should
saturate any two-level system

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.010
completely independent
what gamma is.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:38.490
And if the gamma is 10
nanoseconds or 10,000 years,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:40.460
you will saturate it.

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.560
The value of gamma
has completely

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.310
dropped out of the argument.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:48.320
But of course, if you want to
reach any kind of equilibrium,

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.140
it will take a time scale,
which is 1 over gamma.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:55.686
And then we are
back to 1,000 years.

00:47:55.686 --> 00:47:56.185
Questions?

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.600
All right.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:26.110
Then let's conclude this
chapter and start our discussion

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.135
about line shifts
and line broadening.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.050
I have a problem with
the tablet computer.

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:48.840
I draw a line, but the computer
draws a line somewhere else.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:55.540
So maybe I should just go
back to this one and then copy

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:56.070
things over.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:00.990
OK.

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.665
Our next big chapter is
line shifts and broadening.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.780
So the first question
is motivational.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.940
Why should we be interested
in line broadening?

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.010
Well, the answer
is almost trivial.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:28.010
No resonance is
infinitely narrow.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:31.290
Whenever we want to interpret
any result we obtain

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:34.055
spectroscopically, we are not
observing a delta function,

00:49:34.055 --> 00:49:35.450
we are not observing
a resonance,

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.420
we are observing a line shape.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.800
And unless we understand
the line shape,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.574
we may not accurately find
the resonance frequency.

00:49:43.574 --> 00:49:45.740
You could, of course, assume
that your line shape is

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:50.190
symmetric, which may be the
case but is not always the case.

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:54.300
So without understanding
line broadening,

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.500
you cannot interpret
spectroscopic information.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:06.545
And eventually, as I
mentioned in the first chapter

00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:11.460
of this course, the art
of analyzing line shapes

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:16.520
and finding the line center
is very well advanced.

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:29.650
When we have caesium
fountain clocks,

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:35.080
the accuracy how you operate the
clock as a frequency standard

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.280
is on the order
of one microhertz.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.500
But those fountain
clocks with you toss up

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.460
the atoms for one second
in the atomic fountain,

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.720
they fall up and down,
well, like a rock,

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.090
which takes about a second for a
rock to go up and down a meter.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:53.660
So therefore, the line width
is on the order of one Hertz.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:02.065
So therefore, people have to
understand any single aspect

00:51:02.065 --> 00:51:07.570
of the line shape at the
level of 10 to the minus 5,

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:10.005
or 10 to the minus 6 to
have this kind of accuracy.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.550
OK.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:35.290
So I thought I want to start
this unit by collecting form

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:46.050
you examples for phenomena which
cause broadening and shifting

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.780
of lines.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:52.530
And well, my list
has about 10 of them.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:54.260
Let's see how many you get.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:52:00.310
So what phenomena can lead
to line shifts and line

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:00.810
broadening?

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.220
AUDIENCE: Phonons.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.580
PROFESSOR: Phonons?

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:11.590
In terms of-- OK,
AC stark effect.

00:52:14.874 --> 00:52:15.374
Pardon?

00:52:15.374 --> 00:52:16.793
AUDIENCE: Magnetic field noise.

00:52:16.793 --> 00:52:19.610
PROFESSOR: Magnetic field noise.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:20.190
OK.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:26.830
I tried to-- yes, very good.

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:28.564
OK, yes.

00:52:28.564 --> 00:52:30.230
Let me just try to
group it a little bit

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.940
further, because I
want to discuss it.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:35.960
So we have external fields.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:43.730
And external fields can
have AC stark shifts.

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:51.680
If an external field is noisy,
we have noise fluctuations.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.890
All right.

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.450
Anything else?

00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:58.450
AUDIENCE: Doppler shift.

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:00.920
PROFESSOR: Doppler shift.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.420
Yes.

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:07.580
So we have the
velocity of the atoms.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.515
Doppler shift.

00:53:16.515 --> 00:53:17.425
AUDIENCE: Collisions.

00:53:17.425 --> 00:53:18.355
PROFESSOR: Collisions.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:26.830
Very good.

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.829
Well, we just talked
about one thing.

00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:45.745
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:45.745 --> 00:53:46.670
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:48.840
When we have external
fields, we can

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.070
have external fields
like magnetic fields

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:54.100
or electric fields which
cause shift and broadening.

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.160
And if there's noise,
additional shifts.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:01.400
But when we regard those
fields as drive fields,

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.960
they can do power broadening.

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:15.580
Maybe by collisions, I should
add the keyboard "pressure

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.600
broadening."

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.050
The higher the pressure
in your gas cell is,

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:24.660
the more collisions you have and
the more you have broadening.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:25.410
Other suggestion?

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.255
If you don't have
any of those effects,

00:54:36.255 --> 00:54:39.410
do you measure delta function?

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.870
What's the line width?

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:41.370
Will?

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:42.380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.630
STUDENT: Spontaneous emission.

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:44.788
PROFESSOR: Spontaneous emission.

00:54:44.788 --> 00:54:45.288
Yes.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:59.185
And if you don't have
spontaneous emission,

00:54:59.185 --> 00:55:01.040
do we then measure
delta function?

00:55:04.442 --> 00:55:05.900
STUDENT: There's
a Fourier limit.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.680
PROFESSOR: The Fourier limit.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.290
You can call it
observation time,

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:12.270
or time of light broadening.

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.020
If an atom flies
through your laser beam

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.910
and you can interrogate
it only for a finite time,

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:20.990
you have a broadening due
to the Fourier theorem.

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:37.830
And this can be called time of
flight broadening and time of--

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:44.035
or interaction time broadening.

00:55:53.254 --> 00:55:54.733
STUDENT: Rotations
and vibrations?

00:55:54.733 --> 00:55:58.260
PROFESSOR: Rotations
and vibrations.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:58.760
Not really.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.650
These are more-- then the
system has more energy levels,

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:03.550
and that's what you
want to find out.

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:06.599
So maybe I'm more asking,
how are those energy levels--

00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:08.140
how do they appear
spectroscopically?

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.610
Well, I think that's
pretty complete.

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:17.930
Two external fields.

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:20.260
If you want, you
can add gravity.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:24.750
There is a
gravitational red shift,

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.840
which is general relativity.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:34.810
But anyway, let me look over
that and try to categorize it.

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:41.440
What we had here actually all
comes from a finite observation

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:41.940
time.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:50.380
Either we do not have the atom
long enough in our laser beam,

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.620
and that sets a limit.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:55.260
Or if you are interested in an
excited state and the excited

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.200
state decays, then
the atoms themselves

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.500
have terminated our
interrogation time.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.110
The second class
here, velocity, I

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:10.370
would summarize that we
have motion of the atom.

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:16.590
It's a form of
motional broadening.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.810
We will actually discuss,
when we discuss motion, also

00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:29.160
the possibility of having
atoms in a harmonic oscillator

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.830
potential, ions in an ion trap.

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:35.600
So these are now
trapped particles.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:41.640
This will actually often give
rise to a splitting of the line

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.990
into side bends.

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:46.370
So we want to discuss that.

00:57:55.930 --> 00:58:00.975
I've already mentioned external
fields, conditional [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:00.975 --> 00:58:03.480
interrogation, power broadening.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.320
Some power broadening
will actually

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:12.700
result into a splitting of
line into [INAUDIBLE] triplet.

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.790
So power will not
only broaden the line,

00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:16.610
it can also split the line.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:19.820
And we want to discuss that.

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:32.015
And finally, we have the
effect of atomic interactions.

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:43.720
So for interactions, I think
we should add something

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:49.960
like mean field shifts,
which also goes sometimes

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.370
by the name of clock shift.

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:54.820
If you're not at zero
density, your transition

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:59.320
can be shifted by the
presence of other atoms.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:58:59.820
Will?

00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:02.280
STUDENT: Isn't collisional
broadening or pressure

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.248
broadening sort of
just an ensemble

00:59:04.248 --> 00:59:05.724
average of a stark effect?

00:59:05.724 --> 00:59:07.692
So that's sort of
an external field?

00:59:12.612 --> 00:59:15.040
PROFESSOR: That depends now.

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:20.170
Collisions is one of the richest
phenomena on the list here.

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:24.350
You're ahead of me.

00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:26.610
But in the next few minutes,
I wanted to actually

00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:32.320
see, well, maybe we should--
those categories are not

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.100
mutually exclusive, because
one part of collisions is.

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.830
An atom is in the excited
state, it collides,

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:40.370
it gets de-excited.

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:43.850
So then collisions
have no other effect

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:47.140
than sort of give us a
finite observation time,

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:51.027
where there is an effective
lifetime, which is just

00:59:51.027 --> 00:59:52.360
the time between two collisions.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.370
So it can be this.

00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:56.210
There's another
aspect of collisions,

00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:58.280
that every time
there is a collision,

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.800
an atom feels the electric
field of another atom.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:07.480
And then we have some form
of collisional broadening,

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:13.090
because we do some statistical
averaging over stark effects,

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:16.280
over level shifts.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:20.020
Now, there is a third
aspect of collisions,

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.120
which is maybe surprising
to many of you.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.900
And this is actually-- I
put it here under motion.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.118
It is collisional narrowing,
or [? diche ?] narrowing.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:45.110
There's one limiting case
when you have collisions,

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:48.605
that collisions lead to a
narrower line and not only

01:00:48.605 --> 01:00:50.334
to a broader line.

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:56.910
the reason is a little bit-- if
you put an atom in a buffer gas

01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:59.250
and it collides with
all the buffer gas atom,

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.450
it cannot fly away.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.090
So buffer gas and
collisions can sort of

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:10.280
help to increase your
observation time.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.370
But only if the other effects
of collisions are absent.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.600
So anyway, I thought
this is a number

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.200
of really interesting effects.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.530
And you already see from my
presentation and discussion

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:26.050
that it makes perfect sense to
discuss them not one by one,

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:28.050
as they appear in
other chapters,

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.880
but try to have comprehensive
discussions of those.

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:44.630
Let me talk about one
classification of those shifts

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:46.630
and broadening.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:02:01.580
And one is the distinction
between homogeneous

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:10.580
and inhomogeneous broadening.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:15.390
So the picture
here is that if you

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:19.210
have-- let me just give
you the cartoon picture.

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:27.710
If you have different atoms,
atom 1, atom 2, atom 3.

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.650
A homogeneous
broadening situation

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:34.020
is if the line
has been broadened

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.710
for each atom in the same way.

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:39.350
An inhomogeneous
broadening situation

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:45.600
is that atom 1 has a line
here, atom 2 has a line here,

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.710
atom 3 has a line there.

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:50.940
And if you look at the
statistical ensemble,

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:53.940
you may find the
same line widths

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:59.530
as on the left-hand side, but
the situation and the mechanism

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:01.058
is a very different one.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:11.690
So the different characteristics
are that here, we

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:15.290
have a mechanism which
broadens or widens

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:22.200
the line for each atom.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.890
Whereas here, there is
maybe not even any line

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:27.450
broadening for the atom.

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:38.280
It's more a random shift
to individual atoms.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:46.030
And the widening happens
for the ensemble.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.340
Another very
important distinction

01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:01.420
is in the left case, if you
have one powerful laser,

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.800
it can talk to all the atoms.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.610
Whereas in the
right-hand side, you

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:07.940
may have a laser with
a certain frequency,

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:12.370
and it may only excite one
group of atoms in your ensemble.

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:31.790
So this is the opposite here.

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:40.505
In many situations do we have
a physical picture where,

01:04:40.505 --> 01:04:43.870
in homogeneous broadening,
we can understand it

01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:49.390
as random interruptions of the
phase's evolution of the atom.

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:52.620
For instance, through
spontaneous emission,

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.300
or you can see certain
collisions-- just mean

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:59.730
the phase of the excited
state is suddenly perturbed.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:03.060
And therefore, the
phase is randomized.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:12.250
So if the physical picture
is a random interruption

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:20.490
of the phase evolution,
well, a random interruption

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:23.300
of a phase evolution
means that there

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.500
is an exponential
decay of coherence.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:34.510
And the line shape,
the Fourier transform

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.940
of an exponential
decay is a Lorentzian.

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:43.890
Whereas the physical picture
behind inhomogeneous broadening

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:46.390
is that you have
random perturbations.

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:52.630
And if you have many random
or small perturbations,

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:54.870
they often follow a
normal distribution,

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:56.092
which is a Gaussian.

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:13.290
There's one other aspect of
an inhomogeneous broadening.

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.020
If it's an inhomogeneous
broadening,

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.390
it is as if the individual
atom is not broadened,

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:20.520
the individual atom
is actually sharp,

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.290
it has a longer coherence.

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:25.170
And you can-- there
are techniques to make

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:26.400
that visible.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.920
And one famous technique,
for those of you

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.570
who have heard about it,
are an echo technique.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:46.660
So having explained to
you in a general way

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.270
the difference between
inhomogeneous and homogeneous

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:55.570
broadening, how would you
classify the line broadening

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:57.745
mechanisms we have
collected before?

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.810
Which one are
inhomogeneous broadening?

01:07:08.714 --> 01:07:09.880
STUDENT: Doppler broadening.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.450
PROFESSOR: Doppler broadening.

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:14.450
We exploit that when we
do saturation spectroscopy

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:17.900
in the lab, when we just talk
to one component of the velocity

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.430
distribution.

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:21.850
What else?

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:22.830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.117
STUDENT: Collisions.

01:07:30.117 --> 01:07:31.033
PROFESSOR: Collisions.

01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:36.720
That's actually a good one.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.840
Usually, collisions
are classified

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.340
as homogeneous broadening,
because the simplest

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.500
model for collisions
is collisions

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.950
are sort of just hard-core
collisions which just de-excite

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:50.400
the atom, completely change
the coherent phase evolution.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.970
And therefore, collisions
would broaden the transition

01:07:54.970 --> 01:08:00.000
for all atoms to a
line widths which

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.080
is 1 over the collision rates.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.610
However-- and this shows that
the distinction cannot always

01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:09.630
be made-- you can actually have
collision rate which depends

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:10.700
on the velocity.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.400
The faster atoms may have
a smaller collision cross

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.810
section than the slower atoms.

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:19.350
And now you have an
inhomogeneous aspect

01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:20.350
of the collision rate.

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:22.516
And therefore, collision
rate becomes inhomogeneous.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.649
I mean, the standard example
for inhomogeneous fields

01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:33.270
would-- if you have an
inhomogeneous magnetic field,

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:37.170
you have stationary atoms--
well, not in an atomic gas,

01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:39.680
but maybe in [INAUDIBLE]
or in a solid.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.034
And you have an
inhomogeneous magnetic field.

01:08:43.034 --> 01:08:44.450
This is actually
the standard case

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:47.140
of nuclear magnetic
resonance, that each atom

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.630
possesses at its
local magnetic field.

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:53.130
And the line shape is
inhomogeneously broadened.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:53.629
Colin?

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:56.885
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
clock shift sometimes,

01:08:56.885 --> 01:08:59.265
in some circumstances.

01:08:59.265 --> 01:09:01.370
PROFESSOR: If the
density is constant,

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.130
you would actually
say the mean field is

01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:05.680
the same for all
atoms in the ensemble.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.620
But if you have a
trapped atom sample

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:10.430
where the density
drops at the edge,

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:12.670
you may actually
have a sharper line,

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:17.529
and less broadening, or less
shift at the edge of the cloud.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:20.760
Anyway, so I think you have
all the tools to classify it.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.510
And you see from the
discussion that sometimes it's

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:25.859
not so obvious.

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:27.560
Or you may have
a mechanism which

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.649
has [? both ?] inhomogeneous
that it does something

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:31.979
to all atoms.

01:09:31.979 --> 01:09:34.890
So for instance, collisions
broaden all the atoms,

01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:37.540
but then different atoms are
more broadened than others.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.570
So there may be also an
inhomogeneous aspect.

01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:50.990
But finally, let me
ask you the following.

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:56.890
It seems the first
items on our list

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.040
had sort of a very
natural explanation

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.660
in terms of the Fourier theorem,
that, well, we only talk

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:06.400
to the atoms for a finite time.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.100
Or the atoms decide not
to talk to us for longer,

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.000
because they
spontaneously decay.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.500
Now, maybe you want to
give me some arguments why

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.160
some of the other
mechanisms are actually

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:31.904
also due to some form of
finite time of interrogation.

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:51.410
Well, if I would say,
can we regard collisions

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:55.820
as an effect of finite
observation time?

01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:00.370
Well, if I rephrase "observation
time" to "finite coherence

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:03.950
time," that something interrupts
the coherent evolution

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.830
of the wave function,
I think we would

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:09.690
say the collision time sets
a time limit to the coherence

01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:12.750
time and therefore,
should also be regarded

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:15.679
as due to the
finite time, we can

01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:17.220
drive the atom in
a coherent fashion.

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:29.340
If I take power
broadening, we just

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.726
discussed power broadening.

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:41.090
Well, what is the rate--
or 1 over the rate

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:42.016
of power broadening?

01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:51.870
We just discussed
that that's maybe

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:53.620
nice to take it
out of the context.

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.530
We discussed before that
power-broadened line widths

01:11:56.530 --> 01:12:00.610
is gamma over 2 times S
plus 1 square root of it--

01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:02.270
the saturation parameter.

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:04.990
But when does power
broadening happening?

01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:10.761
And what is the real time scale
for what is the physical--

01:12:10.761 --> 01:12:12.132
STUDENT: Spontaneous emission.

01:12:12.132 --> 01:12:15.650
PROFESSOR: Spontaneous--
so we had a criterion

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:21.100
that the unsaturated rate has
to be comparable to gamma.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.940
Let's forget about
factors of 2 now.

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:26.160
But that means that
the Rabi frequency

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.610
has to be comparable to gamma.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:32.840
The Rabi frequency tells
us a time of Rabi flopping.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.440
So actually, power
broadening can

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.090
be understood as a finite
observation time broadening,

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:45.520
but the atom is leaving
the excited state

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.130
not by spontaneous emission,
but by stimulated emission.

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:51.950
So in other words,
stimulated emission

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:55.220
interrupts our ability
to observe the atoms

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.760
in the excited state.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.730
And so again, we see that
there is a process coming

01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:04.180
in which interrupts
our observation

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.603
time of the unperturbed
atomic levels.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.510
Well, let me go
one step further.

01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:18.390
Let me ask you, do
you have any idea

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:23.890
how we could discuss
the Doppler shift as

01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:26.518
due to some finite time scale?

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:32.780
You would say, well, yeah,
that's dimensional analysis.

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:35.670
If you have a broadening, a
broadening is a frequency,

01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:37.940
1 over the frequency
is the time,

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.020
and there is a time
scale associated

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.050
with Doppler broadening.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.560
Sure.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.690
But now my question is,
what is the physical time

01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:46.074
scale with Doppler broadening?

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:55.190
Yes?

01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:56.838
STUDENT: [? Collisions. ?]

01:13:56.838 --> 01:13:59.030
PROFESSOR: No.

01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:01.230
We have an ideal gas without
any collisions-- just

01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:02.659
a [INAUDIBLE] distribution.

01:14:02.659 --> 01:14:03.200
You're right.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.640
In practice, yes.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.470
But I try to create an
idealized situation.

01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:12.667
So what is the time scale
of Doppler broadening?

01:14:12.667 --> 01:14:14.250
You may have never
heard the question.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:16.960
But this is for me, what
I want to really teach you

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:20.377
when I teach all these
different line shifts

01:14:20.377 --> 01:14:21.210
and line broadening.

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:22.460
There is a common denominator.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:25.930
STUDENT: You could think of
the atom [INAUDIBLE] emission.

01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:29.360
And then you would have
velocity [INAUDIBLE] emission.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.360
PROFESSOR: You're talking
about recoil shifts,

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.765
and the atom is changing
its velocity due to recoil.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.790
This would something
in addition,

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:55.880
but it's not necessarily
the case here.

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:00.760
I give you a physical argument.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.720
If I make the atom heavier
and heavier and heavier,

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.980
the effect of the recoil vanish.

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:08.110
But then I can heat
up the heavier atom,

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:10.870
that it moves with the same
velocity as the slow atom.

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:13.454
So there is an effect which
you can associate just

01:15:13.454 --> 01:15:15.495
to the velocity and to
the velocity distribution.

01:15:15.495 --> 01:15:17.710
And that's what I
want to discuss now.

01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:20.050
But there is another
effect with the recoil.

01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:23.000
But I can say the
recoil is a finite mass

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.540
effect, for that purpose.

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.460
The mass is sort of my
handle, whether the recoil

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.628
of a singular photon
is important or not.

01:15:29.628 --> 01:15:30.128
Yes?

01:15:30.128 --> 01:15:31.076
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:35.816 --> 01:15:37.780
PROFESSOR: Yes,
but this is really

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:39.687
a more trivial finite
observation time.

01:15:39.687 --> 01:15:41.270
When you heat the
wall of the chamber,

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.100
it's a collision
with the chamber.

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:47.290
It means we have only a
finite interaction size.

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:49.170
Now, let me sort of
guide you to that.

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:51.850
The secret here is
when we say, you

01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:54.820
have a finite lifetime, a
finite observation time,

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.070
what matters when
we do spectroscopy

01:15:57.070 --> 01:16:01.690
is the time we can observe
the atoms coherently.

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:05.420
If the atoms de-phase,
if the atoms get out

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.480
of coherence-- for instance,
if you have collisions--

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.850
if collision de-excite
the atom-- we'll

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:13.520
talk about it later-- it's
like spontaneous emission.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.300
But then there are
collisions which

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:18.040
just create a phase
hiccup, that the excited

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.030
state gets a random phase.

01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:23.230
So an interruption of the
phase, an interruption

01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:26.790
of the coherent
evolution is, in effect,

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:32.070
an interruption of us probing
the atoms in a coherent way.

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:35.420
And then the Fourier transform
just tells us, this time, or 1

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.680
over this time, is the
line which we observe.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.110
And you would say,
but how does it

01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:44.000
come into play with atoms
with a velocity distribution?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.570
In the following way.

01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:48.980
If you line up several atoms
and they interact with a laser

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:53.616
beam, some atoms are faster,
some atoms are slower.

01:16:53.616 --> 01:16:57.600
If some of the atoms have
moved compared to the slower

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.910
atoms, one additional
wavelength,

01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:04.110
then your ensemble
of atoms is no longer

01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:07.190
interacting with the laser
beam in a phase-coherent way.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:10.950
Because of the
different velocities,

01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:13.386
they are now talking to
random phases of the laser.

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.820
So therefore,
Doppler broadening is

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.200
nothing else as a
loss of the atoms

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.070
to coherently interact with
a laser, because some of them

01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:31.235
have moved an additional
wavelength in the laser beam.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.920
Well, if that is true-- but what
happens if the laser beam is

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.510
like this, with the wavelengths,
and the atoms go perpendicular?

01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:44.320
What happens then?

01:17:47.044 --> 01:17:48.210
STUDENT: There's no Doppler.

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:50.780
PROFESSOR: Then there
is no Doppler effect.

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:52.710
So what I'm saying
is fully consistent

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:55.550
with every single thing you
know about the Doppler effect.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:04.740
OK.

01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:14.630
So I think there's not
much more we can do today.

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:18.070
But let me give you the
summary of this discussion.

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:31.130
To the best of my knowledge,
all line broadening mechanisms

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:43.270
can be described by using the
concept of coherence time.

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:46.645
And it's a coherence time
of a correlation function.

01:18:49.777 --> 01:18:51.485
It's pretty much the
correlation function

01:18:51.485 --> 01:18:54.640
of the phase which
the atom experiences.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.590
At t equals 0, it experiences
one phase of your drive field.

01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:02.581
And a later time, how
long does it stay coherent

01:19:02.581 --> 01:19:04.830
with the coherent evolution
of the phase of your drive

01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:06.505
field of a correlation function?

01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:14.510
However, in the case
of inhomogeneous

01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:19.410
broadening-- and
this is what I just

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:21.140
discussed with the
different atoms

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:24.240
starting together and
having different velocities.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:32.090
In the case of
inhomogeneous broadening,

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:35.260
I have to include in the
description of the correlation

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.819
function ensemble averaging.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.070
So this is our agenda.

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:55.070
On Wednesday, I will
start to discuss with you

01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:57.010
very simple cases.

01:19:57.010 --> 01:19:59.900
I sort of like, before I
introduce correlation function,

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.590
we have the
generalized discussion

01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:05.950
to summarize for you the
phenomenological description

01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:11.810
of just Rabi resonance, Ramsey
resonance, exponential decay,

01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:14.630
simple Doppler broadening,
the recoil effect,

01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:16.570
that you have a clear
physical picture of what

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:18.300
the different phenomena are.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.278
And then we describe them
with a common language,

01:20:22.278 --> 01:20:23.652
with a common
formalism, which is

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:26.147
a formalism of
correlation functions.

01:20:26.147 --> 01:20:26.730
Any questions?

01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:34.790
One obvious
question-- the chapter

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:39.390
on line shifts and broadening
will not be on the mid-term.

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.890
OK.

01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:41.740
See you on Wednesday.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.390
Let's analyze a
one-dimensional collision,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.520
where we're in the
laboratory reference frame.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:16.079
And we have V1 initial
and V2 initial is 0.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.750
It's a frictionless surface.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.640
But there's a collision here.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.600
And now we're going to make this
collision totally inelastic.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.690
Now what that means is that the
two particles stick together.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.550
So if this is our
initial state--

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.580
and let's, again, choose
a direction i hat-- then

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.560
our final state will just stick
those two particles together.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.060
And they're going to move.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.430
We only need one velocity
for the final state, i hat.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.740
Now again, let's assume that
there's no external forces.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.519
There are clearly
internal forces

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.960
that are acting between the
two particles as they collide.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.850
But, remember, we know
that internal forces

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.170
cancel in pairs.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.880
And if there's no
external forces,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.320
the momentum of the
system is constant.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.920
So we can write down our
momentum condition very simply.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.350
And we'll write it again
in terms of components.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.770
We have some incoming
momentum into the system.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.080
And all of that incoming
momentum is going out.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.500
And now, is energy constant?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.880
Well, a totally
inelastic collision,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.680
energy cannot be constant.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.460
And the reason is that
these internal forces

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.830
will cause deformations
that are irreversible.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.020
So the objects
might be deformed,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.229
which is a loss of-- some
of that kinetic energy will

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.670
go into deformation.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.750
There could be noise.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.810
There could be heat generated in
the collision, lots of sources.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.180
When objects stick together,
kinetic energy is not constant.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.070
In fact, we can even figure out
the change in kinetic energy,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:18.020
because we can see here that Vx
final is m1 over m1 plus m2 V1

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.610
x initial.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.090
And now let's ask ourselves, in
a totally inelastic collision

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.160
what is the change in
the kinetic energy?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.890
So our final kinetic energy
is 1/2 m1 plus m2 V-- here,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.867
we can, again, right in terms
of components-- Vx final,

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:42.200
because the component's squared.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.430
That's no problem.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.110
And we just have this initial
kinetic energy coming in.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.520
Now we have a solution
for our problems.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.110
So let's just put that in.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:02.900
m1 plus m2 times m1
over m1 plus m2 times V1

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.270
x initial squared minus 1/2
m1 V1 x initial squared.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.160
And now let's pull
out the 1/2 m1

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.829
V1 x initial squared--
1/2 one factor of m1 V1 x

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.550
initial squared.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.770
But what we're left with
here is another factor of m1.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.200
And downstairs, we
have an m1 plus m2

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.079
outside but an m1 plus m2.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.050
Now remember, we
didn't square that.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.320
We have an m1 plus m2 inside.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.390
So there's that m1
plus m2 minus 1.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.880
Now this is the
initial kinetic energy.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.579
And when we subtract
these terms,

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.829
we have negative
m2 over m1 plus m2.

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.920
And so what we see
here is-- I'm just

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.720
going to rewrite this again--
that the kinetic energy,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.670
the change in
kinetic energy, just

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.600
depends on the initial kinetic
energy and this mass ratio.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.170
In fact, if we asked
ourselves, what

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.670
is the ratio of that
loss of kinetic energy

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.920
to the initial kinetic
energy, that just

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.019
depends on the mass
ratio of our two objects.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.330
In particular, it
should be a minus sign,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.840
because the kinetic
energy is decreasing.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.780
And so this is the fact that
it's very transparent now

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.450
that in a totally
inelastic collision

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.510
the kinetic energy
is not constant.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.650
Where did that energy go?

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.508
It went into other
forms of energy.

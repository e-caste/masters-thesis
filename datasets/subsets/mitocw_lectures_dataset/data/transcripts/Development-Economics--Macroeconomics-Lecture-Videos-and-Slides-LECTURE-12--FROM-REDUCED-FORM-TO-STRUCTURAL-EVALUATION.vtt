00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:31.986
AUDIENCE: Was that
going to be-- were

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.790
we going to do that
session after you do this?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.090
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.750
AUDIENCE: [? Or ?] [? will ?]
[? we ?] do it before?

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.500
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We'll
get your questions first.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.950
That way, I can't
time how quickly

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.870
or how slowly to go
through this lecture.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.543
So I'd just as soon start off.

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:48.710
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.390
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.765
AUDIENCE: I wondered
if you could

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:53.880
explain in more depth how--

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.740
so, when you were--

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.473
when you're simulating
structural models,

00:00:57.473 --> 00:00:58.890
and there's an
obvious distinction

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.598
between structural
models in which people

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:02.860
are forward-looking and
which people are not.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.120
And it makes it easier if
people aren't, but it's not

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.240
as realistic.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.355
So I wondered if you can
kind of explain like what are

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:14.680
the trade-offs in making people
forward-looking and then how

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.100
you--

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.950
I think there was like
a [? Vieira ?] paper

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.860
about how he was able,
for the first time,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.568
to like get at the transition
and not just steady state.

00:01:24.568 --> 00:01:26.550
So I didn't understand
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.092
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, OK, so there's

00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:32.472
like three or four
different things in there.

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:34.800
It's a good question, questions.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.970
First of all, this
forward-looking

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.090
or not forward-looking, part
of it is just tractability.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.530
The first generation of
these models, half of them

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.850
basically assumed what's called
warm-glow bequest motive.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
So you just sort of feel
warmly about passing your money

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.000
on to your kids, but,
actually, it's you,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.680
and you are reborn
the next period.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.900
We went through LEB,
which is this Lloyd-Ellis

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.340
and Bernhardt, which is a
simple sort of bequest motive.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.920
So you don't take into
account the utility that's

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.750
generated by the bequest.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.530
You just model it
as a reduced form.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.750
It's a bit like
overlapping generations,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.670
and that's why overlapping
generations models are still

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.960
widely used.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.680
We had another.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.060
There was a QJE paper on
financial volatility, which

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.720
was overlapping generations,
another one on China

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.390
and savings rates, which
was overlapping generations.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.510
It's just far easier to solve a
two- or a three-period problem

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.600
and splice together these
overlapping generations

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.620
than it is to have a
forward-looking behavior.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.150
So it's a judgement call.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.510
Now Paco, way back to his
dissertation, but also then

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.200
subsequent papers with
Kaboski and so on,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.610
have this forward-looking
aspect to it.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.230
So not only do you
have to kind of work

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.330
backwards on your own decision
problem, but, to the extent

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.090
that prices and
wages are endogenous,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.930
you kind of have to
forecast those too.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.820
And, in rational
expectations, you

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.380
would require that the forecast
be rational, that households

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.200
are kind of getting
it right on average.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.750
Actually, that reminds
me to say that one

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.010
of those flow of funds
papers we reviewed briefly

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.540
was Monika Piazzesi
and Martin Schneider.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.450
And, although they
were using US data,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.520
they were looking at the
effect of various things,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.370
including a demographic shift,
sort of baby boom generation

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.030
having more young people in
the population, relatively

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.080
speaking, than before.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.950
And they did not have the
forward-looking behavior

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.150
because they basically assumed
that the expectations you

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.720
see in the Michigan
surveys are accurate.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.433
So--

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:22.100
AUDIENCE: What were
the expectations of?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.100
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Prices.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.225
AUDIENCE: Would they go up?

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:25.820
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Inflation rates.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.030
So it wasn't like solving for
an endogenous price in the model

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.830
and then having
people forecast that.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.250
They just short circuited
the whole algorithm

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.820
by assuming that people's
expectations in the models

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.890
were as measured in the data,
even if those decisions that

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.410
got generated might
be inconsistent

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.230
with those inflation forecasts.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.620
And it was a reminder
to many of us

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.400
how straight-jacketed
we've become,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.640
in a good and a bad way, with
the rational expectations

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.070
because, once you have
a way of pinning down

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.470
the future via these
measured expectations,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.200
you can expand the heterogeneity
in the model and deal

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.810
with a lot more realism.

00:05:14.438 --> 00:05:16.105
AUDIENCE: So, in that
inflation, how far

00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:18.767
did they forecast
inflation in the survey?

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:21.100
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I think it
was just the following year.

00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:28.398
So the last thing you asked
about were the transitions.

00:05:28.398 --> 00:05:30.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.580
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Sorry,
I didn't hear you.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.500
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was
just telling him they

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.692
measured for different
ranges of times.

00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:40.077
I was like one year ahead
and five years ahead.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.140
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
They were concerned

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.070
with consumer durables and
housing purchases and so on.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.970
So you'd want to
have expectations

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.425
of some of those asset prices.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.120
The transitions are the
hardest thing to do.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.710
You can have a model,
which is forward-looking,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.590
and solve for the steady state.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.840
It's like taking a little
tease off of all the variables.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.580
So, you know, things
will settle down

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.110
to one interest rate
and one wage rate.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.800
That doesn't mean the
decision problems are static.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.360
People are still
forward-looking,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.350
but they're looking
forward at those prices.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.470
And, in a steady state,
there's always these offsetting

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.630
fractions of the population.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.790
So some fraction become urgent.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.080
The rest become patient.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.270
There's always a fixed fraction.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.660
And there's always a fixed
demand and supply of funds.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.910
And so you get these.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.790
And you can almost
analytically, sometimes,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.280
get the steady state of
some of these models.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.520
Or, even if not,
you can compute them

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.740
much more readily, whereas the
transitions, by definition,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.210
you have a whole
path, and you have

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.760
a path of guessed interest
rates and wages and so on.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.230
And people take that path
as given and optimized.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.930
And then you have to
look at the excess demand

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.540
and supply for labor
and for capital

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.510
not only in the current period,
but all these future periods

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.880
for which they've
already made a guess,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.510
and then have this algorithm to
somehow adjust the guessed path

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.940
and hope, somehow,
it will converge.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.630
So Buera and Shin
did that originally

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.450
and have modified the code.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.430
Yan, you've played
around with that code.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.170
Other people have as well.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.160
It seems to work, but it--

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.760
if you take it to
a new application,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.810
you've got to kick it
and push it around a bit

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.970
and get scared that it's
not going to work at all.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.400
And so it's certainly
not a silver bullet,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.460
but it does seem to work
for particular applications.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.920
Am I answering all--

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.383
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:08:12.383 --> 00:08:14.600
AUDIENCE: So I actually
have a related question.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.610
So I remember when
we were talking

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.300
about the computation issues
in one of the extra sessions.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.620
We were talking about
having myopic agents

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.110
and saying, well,
in the profession,

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.170
we're not that interested
in myopic agents.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.720
But I feel like
there is potentially

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.260
some middle ground
between saying,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.677
well, I have to
have an agent that

00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:41.570
looks to the
infinite future, or I

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.150
have to have an agent
that is totally myopic.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.210
And I feel like
it's actually not

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.560
more sensible to say this
agent looks to period infinity

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.960
than to say this agent
doesn't look forward at all.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.797
So I'm wondering like
what way you see like--

00:08:56.797 --> 00:08:58.880
is there a reason I'm not
understanding why one is

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.150
more ridiculous than the other?

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.650
Or like I mean--

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.275
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
People take positions.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:05.000
There's no question you're
going to get opinions.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.240
Some people would dismiss the
myopia out of hand as outdated.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.740
Other people are
convinced there's

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.290
a lot of irrationality
and behavioral things.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.190
And I do think that taking
the expectations as measured

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:26.090
in the data is quite
reasonable thing to do.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.520
And some overlapping
generations models

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.810
are, with realistic lifetimes
and mortality and all of that,

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:37.775
are really, in some sense,
the most realistic of all.

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:40.150
Granted, you still have to
deal with this bequest motive,

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.030
but, you know, I'm practical.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.220
I think it depends on
the question at hand.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.860
And it's nice to be fully
rational and forward-looking

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.430
and all of that,
but computational,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:00.900
dimensional issues will limit
the model you want to analyze.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.330
And, sometimes, it
seems unreasonable.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.070
So I mean, for example, in IO--

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.010
I'm not sure if we'll
get to this today--

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:13.050
the state spaces just
expand dramatically when

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.560
you start thinking about
strategic behavior.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.380
And then you can
actually show, if you

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.460
wanted to keep track of where
all financial providers are

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.010
going to locate with a
finite number of nodes,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.400
kind of working
backwards and having--

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.350
that becomes a very
computationally intensive

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.890
problem.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.950
And it seems reasonable to
say, well, let's just have them

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.390
forward-looking for two,
three periods or something,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.558
a finite number of periods,
as an approximation.

00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:48.100
AUDIENCE: I think
it's so interesting

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.930
because, from outside
the profession,

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.740
a lot of the criticism
we get is, oh, you

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.222
assume that these agents
are totally forward-looking

00:10:54.222 --> 00:10:55.180
and perfectly rational.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.770
You guys should see what
happens in your models

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.110
if you don't assume that.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.350
But then, within the
profession, if you

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.388
were trying to
assume that, people

00:11:00.388 --> 00:11:02.350
would be like this is
a waste of my time.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.243
Leave me alone.

00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:05.410
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, the
profession comes and goes

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.520
in terms of its
rational expectations,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.860
which was kind of invented by
Muth in 1960-something I think,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.900
late '60s.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.500
And then it took over
macro with a vengeance,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.360
well, in the sense that there
were a lot of unhappy campers.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.645
So people had stakes
in doing certain--

00:11:31.645 --> 00:11:34.310
one way or the other.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.770
And then you need to
start putting back

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.400
ingredients in the models
to explain rigidities

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.990
and slow-moving behavior.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.900
I mean, personally, I'm not
so sure sticky prices is

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:52.690
any more compelling to me than
sort of some fixed expectation.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.460
So those are-- you'll just have
to develop your own judgment

00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:00.830
somehow, but there isn't a
single right way to look at it.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.150
I think it really does
depend on the applications.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:08.020
And, especially, as I said, if
you want to break new ground

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.590
and explore a different
kind of model,

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.720
you may have to make
some approximations.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.510
Yes?

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.690
AUDIENCE: So I have a
more general question,

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.040
sort of how to interpret one of
the classic models that we saw.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.270
So it made a lot of sense
to me like the last part

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.410
of the other course where
we looked at insurance

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.160
and how to fit data
with different models.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:46.320
But there was that one lecture
on TFP that I am kind of not

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.210
clear exactly how
to think about it

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.740
in the context of this class.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:57.660
So, the paper by Zilibotti
and other people on China,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.640
how do we--

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.080
how should we think about it
in the context of this class?

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.000
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, the
way I think about it is we're

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.440
interested in development
and development issues.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.710
We're interested in the
impact of financial programs.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.670
And, for both those
reasons, it seems

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.250
like we have to take
into account how

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.485
the entire economy is evolving.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.560
People don't narrowly
stay in their village.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.600
They can migrate.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.190
They're forward-looking.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.900
Potentially,
there's urbanization

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.220
going on and so on.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.930
The starting
point-- and I put it

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.110
at the beginning, rather
than the end of the course,

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.250
was what models do we have.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.200
Let's take an inventory of
the different kinds of models

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.370
we have to try to deal
with some of the puzzles

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.790
like why is money leaving
China while the rates of return

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.480
are so high in that
paper that you mentioned,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.470
"Growing like China."

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.320
It is true, for example,
that a lot of macro guys

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:17.530
are happy sort of
modeling TFP as a process.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.070
The business cycle
literature, following

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.780
the lead of Prescott
and Kydland,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.390
is very much like that.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.790
The development literature
still has those ingredients

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.940
in the sense of allowing
individual talent

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.070
and productivity
to vary, but part

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.890
of what we see in
the aggregate data

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.720
is an equilibrium phenomenon.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.640
TFP has to do with potentially
improving allocation

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.340
of resources across
individuals and households.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.540
So that brings us back
to the micro data.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.940
And the way I see the
inter-relationship is I

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.990
could have equally well started
with the micro underpinnings

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.670
and built up to
the macro, rather

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:08.320
than starting with the macro
and then getting into the micro.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:14.170
It is true, I think, that you
need to iterate back and forth.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:19.150
You tend to lose the perspective
when you're just reading

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.100
macro development papers.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.450
So what does this have to
do with the poor people

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.510
in an Indian village?

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.800
Or, vise versa, when you're
trapped in a village,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.220
you can't see what's going on
in the rest of the economy.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.460
I mean, it's just my firm
belief that we absolutely

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.980
have to do both.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.440
Although, how much of
one versus the other

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.180
depends on the application.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.480
But this is a macro
development class.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.020
So it really has
to get us all up

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.430
to speed and comfortable
with sort of macro.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.380
And the cool thing
about macro development

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.270
is this whole
generation of models

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.900
that's coming along that
are explicit about micro

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:07.090
underpinnings and potentially
testable, whereas so much

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.900
of the macro literature,
real business cycle

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.660
literature, new
Keynesian, and so on,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.340
just make assumptions
about what's

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.980
going on at the individual
micro level and never test.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.310
Markets, institutions, the
nature of financial contracts

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.970
are all primarily
just assumed and taken

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.970
as given in the
more standard macro

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.000
literature, whereas
development is kind

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.250
of a wonderful playground, if
you want to put it that way,

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.630
for seeing just, whether
you're going from urban

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.630
to rural areas or one
country to the next,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:49.420
you can see these constraints
being estimated and varying.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.570
And the work we did in
the class shows that that

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.762
matters for the macro.

00:16:54.762 --> 00:17:00.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I guess
that my point of view, maybe

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.150
also because of my background,
but it seemed to me

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:10.210
that, the last part, we really
were in villages like seeing

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:15.310
how people do risk sharing and
stuff like that and your paper

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:20.500
with Kaboski about the
Million Baht program.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.170
But them it seemed
maybe we didn't

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.410
do that much on urban,
or most of the emphasis

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.800
was on the rural side.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.467
I mean, we said some
of the implications

00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:32.360
for the urban model and how the
data do in the urban setting.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:38.620
So it's kind of a little hard
to me to go back to that macro

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.132
where we kind of
don't have firms.

00:17:43.132 --> 00:17:45.280
Like it's unclear
to me exactly what

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.840
we're going when we're
talking about individuals

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.870
having projects.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.400
And, oh, they might employ some
other people in the village.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.970
But that still sounds to
me as like little things.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.440
And then how do
we translate that

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.412
into if we think more about
it in a macro perspective

00:18:02.412 --> 00:18:04.370
where there's really no
firms and [INAUDIBLE]??

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.453
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, the
Kaboski paper it's true

00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:10.130
used the annual rural resurvey.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.900
So it's about village
and village size.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.790
But, before we did that,
we did the paper with Alex.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.480
And that's about obstacles.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.480
And there we used
the annual data

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.610
for both the rural and the
urban or the annualized

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.290
version of the rural.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.810
But, anyway, half
of the estimation

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.747
was about urban households.

00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:35.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I remember that.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:35.540
ROBERT TOWNSEND: And so--

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.670
AUDIENCE: And we said
that the rural [? other ?]

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.540
was very important.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:42.386
But it still kind of don't
resonate with me like how--

00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:44.410
like what are we thinking
about when we think--

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.830
when we think about rural?

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.730
Are we thinking about firms?

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.662
Are we thinking about
little resalers?

00:18:52.662 --> 00:18:54.410
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.010
ROBERT TOWNSEND: There's a
whole spectrum of size and scale

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.800
of firms in these countries.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.560
And it's true that,
in the rural areas,

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.510
they tend to be small, small
or medium enterprise, household

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.890
enterprise.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.040
That's actually true as
well in the urban areas.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.790
Most of the firms in
these countries are small.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.960
Most of them don't
even hire employees.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.990
Now, when we're
doing macro proper,

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.600
we want to make
sure that we also

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.670
include the
medium-large firms if we

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:40.470
have the relevant data
on them, but I'm not

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.050
sure I see so much
of a difference

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.300
between urban and rural.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.910
For example, there are
very active money markets

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.620
in the urban areas.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.110
Credit constraints,
in some respects,

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.090
seem as severe or at
least constrained,

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.990
very high interest
rates, money lending,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:07.900
despite the proximity of
financial infrastructure.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.880
So, yeah, you can study
urban neighborhoods.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.710
I once did this in Chicago.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.820
I started looking at
urban neighborhoods,

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.070
a Mexican neighborhood,
a Korean neighborhood,

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.690
an African-American
neighborhood,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:25.690
and just seeing the differences
and whether the institutions

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:29.410
and the data seemed consistent
with certain outcomes.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.580
So, as far as the method goes,
I don't see a big difference.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:39.400
It's true that you're often
persuaded by the data you have,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.690
and this monthly data is rather
unique to the rural areas.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:49.390
So we've done more with that,
but that's just a constraint.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.230
It's not some-- we're
thinking about, god willing,

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.080
we will gather these
monthly financial accounts

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.945
data in urban areas soon.

00:21:00.945 --> 00:21:02.610
AUDIENCE: So, from
my perspective,

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.040
I think that, when we talk
about rural and urban,

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.130
if it's not Bangkok, urban
isn't really like urban here.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.540
It's just like small towns.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.230
So I wouldn't think that like--

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.550
I would think that the results
from the rural data [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.300
generalize to urban areas.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.670
But when you think about--

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.830
I think your question is
more like big, big firms

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.890
or big firms in
developing countries.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so my
point is that, sometimes,

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:31.150
most of the time, like, when
I think about TFP and studies

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:36.870
about TFP, they have this
concept about TFP growth

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.770
like in a country, which
is possibly unclear

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.790
exactly what it needs.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.210
But it's like how
much of what we're

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.880
doing at the micro level
then translates into this

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.162
like super aggregate measure?

00:21:48.162 --> 00:21:49.870
AUDIENCE: And you
think that most of this

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.412
may be coming from
the large firm?

00:21:51.412 --> 00:21:52.370
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.370
I mean, I just-- again,
like China is different,

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.590
but like that one paper was
about state-owned enterprises,

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.270
which I'm assuming are big.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.850
Like that one made
sense and was sort of--

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:05.450
which is why I kind of
can't reconcile the two.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.810
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The Jeong,
Townsend paper is about TFP

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.370
at the macro level in Thailand.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.930
And there we use
socioeconomic survey data,

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.120
which includes some
data on larger firms.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.452
I suspect it's dramatically
under sampling larger firms.

00:22:23.452 --> 00:22:25.160
And, nevertheless, we
explained something

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.780
like 72% of TFP movements
at the aggregate level.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.800
So I mean that was a real
eye-opener that development

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.970
in micro is all about--

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.220
largely about macro TFP.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.560
It's just efficiency.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.950
You know, TFP literally means
nothing more than how much--

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.220
or, changing TFP,
how much more output

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.550
can you get period
after period, even

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.850
holding the level of capital
and labor and so on fixed?

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.420
So, to the extent that
intermediation allows a better

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.390
allocation of resources
based on individual talent,

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:06.610
you should expect it
to show up in TFP.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.110
AUDIENCE: You do
have a new survey

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.970
that focuses on big firms.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.300
Do you have any work in progress
that maybe the result is

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.272
different from what--

00:23:16.272 --> 00:23:17.730
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Well, it turns out

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.610
that big firms are harder
to find in some sense.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.830
They're harder to get into.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.040
This TEPS survey
in Thailand ends up

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.990
looking a lot like
the urban survey,

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.920
even though it was designed to
try to pick up the larger ones.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.170
I mean, there is something
called the missing middle,

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.460
and I don't know whether it's
missing because of the survey

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.610
design techniques that
are used or just missing

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.860
because it doesn't exist.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.890
But the missing middle
refers to the sort

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:50.890
of life cycle of firms and the
fact that we tend to see either

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.690
the very big ones,
as in surveys, census

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.620
of manufacturers, or the very
small ones, as in household

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.230
survey data.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:03.720
And the interesting thing
is, where do the big ones

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.160
come from.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.240
What is their history?

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.410
Go back in time.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.290
Did people move out of
villages into the town

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.600
and set up their
businesses there?

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.470
And that's something we
don't know as much about

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.570
as we would like to know.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.720
It's even hard,
actually, to imagine

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.060
how to sample to figure
it out because everything

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.190
is endogenous.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.840
You can comfort
yourself when you

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.470
have a fixed enumeration of
households, as in a population

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.040
census.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.360
Then you just sample at random.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.300
Or you have an official
registry of large businesses,

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.710
and then you sample
them at random.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.640
So we can take
comfort that we have

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.250
an unbiased, stratified,
random sample,

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.480
but that doesn't get at
this missing middle if--

00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:56.495
yeah.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.583
Yes?

00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:02.625
AUDIENCE: So I have another
very general question

00:25:02.625 --> 00:25:03.730
about structural model.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.180
So we've seen a lot of models
with this heterogeneous agent.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.470
So, obviously, there's all kinds
of sources of heterogeneity.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.140
And, in your model, you
only choose to model--

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.460
you cannot model all of them.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.835
And what you're
going to model is

00:25:16.835 --> 00:25:19.270
what you think is playing
a key ingredient in driving

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.180
the mechanism of the model.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.650
So, for the other
heterogeneity, it's what?

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.795
Like, in the paper with
Kaboski, you just filter--

00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:31.150
adjust your data by filtering
the other heterogeneities.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.460
I'm just wondering whether
like, for example, people

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.368
think that there are three or
four key heterogeneities that

00:25:38.368 --> 00:25:40.660
are driving the decision-making
at the household level,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.660
but you're only
modeling one of them,

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.672
and you're filtering
out the others will be

00:25:44.672 --> 00:25:45.880
getting a lot of [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.713
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Integrating up I would say,

00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:49.690
rather than filtering out.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.460
There is a question
of the dimension

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.480
of the unobserved heterogeneity
that's in that model

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.320
and in what we're going
to talk about momentarily.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.520
You have-- like
an econometrician,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.560
it's very similar in spirit.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.890
You have the observed covariates
x on the right-hand side,

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.400
and then you have some
unobserved household

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.470
or other fixed effects
on the right-hand side.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:20.100
And you can assume all kinds of
things about those unobserved

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.400
heterogeneities, but you have
to assume something basically.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.300
It's hard to do something
completely non-parametric.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.710
So you're making assumptions.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.740
I'm not denying that at all.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.290
And it matters what you
assume, but it's not

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.335
as though the
heterogeneity isn't there.

00:26:38.335 --> 00:26:39.960
AUDIENCE: So it's
not about unobserved.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.840
So, for example, household
[? that respond ?]

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.052
in that paper, the
heterogeneity is

00:26:44.052 --> 00:26:46.805
in permanent income and
wealth, liquidity, wealth,

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:47.680
and permanent income.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.060
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
wealth might be observed.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.770
Permanent income
is not observed.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.320
AUDIENCE: And household
composition is observed,

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.540
but it's not modeled.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.620
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Oh, now that's
something we did for the data.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.625
And that's more a
trade-off in methods.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.790
Let me draw an analogy.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:08.530
If you did real
business cycle modeling,

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:12.820
you would basically take
a trend out of the data.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.190
I mean, in the US, there's
just this huge trend.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.110
I mean, if you looked
at the business cycles

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.740
around the trend, you'd like
what is this subject called

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.917
business cycle.

00:27:21.917 --> 00:27:23.500
Of course, when
you're in a recession,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.600
it seems real enough.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.830
So people have a filter.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.690
You could take a
linear trend out.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.450
You could use this
Hodrick-Prescott filter

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.650
and take out some kind
of smooth moving average.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.480
And then, having
taken it out, you'd

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.750
just focus on the
deviations around the trend.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.380
So what we did was take out
all the demographics, which

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:49.030
is not pleasant either,
but, I mean, it at least--

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.510
the other thing to do is
to leave it in the data

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.700
and use a model that
doesn't have it.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.710
And that seems weird too.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.540
That's like doing
business cycle modeling

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.742
and leaving the trend in.

00:28:00.742 --> 00:28:02.450
AUDIENCE: So, id you
don't-- for example,

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.220
but, if the question
that you're--

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.220
like the model, like, if
people think that household

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.050
composition or demographics is
playing some sort of key role

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.700
in the household
decision-making,

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.712
but you're filtering it out--

00:28:14.712 --> 00:28:16.420
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's
a fair criticism.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.750
AUDIENCE: So there are
criticisms like that?

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.710
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:25.390
Yeah, well, it sounded like
all the research got done.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.860
Oh wow, we'll see
you on Thursday.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.110
No, no, those are good,
productive thoughts,

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.300
which is it's not like--

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.150
you can be sort of uncomfortable
with research in general

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.760
and the apparently
arbitrarily way

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.590
in which different
researchers make assumptions.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.730
But where research kicks in in
a very positive way is to say,

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:49.450
no, I don't believe that
is a reasonable assumption.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.100
I think it would matter a lot.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.610
Let me try to incorporate
it and maybe leave out

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.120
some other things and see
what difference it makes.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.956
That's where good research
is born, absolutely.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.490
Yes?

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:10.320
AUDIENCE: So a lot of the
models that we've covered

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.032
has a wage as a key parameter.

00:29:14.032 --> 00:29:20.616
But, in like some research
in, if I remember correctly,

00:29:20.616 --> 00:29:25.500
your paper in Econometrica
doesn't find a effect

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.310
on wage, at least short term.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.700
And, also, like Esther
and Abhijit's paper

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.230
didn't also find wage,
like effect on wage,

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.625
of microfinance [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:39.500
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Joe
and I did find an effect

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.020
on the wage in the
astructural model.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.533
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK so that's
totally [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:45.700
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.700
AUDIENCE: I missed that.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.810
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
But, again, that's

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.000
a good example again of
these trade-offs, which

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.580
is you have a sort
of a search algorithm

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.600
through the lens of a
somewhat reduced form,

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.170
maybe instrumented
variables to see what's big

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:00.950
and what's small.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.020
And we found an
effect on the wage.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.020
Now it is true
that in that model,

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.240
the structural Econometrica
paper with Joe,

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.510
we did not try to
make wages endogenous.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:15.050
In fact, we allowed
investment, but we moved away

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:18.600
from occupation choice
and these key ingredients

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.040
of a lot of these macro models.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.140
It's not like it
couldn't be done.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.550
It was just something we
chose not to focus on.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.440
AUDIENCE: I guess my point is--

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.010
so I don't think there are a
lot of evidence, especially

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:43.290
[? treating ?] endogeneity
of financial development.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:47.140
But it seems to
me that, at least

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.900
like RCT of like
MFI and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.780
they usually didn't find,
but I only know two papers,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.810
but they didn't find
like effect on wage.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.980
So I'm kind of wondering
like what's your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.970
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I think,
if you think about--

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.860
you have to think about the
scale of the intervention,

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.360
all right?

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.400
So, if you have an RCT, even
with a fairly big sample,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.290
in a small, open economy,
it's arguably true

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.120
that you wouldn't
necessarily expect

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.130
to see anything with the wage.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:31.320
But, if you were scaling
that same experiment up

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.460
to the national level, then
you probably would see it.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.890
Actually, that's a
very good argument

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:42.780
for doing both basically
and, in particular,

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.140
not getting misled
by program impact.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.830
Ester's thesis in Indonesia
was about education reform.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:54.360
And she was worried about
whether the wages would

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.330
go down, as you had
more educated cohorts.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.030
So people have worried
about this kind

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.490
of thing for quite a long time.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:03.720
There is some work in Canada.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:09.600
RCTs are a bit sort of like
they look new, like people maybe

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.420
haven't been doing them much,
but it's not true actually.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.790
If you can go back
into the '60s and '70s,

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:20.250
there was work in
Canada on I think

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.560
it was either a pension
or social security

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.920
reform where they did
exactly what I was saying.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.110
They kind of backed
that impact locally,

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.970
and then they
extrapolated to what

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.790
would happen to the
rest of the country

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.620
if it were
implemented nationally

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.931
with the structural model.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:40.650
Yes?

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.290
AUDIENCE: So this is
a very broad question,

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.563
but [INAUDIBLE] asked
something about the financial

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:50.400
[INAUDIBLE],, especially
corporate financial [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.140
equity markets
and money markets.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.070
So these markets of
course are [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:01.270
to the way economic surplus are
divided into different people

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.300
or different organizations.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.910
So, as a result of that
[INAUDIBLE] impasse,

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:11.560
how, for example, new
projects or new policies

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.480
have benefited different types
of groups or organizations--

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.220
so there are some political
economy issues related

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:25.406
to the imperfection of
the corporate financial

00:33:25.406 --> 00:33:27.300
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.820
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Impact of
the corporate finance on--

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.690
AUDIENCE: Structure on-- so
political economy concerns

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:39.000
about who benefits from new
policies and new projects.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.320
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well,
there's two things.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.870
On almost anything
we've done, there

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:46.190
is sort of the
winners and losers.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.060
And that, in principle,
that has nothing

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.380
to do with political economy.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:53.600
That's just mapping out who's
going to get the benefits.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.040
Now the next step is, if you
think there are barriers,

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.940
it may be that the losers
are blocking reforms.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.025
And that's definitely
a political economy.

00:34:04.025 --> 00:34:04.241
AUDIENCE: Oh yes,
then my question

00:34:04.241 --> 00:34:06.810
is does the literature
seriously investigate

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:12.130
the second step you just
described, [? fair ?] wages.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.710
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I mean, Daron
has occupation choice models

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.380
where, basically, the
oligopolists are the ones

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.230
sort of dictating the outcome.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:26.380
And they are a force
for financial repression

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.460
because they want to
keep the wages low.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.840
I mean, that's at least a step.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:38.199
We, in this class--

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:40.659
let me try to think if
we actually covered it.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:47.120
A bit, yeah, you saw
one version of that.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.420
We can model how financial
service providers

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.460
ought to be behaving
if we believe

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.199
the structure of the model.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.150
Then we look at the
data, and we discover

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:59.390
that there are
gaps in some places

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:03.030
and too many banks
in other places.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.670
And so, through the
lens of the model,

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.450
you sort of get
suspicious that--

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.090
develop a null
hypothesis that there

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.410
may be political
considerations at work.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:22.355
Now how explicit or evil or
well intended it is, that's--

00:35:22.355 --> 00:35:26.060
you have to go in
there with your eyes

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.730
open, but not
necessarily assume.

00:35:32.968 --> 00:35:35.218
AUDIENCE: I have another
question if no one else does.

00:35:35.218 --> 00:35:36.170
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.983
AUDIENCE: So--

00:35:36.983 --> 00:35:38.941
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Anything
but the lecture, huh?

00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:41.300
AUDIENCE: No, I just-- this is--

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.910
so I'm kind of embarrassed to
ask this question because it

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.280
seems like it's something
that I should have been

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.488
able to figure out on my own.

00:35:46.488 --> 00:35:48.800
But you see a lot
of people throwing

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.370
around the word structural
in ways that are confusing

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:54.530
and in ways that sometimes--

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.300
sort of I guess the
natural and then

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.830
from what we've looked
at and all your papers,

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.140
I guess I'd sort of be
inclined to say your models

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.890
are only structural
if you are identifying

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.850
like underlying parameters
that are in a model of interest

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.020
using econometrics or using
calibrated simulation.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.500
But I see a lot of people
calling stuff structural that

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.900
doesn't necessarily actually
identify those parameters.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.483
Have I got the wrong
end of the stick?

00:36:19.483 --> 00:36:23.057
Or is there like a
nuance that I don't see?

00:36:23.057 --> 00:36:24.140
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I don't--

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.390
I don't actually know
for sure, depending

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:28.727
on who's using the words,
what they have in mind.

00:36:28.727 --> 00:36:29.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah, me either.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:34.610
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I
think, legitimately,

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:39.380
many people are worried that
assumptions are being made

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.650
in structural models,
which are never tested,

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.770
and that you're
seeing the observables

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.270
through these
auxiliary assumptions.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.950
And, if they were sort of
totally off and totally wrong,

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.260
then you're not
learning anything.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.620
So that tends to push you
toward data summaries.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.350
It tends to push you
toward not assuming things.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.460
But then there's a flip
side, which is actually

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.380
the lecture, which is
this notion that there's

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.810
theory-free tests.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.540
It's just not true.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.550
Even though RCTs and--

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.460
you know, they're all
assuming some things

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.950
that you might think
are rather innocuous,

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.220
but, when you start to
think about the structure

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.240
of decision-making,
there's content there.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.090
And those assumptions
could be wrong.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.150
So I view the tension
that way, which

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:40.400
is trying to assume
as little as possible,

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.860
if you can get away with it,
in terms of the underlying

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.900
distributions of
unobservables and so on,

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:53.720
but, at the same time, mindful
that data work without theory

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.890
has big limitations.

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.640
And that's a debate,
philosophical and otherwise,

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.150
that goes way back, I mean,
back to business cycles.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.800
You know, Burns and Mitchells--

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.500
Burns and Mitchell have this
business cycle measurement,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.225
the NBER dates actually.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:22.920
And Koopmans came along,
and he said it's just crap.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.310
And there was a lot of fighting.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.500
So how can you measure
something if you don't have

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.200
a model in mind, et cetera?

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.880
So I'm not saying there
aren't good answers to that,

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.290
but this is not just a debate
in development economics.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.140
This is, again,
kind of a judgment.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.040
AUDIENCE: So it's a
kind of vague question,

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:51.840
but we've seen in the lecture a
lot of models and evidence that

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.760
financial [INAUDIBLE],,
[? let's say, ?] sort of like

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.650
what financial development
does to the real economy.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:05.310
And how would you compare
that to the situation

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.853
in developed countries?

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.610
What is like-- what
is the difference?

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.980
Because like a lot of models--

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.970
at least model-wise,
you can apply it

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.480
to developed countries.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.510
And, at first glance,
like, for example,

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:33.830
like for consumption, people
aren't risk sharing quite well.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:43.130
So like it's quite
close to this situation

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.520
where the market is complete.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:52.170
On the other hand, if
you look at macro level,

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.920
as we saw in the first
lecture, like there's--

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.840
or like people tend to think
that financial development

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.620
[INAUDIBLE] varies
over countries

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.410
and affect [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.900
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well,
we've used the US as--

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.080
some of those papers used the US
as like the benchmark standard,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.590
as if it had perfect and
complete financial markets.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:22.440
But I think we all
know now just how

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.750
badly the US and other
advanced countries

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.010
have done over the last--

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.050
since '08, '09, and so on.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.570
So, actually, what's
going on in macro

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:34.410
is this huge rebirth
of interest in modeling

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.170
the financial sector.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.600
There's no consensus
on how to do it.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.370
And I think that
literature would

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.260
benefit from the
advances that have

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.690
been made in macro development.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.670
But there's no reason why--

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.200
I mean, the same
issues will come up

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.800
when thinking about
the US or Spain.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:59.587
I mean, Spain is an
example, for a good example,

00:40:59.587 --> 00:41:02.170
depending on whether you think
it's an advanced industrialized

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.190
country or not.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.820
Spain liberalized its financial
system in the late '80s

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.680
with a series of reforms
on interest rates

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.420
and the nature of business,
of savings and loans,

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.420
and all these providers.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.380
So these little regional
banks, like Santander up there

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:34.920
in the north and, basically,
along with many of the others,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.010
expanded their financial
infrastructure,

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:42.930
establishing branches, spreading
throughout the rest of Spain

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:47.790
and, eventually, of course,
on to Latin America.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:51.180
And then now we have
this mess, right?

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:54.120
So what went wrong?

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.885
Or what went wrong in the US
mortgage crisis and so on?

00:41:57.885 --> 00:42:01.180
So I think those are--

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.240
there's hardly a
consensus, as I said,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.000
but those are really
important topics.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.940
This is haunting countries, as
well as the IMF and the World

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:18.460
Bank and so on, now because
countries want to grow.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.920
There's a lot of poverty,
a lot of inequality.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.630
And there is this
notion that expanding

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:31.170
financial systems,
finance, can cause growth,

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:37.600
and growth can trickle down and
help reduce poverty and so on.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.650
So there is this sort
of development view

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.980
that finance ought to expand
in some way and cause growth.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.970
And, at the same time, there's
this worry that expanded,

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.690
deeper financial
systems are going

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.820
to be prone to instability.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.480
And that's a force
for repression.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.760
And that was the first
lecture of the class,

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.290
actually, was how do we
deal with both these,

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:07.210
get both these things
on the same page.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.060
But, for sure,
today in the world,

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.070
throughout Africa
and Asia and so on,

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.480
people are sort of
wanting to expand

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.090
and, at the same time,
quite scared, as regulators,

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.880
that they're going to take
the blame in the future

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.100
when something goes wrong.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.095
All right, so I'm going to
give you a 30-minute summary.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:36.990
Fortunately, some of
these themes have come up.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.300
And, as always,
the lecture notes

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.990
are on the Stellar website.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:47.220
So it's OK if we don't cover
everything in enormous detail.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.830
Oh, by the way, one
last thing, which is I

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.260
did write out, for
those of you who

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.950
are worried about the generals,
sort of a reader's guide

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:56.575
to the--

00:43:56.575 --> 00:43:59.790
not a reader's guide, a
summary of the questions

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.010
that we've been
addressing in the class.

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:04.230
It's just kind of a way
to organize the material,

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.570
and I'll post that
on Stellar and--

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:09.883
who's also going to
have some sessions.

00:44:09.883 --> 00:44:12.300
I think there's only four or
five of you that are actually

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.370
going to take the
generals, but, if you are,

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:19.820
it's easy to get lost
in all this material.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.278
So I wrote up this
sort of summary.

00:44:21.278 --> 00:44:22.778
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? going to ?]

00:44:22.778 --> 00:44:23.770
need it for next year.

00:44:28.008 --> 00:44:29.550
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, well, by then,

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.810
research will have
advanced, and we'll--

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:37.730
OK, so this is about
this structural

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:39.410
versus reduced form stuff.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:49.100
And the topic is the impact of
expanding financial systems.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:54.980
So it's both a methods
and a topic that basically

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.040
is the hallmark of the class.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.580
There's three things.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.340
I'll probably only barely
get through the first.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:07.160
One is sort of IV versus
structural analysis,

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.800
all in the same
model, basically.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.600
The second is this
expansion of banks in Spain,

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.300
which I was already mentioning,
using what the IO guys do,

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.410
the way they avoid
having to spell out

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.350
the entire structure
of the equilibrium

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:29.400
by using reduced form
Markov processes.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.460
And then, finally, if
I were to have time,

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.620
I could tell you about
the limitations of that.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:37.490
The point is there's
no one thing,

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:42.880
but you need to be aware of
the strengths and limitations.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.480
So this is a paper
I wrote with Urzua,

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:55.480
and it's about occupation
choice and about

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.350
unobserved heterogeneity.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.720
So a lot of this is
already familiar.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.110
You've got sort of
your wealth if you're

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:11.710
a wage earner, your wealth
if you're an entrepreneur.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:14.210
Instead of having just a
flat wage for everyone,

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.450
there's sort of this
productivity shifter,

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.730
which varies with households.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:19.720
Or you can run a firm.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:25.300
There's some setup
costs unobserved, again,

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.980
varying with
households, [? i. ?]

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.500
The profits come from
maximizing revenue

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.120
less the cost of inputs.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.310
In this case, there's
no financial sector.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.700
Ironically, I'll get there.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.388
And you just have to finance
the setup costs and your capital

00:46:42.388 --> 00:46:43.430
with your initial wealth.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:44.520
So you saw this.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.050
This was day two.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.200
This was the Lloyd-Ellis
and Bernhardt model,

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.190
versions of which we
took into or modified

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:58.710
in some of the other
papers in the literature.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:03.030
So you get to choose
one or the other.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:07.080
So we can create this
decision rule, a dummy D

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.960
for do profits dominate wages.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.370
If so, do it, and,
otherwise, don't.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.030
OK, so it's an indicator.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:19.080
Note that it depends
on observables,

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.410
the economy-wide
wage and the wealth,

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:25.200
which varies across households,
and these unobservables, which

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.760
are these setup costs or talent
for both being a wage earner

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.980
and being an entrepreneur.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.270
We're not going to see those.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.590
So, as you know,
it's sort of naive--

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:43.560
you know, incredibly simple,
but, in some respects,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.070
powerful way to write
down the observable

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.430
depends on which thing you do.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.510
But, if D equals 1,
then 1 minus D is 0,

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.540
and you have the profits
and earnings of being a firm

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:03.450
versus, if D is 0, you're
going to have the wage earnings

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:05.430
from being a wage labor.

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:08.610
So you can write down,
if you were running

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:15.240
a regression of earnings,
you could let that regression

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:21.270
have wealth in there and wages.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:25.500
And then you'd have
this sort of dummy,

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:31.140
which is a 0, 1 binary variable,
plus some epsilon term,

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.820
as regressions tend to have.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.510
However, following the
structure of this model,

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.530
we know exactly
what the epsilon is.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:46.380
It's this D-weighted
average of the talent.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.500
Now you don't change your
talent when you make an--

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.530
you have your talent in
both of those occupations.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.470
And that's what's
driving the choice, OK?

00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:02.430
So, basically, the
worry, correctly,

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:04.590
is that D on the
right-hand side is

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:10.410
correlated with epsilon because
that's self-selection, OK?

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:15.000
You choose the occupation with
which you're most productive,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.670
and part of that choice
is based on unobservables.

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:20.610
So we see it both in the
choice and in the error.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.758
OK, so we need an instrument.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:37.840
Let's imagine in this economy
there's some subsidy or tax.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.720
And it's lump sum and
administered, say, randomly.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.830
Well, then, clearly,
the decision variable,

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:55.620
which has a phi in it now
is influenced by that.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.020
And, the higher is the
subsidy, the more likely

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.640
you are to be running a firm,
other things equal, right?

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:09.270
But, because it's lump sum,
this instrument, this subsidy,

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:13.560
affects the choice of
what occupation you're in,

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.440
but it does not influence
the outcome conditioned

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.903
on choosing.

00:50:18.903 --> 00:50:20.320
If you choose to
be a firm, you're

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.890
going get that subsidy or not.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:26.060
And that leaves all the other
decisions about labor to hire,

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:26.970
et cetera, et cetera.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.360
And none of those decisions,
none of those outcomes,

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:33.370
depend on the subsidy
because that's

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:36.670
sort of bygones are bygones.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:40.630
You can't do much about it.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:48.280
All right, so we could imagine
running that regression,

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:54.270
but we regress the decision
to be a firm in the data

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:56.950
onto observables, like
the wage and wealth,

00:50:56.950 --> 00:51:00.780
but also onto this
subsidy as an instrument.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.470
That's called the IV,
the instrumented version

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.270
of the decision.

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:08.510
And then we run the
outcome function

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:13.560
with the instrumented
version, OK?

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.995
So, hopefully, this is a review.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:26.380
And what is the policy outcome?

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:30.690
The coefficient on d
after instrumenting it

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:34.900
is supposed to be the
gain to being a firm,

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.110
as opposed to being "treated,"
quote, and being a firm rather

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:40.300
than being a wage earner.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.400
But it isn't exactly that.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.520
Or, at least, put on
your thinking cap.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:50.450
It's the local average
treatment effect.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:58.120
It is the average gain in
income for those people induced

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:03.900
by the subsidy to switch from
being wage earners to being

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.205
entrepreneurs.

00:52:09.632 --> 00:52:10.590
So you're not getting--

00:52:14.167 --> 00:52:15.750
you're not getting
other things, which

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:20.670
are easily, similarly sounding,
like treatment on the treated.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:23.160
Treatment on the treated
sounds like, oh, well, people

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.420
became firms.

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.990
What was their profits relative
to the earnings they would have

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:32.130
had if they were wage earners?

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:33.920
That's what this says, right?

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:38.900
What is the average in
the population of profits

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.230
with the thetas in
there less wages,

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:46.130
given that they made the
decision to be a firm,

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:48.680
and their wealth is basically b?

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.450
So I'm doing this wealth
category by wealth category.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:58.210
And this is the average
treatment effect.

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.430
This is what the
average would be

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:04.810
if the whole population
became firms, taking wages

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.690
as given and so on.

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:12.390
So, basically, be careful
because LATE is not

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:15.870
necessarily equal to-- what
you get with the IV is not

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:18.930
necessarily equal to
treatment on the treated

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:22.890
and not necessarily equal to
the average treatment effect.

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:25.950
Is this a review for you guys?

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:27.080
OK, good.

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:35.700
So you can put more
structure as a way

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.910
to back out the average
treatment effect and so on.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:41.550
Now this is like
assuming that those error

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:46.020
terms are multivariate normal.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:51.030
And then you run this logistics
regression, basically,

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:54.870
binary yes, no, be firm or not.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:54:03.680
And you can back out
these variance terms,

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.510
assuming that there's no--

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.010
that the talent
things have say zero

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.800
mean, or you could
adjust for that.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.545
And then you can get
expressions for--

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.060
so then you want to basically
run your regression of profits

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.710
onto those people
who have chosen

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:30.270
to be firms, controlling for
their wealth and their subsidy.

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:33.690
And, if you didn't, if you
weren't careful and did OLS,

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:35.520
you'd have a bias,
but you basically

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:42.082
use that first stage
probit to get a propensity.

00:54:42.082 --> 00:54:43.540
The structural
model tells you what

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:48.460
the exact formula is
for the selection based

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.600
on the unobservables.

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.250
And you put that
into the regression.

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:55.250
You literally put this into
the regression and run it.

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:58.360
And it, quote, "solves
for the selection bias."

00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.530
Yes?

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.780
AUDIENCE: How much more
computationally difficult

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.110
is it to use some kind
of data distribution

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:08.370
or like some other kind
of-- because normal

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:10.586
is a bit of a stretch as
an assumption for a talent

00:55:10.586 --> 00:55:11.500
distribution.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.550
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Oh, I
think that's quite doable.

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:17.930
Look, this is just meant to be
an example, a classic example,

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:18.430
but--

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:19.302
AUDIENCE: Cool,
so it's not too--

00:55:19.302 --> 00:55:20.223
OK, sounds good.

00:55:20.223 --> 00:55:21.640
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
But, I mean, this

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:27.070
question that you guys were
asking, so here you've made--

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:29.650
you're able to get
average treatment effect

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:31.420
and treatment on the
treated, but only

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.640
if you make some assumptions.

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.020
And some people don't like that.

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:38.350
They'll say, oh, you
know, it's too structural.

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:40.915
But, in order to get answers,
sometimes, you need--

00:55:40.915 --> 00:55:42.540
AUDIENCE: You have
to make assumptions.

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:47.740
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK, now, I
mean, the most powerful way

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.320
to say this is we actually
see the counterfactual

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.570
through the lens of the model.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:55.450
We can see what the wages
would have been for people

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:57.430
who chose to be firms.

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:59.440
By definition, they're
not in the data.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.685
And this is a
generalized version.

00:56:12.685 --> 00:56:17.590
And I'll just say that this is
like local average treatment

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:22.900
effect, but really local,
like just taking derivatives

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:27.640
of how that difference
between profits and wages

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.550
is going to move,
holding wealth constant,

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:35.800
as you vary something
like a propensity score.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:40.720
And the propensity score
has, not too surprisingly,

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.620
everything to do with
those unobservable talents.

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.120
So this is hard to implement.

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.190
This one is really not easy.

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:53.240
Josh doesn't like it,
among other things,

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.720
but he's not disagreeing
that it's wrong.

00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:00.970
He's just thinking it's
just not as operational.

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:04.360
Now the nice thing, if
you could back this out,

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.690
then you can ignore this
page, but, basically,

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.360
treatment on the treatment and
the average treatment effect

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:15.310
are just sort of integrals
of these marginal treatment

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:16.670
effects.

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:17.170
Yes?

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:19.820
AUDIENCE: So Josh
sometimes recommends

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.210
to apply LATE to
non-compliance based

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.888
on observable characteristics.

00:57:25.888 --> 00:57:29.280
So, in the typical
data set in the context

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:33.520
of occupational
choice, what can we

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.063
observe among characteristics
of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:57:39.063 --> 00:57:40.480
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
So here the model

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.500
is taking a stand
that we're going

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.170
to see their initial wealth.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.350
We're going to see the factor
prices that they faced.

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:51.640
We're going to see the
profits that they make.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.400
And we're not going to see
these unobserved things that

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.970
are driving fixed costs around.

00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:59.860
This is not the
only model around.

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:03.190
We're going to use the model
to make these examples.

00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:05.470
I haven't gotten sort
of to the punchline.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:08.380
I'm happy if it's
a review, but--

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:21.020
OK, so we have the model, right?

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.830
So, if you don't
believe this miracle,

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:27.470
let's simulate the
data from the model.

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:31.670
Instead of looking at some
of the cross-section that

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:35.990
got treated with the subsidy
and others that didn't, let's

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:39.140
take a particular individual in
the model at given parameters

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:43.460
and see what the behavior is,
in terms of switching occupation

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:48.930
and so on, as you turn the
subsidy on and then average up

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:50.970
in that wealth category.

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:54.600
So believing in the miracle is
basically the math that you're

00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:59.950
going to see the average of
this model-generated simulation

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:03.250
of impact will be the IV.

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:07.215
It's going to be LATE
under these assumptions.

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:22.000
So here is the IV estimate.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.270
And, roughly averaging over
wealth, et cetera, it's 0.45.

00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:30.370
OLS is-- by the way,
OLS is terrible,

00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:35.080
but I guess you don't
need to know why.

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.150
There's nothing productive
about the subsidy.

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:39.130
The subsidy is just
inducing people

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:41.920
who should be wage
earners to be firms.

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.660
Of course, the
impact is negative.

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.260
And OLS estimates
it to be positive.

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.105
Why?

00:59:48.105 --> 00:59:49.480
Because, in the
observables, it's

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:51.320
the talented people
who are firms,

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.650
but they're not being
induced by the subsidy.

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:56.480
They're already firms, right?

00:59:59.032 --> 00:59:59.990
I couldn't help myself.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:08.750
OK, and this is the
model-generated treatment where

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:09.920
we actually have the panel.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:15.390
And you can see, numerically,
it's quite close.

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:17.720
All right, so that's reassuring.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.680
Now let's go back
to the topic, which

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.840
is what is the
impact of expanding

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.600
financial infrastructure.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.660
Let's invent a village fund.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.290
Let's let banks
establish branches--

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:37.140
forgive me for the
moment-- at random.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.540
Like maybe the government
told them something,

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:45.740
or I'll get to that,
but, for now, random.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:50.770
So, if we observe these travel
times or the effectiveness

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:52.720
of local financial
infrastructure,

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.940
we can call this cost here
to be an instrument, right?

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:01.390
So, yeah, so the idea is
just like the subsidy.

01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:03.430
The lower is this
number, the more inclined

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:07.045
you are to incur the cost to
be able to do the banking.

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:12.810
OK, we rewrite the problem.

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:15.450
This is the part of the model
with financial infrastructure.

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:20.970
They get to borrow money
to cover the capitalization

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:24.420
and the fixed cost.

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.130
Wage earners, by
the way, also get

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:30.510
to put their wealth in the
bank and earn money, interest

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:32.070
rate on their savings.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.150
You've seen this model.

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:36.180
This was, again,
the second lecture.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:47.280
And now we have the
observed outcome.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.560
If you are in--

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.290
if you chose to be in
the intermediated sector,

01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:55.080
you have another
occupation choice problem

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.130
within that sector.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.710
You can be a firm
or a wage earner.

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:04.790
These D's denote that choice.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:07.140
Notationally, it's got
a w and r in there.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.375
That r is a clue that we're
in the intermediated sector

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:11.750
because there's
an interest rate.

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:13.590
Because, if you were
in the autarky sector,

01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.340
there's no borrowing
and lending of funds.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.340
And, of course, this is
the occupation choice

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.970
we had before without
intermediation.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:34.800
So we're going to get
sort of the observed

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.120
earnings in the autarky
sector and observed earnings

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.710
in the intermediated sector.

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:45.190
And, within both sector, there's
this other margin going on,

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:47.610
which is the occupation choice.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.800
All right, now we're
reaching the point here.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.880
We have a double margin.

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:57.420
There are two things
people are choosing from,

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:02.460
whether or not to go to the bank
and what occupation to have.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.055
Sounds like it shouldn't
cause a problem.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.460
This is basically--

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.600
I'm sorry this is
so hard to see,

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.060
and it must be even
harder for you than me.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.890
I'm right next to it.

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:25.730
This sort of symmetric Y is
like an indicator variable

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:28.220
for choosing to
be intermediated.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.130
These Y's with a little bit
of tail off to the right

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:35.570
are incomes under
intermediation and autarky.

01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:38.240
It's this way in the paper,
and somehow the slides

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.510
got created this way.

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:43.640
But, anyway, so the gain is--

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.510
let's skip that.

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:00.140
So what can I say?

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.990
It's a double margin.

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:08.650
So you get to choose whether
or not to go to the bank.

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:10.790
And, within that,
each category, you

01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:14.300
get to choose your occupation.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.320
We can linearize the profits
functions to be functions

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.260
of the observables
and the unobservables,

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:26.930
substitute in those decisions,
and write out the expression

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:34.160
for what you see in the
data, namely, this income,

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.830
but it's just a weighted
average of all the choices,

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:44.240
depending on whether these
D's are 0 and 1's or these

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.632
symmetric Y's are 0 or 1's.

01:04:48.632 --> 01:04:50.590
That was a bit of a rush,
but, I mean, I think,

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:54.130
conceptually, you understand
where this is coming from.

01:04:54.130 --> 01:05:00.220
But, not only that,
look at this error term.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:05.890
Oh my god, the error
term is complicated.

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:08.680
And it also has all
these decisions,

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.510
but note it's got the occupation
decisions in both sectors.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.773
Depending on what
you do, certain terms

01:05:16.773 --> 01:05:18.190
are going to kick
in and kick out.

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:22.780
There's massive selection
going on about whether or not

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.588
to go to the bank, based
on what occupation you're

01:05:26.588 --> 01:05:28.630
going to choose, conditioned
on going to the bank

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.820
or not going to the bank.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:33.160
And we don't see any of this.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.210
We just see the choices.

01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:35.680
We don't see these error terms.

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:45.880
So what can an instrumented
version of intermediation

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.770
give you?

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:59.490
It can give you the local
average treatment, the income

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:06.720
gains that are a consequence
of a lowered cost that

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.690
allows you-- makes you
want to go to the bank,

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:13.110
as opposed to what you would do
if those costs had been higher,

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:14.780
and you're not
going to the bank.

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:20.280
So the local average
treatment is the impact

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.390
on earnings that have to do with
those people who are induced

01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:27.750
to join the banking
system as a consequence

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:33.450
of the placement of branches
or varied costs of access.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:44.040
Now you have to be careful
in terms of what this isn't.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:48.340
For example, do
we want to look--

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.770
what do we mean
when we say we want

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.630
to measure the
impact of improved

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:57.220
financial access on the
profits of entrepreneurs?

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.800
You want to do an IV for that?

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.300
Good luck.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.100
Now what can go wrong?

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:14.620
Remember monotonicity
and independence, OK?

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:18.880
So monotonicity means
that more people

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.360
are inclined to do something
as a consequence of the policy

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.220
variation.

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:26.650
Are more people
inclined to be firms

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:30.520
as a function of having reduced
cost of financial access?

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:34.540
Maybe if they were credit
constrained and then

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.060
make a lot of money in
business, but there's

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.550
another subset of
the population,

01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:43.840
those not so talented people who
are in financial autarky, who

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.590
would be actually induced
to leave business and put

01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:48.700
their money in a bank.

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.090
So it's not monotonic.

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.130
The effect of improved
financial access

01:07:57.130 --> 01:08:05.370
is not monotonic on things like
the income of entrepreneurs.

01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:07.400
You can, if you're
careful, think

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.470
about what is the impact on
profits of entrepreneurs,

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:15.950
of those people
whose decision to be

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:20.120
an entrepreneur is not affected
by financial intermediation.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.859
Now that's an
interesting question,

01:08:21.859 --> 01:08:24.830
but it is not
necessarily the one

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:26.660
that we had in
mind to begin with.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:32.609
And who are those people?

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.609
Well, it kind of depends
on their talent, right?

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:38.040
So you're making statements
about where these talent

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.770
cutoffs are when
you're conditioning

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:44.340
on, quote, "things like people
who were not making their"--

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:48.830
if you just run an IV
in this cross-section,

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:55.689
just be mindful of what you
want to do with the occupation

01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:57.340
categories.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:05.180
Now this is where the
rubber hits the road.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:10.090
Am I just talking fancy
theoretical models here?

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:11.500
I don't think so.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.810
This is just the
most innocuous kind

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:17.899
of unobserved heterogeneity.

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:21.149
And yet it tells you
that IV is not a panacea.

01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:23.540
You have to be very
careful when you

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.397
use it to think
about the questions

01:09:25.397 --> 01:09:26.314
you're able to answer.

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:39.160
So let me just jump.

01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:44.779
So, again, we have
the model fortunately.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:49.470
So we can generate any data
that we want from the model

01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:53.819
and talk about
occupation choice or talk

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:56.280
about financial intermediation.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:02.690
So, at the parameters
we put in, which

01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:07.880
have to do with that LEB thing
you saw in the second lecture,

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:15.720
roughly, we can talk
about moving people

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.590
in the model from autarky
to financial intermediation,

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.190
in other words, changing
their choice problem,

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:27.840
damning them to autarky,
or allowing them to be

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.340
in the intermediated sector--

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:32.280
that's the conceptual
experiment--

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.600
and looking at what happens
to people by occupation.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.100
So we've got guys who are
wage earners before and after.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.690
They're not moving.

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:46.610
And we kind of get their gains.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:50.660
We've got people who move
from the wage-earning category

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:56.492
under autarky to entrepreneurs
under financial intermediation,

01:10:56.492 --> 01:10:57.950
and you'd like to
think about those

01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:02.307
as the talented poor people
who now are able to borrow.

01:11:02.307 --> 01:11:03.890
And then there's
this negative number.

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:05.307
And I looked at
this this morning,

01:11:05.307 --> 01:11:07.340
and I'm like, [? oh, ?]
what's wrong, negative.

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:11.090
And then I remembered,
oh yeah, the subsidy.

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:14.310
So the subsidy is in place here.

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.310
So you can actually
get adverse selection,

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:21.290
if you want to call it that,
of people who really shouldn't

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:24.110
be moving from wage earner to
the entrepreneurial category.

01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:26.720
And it's precisely
those people that

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.330
get impacted on the margin.

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:31.860
These are local average
treatment effects.

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.770
These are people who
are induced to change

01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:38.510
their behavior as a
consequence of the program.

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:43.310
Then we've got people who
are firms no matter what,

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:45.140
and they gain.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:56.400
And, people who are from
entrepreneur under autarky

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.340
to wage earner under
intermediation,

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.480
so these are the not so
talented guys who basically do

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:07.860
switch and do gain as a
result of the program.

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:11.520
So, I mean, so you might think
that, at plausible parameter

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.010
values, you wouldn't see any
of these occupation switchers,

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.690
but you do.

01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:17.220
And, again, the
models that we've

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:20.520
been talking about sort of
assume something like that's

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.070
going on.

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:24.250
That's where the TFP is
coming from, except we

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:26.080
didn't have a subsidy.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.020
Well, maybe China did.

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.720
Maybe we were
removing the subsidy.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.560
OK, this will be even
shorter, but it's

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.420
a nice review in a way.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.330
You remember that
Greenwood and Jovanovic,

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:48.280
the forward-looking model?

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:53.080
People solve stochastic,
dynamic decision problems

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:57.100
to maximize expected utility,
choosing how much to save

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.050
and where to put
their money in terms

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:01.045
of safe or risky
activities or assets.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.130
We're going to put a little
heterogeneity in this discount

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:06.630
rate.

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:10.318
It could be other places.

01:13:10.318 --> 01:13:12.110
Now we're just going
to experiment and see.

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:17.930
So here let beta i be equal to
some common average, beta bar,

01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:24.810
and then some heterogeneity,
unobserved heterogeneity,

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:26.920
that makes beta i
different from beta bar.

01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:33.550
And then we saw this
optimization problem.

01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:38.090
We have savings,
fractions of wealth

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:41.710
to put in sort of safe or risky.

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.390
Or, in this case,
I generalized it

01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:48.310
to entrepreneurial and
wage-earning activities.

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:50.680
You have aggregate
shocks in both.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.350
You have idiosyncratic
shocks in both.

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:56.680
You have a law of
motion for wealth.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:01.300
Wealth today, fraction
saved, fraction

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:06.820
put into risky and safe
gets you wealth tomorrow.

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:10.110
We have two sectors
here, intermediated

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:12.320
and non-intermediated.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.610
The non-intermediated sector
is like this financial autarky

01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:17.090
sector.

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:20.610
So we're going to look for
this value function, W0.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.220
If you're in the
intermediated sector--

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.010
oh, sorry, well,
I'll do the next one.

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:32.440
If you're in the
intermediated sector,

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.630
you're looking for another
value function that

01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:39.120
solves dynamic optimization.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:45.810
Now, for each one of these,
if you were there and destined

01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:49.920
to be there forever with these
constant relative risk-averse

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.490
utility functions, you
have some simple sort

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:58.470
of facts like the savings
rates are constant.

01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:03.702
Savings rates depend on
beta, but give me the beta,

01:15:03.702 --> 01:15:05.160
and I'll give you
the savings rate.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.720
And that's true in
autarky, and it's

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.830
true as well in the financial
intermediated sector, OK?

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.370
But, because it affects
the savings rate,

01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:22.980
it's going to affect income.

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.320
And so part of the
unobserved error

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.850
is going to be the product
of income with this theta i,

01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:31.620
but theta i was that preference
parameter we don't see.

01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:37.580
You with me?

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.520
Hopefully, you can at
least conceptually see

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.620
where we're going.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.880
OK, and so there's--

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.990
similarly, there's a
savings rate and consumption

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:49.990
for the intermediated guys.

01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:55.370
And then you have
the big choice here.

01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:56.900
This is Greenwood and Jovanovic.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.890
So there's this cost Z of
joining the financial system.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:05.360
And, if this cost Z is
sort of a random variable

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.240
in the population, it's
going to affect the choice.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:16.360
The issue is whether
V is greater than W.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:22.570
So, if all of this choosing
were happening only

01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:25.660
in the initial
period at t equals 0,

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.570
then I've got a
valid instrument.

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:32.590
I have something that affects
the choice of intermediation,

01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:35.710
even in this dynamic model.

01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:38.560
And then you're in one
sector or the other.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.580
The savings rates
depend on the error

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.520
term, which depends on theta,
but this occupation choice

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.990
here--

01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:52.180
sorry, this this participation
choice is instrumented with Z.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.030
And Z has nothing to do with
the unobserved preference

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:56.510
heterogeneity.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.790
So I have a valid instrument.

01:16:57.790 --> 01:17:01.900
I have monotonicity, OK?

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.710
However, that was not the
way we dealt with that model

01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:07.210
in the lecture.

01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:11.030
We talked about endogenous
financial deepening.

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:13.700
That makes households
forward-looking,

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.610
planning, potentially, to
join the financial system

01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:18.380
at some future date.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:23.530
Well, now we're in trouble,
even with the same instrument,

01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:27.760
because what we see
prior to the selection

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.910
is the endogenous
evolution of wealth.

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:35.200
And these guys will be saving
up to cover those fixed costs.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.660
It's no longer true that
the savings rates are just

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:40.930
constant fractions of income.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.290
What does it mean for RCTs?

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:48.810
It means you should
try to keep the control

01:17:48.810 --> 01:17:53.020
population in the
dark about the program

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.490
because, if they
know it's coming,

01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:56.212
and they'll eventually
get treated,

01:17:56.212 --> 01:17:58.420
they're going to change
their behavior if they behave

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:01.000
the way they do in the model.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.980
So Ben surprises people
with the road construction

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:09.100
when he dug up the dirt to see
what the pavement was made of.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.860
That happened after the fact.

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.350
He didn't tell them he
was going to do beforehand

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:18.100
for obvious reasons.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.565
But it's very hard in the
field to maintain this

01:18:21.565 --> 01:18:23.190
because people want
to know why they're

01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:25.190
answering all the questions
in the questionnaire

01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:26.760
and not getting the program.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.960
They're not even supposed
to know about the program.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:35.610
You know, there are
ways to try to fix it.

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:40.168
Now it's true that, if
you had like a surprise,

01:18:40.168 --> 01:18:42.210
even though they're
following this dynamic model,

01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:47.130
you say, oh, today is
we got a special deal.

01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:49.920
It's not going to be
repeated tomorrow.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.140
Then you have this
one-time-off experiment.

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:56.040
You have this Z that's lowered
that they got surprised,

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.010
that prior behavior isn't
influenced by it, that will

01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:01.613
induce selection and so on.

01:19:01.613 --> 01:19:02.530
Well, what am I doing?

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:05.640
I'm just reviewing, in a
way, what we've already done

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.810
with these kinds of models.

01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:09.810
This one is dynamic,
but putting it

01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:14.460
in the language of when RCTs
and instruments will work

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.890
and what to be kind
of leery about.

01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:23.090
I honestly don't see how you
can talk about IV or RCTs,

01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:25.660
random as they may
be, without having

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:29.350
some framework in your head
to think about the model.

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:37.320
And the rest I'll skip.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.520
It's about that financial
expansion in Spain.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.390
I'll tell you the key
insight the IO guys had,

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:48.420
which is, basically, you
worry about an equilibrium

01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:50.690
where everyone is
anticipating everybody else.

01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:53.760
You say, well, hey, if you
believe it's an equilibrium,

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.430
then it ought to be in the data.

01:19:56.430 --> 01:20:00.150
So you start running
reduced form regressions

01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:06.150
of how your competitors behave
as a function of what you did.

01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:08.010
And that's kind
of the forecasting

01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.550
aspect, which you can bring
into the individual problems.

01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:15.390
I know it sounds a
bit counterintuitive,

01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:17.790
but, basically,
the reason it works

01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:20.430
is because everyone is
getting these shocks.

01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:23.370
So no node-- you know,
you can be at any node

01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:26.310
and go to any other node
because there's always

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:28.545
a shock that's going to
rationalize that choice.

01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:36.310
It's like Hutz and
Sedlacek way back when.

01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:40.410
And it's the foundation of
these discrete choice models.

01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:42.390
Now that doesn't always work.

01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:44.730
And the last thing I
won't even tell you

01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:46.770
is a situation
where it might fail.

01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:49.860
So the point was
not to drive nails

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.140
in the coffin of one
way of doing business.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:55.090
The point was to have
an open conversation

01:20:55.090 --> 01:20:58.060
and have everything
on the table and so

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:00.910
to increase our sensitivity.

01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:02.850
If you don't think
heterogeneity is--

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:05.610
unobserved heterogeneity
is a big deal,

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.610
that would help you
a lot, but, when

01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:10.440
we looked at the
impact of microcredit,

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.620
we saw a lot of
heterogeneity in outcomes,

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.535
whether it was Hyderabad
or Thailand or Morocco.

01:21:18.535 --> 01:21:22.220
That seems to suggest this
selection on unobservables

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:25.580
is quite important.

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.460
OK, good.

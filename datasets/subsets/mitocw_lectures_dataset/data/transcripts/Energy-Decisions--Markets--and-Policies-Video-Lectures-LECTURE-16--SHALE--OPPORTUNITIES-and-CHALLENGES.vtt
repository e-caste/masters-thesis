RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
For those of you

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.870
who don't read The Times
back to front every day,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.960
there was a terrific
section that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.230
relates to today's lecture.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.990
It didn't give me nice
cases as Don's did,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:44.230
but the headline captures a lot
of what goes on in the section,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.090
and a lot of what
we'll talk about today.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.470
The headline is, "Fuel to burn--

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.260
now what?"

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.710
So I'm going to talk about
shale and its implications,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.260
and what it's done to
the energy universe

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.370
in the last couple of years.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.390
But first, I've got
some unfinished business

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.330
from last time, a couple of
questions I didn't answer.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.400
Prosper asked whether
anybody was still

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.630
making coal gas in the
old-fashioned, manufactured

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.590
gas, town gas, heat it
and use the results style.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.370
And I couldn't find anybody.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.380
I looked around.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.810
I did the usual kind
of web crawling.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.940
But what I did find is a lot of
people that have made and are

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.410
making gas from wood.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.530
This is a reactor
being sold by a company

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.400
in South Africa that's sold
it to a number of locations--

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.280
wood pellets to make gas,
sometimes for a vehicle,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.050
sometimes for use in gas mains.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.970
And this one, this
is from Wikipedia,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.130
but I couldn't resist it--
this is a North Korean

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.730
wood-powered truck.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.340
But if you browse
around, there are

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.360
a lot of examples during
World War II where

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.510
these reactors were put on
cars that were then converted

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.300
to run on wood because
you couldn't get gasoline

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.400
in continental Europe
in World War II.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.050
So it's not a novel technology.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.930
It's not your first-choice
technology for vehicles,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.950
but in places that have a lot
of wood and not much else,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.850
it apparently is an interesting
and used technology.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.470
There are plenty of vendors.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.920
There plenty of examples.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.370
So wood gasification-- but
I couldn't find anybody

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.290
who's doing coal commercially.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.060
So that's unfinished item one.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.260
Unfinished item two was CO2
emissions. [? Siddhartha ?]

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.900
asked about how fossil fuels
compare, and I kind of mumbled,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.160
you will recall.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.280
It turns out if you think
about it a little bit

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.430
beyond the mumble stage,
it's not a simple question.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.120
You can do emissions per BTU.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.260
You burn the stuff.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.080
What do you get per BTU?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.090
And that's the
carbon-hydrogen mix

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.520
in the fuel, which
varies slightly.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.260
So you see coal has about
75% more emissions per BTU

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.520
than natural gas.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.830
And petroleum-based fuels
are somewhere in between.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.550
But of course, you don't
buy fuels for BTUs.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.870
You buy fuels for some
purpose, some energy service.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.150
You will recall, we don't
actually, most of us,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.310
live for BTUs alone.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.860
So home heating-- that
would be a good comparison,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.570
but suppose you want
to do electricity.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.170
Well, then you have to think
about how efficiently you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.420
can use them in electricity.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.340
You'll note that a gas
combined cycle plant is

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.320
more efficient than a
traditional coal/steam turbine

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.700
plant.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.910
So that means in terms
of per kilowatt hour,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.060
the advantage to
gas over coal grows.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.550
And you think about
gas-powered automobiles

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.280
versus gasoline-powered
automobiles-- again,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.070
there's a difference
in engine efficiency.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.140
But even that, you've got
to think about the emissions

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.230
in producing it if you want
to do this kind of comparison.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.959
And I haven't really
seen a good study

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.839
that lets you get to
that third level--

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.980
so good question.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.440
Easy answer here, somewhat
easier answer, somewhat harder

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.280
answer here.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.190
Can't answer that.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.620
Any questions or comments
on either of these first two

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.120
topics?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.450
OK, let me go to shale.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.460
So the new technology
that really has changed--

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.910
but it isn't a new technology.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.850
So let me be a little
bit clear about that.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.120
But this is horizontal drilling
and hydraulic cracking,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.960
called fracking.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.860
So there are sort
of two pieces to it.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.270
One is the ability to
drill deep into shale.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.540
This little example shows
shale 7,000 feet deep,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.280
in this case, the Marcellus.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.390
I think this is from the
PennEnvironment thing.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.690
And to do horizontal drilling--
horizontal drilling is not that

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.660
new, but it's relatively new--

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.870
and then to put down fluid,
which I'll talk about in a bit,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.220
under pressure to make
cracks in the shale, which

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.900
permits gas and/or oil to
come back into the pipe.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.410
Fracking, if you just drill
down and crack horizontally,

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.450
has been done for a long time.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.920
Horizontal drilling
has been done

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.450
for a relatively long time.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.550
Putting the two pieces together
has had a revolutionary impact.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.350
I caution you,
"The Times" repeats

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.410
what the president said in his
State of the Union message,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.850
which is, DOE started
all of this in the '80s.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.460
This drives people in
the industry crazy.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.460
They say, DOE invested a
few dollars in the '80s,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.880
and then a whole bunch
of little US companies

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.900
have invested a lot since then
to actually make this work.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.920
So big firms like Exxon did
not have this technology.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.470
They're busy buying small firms.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.340
Does this sound like a familiar
story from Don's discussion?

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.510
I mean, little guys experimented
and experimented and got it

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.140
to work.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.170
So most of this fluid--

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.680
and we'll come back to
this-- is water and sand,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.030
but there's other stuff.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.980
And what other stuff varies
from producer to producer,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.050
and is the source of a
good deal of controversy.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.720
But it's mostly water and sand.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.250
And what this does is it makes
it economical to extract gas

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:04.250
and oil from 7,000, 10,000-foot
underground shale deposits.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.750
Now, it's not just that
it's possible-- it's cheap.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.810
And cheap is the story.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.960
Now, there's shale
around the world.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.430
This is what one
installation looks like.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.130
This would be called the "pad."

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.120
And what normally happens
is you drill multiple wells

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.950
from a single pad.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.990
So they might go
underground this direction,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.670
and this direction,
and whatever.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.170
So you cover an area with
multiple wells from a pad.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.220
When you pump the water down
under pressure, it comes back--

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.420
there's a shock.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.900
And it comes back not only
with the stuff you put down,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.210
but with stuff it picks up--

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.330
various underground minerals,
and chemicals, and occasionally

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.940
something's radioactive
or something's toxic.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.240
It is then typically,
I assume, piped--

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.440
although I don't see pipes.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:04.160
It's piped to a holding
pond, and from there it's

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.540
interesting-- in this picture,
it's being trucked away.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.600
Sorry, the water is
stored in a pit or a pond,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.210
and then taken to
a treatment plant.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.330
What's often done
with it instead

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.320
is it's injected
underground in a deep well.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:29.430
So the water either gets
treated out of this pond

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.549
or it gets, either
here or someplace else,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.890
dumped back into
something that'll hold it

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.909
underground, some formation
where you might otherwise

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.070
store CO2, for instance.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.549
But those are the
two possibilities.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:49.710
So questions about the basic
story here, the basic process?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.620
Yeah.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.203
AUDIENCE: It
[? prevents ?] the ground

00:08:54.203 --> 00:08:56.238
after you start to [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:56.238 --> 00:08:58.530
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
the gas has come up with it,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.990
so you're basically
taking the gas off,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.900
and then you take the water.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.090
Yeah, no, this is not full of
commercially recoverable gas.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.780
Yeah, Jacob.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.447
AUDIENCE: What kind
chemicals and fluids

00:09:10.447 --> 00:09:12.000
do you typically pump?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, usually a surfactant

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.020
of some sort to reduce
surface tension, to make

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.330
it more easily penetrate.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.610
In some cases, people have put
benzene and various petroleum

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.050
products down.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.420
This causes a lot
of distress, as you

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.880
could imagine, but usually--

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.680
usually-- some surfactant
and other stuff.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.310
For the little guys, this has
been sort of a secret sauce.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.820
It's mostly water and sand.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.030
And I'm not going to tell
you what the rest is, haha.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:59.300
Well, what's missing here
is this might be an aquifer,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.460
so there might be
groundwater issues.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.170
And we're going to
talk about this--

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.740
usually not coming up
from 7,000 feet down.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.700
The aquifers are higher.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.780
But if the well's
integrity is breached,

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.120
stuff can come
out from the well.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.370
And that happens.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.660
OK, anything else?

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.450
All right, so
that's the picture.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:28.210
So this process now makes
it economical to extract

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.310
oil and natural gas from shale.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.410
Where is the shale?

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.830
The key thing is this gray bar.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:41.710
The height is the amount
of shale gas recoverable.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:47.230
The black is coalbed methane,
which is also doable.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.050
But the new thing
is the gray bar.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.800
And you will notice
we have a lot of it.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.000
There's not that much in the
Middle East, some, presumably,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.950
in Africa, but
little exploration,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.980
some in Latin America, a lot of
it over here in Asia-Pacific,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.870
which is mostly China.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.920
So China appears to
have a lot of shale.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.340
We got really lucky.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.200
We have enormous amounts
of shale from which

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.930
this stuff is recoverable.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.320
Australia often refers to
itself as "The Lucky Country."

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.570
In this one we got lucky.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:28.120
Europe-- this, I
believe, is OECD Europe,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:37.480
and that is mostly Poland,
which is starting to work on it.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.760
So where is it in the US?

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.570
Well, the good news and the
bad news is, a lot of it

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.350
is near where demand is,
as opposed to, say, wind

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.590
or solar that tend to be in the
desert or in the high plains.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.700
A big play here
is the Marcellus,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.260
and that's New York, and
Pennsylvania, and Ohio,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.110
and in this Eastern region.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.730
That's enormous.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.570
That's just an enormous
amount of recoverable gas.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.610
The other play that
people talk about,

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.860
other plays that
people talk about,

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.950
are the Bakken up here,
mostly in North Dakota.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.860
The Bakken has a
lot of oil that is

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.940
being recovered using this
same technique, as well as gas.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.370
There are not a lot of
pipelines out of North Dakota,

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:35.320
and as we will see, that's a
problem, but oil you can move.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.440
Oil's valuable enough.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.950
You can find a way to move it.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:44.000
The other places are the
Barnett, the Barnett shale,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.600
a lot of which is-- oh, yeah,
there are a lot of people

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.910
up here in the Marcellus.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.840
Some of this is rural.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.610
Some of it's near urban areas.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.890
You read that
PennEnvironment document.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.370
They talk a lot about
schools, libraries, and stuff.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.810
Down here in Texas,
a lot of it's

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.150
not near anything,
which is all good.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.680
And in the Bakken, a lot
of it's not near anything.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.560
I think the Eagle Ford
supposedly has a lot of oil.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.770
But people have been doing
various kinds of fracking

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.050
in Texas, not
necessarily horizontal,

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:20.510
but vertical and
experimental, for a long time.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.930
Nobody's drilled for
anything in the East

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.660
since the first Pennsylvania
oil field went dry

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.280
in the 19th century.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.440
Well, I'll say a little more.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.530
As you see, there
are plays elsewhere,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.370
in Arkansas, for instance,
there's some action.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:44.390
But this is the Marcellus, is
what people talk about a lot.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:49.370
The Bakken there's a lot of
action, and then down in Texas,

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.840
with a little bit elsewhere,
little bit in California.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.400
Colorado-- again, people have
been doing this in Colorado

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:55.940
for a while.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.950
The reserves are smaller.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.820
And I don't know much
about most of the others.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.690
Comments or
reactions about this?

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:11.390
OK, so what's all this done?

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:15.200
Well, it's created a boom.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.500
This is a map of
wells in Pennsylvania

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:24.950
through the end of 2010.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.660
You see their trajectory--

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:33.170
27 wells drilled in 2010,
then 161, then 785, then 1445,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:37.730
and 3,000 wells in the ground
producing by April of 2011,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.515
with rapid permitting going on,
concentrated in a few areas.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.980
Similar story elsewhere--
the Pennsylvania folks

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.770
just happened to have
provided a convenient map.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:57.065
So you have a drilling boom
to get at this resource.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.070
What's it done?

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.860
Well, it's depressed gas prices.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.120
You may recall last time,
this is a Henry Hub price.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.860
Last time, this graph
cut off about here.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.740
This is the result.
This is the rest of it.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:23.630
We're down in the neighborhood
of $2 per million BTUs, where

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.394
the normal price was
tending to be around 10,

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:32.400
eight, 10, was what people
thought was sort of normal.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.460
And again, if you go
back to the Pennsylvania

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.440
figure, the drilling,
this is all since--

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.050
it just began in 2007.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.980
There is no pre-2007
drilling in Pennsylvania,

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:51.800
and there are more than 3,000
wells, probably 4,000 by now,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.620
producing.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.660
So this has come on
very fast, very big,

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.720
and in parts of the
country where people live.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.170
And it's depressed
the natural gas price.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.310
To go to a question that
we discussed last time,

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.970
this is arguably old business,
but just to do an oil--

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:16.490
oh, yeah, people in the
business say what happened,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.460
the reason we're at $2, is a
lot of people got very excited.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.620
This happens in
businesses like this--

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.940
everybody drills a well.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.420
All of a sudden, oh, my god,
we've drilled too many wells.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.670
It's not profitable,
most people say,

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:34.130
to get at this gas at $2 a
million cubic BTU, but at $4

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.680
it is, and at $6 it is.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.450
Somewhere in the
four to six range

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.780
is where people look for
a long-run equilibrium.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.780
Drilling will slow
down for gas alone.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.350
Demand will pull the price
up, blah, blah, blah.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.600
So they look at the four
to six range, as opposed

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.240
to the eight to 10
to higher range,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.340
as a place where gas
will settle down.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.850
And there is a lot of it.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.280
There's controversy
about how much there is.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.700
So one thing it did was
to depress the gas price.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.890
It drove an interesting
wedge between gas and oil.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.540
So this is another one
of these comparisons.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:18.650
If you just look at dollars
per BTU, which I caution

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.200
is kind of a crude measure,
because not all BTUs

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.819
are created equal.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.589
Gasoline is better
for automobiles

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.230
because you can have a higher
energy density and a longer

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.160
range, and so forth, and it's
easier to transport per BTU.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.470
So oil has a variety
of advantages,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:38.240
but if you just look at BTUs,
then the conversion factor

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.810
is apparently 5.825, which
references tend to agree on.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.490
So that means if gas
is $2 a million BTUs,

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.830
that translates into
$11.65 a barrel of oil.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:18:00.550
But when gas hit $2 recently
over here, oil was over $100.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.810
So that says in BTU terms,
the difference right

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.910
now is enormous.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:13.130
If you can find a way to use
the gas BTUs and not oil BTUs,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.692
it makes a big difference.

00:18:16.692 --> 00:18:18.650
And it makes a difference
in a lot of settings.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.483
I have a colleague--

00:18:19.483 --> 00:18:21.830
I haven't seen the
paper, but he says

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.070
it's straightforward
that a natural gas

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.970
car dominates an electric car.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.580
An all electric car, you've got
to have an expensive battery,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.550
it has limited range, dadada,
you've got to plug it.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.740
And natural gas,
you need a tank.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.490
Engine is trivial to modify.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.200
It doesn't cost much more,
and the range is also limited,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.830
but it's about the same.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.330
So why would you buy an electric
car when you can buy a gas car?

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.140
Well, we'll see.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.710
They're not subsidized yet.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.210
We'll see.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.920
But anyway, this is a big deal.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.100
Again, historically, there
are gaps between oil and gas.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.250
They don't track precisely
because as I mentioned

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.030
last time, you don't really have
electric utilities substituting

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.390
every five minutes
between oil and gas.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.650
But this is pretty
much unheard of.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:14.480
That difference in price
per BTU is unheard of.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.280
And it's opened in the
last couple of years.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.620
So that has implications.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.780
And again, "The Times" talks
about this without the picture.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.075
The other thing it
does is look at this.

00:19:27.075 --> 00:19:33.510
This is the Energy Information
Administration's Annual Energy

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.270
Outlook Early Release,
which came out

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.180
either January or February.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.800
It says this is their
projection for future production

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.430
of natural gas.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.750
This brown thing on
the top is shale.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.250
I mean, look at
it-- there's nothing

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:58.020
going on here until about 2006,
2007, and then it explodes.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:03.180
And by 2035, it
accounts for almost half

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.280
of total US production.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:13.860
Previous work sort of focused on
these, just plain old gas, gas

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.260
that you get with
oil, coalbed methane--

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:22.230
steady decline, increase
in demand, lots of imports.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.440
Tight gas, which is
related, is going up,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.430
but shale gas is
projected to explode.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.870
I happened to look because I was
updating last year's lecture,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.240
and I had a graph
like this last year.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.440
The graph last year showed--

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:47.520
this was, again, circa
last March or April--

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.240
it showed the US being a
net importer of natural gas

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.060
through 2035.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.920
Again, this was a year ago.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.070
It projected big increases
in shale, but not

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.960
enough to offset
demand, and said

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.660
we would be an
importer through 2035.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.060
The current projection
a year later

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.290
is we'll be a net exporter
of liquefied gas by 2016.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.780
We'll be a net
exporter overall--

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.450
pipeline and
liquefied-- by 2021.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.660
That's in a year.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.680
That's unheard of,
just to be clear.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.410
That's a dramatic,
dramatic change.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.780
I think when I taught
this two years ago,

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.690
I'm not sure we mentioned shale.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.280
Anyway, the other thing is it
has had an impact also on oil.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.850
If you look at oil,
US production of oil,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.920
as we discussed early
in the semester,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.130
has been in long-term decline.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:49.830
in large part because of shale
and related developments,

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:55.080
they now project a pretty steady
increase in US production.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.927
And this is not,
oh, my god, we've

00:21:56.927 --> 00:21:59.010
authorized deepwater
drilling or oh, my god, we're

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:04.650
drilling the National Wildlife
Refuge on the North Slope.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.420
This is under current policy.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.920
This is under current policy
we will produce lots more oil.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:22.990
OK, what's good about this?

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.810
What are the benefits?

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.608
We'll come to cost in a minute,
but is this a good thing?

00:22:28.608 --> 00:22:29.650
Why is this a good thing?

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:30.434
Maxwell.

00:22:30.434 --> 00:22:31.482
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:31.482 --> 00:22:33.190
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It'll get us energy.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.200
It'll move us toward
energy independence

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.140
if we use the natural
gas in transportation,

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.450
energy security, rather.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:45.010
It'll affect our balance
of payments regardless.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.370
But since most of our gas
imports are from Canada--

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.250
I know they're shaky up
there-- but to the extent

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.610
we use it in transportation, you
really get some energy security

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.870
benefits.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.760
And let me just expand
on that a little bit,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.500
because I know other
people want to talk.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.520
One of the interesting things in
here that I hadn't focused on--

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.590
in "The Times," rather--

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.350
they talk about the
garbage truck market.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.020
Garbage trucks are
perfect for this.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.880
They're centrally fueled.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.250
They're in use for
a few hours a day.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.350
It's perfect.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.350
And given the price difference,
the fuel price difference,

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.900
they said something like half
of garbage trucks sold now

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.550
are natural gas compatible.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.090
A third of buses sold now
are natural gas compatible.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:32.110
So you do expect a
reasonable amount of use

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.940
in transportation.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.400
That'll reduce our imports,
improve the trade balance,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.610
and improve energy security.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.920
Anything else?

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.870
Yeah.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.458
AUDIENCE: Reduction
in emissions.

00:23:41.458 --> 00:23:43.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Reduction
in emissions, we'll get.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.230
I want to come back to that
later because that's an issue.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.750
You expect it to reduce
CO2 emissions as we

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.300
move from coal to natural gas.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.800
There's some
controversy there and I

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.760
want to come back to that.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.260
Jessica.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.056
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
resource, but you

00:23:57.056 --> 00:23:59.348
have mostly infrastructure
layout [INAUDIBLE] so you're

00:23:59.348 --> 00:24:02.642
taking [INAUDIBLE]
or it's easier,

00:24:02.642 --> 00:24:07.222
there's less of a barrier
to entrance [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:07.222 --> 00:24:08.680
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
You don't have

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.350
too much of a
chicken/egg problem

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.230
because you do have the pipeline
infrastructure in place--

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.450
not everywhere, and we'll
see that in a second.

00:24:19.517 --> 00:24:21.100
You do have to put
in, if you're going

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.600
to do it in
transportation, you have

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.800
to put in refueling stations.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.460
"The Times" argues that to do
it effectively and trucking--

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.380
forgetting about garbage
trucks and so forth

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.600
that you can pretty
much do now--

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.030
to do it for interstate
trucking you need, they said,

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.720
2,800 fueling stations on
the major truck routes.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.970
And people are building them.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:43.797
David.

00:24:43.797 --> 00:24:45.288
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:49.052 --> 00:24:51.010
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
expect the US industry

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:55.600
to be more competitive
because costs have come down.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.650
There's the other interesting
thing that we tend to forget,

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.760
because we think of natural gas,
particularly in this class, as

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.020
mostly an energy source.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.620
But it's a feedstock for a
variety of chemical processes.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.540
And so a bunch of the industries
that use that as a feedstock--

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.940
plastics, importantly,
but others--

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.160
are moving back to the
US because it's so much

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.300
cheaper here than elsewhere.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.980
So you're getting natural gas
based manufacturing moving

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.440
back, not only because
energy costs are

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.450
down but because
feedstock costs are down.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:32.950
Anything else?

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:33.650
Ryan.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
American jobs.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.490
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Jobs--

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.750
I've got a great
graphic on that,

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.690
that I'll show you in a minute.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.420
But that's normally
the first thing--

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.760
in Congress it's the
first thing they say--

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.310
this is jobs.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:53.830
OK, I think we have most of
the benefits, but not all.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.330
Anything else
anybody can think of?

00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.890
Oh, sorry, yes, Kirsten.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.598
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
continue to explore

00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:04.340
[INAUDIBLE] increases, so in
the future [INAUDIBLE] prices

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.257
to be less volatile
[INAUDIBLE] in the ground?

00:26:06.257 --> 00:26:08.215
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It
might be less volatile.

00:26:08.215 --> 00:26:09.010
I think so.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.560
But you still have this
short-run inelastic demand,

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.390
inelastic supply issue.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.750
And a really cold winter
or really warm winter

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.140
can have an impact.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.980
They do store gas, not
just in the big tanks

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.860
you see when you drive
south along the waterfront.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.780
But it's stored in
underground caverns

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.040
and has been for a long time.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.150
So you would hope that the
volatility will go down

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.440
because we're a little bit
out of the world market.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.080
Yeah, didn't have that.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.470
Anything else?

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.970
Yeah.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.053
AUDIENCE: Would that mean
money for the government

00:26:39.053 --> 00:26:41.550
in terms of royalties?

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:44.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It might
if it comes from federal lands.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.100
Suppose it comes
from private lands.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.490
I have friends who inherited
an otherwise useless ranch

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:55.380
in Texas and were told there's
natural gas under your land.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.600
We'd like to drill.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.860
They like that, because they
weren't going to live there.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.390
In fact, nobody
was living there.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.300
And they're happy
to cash that check

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.530
when it comes in every month.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.095
So it's money for the
government in revenues,

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:11.220
depending on the royalties.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.500
It could be money
from landowners.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.110
And that's everything
except something

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:22.580
that we haven't talked
about and you might not

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.340
pick up until we've
talked about electricity.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:32.060
And that is one of the
issues of bringing in wind

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:38.510
and solar is they vary and
they vary unpredictably.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.810
So you need resources
that can respond to that.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.160
I mean, storage would be swell.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.420
Storage is the Holy Grail.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.210
We don't have
storage economically.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.990
So what you tend to use is
you tend to use gas turbines.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.200
And gas turbines, if you recall
from-- not combined cycle,

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.000
but old gas turbines--

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.620
and on an earlier slide I
had the efficiency of those.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.430
And it's not high,
but they're quick.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.840
Well, this reduces the
running cost of the devices

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.840
you will use to use
more wind and solar,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.700
and thus makes it
easier to integrate

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.260
wind and solar into the system.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.280
Jacob, you had a point?

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.947
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was just going
to say I hope you're going down

00:28:15.947 --> 00:28:18.335
the path of it provides
baseload power for [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:18.335 --> 00:28:20.210
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It
can provide baseload.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.460
It provides, as we were
saying, lower emissions

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.180
baseload power, particularly
the combined cycle stuff.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.831
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] used
to turn on and off really

00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:30.535
quickly when the
power demand spikes.

00:28:30.535 --> 00:28:32.660
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And
you use the combined cycle

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.250
stuff for baseload.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.150
You may or may not remember
the brief discussion

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.530
of combined cycle.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.580
We'll probably come back to it.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.830
But when we talked
about Hexion, I

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:53.330
mentioned there were two
sorts of technologies.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.280
And the combined
cycle technology

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.988
is a generating technology,
not unrelated to what

00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:01.280
was going on in Hexion, but
it's generating technology.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.830
You use natural gas or oil
or whatever, but typically

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.530
natural gas, to
run a gas turbine.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.420
The exhaust from the
gas turbine is hot.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.030
You use the exhaust
from the gas turbine

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.240
to heat water to make steam
and you run a steam turbine--

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.160
hence combined cycle.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.180
You can get a lot of efficiency
because you're not putting out

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.500
a high temperature exhaust.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.820
You're not wasting that heat.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.990
You use it.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.000
And you can use it effectively
in a steam turbine.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.930
So that's effective.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:33.560
So the other thing
we didn't talk about

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:40.580
and that's because you don't own
homes, but if you own a home,

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.890
you'll have lower heating costs.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.310
That bill that comes around
in the winter will be lower.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.560
This is a good thing.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.720
I just managed to
persuade my condo

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.510
to convert to gas from oil.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.470
And electricity will be cheaper.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:30:00.980
So for those of us who pay these
bills, that's a good thing.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:06.830
We'll reduce gas and
probably oil imports.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.440
It will reduce it because
there's more production

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.180
but also because you'll be
substituting gas for oil.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.380
US manufacturing-- people get
very excited about a rebirth

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.023
of US manufacturing,
some of which

00:30:23.023 --> 00:30:24.440
is driven by energy,
some of which

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.130
is driven by feedstock prices.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.100
Easier to integrate
wind and solar, money

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.610
for people in rural
Texas for ranches they

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.985
had no intention of living on.

00:30:37.985 --> 00:30:39.110
We're going to talk about--

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.880
I didn't underline
"some," but I probably

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.130
should have underlined "some."

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.910
Fewer neighbors in
rural Texas than,

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.580
say, in urban Pennsylvania--

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.340
that's an issue.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.570
And of course, jobs.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.630
These are pictures
of North Dakota.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:03.020
And this is oil production
in North Dakota.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.720
North Dakota is now the number
four oil-producing state

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:11.760
in the country from pretty
far down the league table.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.830
And for the last three years, I
don't know what the early 2012

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.580
numbers are, but for
the last three years,

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.780
it's had the lowest unemployment
rate in the country.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.880
So if you're from North
Dakota, this is fabulous stuff.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.070
All of a sudden the
land is worth something.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.820
All of a sudden there
are a lot of jobs.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.945
And if you're running a
restaurant, all of a sudden

00:31:30.945 --> 00:31:33.070
there are people who come in.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.540
This is oil production.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.860
This is gas production.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.160
And this is an interesting
graph for a number of reasons.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.660
You see what you
would expect, which

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.560
is natural gas
production goes way up.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.050
But there aren't pipelines.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.570
And this is the
percentage flared.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:55.280
So "not marketed"
means "flared."

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.940
They're burning it.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:04.660
So they're burning, depending
on the month, up to 40%,

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.740
typically above 30%
of the gas produced.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.720
The money is in the oil.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.650
They don't have enough pipeline
capacity to get the gas out

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:18.008
so they burn it,
which is a shame.

00:32:18.008 --> 00:32:19.300
Somebody will build a pipeline.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.890
That's money being burned.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.405
OK, comments?

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.395
But there are issues.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.340
You can find, and
I was going to try

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.700
to do it but my earlier attempts
to link YouTube videos didn't

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.220
work well.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.800
But you can go to go to YouTube,
and most videos on fracking

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.260
look like this.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.250
Somebody pours water,
lights a match, foomp.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:02.020
And earthquakes-- there was
some recent press coverage

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.010
of fracking-related earthquakes.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:10.150
So this is not a completely
benign technology.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:11.548
I mean, neither were railroads.

00:33:11.548 --> 00:33:13.090
Neither were coal-fired
power plants.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:19.500
Neither are automobiles,
but it has issues.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.180
Some of the issues--

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.700
they mostly come
from these features.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:31.080
Some of the fluids
contain toxics,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.160
some of the stuff that's
pumped down-- and again,

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.685
it varies from
player to player--

00:33:36.685 --> 00:33:37.185
is toxic.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.290
The water that
comes up is at least

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.190
as bad as the stuff that went
down, often quite a bit worse.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:51.300
It's got whatever
junk it picked up

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.950
traveling through
thousands of feet of rock.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.620
The wells go through
aquifers often.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.670
You drill down.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.740
You're drilling down
through an aquifer.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.210
That's somebody's groundwater.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.850
That's the well
water that's burning.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.389
Methane has its own toxicities.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:16.070
It is flammable,
per that picture.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.650
And it is a greenhouse gas.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:23.179
So the question that Philip
raised of lower emissions

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:28.295
gets to be a little complicated,
because methane leaks.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.969
So these are the main issues.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:39.019
Let me just walk through some
of the environmental problems.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.300
First is groundwater
contamination--

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:51.920
not that big a deal in Texas,
big deal in Pennsylvania.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.925
They actually have
water in Pennsylvania.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.380
The best evidence I know
says that the problem comes

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.530
from the well bore,
from going down--

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:09.290
that it's very hard
for the gas to leak up

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:13.190
through 7,000 feet of
rock into the groundwater.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.570
But in any case,
there are plenty

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:19.130
of examples where groundwater
has been contaminated.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.990
There's also this
issue of wastewater,

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.955
the stuff that's coming back.

00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:26.300
It's got all kinds
of junk in it.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:33.140
If you don't inject it safely,
if the holding pond leaks,

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.660
if the treatment
isn't adequate, you

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.330
can have that as a
source of contamination.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.280
There is nearby pollution.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.300
There's all this junk.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.550
You're running an industrial
operation-- again,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.070
not necessarily so
terrible in Texas.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.030
Do I have a picture?

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.230
No, I don't?

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:58.690
Not so terrible in some places,
but the methane will be out.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.070
That's not nice stuff.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:04.180
Various other toxic
things come out--

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.160
volatiles in the groundwater.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.078
You get dust, and noise,
and a lot of traffic,

00:36:09.078 --> 00:36:10.120
a lot of vehicle traffic.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.510
You truck the gas out
typically, and find a pipeline.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.880
You don't build a pipeline
to every well site.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:20.670
So it's noisy, and
messy, and dirty.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.580
Does that matter?

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.300
Well, in Pennsylvania
and New York,

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.870
there tend to be a
lot of people around.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:32.120
In North Dakota and
Texas, not so many.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.820
So whether these things are
important or not depends on A,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:39.740
what the well does, and B,
what damages it inflicts.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:44.510
I mean, my friends' ranch,
there's nobody for miles.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.590
So yeah, there's dust, and
dirt, and traffic, and junk,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.190
but it's polluting
the sagebrush.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:56.145
In that PennEnvironment thing,
there are schools, hospitals

00:36:56.145 --> 00:36:56.645
nearby.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:05.650
Methane leakage-- let me
talk about methane leakage.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:09.580
There was just a
piece in "Nature"

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.410
about methane leakage
from one field

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:15.880
that folks managed
to measure well.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.220
And it was like--

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:23.450
not to make up a number-- like
6% of total production leaked.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:27.240
Well, methane is
a greenhouse gas.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.580
We talked about that earlier.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.040
It has a relatively
short half life,

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.210
order of magnitude 10 years--

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.940
quicker than carbon dioxide
to come out of the atmosphere,

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.420
but while it's in
the atmosphere,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:45.770
it's potent, more potent
than carbon dioxide per unit

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.690
of mass, or maybe per
mole, one way or the other.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:52.010
In any case, this is
sort of a serious issue.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:56.300
If you're going to produce this
stuff at scale for a while,

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.550
and dump a lot of methane
in the atmosphere,

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.220
you're going to have
climate implications.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.180
There was a study that
said producing and using

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.830
natural gas via fracking is
worse for the climate than coal

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.400
on a lifecycle basis.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.630
That study was
pretty badly flawed

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:23.030
because it assumed very
inefficient coal plants,

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.890
but if the methane
leakage is high enough,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.810
that could be right.

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.625
And if you use the right
measure of climate damage, which

00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:32.750
I think he used the wrong
measure of climate damage

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.450
as well.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.300
But that's a serious issue.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:45.780
Earthquakes-- "Another
Fracking Earthquake,"

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:46.740
from that t-shirt--

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.410
great t-shirt.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:52.200
Again this year there
were discussions

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.760
of earthquakes in
northeastern Ohio,

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:01.200
thought to be associated
with basically dumping

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.810
all that water deep
underground, kind

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:08.700
of lubricating the formations.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:13.350
An Ohio regulatory authority,
with a lot of consultation

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.760
with geologists, has
verified, they think,

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.630
that in fact, the fracking was
the cause of small earthquakes.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:25.890
But small earthquakes
are earthquakes--

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.910
magnitude 3 kind of
earthquake, for those

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.160
who follow that sort of thing.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.350
In Ohio, they've
responded by saying

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.790
it doesn't always do this.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.950
It does it when it's
injected in certain ways

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.960
into certain formations.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.260
And they have a set of
regulations for Ohio

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.660
that they think
will deal with this.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.030
But it's an issue--

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:54.600
earthquakes, not
everybody's favorite.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.040
How many people have been
through an earthquake?

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.030
Oh, yeah, from California?

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.040
Where?

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.510
All over.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.635
AUDIENCE: Last summer here.

00:40:03.635 --> 00:40:05.927
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
there was a little one here.

00:40:05.927 --> 00:40:07.330
OK, that's true, that's true.

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:10.100
That doesn't count.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:14.510
If it's not magnitude 5 at
least, it doesn't count.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.590
It's a weird feeling.

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:20.630
And in Ohio it doesn't
happen, but it does now.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.530
It does now.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.910
And this one is actually very
interesting if, as I hope

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.480
you did you looked at the
Jacoby et al. article.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:39.170
Their argument is if
you look down the road,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.260
and you're serious
about climate,

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:46.130
you will recall from our
difficult negotiations

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:49.520
the world's going to
need big reductions.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.130
And you can't get
the big reductions

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.340
unless you can figure
out some magical way

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.925
to do transportation.

00:40:56.925 --> 00:40:59.300
But you're not going to get
the big reductions unless you

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.240
get the carbon emissions from
the electric power sector way

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.710
down.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.600
Natural gas doesn't
do that for you.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.300
It gets it down,
but not way down.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.350
But if natural gas
is cheap, then you

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.180
don't build a nuclear
plant, and you

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.890
don't fool around with
nuclear technology

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:19.670
because it's so noncompetitive.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:25.430
And wind and solar require
bigger subsidies to compete.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:29.840
And so the argument is it's
quite possible that cheap shale

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.110
gas will slow the development
of very low-carbon technologies,

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:39.110
and thus be a bridge to nowhere.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.770
We will easily lower the carbon
content of the electric power

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.190
system, and heating,
and other things.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.490
But after a while, we won't
be able to go any farther,

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.680
because we won't have
the technologies we need,

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.040
because they will have been
non-competitive all along,

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.710
and been very expensive
in subsidy terms.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.160
And so this could easily
be a bridge to nowhere

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.850
that stops progress on
climate after a while.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.000
That's why it's a
complicated question.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.600
Short term, yeah, unless
you get a lot of leakage,

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.140
but the long-term
question's really hard.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.980
What's it mean for
wind, solar, nuclear,

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.230
or other carbon-free
technologies?

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:27.260
The European Union,
I learned on Monday,

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:31.270
has a formal plan to
have zero carbon dioxide

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:37.360
emissions from its electric
power sector by 2050--

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.180
zero.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:43.540
And as the presenter said, we
in Europe do a lot of talking.

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.930
But if you do a
projection of what

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:49.560
it takes to get 80% of
reduction in greenhouse gas

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.250
emissions, boy, you better
be pretty low carbon.

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.583
And natural gas won't
get you there no matter

00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:56.250
how cheap it is.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.920
What's the policy [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.570
Questions on any of this?

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.800
Yeah, Max.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
wind, solar, nuclear

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.740
are fairly not competitive
right now, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.100
still develop the technology.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:18.520
So why would we keep
developing [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.900
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, wind and solar

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.650
are being driven by
subsidies, and those subsidies

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:31.040
get to be more expensive as the
alternative gets to be cheaper.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.920
So the argument is
yeah, you could,

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.640
but if you were starting
a wind turbine business,

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.480
you'd have to be really sure
of the subsidies or pretty sure

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.840
that you can get the cost
down so you won't need them.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.740
The lower the cost of gas
is, the harder that second

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.510
is to be sure of.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.000
And the lower the cost
of gas is, in a way,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.290
the first gets shaky because
it becomes hard politically

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.200
to justify subsidizing
wind and solar

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.712
when we're moving into gas
and emissions are going down

00:44:04.712 --> 00:44:05.545
and we're all swell.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.755
Nuclear, I think, is going
to be hit the hardest.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.130
Well, we may talk about nuclear.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.380
And we'll hear about nuclear
from some of your papers.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.690
So I'm looking
forward to learning.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:26.260
But I think what
people do tend to say

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.410
is with gas at these
prices, even forget $2

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:34.580
but $4, boy, is a nuclear
plant out of the money.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.090
And if you don't
build them, it's

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.540
hard to really prove
out the technology.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.220
There's all these
fabulous designs

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.460
for intrinsically safe,
small-scale nuclear plants,

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.710
but unless we build them,
we're not going to know.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.980
And building them gets to be
a more expensive proposition.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.040
So it's hard to do
that nuclear stuff,

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.200
because you really
need to do it at scale.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.410
That means somebody's got
to bear the commercial risk,

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:02.510
and the commercial risk
gets bigger with cheap gas.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.990
So I think that's
the basic issue.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.790
I mean, the government
could say, look,

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:11.500
I think this is so important
we're going to keep doing it.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.390
The Europeans might.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:16.580
I worry about us, and we'll
see about the Europeans.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.207
We'll see about the Europeans.

00:45:18.207 --> 00:45:18.790
Anything else?

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:19.690
Yeah.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.660
AUDIENCE: Does it matter also,
though, if, in a few years,

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.010
we'll have some sort of carbon
tax or something like that?

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:29.080
Because then you
would start arguing

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.767
that whatever emits carbon
will become less competitive.

00:45:32.767 --> 00:45:33.850
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.430
I mean, with a
serious carbon tax--

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:45.330
again, cheap shale,
cheap gas, the advantage

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:49.470
of renewables over
gas-fired power

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:52.980
goes down with the price of
gas, given any carbon tax.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.940
You're right, the carbon
tax widens the gap.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.850
Cheap gas narrows it, so
you need a bigger carbon tax

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.802
to have the same differential.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:12.032
I mean, we all say,
of course, we're

00:46:12.032 --> 00:46:13.740
going to have a carbon
tax at some point.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.532
We have to have a carbon
tax at some point.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.870
I know people who have been
saying that for 20 years.

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:27.550
So I would love
to be young enough

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:30.320
to have the feeling that of
course it'll happen soon.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.920
But I've watched it
not happen for so long.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.720
And I've watched the Republican
Party harden against climate

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.830
so firmly that we'll see.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:46.330
It may take-- those
of us in the area

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.720
speculate from time to time that
it's going to take something

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.700
like an ozone hole.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.890
You recall or you
may not recall.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.600
What led to the
Montreal Protocol

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.100
wasn't all the
brilliant chemical

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.270
work done, a lot of it here
at MIT that won a Nobel Prize.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:05.530
It was the opening of the ozone
hole over the Antarctic, such

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.970
an image.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.035
There's a hole in the ozone?

00:47:09.035 --> 00:47:11.410
Most of us didn't know there
was ozone to have a hole in.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.870
But there's a hole in
the ozone, and it's

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:17.583
letting in all these harmful
rays, and it's getting bigger.

00:47:17.583 --> 00:47:18.625
That was pretty dramatic.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.610
Having the Arctic be
ice-free maybe-- maybe

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:28.000
that'll be dramatic,
but we don't see that.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.790
Ozone hole, you go out,
and you get a suntan,

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.500
and your risk of
skin cancer goes up.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.073
Well, that kind of comes home.

00:47:35.073 --> 00:47:36.490
There aren't any
more polar bears?

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.740
Well, that's too bad,
but I can go to the zoo.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.900
So I don't know what
on the climate side--

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.920
I love polar bears.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.470
Please don't quote me.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:52.240
They're "charismatic
megafauna," as the phrase goes.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.100
It may well take
something like that.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:58.140
Anyway, anything else before
I go to the policy arena?

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:58.875
Yeah.

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:01.725
AUDIENCE: Are the big
players large companies

00:48:01.725 --> 00:48:03.922
or small [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:03.922 --> 00:48:05.880
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: In
terms of this industry?

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like
Chevron [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.443
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
The big companies

00:48:09.443 --> 00:48:11.590
have bought small companies
to get the technology.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.620
So the people who
were big gas producers

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.670
are big gas producers.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.180
Again, there are
still small players.

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.430
There are still small players.

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:24.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] direct
a little R&D money that way.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.010
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I don't know.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:28.365
I don't have the sense--

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:36.770
I could be wrong, but
I don't have the--

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:39.020
and we do sort of
see these folks

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.230
when they come to the Energy
Initiative to fund research.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.330
So we get some sense of
what at least some of them

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:45.500
are interested in.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.490
I hear a lot more
interest in finding

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:52.550
technologies than
extraction technologies,

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:58.010
3D seismic underground
mapping, improvements there,

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.375
rather than better drilling.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.950
It's a young technology, but
it seems surprisingly mature.

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.320
Nobody says, "If only
we could do this."

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.910
The one issue that
people talk about,

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.360
and "The Times" mentions it a
little bit, is the technology

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:19.610
was aimed at gas and it's
not yet tuned for oil.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.260
And there are places
where there's oil,

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.468
but they're getting a ton
of oil out of North Dakota,

00:49:23.468 --> 00:49:25.370
so it's not too badly tuned.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:29.750
So this particular
technology doesn't

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:32.278
seem to be a huge R&D target.

00:49:32.278 --> 00:49:33.320
At least that's my sense.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.100
It's very deep shale.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:41.860
The stuff that would help you
figure out where the gas is

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.940
seems to be higher
on their wish list

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.740
than techniques to get it out.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.050
If they can find it, they
can go down 10,000 feet,

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:50.240
drill sideways, break the
shale, and get the gas

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.830
out, which is pretty amazing.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:50:01.900
The policy arena-- so the
PennEnvironment report

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.550
is pretty good on this.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:06.850
It's a bit of an advocacy
piece, but it's pretty good.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:14.590
You would normally think that
the air stuff would be EPA,

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:17.350
the air pollution
issues I talked about.

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.510
There is a Safe
Drinking Water Act

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:21.140
that you would think
would cover stuff

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.390
that would affect the aquifer.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:25.990
And indeed, it does
in a lot of areas.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:33.110
But there are exemptions to
a lot of federal legislation,

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:36.640
put in place quietly in
the middle of the night,

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.650
that means there's
relatively little EPA can do.

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.840
It can set some standards
for local air emissions.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.910
And it's doing that
for methane emissions.

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:47.690
It will probably have
regs on methane leakage.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:52.640
But the water side is
pretty limited by law.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.150
I mean, it covers a lot of
stuff that pollutes aquifers.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:57.560
It can't get at this.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.070
And even if it
set the standards,

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:05.170
the enforcement would
be at the state level.

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:11.740
And if you think about it,
this is not easy enforcement.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.280
I showed you 2,400 wells
in Pennsylvania-- lots

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.153
more coming.

00:51:17.153 --> 00:51:19.570
How many inspectors do you
think the State of Pennsylvania

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:22.210
has to inspect
natural gas wells?

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:24.760
Well, they haven't
had any natural gas

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.290
drilling in
Pennsylvania or drilling

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.390
for anything in Pennsylvania.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:32.500
So they probably started
out with, let's say zero.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:36.010
And maybe they have a few if
their budget's been generous.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:38.320
So enforcement is a state issue.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.880
The rules about the
fluids are state issues.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.270
EPA can't control that.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:49.750
Rules for that well,
the bore, how well it's

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.540
sealed, how thick the concrete
is, what, kind of concrete

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:56.440
all of the stuff that gets you
down below the aquifer and that

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:00.160
has to be inspected--
that's the state.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:07.020
The experience and attitudes
vary enormously among states.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:11.130
New York, as I'll mention in
more detail, has a moratorium.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.500
You cannot do this in
the State of New York--

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.780
full stop, done.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.770
Pennsylvania is
letting people drill.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.630
Does Pennsylvania
have expertise?

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.430
Does Pennsylvania have
an adequate budget?

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:26.710
Does Pennsylvania
have adequate laws?

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.660
The PennEnvironment
report suggests not.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.800
Others may disagree.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.720
I don't know enough
to have a view.

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:38.350
Texas does oil and gas.

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.450
They've been drilling
and fracking in Texas

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:43.000
for a long time--
not at this scale.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.727
And Texas also has a lot of
rural areas, where it's dusty,

00:52:49.727 --> 00:52:51.310
and it's dirty, and
it's I don't care.

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:52.570
Nobody lives here.

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:53.410
It's a job.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:54.160
There are jobs.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:54.827
That's fabulous.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.100
Some states are revving up.

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.100
There's a lot of
industry interest.

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.470
Texas is now requiring
fluid disclosure.

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.640
I think others are.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.560
There's an interesting
industry split.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:18.170
The small guys
oppose regulation.

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.840
The small guys say, I don't want
to tell you what my fluid is.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.210
I don't want to be inspected.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:24.110
I'm doing a good job.

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:24.735
Leave me alone.

00:53:24.735 --> 00:53:27.690
I'm just a little guy.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.570
You talk to people from
Exxon, and people from Exxon,

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:35.910
and Chevron, and those guys
say, we need regulation.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.625
This is anti-stereotype,
and it's worth

00:53:37.625 --> 00:53:39.000
thinking about
because we'll come

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.850
to public policy
in a little while.

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:43.990
They want regulation.

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:46.167
Why do they want regulation?

00:53:46.167 --> 00:53:48.750
They don't want to see a lot of
those videos of drinking water

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.000
burning.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.670
They don't want a lot of states
to do what New York has done

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:57.160
and say, you can't drill here.

00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:02.790
So the big guys think,
OK, it adds $1 or $2

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:07.270
per million cubic feet, to
control methane emissions,

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:11.680
to inspect the wellbore, to
limit the fracking fluids,

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:17.700
to disclose everything. $1
is nothing to the big guys.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.740
$1 might be something
to the little guys.

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.450
The big guys are
afraid of a backlash.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:25.330
The big guys are afraid,
and you hear them say this

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:26.890
after about two drinks.

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:30.190
This industry could go to
the way of nuclear power.

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:32.680
The public could be so
fed up with earthquakes,

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:36.400
and groundwater pollution,
and burning water coming out

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.400
of faucets, that
we get shut down.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.200
And the country that could have
all this abundant, relatively

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.300
clean energy won't get it.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:53.940
So the big guys are in favor
of sensible regulation.

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.260
There's a lot of industry
best-practice activity.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:01.130
There's a lot of work by
the big guys with the states

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:04.150
to avoid a backlash.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:07.810
Please impose reasonable
costs on this industry

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:09.085
we will still be cheap.

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:15.240
Don't shut it down.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.930
An awful lot in the
environment community

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:21.840
think state
regulation can't work.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.690
Pennsylvania's going to
regulate natural gas drilling?

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.310
They haven't seen a
well for 100 years.

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:28.620
What?

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:33.335
So they say it's
hard to enforce.

00:55:33.335 --> 00:55:35.710
You're going to inspect every
well as it's being drilled.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:37.627
You've got to monitor
the quality of concrete.

00:55:37.627 --> 00:55:39.360
This is a serious
enforcement problem.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.130
They're all over the landscape.

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.820
You can't do it.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.970
Yes, in principle, regulation
might make this safe,

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:49.980
and so forth, and clean,
but you can't do it.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.210
So you should just kill it.

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:54.770
Just kill it.

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:58.070
Again, if you
Google fracking on--

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:03.800
if you look at Google Images
and call for fracking,

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.520
you will get posters
and rallies galore--

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.020
ban it, ban it, ban it.

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.790
Stop fracking in Ohio.

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:14.330
Where else do you see a lot of--

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:15.800
it's banned in New York.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.450
It's banned in France.

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:20.750
It's banned in at
least one German state.

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:23.480
And there are debates
in lots of other places

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.810
that say basically,
it's a moratorium.

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:32.300
If you can prove it's clean
and safe, we'll let it go on.

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:36.110
In North Dakota, it's jobs.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:39.980
In Texas, it's we know this
and nobody lives out there

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.060
on those ranches anyway.

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:43.730
In New York, this is New York.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:45.110
People live here.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:46.870
Pennsylvania, people live here.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.493
Yeah, Jessica.

00:56:47.493 --> 00:56:50.160
AUDIENCE: How long could they go
using the natural gas reserves?

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.948
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: The ones
we have now, the shale gas?

00:56:53.948 --> 00:56:55.580
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.740
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Hard to know--

00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:01.460
what we're getting are estimates
of probably recoverable

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.390
reserves.

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:05.000
Proved reserves are much
lower, but estimates

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.750
are hundreds of years.

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:11.010
It's just a lot of
gas at low cost.

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:19.880
So what that thought leads to,
and the fact that it's cheap

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:24.190
leads to, it may be
impossible to kill

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:29.590
because the economic benefits
are so large that politically

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:32.110
it may be hard to kill.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:34.150
But suppose everybody
in Pennsylvania

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:37.450
has their water burn
when it comes out of the.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:42.650
Tap will New York
drop its moratorium?

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:44.390
Probably not.

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:46.590
Will Ohio impose a moratorium?

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.780
Probably.

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:53.610
So if you can't make it safe--

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:54.860
what's a little burning water?

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:55.652
I mean it's things.

00:57:55.652 --> 00:58:01.610
But anyway, think about the
stuff we breathe every day.

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:02.720
But that's dramatic.

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.240
That's a YouTube video.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:11.400
The PennEnvironment report has
sort of a balanced proposal.

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.620
It talks about
there's another part

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:16.550
of the environmental community.

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:19.480
It clearly couldn't be
killed in Pennsylvania.

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.613
It's 3,000 producing wells
and 10 a day being permitted.

00:58:22.613 --> 00:58:23.530
What, are you kidding?

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:24.572
We're going to kill this?

00:58:24.572 --> 00:58:26.560
I don't think so, not now.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.810
So they say what you
need to do is eliminate

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:30.640
these federal
exemptions so EPA can

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.630
play a role for groundwater.

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:37.780
And they have a number of very
specific suggestions, which

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.510
I don't want to go in,
for tightening regulation

00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:42.670
in Pennsylvania, like not
letting this stuff happen

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:46.570
near a school or near a hospital
just because there is increased

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:49.540
local pollution, no
matter what you do,

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:54.310
and giving the agency
some money to enforce.

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:56.410
It's easy to write rules.

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:58.000
Enforcement takes people.

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:03.160
And then finally, that
lovely interview with Fred

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:07.290
Krupp from the
Environmental Defense Fund.

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:10.140
As we'll talk about later,
the Environmental Defense Fund

00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:13.860
has played a very
interesting role historically

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:17.970
in making environmental
policy in this country,

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.430
to the extent possible,
economically sensible.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:29.130
And Krupp argues you can't
do anything in Washington,

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:33.030
so to say the EPA
should play a role--

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:37.400
of course, it should, but
you can't get that passed.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.470
You can't get
sensible legislation

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:40.580
passed in Washington.

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:45.410
You can't get those loopholes
closed, at least not now .

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.210
And you probably
shouldn't kill it

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:50.930
because the benefits
are so large.

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:54.080
I think underlying that
is a realist saying,

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.500
you probably can't kill it
because the economic benefits

00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.610
are so large for so many people.

00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:03.930
So there really isn't any choice
but to work with the states.

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:05.870
Encourage the states
to talk to each other.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:11.120
Encourage the big producers
to work with industry.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.630
So that's sort of the
policy environment, I think.

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:15.440
Reactions?

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.300
Comments?

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.400
Anything?

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.960
OK, let me throw the floor open.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.540
Suppose we were lucky
enough or unfortunate enough

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:27.640
to have shale in Massachusetts.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.660
You're an MIT students.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:31.000
You can march on
the State House.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.220
You can get TV time.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.450
You can make noise.

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:38.380
What do you do?

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.780
Drill, baby, drill--
we need the jobs.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.460
We need the benefits.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:43.678
Let's be real.

01:00:43.678 --> 01:00:44.470
Let's make it hard.

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:46.210
It's not under Boston.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:47.232
That would be too easy.

01:00:47.232 --> 01:00:48.940
They're never going
to drill under Paris.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.773
But suppose the shale
is in the western part

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:54.280
of the state, which has
been chronically depressed.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.830
Suppose that's
where the shale is,

01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:58.848
the western part, not
the Berkshires, kind

01:00:58.848 --> 01:00:59.890
of central Massachusetts.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:04.450
Pittsfield, has anybody
been to Pittsfield?

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:06.250
You've been to
Pittsfield, all right.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:07.388
Are you from Pittsfield?

01:01:07.388 --> 01:01:08.680
AUDIENCE: It's near Tanglewood.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.472
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It is near Tanglewood.

01:01:10.472 --> 01:01:11.290
Tanglewood is nice.

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:14.020
Pittsfield, well, MASS
MoCA, but otherwise

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.410
been depressed for a long time.

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.930
We've got shale in Pittsfield,
in the central part

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:23.740
of Massachusetts where
there are no jobs,

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.140
and you're going to
march on the State House.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.472
Alex, was that your hand I saw?

01:01:29.472 --> 01:01:31.014
AUDIENCE: I was
going to say, I think

01:01:31.014 --> 01:01:34.460
if there is a way to do it
safely, if they can figure out

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.514
how to do it so your
faucet isn't burning,

01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:39.410
then I think it
would be [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:41.484
But otherwise, I
don't think it's worth

01:01:41.484 --> 01:01:42.780
it if you're causing more
problems to all the people

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.770
who live there.

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.760
Because there are a lot
of people in [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.650
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Even in Pittsfield.

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:51.320
So would you
advocate a moratorium

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.680
until we know for sure
how to do it safely?

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.355
AUDIENCE: I'd advocate
for regulations.

01:01:57.355 --> 01:01:59.730
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Are we
sure we know how to regulate?

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:00.570
AUDIENCE: No.

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:02.280
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.890
OK, but you would say
at the very least,

01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:06.840
the state ought to
acquire some expertise.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.450
We ought to have
a legal framework.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:09.992
I mean, nobody's
drilled for anything

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:12.960
but water in
Massachusetts ever, so we

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.170
don't have anybody who
knows about deep wells

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:19.110
or groundwater conta-- well,
we know about groundwater

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.160
contamination.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.930
OK, anybody else?

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:25.860
Arianna.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.610
AUDIENCE: My parents have a
house in upstate [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.170
New York.

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.610
And a couple of years
ago, actually, our town

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:37.770
exploded the
anti-fracking [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:43.150
We were on literally
everyone's yard.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:45.630
And I think that
even though there

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:50.970
are a lot of large-scale
benefits, in the end,

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:52.600
I think it's great
to do in Texas

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.900
and places where people
don't really live.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:59.820
But there is a large segment
of not in my backyard.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:05.670
And we like our house,
and primary residence

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:06.780
in New York City.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.880
Part of it, I know, is
that it's nicer and clean.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.070
The air is clean, and getting
to spend some time with nature,

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:14.570
I guess.

01:03:16.903 --> 01:03:19.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I hope
you have some nature up there.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:19.820
Yeah

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.930
AUDIENCE: Lots of trees.

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:27.540
But the idea it's great if
energy prices fall, but I

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.690
don't want it at my expense.

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:32.460
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you'd advocate,

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:35.070
if we can translate to western
Massachusetts, which isn't

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:37.680
that dissimilar, you'd say, no.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.263
No, thank you.

01:03:38.263 --> 01:03:39.680
They're doing it
in Texas, they're

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.920
doing it in North Dakota.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.503
The people in Pennsylvania may
or may not have made a mistake,

01:03:43.503 --> 01:03:45.240
but we're not going
to do it, full stop.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.070
OK.

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:50.140
AUDIENCE: I would
also say, why would--

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:55.200
if you're [INAUDIBLE] or whoever
has a significant population

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.210
and has no experience
with it, why

01:03:57.210 --> 01:04:01.200
be in a hurry to go ahead
and drill everything and not

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.190
just wait to see some
sort of regulations?

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:09.000
I mean, to have
a clear framework

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.370
of what you should regulate,
and how you should do it,

01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:14.310
and what are the
consequences, and all that.

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:19.140
So like North Dakota and
Texas have a smaller, lower

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.220
population density.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.860
Figure out the hard
stuff, and then

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.890
figure out if you want to do it
or not in a few years when you

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:28.050
know what the consequences are.

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:28.500
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Of course, we

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.480
may not be happy with a
regime that would make

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.610
them unhappy in North Dakota.

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:35.100
Because they're desperate
for jobs and we're

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.000
not that desperate.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.670
So they might be willing
to deal with that

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:42.000
to accept environmental
harms that we wouldn't like.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.370
So you wouldn't just want
to follow them, necessarily.

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.230
Julian.

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:49.260
AUDIENCE: So I'm going
to agree with Alex

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.820
for the most part,
in that regulation

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.800
is needed to some extent.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.710
It is needed to
keep things safe.

01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:57.840
But realistically,
you're going to have

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:02.400
to work very, very hard to keep
people's hands off of money

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.530
sitting underground.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:06.300
I'm from Santa Barbara, and--

01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:09.590
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You can
see the oil out there, can you?

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:14.640
AUDIENCE: You can see 13
oil rigs from my house.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.850
And there is a very, very, very
strong environmental movement.

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:25.920
It's California, blue Democrat
as hard as you can go,

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.000
pretty much.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.290
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
do have some Republicans

01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:28.998
in Santa Barbara.

01:05:28.998 --> 01:05:32.280
AUDIENCE: We do, but
it is quite blue.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.290
It is quite, quite blue.

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:36.400
And still people drill for oil.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.500
You can see the
oil rigs out there.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.760
There are even pumps
on land and whatnot.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.360
And it's kind of
a tough argument

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.160
to go against it economically.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.670
I mean, when you can say that
OK, these people might have

01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:56.667
some bad health effects
from fracking and whatnot,

01:05:56.667 --> 01:05:58.500
but if they can't afford
health care anyway,

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:05.017
then what's the
difference, really?

01:06:05.017 --> 01:06:07.350
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
we have universal health care

01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:09.940
in Massachusetts, to a
pretty good approximation.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.100
So we're OK here.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.650
So we may as well just
drill because everybody

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:15.750
can get health care?

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:22.770
AUDIENCE: Well-- like if
someone can't afford something,

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:23.970
the economic benefits--

01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:27.327
I mean, not necessarily in
Massachusetts exclusively,

01:06:27.327 --> 01:06:29.160
but let's say in another
state which doesn't

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.450
have universal health care.

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:32.130
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Let's say.

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:33.090
AUDIENCE: That
argument could be--

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:34.840
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Connecticut
or western Connecticut,

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:35.820
Rhode Island, yeah.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:40.670
AUDIENCE: I mean, there are
economic benefits, which can

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:44.670
in turn have other benefits.

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:48.100
And yes, there should
definitely be regulation,

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.900
but the argument to say,
no, we should absolutely not

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:53.850
touch this stuff
that's under the ground

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:57.270
is going to be extremely,
extremely hard, especially when

01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:02.790
you go against probably
all the lobbyists from X

01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:06.403
different firms which
are for this measure.

01:07:06.403 --> 01:07:08.820
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And all
the mayors of depressed towns

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.290
who say, we need jobs.

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:12.060
We need jobs.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.323
[INAUDIBLE],, you're going
to agree or disagree?

01:07:14.323 --> 01:07:15.531
AUDIENCE: Disagree, actually.

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:18.080
Because when we had the
climate negotiations,

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.860
we were talking
about how urgent it

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.844
is to start taking
action to reduce

01:07:21.844 --> 01:07:23.828
the CO2 emissions [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:29.500
So if you start
using this method,

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.132
and many studies
shows that it might

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:34.810
have very bad effects on the
environment, and in 10 years

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:39.160
we will see what are the bad
effects that this method had,

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.920
it's going to be
like 2022 and then

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.210
we start discussing again how
to reduce greenhouse emissions.

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:49.450
I think it's going to
be too late by then.

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:51.340
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you'd say no.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.732
AUDIENCE: We don't have room
for any more mistakes anywhere.

01:07:54.732 --> 01:07:57.190
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Or let
them make the mistakes in North

01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:59.807
Dakota and not nationwide.

01:07:59.807 --> 01:08:00.640
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.330
AUDIENCE: --everyone.

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:02.630
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Nobody
in here is from North Dakota,

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:03.400
as I recall.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.780
I can insult North Dakota.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.837
Get out of town.

01:08:05.837 --> 01:08:07.120
David.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.940
AUDIENCE: I think from an
environmental perspective,

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:13.630
even if you didn't
know it's 100% clean

01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:16.430
and no methane, no
water caught on fire,

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.880
it's still a terrible
thing for carbon emissions.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.609
Because your actions for
decreasing your heating bill

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:24.069
or insulating your house
so it's more efficient

01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:25.899
and so you don't
need as much heat,

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:28.131
or using cheap
natural gas but then

01:08:28.131 --> 01:08:30.729
to continue having a
really inefficient house

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:33.160
and leaking heat everywhere.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.040
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
you're troubled by the bridge

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.359
to nowhere argument.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:40.000
And you'd say, unless
we actually can fit this

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.290
into a climate policy--

01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:44.350
which it could be if it
were part of a carbon tax,

01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:46.731
use this for a
while, get off it--

01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:48.189
would you be
comfortable with that?

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:49.819
Or you just say no.

01:08:49.819 --> 01:08:52.609
AUDIENCE: I say
environmentally that's--

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:53.109
yeah.

01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:54.309
Or you could use--

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:57.029
if the costs are so low, you
can have a very high carbon tax,

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.965
and use that money to perhaps
support solar or nuclear

01:08:59.965 --> 01:09:00.590
or whatever.

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:05.050
But I think economically,
you can't make that argument.

01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:09.460
You have to give people jobs
and environmental arguments

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.960
are going to get
legislation passed.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.529
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you're saying

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:13.750
you'd march on the State
House, and you'd say,

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:17.745
"Only with a carbon tax,"
and you'd count on losing.

01:09:17.745 --> 01:09:18.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:19.740
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.279
No, no, I mean, hey--

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:22.450
you fight the good fight.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:26.740
AUDIENCE: Jobs are not going
to part of the environment.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.979
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
you've actually been patient.

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:32.500
AUDIENCE: So I
would say that this

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.050
is an opportunity
for Massachusetts

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:38.529
to help take the lead a
relatively new industry.

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:41.538
And I don't think that
people will pass that up.

01:09:41.538 --> 01:09:43.330
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you think no matter

01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:45.609
what we say in here,
and what you guys

01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:48.100
do when you march on the
capitol, we're going to drill.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.189
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:50.564
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
But New York

01:09:50.564 --> 01:09:54.010
didn't, maybe because of all
those signs in Arianna's town.

01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:57.970
Maybe Arianna's town
shut down New York.

01:09:57.970 --> 01:10:00.700
And there are a lot of people in
upstate New York who need jobs.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.410
There are a lot of
depressed towns up there.

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:03.993
There are a lot of
landowners up there

01:10:03.993 --> 01:10:05.950
who would love to
lease for drilling.

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:09.140
But they managed
to shut it down.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.780
We're going to talk about that.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.877
But you want to go one.

01:10:11.877 --> 01:10:14.460
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah, I was just
saying I'm from South Dakota,

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.680
so I'm kind of jealous.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.590
[INAUDIBLE] if you
look at that map,

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.720
basically, took a huge loop
right around South Dakota.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.340
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:27.820
Well, my guess is there are
people from some South Dakota

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.630
towns who are now
living in North Dakota.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.570
North Dakota was going to
change the name of its state

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:38.448
to "Dakota" to avoid the "North"
for a while, but Matthew.

01:10:38.448 --> 01:10:40.240
AUDIENCE: I just think
the economic benefit

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.340
is too big to pass up.

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:45.375
And if it was a serious
environmental concern,

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.500
it'll become more apparent.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.028
It'll be accelerated
to regulation

01:10:49.028 --> 01:10:52.158
if we allow it to
happen more here.

01:10:52.158 --> 01:10:54.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So you
think it's going to happen.

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:57.282
We're going to see
environmental concerns.

01:10:57.282 --> 01:10:58.740
What the big guys
are worried about

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:04.020
is weak regulation, leads
to environmental disasters,

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:07.140
leads to a nationwide
moratorium.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.080
Whatever happened in New York
could happen nationwide, maybe.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.740
Maybe not in North Dakota,
but that's their concern.

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.325
And you're saying
we should run that.

01:11:16.325 --> 01:11:16.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:19.114
I mean, I think if they
realize the economic benefit

01:11:19.114 --> 01:11:20.140
in the beginning,
they're not going

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.182
to solve it immediate--
like, altogether, they're

01:11:22.182 --> 01:11:24.863
going to provide
some regulation.

01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:26.280
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, there's

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.760
a lot of work doing regulation.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.420
Again, it varies state
to state, but OK.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.190
Yeah.

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:35.670
AUDIENCE: I think there's a
two-part argument for doing it,

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:40.530
but doing it on a limited
scale, versus like you said,

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:45.510
there's kind of an oversupply
of gas at the moment.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.410
And the technology
being relatively new,

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:48.910
it's relatively
expensive, so you're

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:51.330
buying high and selling low.

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:53.520
But it is important
to start getting

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.330
some kind of understanding
of the drilling process.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:59.650
Because from what I
understand, the effects

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.650
are different from place
to place because what's

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.245
in the shale is different.

01:12:03.245 --> 01:12:03.870
So what works--

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:04.680
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
And what's on the way

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.595
down, and the differences.

01:12:05.595 --> 01:12:07.140
AUDIENCE: --in the Dakotas
is different from what

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.970
maybe works in
Massachusetts, but it's

01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.610
different compositions.

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:14.780
So I would argue for
doing a limited roll-out.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.700
You don't do it five
miles from town,

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.270
you do it 40 miles from town.

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:20.060
And you don't
authorize 3,000 wells,

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:23.920
you authorize 30 and
see what happens.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.090
Hopefully, if there
is an earthquake.

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:28.825
You can figure out what's going
on before people freak out

01:12:28.825 --> 01:12:30.158
and shut down the whole state.

01:12:30.158 --> 01:12:31.950
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So that's interesting.

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:33.762
And I hadn't heard
that proposal before,

01:12:33.762 --> 01:12:35.220
which is what makes
it interesting.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.650
So you'd say, we're
Massachusetts.

01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:39.120
We haven't done this before.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.910
We're going to hire some
people with expertise,

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:45.310
but the ones in Texas who
know what they're doing

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:46.830
are mostly staying in Texas.

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:51.570
So we can't effectively
regulate 300 wells.

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:56.220
Let's authorize 30, and let's
watch them closely, and see

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.060
what we can learn.

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:57.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:12:57.810 --> 01:12:59.880
And once the market
stabilizes, then you

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.080
can start pumping more.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.820
And then you'll
have a nice boom,

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.830
hopefully using cheaper
technology that's

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:08.630
more developed and
at a higher price.

01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:10.007
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Interesting.

01:13:10.007 --> 01:13:11.090
Yeah, I hadn't heard that.

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:11.690
OK.

01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:13.460
Marie, you had a--

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
just wanted to mention

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:18.434
that I think there has been some
somewhat successful regulation

01:13:18.434 --> 01:13:22.574
on this, as in Lebanon, Texas,
is going to make [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:22.574 --> 01:13:25.990
long time, a lot of
regulation around this area.

01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:28.280
And the Barnett
Shale is actually

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.425
right over the Dallas/Fort
Worth Metroplex,

01:13:30.425 --> 01:13:33.950
so it is really in
an urban location,

01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:35.872
and they're drilling
all around that.

01:13:35.872 --> 01:13:38.810
And it's just a place where
it has been well regulated,

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:41.090
and [INAUDIBLE]
follow their example.

01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:43.700
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
I mean, Texas, for instance,

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.750
in the Bipartisan
Policy Center thing,

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:48.860
seems to have been the first
state to basically require

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:52.160
disclosure of
fracking fluids, which

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.770
is sort of a first
natural step, I think.

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:57.180
And then you limit
things that can go down.

01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.515
So maybe we can
copy Texas, but they

01:13:59.515 --> 01:14:00.890
have been drilling
in the Barnett

01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:04.430
for a while with
different technologies.

01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:06.982
OK, and we will all wear hats.

01:14:06.982 --> 01:14:07.690
That'll be great.

01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:09.100
Sam.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.690
AUDIENCE: First, as
far as Massachusetts,

01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:14.600
I think if you're trying
to sell that proposal,

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:18.700
you might have a hard time
selling it to Massachusettsians

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.590
copying Texas, just
from like association,

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:24.530
people of Massachusetts
aren't huge fans of Texas.

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:25.040
I think--

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.420
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You didn't
like Rick Perry's campaign?

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:26.920
Never mind.

01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:31.220
AUDIENCE: But I did think
politically it would

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:32.180
be hard to sell.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.590
Just in Massachusetts, people
are pretty environmentally

01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:35.090
conscious.

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:38.390
And I think all it would take
is, like, one anecdote of oh,

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:40.640
my cousin in Ohio,
he had an earthquake

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.243
or his water is on fire--

01:14:43.243 --> 01:14:44.660
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you think.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:47.642
AUDIENCE: We like to overreact.

01:14:47.642 --> 01:14:49.850
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: The
political system overreacts.

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:54.200
So your view is, even
though Arianna's community

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.420
managed to shut down
the State of New York--

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.390
it's a pretty blue state, but
probably less environmentally

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:01.580
conscious than this one--

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.240
it would be tough to do here.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.940
So what would you
advocate instead,

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.958
when you march on
the State Capitol?

01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:10.250
AUDIENCE: Take the money and
invest in green technology

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:10.750
instead.

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:14.860
I think the path to nowhere
argument is pretty good,

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:15.360
as well.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.250
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It's pretty interesting.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.830
Yeah.

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.748
What about the "go
slow" approach?

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.290
AUDIENCE: I think
once you start down

01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:23.082
that, it's going to be
pretty hard to stop.

01:15:23.082 --> 01:15:25.340
I mean, once you start
putting in a few,

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.987
it is going to produce cheap
energy, but it doesn't really--

01:15:27.987 --> 01:15:28.820
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.800
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
And jobs, and jobs.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.560
We'll put them in Pittsfield
or someplace like Pittsfield.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.250
Yeah, Max.

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:37.970
AUDIENCE: I think the
biggest [INAUDIBLE] of this

01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:41.120
is [INAUDIBLE] take
a lot of transparency

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.060
in the industry, the argument
that the chemicals are

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.140
proprietary, so
[INAUDIBLE] nobody really

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.780
has a good way of measuring how
much methane exactly is being

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.018
released in the environment.

01:15:52.018 --> 01:15:53.560
And so we know the
economic benefits,

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.018
but we don't know
the environmental

01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:56.572
[? measurements ?] of it.

01:15:56.572 --> 01:15:58.530
And that's the biggest
problem with regulating.

01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:01.330
Even if you did
a few small wells

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:03.760
before you moved into the
large scale, [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.560
regulating them, just because
of those loopholes and the fact

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.860
that there's no real
metric for how much damage

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.180
it's actually doing.

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:12.532
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
There are techniques--

01:16:12.532 --> 01:16:13.990
not great techniques,
but there are

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:17.320
techniques-- that can measure
methane emissions, methane

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.400
leakage.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.390
It isn't trivial.

01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:23.190
That piece in "Nature"
talked about how

01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:25.500
they managed to measure
methane emissions

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:29.040
from one area, methane leakage.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.720
But it's naturally
tricky, because it

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.830
comes from lots of different
places and is dispersed.

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:39.290
You can, however, talk
about ceiling requirements

01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:40.760
and how joints are done.

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.590
You could put in things.

01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:44.690
It may be hard to
measure what happens,

01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:47.210
but you could put in
place regulation that

01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:49.340
will reduce it,
whether it'll reduce it

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.870
enough, blah, blah, blah.

01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:55.660
So you're saying-- so where
would you go when you march?

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:58.160
AUDIENCE: I would advocate for
it because [INAUDIBLE] there,

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.680
but demand transparency
from the firms that

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.877
are doing it to kind of
[INAUDIBLE] and having them

01:17:03.877 --> 01:17:06.210
[INAUDIBLE] or at least come
up with some sort of metric

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:10.075
to [INAUDIBLE] how much
damage they're actually doing.

01:17:10.075 --> 01:17:11.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, so you

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:14.030
might work on the development
of measurement methods

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:17.390
for methane, for instance, and
require them to implement them,

01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:18.690
and so on, and so forth.

01:17:18.690 --> 01:17:19.470
Yeah.

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:21.470
AUDIENCE: Given how afraid
some of the companies

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.900
are of backlash, especially
if you invite the bigger ones,

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:27.030
perhaps it isn't as slippery
a slope [INAUDIBLE]..

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:29.900
And if you build 30
and they do well,

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.500
and regulation starts
loosening, almost immediately

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.868
if anything does
go wrong, that's

01:17:35.868 --> 01:17:37.160
the whole thing gets shut down.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.030
The companies are
quite incentivized,

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:40.680
in a similar way to
nuclear companies,

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.437
to keep a completely
white sheet.

01:17:43.437 --> 01:17:45.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
The big guys are.

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:45.920
AUDIENCE: Precisely, and so--

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.110
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: The little
guys are the potential trouble

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.610
spots.

01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:51.800
AUDIENCE: And so if
you have 30, given

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.470
that you have some data from
the big guys in other states,

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:56.840
it would make sense if
you have 30 test cases,

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.030
and then for the
future cases to be

01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:02.210
from those people that have
at least some prior history.

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.043
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Oh, that's interesting.

01:18:04.043 --> 01:18:07.250
So you'd look at their
regulatory history elsewhere,

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:10.190
and you would try,
in Massachusetts,

01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:12.967
not to let people who
have bad records drill.

01:18:12.967 --> 01:18:15.050
AUDIENCE: And then you
have the comparative issues

01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:17.150
between what they do in
Massachusetts versus North

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:20.358
Dakota [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:20.358 --> 01:18:22.400
AUDIENCE: Just from an
environmental perspective,

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.840
isn't it better to
drill in Massachusetts,

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.860
in the sense that it's going
to be happening [INAUDIBLE],,

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.710
so you could argue that it
happened in Massachusetts,

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.850
and the type of
population that you have

01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:34.940
and the quality of
engineers, you're

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.520
going to set industry best
practices in Massachusetts,

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.510
which are going to be copied
in North Dakota, then.

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:43.860
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Maybe.

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:47.010
The counter-argument is that
because of our population

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:50.910
density, the
potential for damage

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:53.715
is higher, potential for
environmental damage.

01:18:53.715 --> 01:18:54.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:55.840
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah, no.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.960
So you're saying
you'd do it here,

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.590
but you would allocate
state resources,

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:03.990
and of course you'd beg
for federal resources,

01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:08.770
to improve best practices, to
improve measurement methods.

01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:11.430
One of the things that the
Secretary of Energy Advisory

01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:15.300
Board, the SEAB report that's
cited in a couple of places,

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.070
stressed--

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:20.430
they said the government
is lousy at this.

01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:23.790
The big guys in the industry
are able to develop and improve

01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:25.320
best practices.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.820
They need to be
encouraged to do it.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.340
The problem is once you come
up with a best practice,

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:32.820
it becomes a compulsory
practice, and so forth.

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:34.230
But that's another issue.

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:36.820
OK, I think we're out of time.

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.040
Have a great long weekend.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.510
We will do
electricity next week.

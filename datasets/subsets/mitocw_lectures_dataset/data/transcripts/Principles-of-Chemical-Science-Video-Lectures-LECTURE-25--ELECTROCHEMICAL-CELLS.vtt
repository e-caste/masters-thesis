00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:29.140
PROFESSOR: So, you have now 10
seconds, go ahead and click in

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:43.560
your answer.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.870
OK.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.270
We have a little bit of
a mixed response here.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.860
So for those of you coming in
late, I'm going to give you a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.260
second chance, and we say now
what if the p k a was 4.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.600
Everything else is the same, but
the p k a is now 4 -- what

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:17.850
would the answer be?

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.600
OK, go ahead and click in your
response for a p k a of 4,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:45.160
everything else being
the same.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:59.920
OK, let's do 10 seconds.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.910
Interesting.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.500
More people got that right.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.730
So it's the same answer for a
p k a of 3 as a p k a of 4,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.230
but it gave people the
opportunity to think about

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.410
that a little more and see what
their neighbors had voted

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.490
and make a decision
based on that.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.220
And so more people came up
with the right answer.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.560
So let's consider now for a
minute why this is true.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.430
So if you can switch to my
lecture notes, I have a couple

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.040
of slides on this that are not
in your handout but that are

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.360
related to things we've
talked about.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.920
So just a brief sort of reminder
of where we were with

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.860
acid based titrations.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.340
So, we last time talked about
what's happening at different

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.800
points of the p h curve, and
introduced this concept of 1/2

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.470
equivalence point where the p h
equals the p k a, where you

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.370
have equal number of moles of
molecules that are pronated as

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.500
depronated.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.210
And another way to sort of think
about this whole thing

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.200
is that in the beginning at p
h's that are lower than the p

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.390
k a, you have more pronated
molecules.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.490
And if p h is much above
the p k a, you have

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.860
more depronated molecules.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.950
So, we can think about
things that way.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.020
So let's think about the last
question that I asked where

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.250
are have a p k a of 4.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.380
So, if you gave someone a sample
of molecules where the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.920
p h was equal to the p k a of
the molecule, you'd be giving

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.980
them a sample where there would
be equal amounts of

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.280
pronated and depronated.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.670
But instead, if you gave a
sample where the p h is much

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.340
above the p k a, then you're
going to be giving them a

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.690
sample that's mostly
depronated.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.160
And I emphasize about using, in
terms of titrations, using

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.070
Henderson Hasselbalch for
buffer, but it also can be

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.970
applied to thinking about
this type of problem.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.030
And so you can be thinking about
what sort of ratio are

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.290
you going to get of your
pronated to depronated when

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.360
you have given a particular p
k a and a particular p h.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.560
And so, if the p h is really
very far above the p k a, then

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.920
you're going to be largely
depronated, and here's the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.800
math for these two numbers.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.220
If you're at a p h that's really
below the p k a, then

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.580
your molecules are going
to be pronated.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.920
And so, you're going to be
thinking about this kind of

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.150
thing when you get to organic
chemistry, and also

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.220
biochemistry.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.250
Biochemists spend a lot of time
thinking about the p k

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.950
a's of amino acid side chains,
and there are often mechanisms

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.810
that people propose of how an
enzyme works, and they're

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.290
proposing that some residue is
going to play a role as a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.700
catalytic acid or a base
in an enzyme mechanism.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.300
And often people are proposing
things that really just don't

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.910
make much sense in terms of the
p k a of that molecule,

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.500
that they're proposing, that
it's going to be giving off a

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.720
proton, but given the p h of
the enzyme in the body and

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.050
given the p k a, it wouldn't
be pronated.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.000
So how is it going to give off
something it's not going to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.990
have. So these are the kinds of
questions people talk about

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.320
in biochemistry, and if you're
in a biochemistry seminar and

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.182
someone's talking about
something like this, there

00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:15.680
will probably be a hand go up in
the audience and say "What

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.730
do you think the p k a is of
that amino acid that you're

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.785
proposing that role in this
enzyme mechanism?" And there

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:25.930
have been people who are pretty
high profile who've

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.730
gotten themselves in trouble
over p k a issues.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.940
So now, you should all be ready
to raise your hand in

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.360
those seminars and say "What do
you think the p k a is of

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.830
that residue?" So, you'll be
hearing about p k a's later,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.630
and the thing that makes me
very excited is that some

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.180
other people who are taking
chemistry here, may not be as

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.230
aware of the sort of biological
role of p k a's.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.690
Now you know something, you've
had some of these in your

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.440
problem-sets, and so when you go
into those advanced classes

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.570
and there's a discussion of p
k a, you'll raise your hand

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.350
and impress my colleagues
with your tremendous

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.080
knowledge of p k a's.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.150
So I'm very excited
about that.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.620
And please send me an email
when you get extra points

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.440
because of knowledge
of p k a's.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.900
I want to collect that
information and use it for

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.870
evil purposes.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.370
No.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.980
But anyway, you can think about
p k a's of molecules

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.520
now, which will be very
handy to you later on.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.300
So it's not just -- some people
tell me, if I promise

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.320
never to titrate a weak acid
with a strong base, do I have

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.120
to take that part of the test?

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.190
Well, you know it's not just
about acid based titrations.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.320
Some of the things you learn in
that are actually relevant

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.350
to other things that most
of you will see

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.560
later in your career.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.960
All right.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.350
So, I love enzymes, enzymes are
great, I'm a biochemist.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.750
Acid base is very important
in biochemistry.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.180
And the other thing that is very
important in biochemistry

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.070
is oxidation reduction.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.860
So, in these two units that
we're doing now that'll be on

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.650
the third exam, you're learning
a lot of the basic

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.360
principles that apply
to how enzymes work.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.930
And so we started last time
talking about some rules.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.180
Rules of assigning
oxidation number.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.960
So this is sort of the very
basic knowledge that you need

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.890
to know to go on and do
oxidation reduction problems.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.510
And here are those rules, and
now let's see look at some

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:35.110
examples of how we're going
to apply these rules.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.280
So, first let's look at a
compound that has lithium and

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:47.450
oxygen in it.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.640
All right.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.930
What do I know about lithium's
oxidation number?

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.950
What's it going to be?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.960
Plus 1.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.600
So, things in group 1 are
going to be plus 1,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.660
and I have 2 of them.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.600
So we're going to be using
one of those rules up

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.120
there to assign it.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.300
What about oxygen?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.000
What's oxygen going to
be in this molecule?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.620
Minus 2.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.080
So it's not in a peroxide here,
so it'll be minus 2.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.290
And then we have plus 2 minus
2 is equal to 0, and that's

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.540
good, because there's no charge
on this particular

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.270
molecule, so all of the
oxidation numbers

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.140
should add up to 0.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.630
That's also one of our rules.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:40.990
All right, so let's
look at p c l 5.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:47.010
So, what we know about oxidation
number of chloride?

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.930
What are you guessing?

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.710
Minus 1.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.130
What's the exception to that?

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.680
When it's with what?

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.100
When it's with oxygen
it can be different.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.470
All right, so there's
5 of those.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.670
I haven't told you anything
about phosphorous, but what

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.470
can you guess it's
going to be?

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.350
STUDENT: 5.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.100
PROFESSOR: I love that
enthusiasm, good.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.700
So, it will be 5, and so
overall, we're going

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.800
to add up to 0.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.720
So you won't always have a rule
about everything in your

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.020
molecule, but you'll be given
something that you can get a

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.220
handle on and then predict
what the other

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.660
thing is going to be.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:41.300
So let's do a couple more.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:47.030
So, what about h n o 3?

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:51.030
So let's start with oxygen --
you told me about oxygen,

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.660
what's oxygen going
to be here?

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.320
STUDENT: Negative 2.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.590
PROFESSOR: Negative 2 and
there's 3 of those.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.600
And we need to have this
all add up to 0 again.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.280
So, what about hydrogen?

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.990
STUDENT: Plus 1.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.330
PROFESSOR: Plus 1.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.170
What's the exception
to that rule?

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.530
When its with a metal.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.260
So what does that leave
for nitrogen?

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.400
Plus 5.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.920
And that will all add up.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.020
All right, so you're very good
at this, so let's bring in

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.110
that clicker competition,
and you can tell

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:56.560
me about this molecule.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:12.640
All right, 10 seconds.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.930
Excellent -- not necessarily for
the competition since most

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.960
people got it right,
but I love seeing

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.210
people get it right.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:31.150
So, 2 times plus 1 minus 2 is 0,
so we know our states here.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.390
And I'll just tell you another
thing you can do in doing

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.330
these problems, if you recognize
that something is

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.450
often seen has a unit here, you
can also think about this

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:47.760
as h plus and n o 3 minus, and
you would get the same answers

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.610
to the problem.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.950
So, if it's a little complicated
and you want to

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.050
break it apart, you can do that
too, you'll get the same

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.620
answers there.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.330
All right, so as I said, in this
unit it's a lot of adding

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:04.320
and subtracting, so this part
is not too complicated, but

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.280
you just have to be paying
attention and doing your math,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.650
simple math, correctly.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:13.060
All right, so we looked
at some examples.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.640
So now we're going to give
some definitions.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.630
What is oxidation?

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.300
What happens when something
is oxidized?

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.010
Yup.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:34.700
So, when you oxidize something,
electrons are lost.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.270
What happens when you
reduce something?

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.390
STUDENT: Gain electrons.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.370
PROFESSOR: You gain electrons.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.770
Most people are good with
those definitions.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.700
Here are some that give people
a little bit more trouble.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.200
Oxidizing agent.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:13:01.090
So it is an agent of oxidation,
so it accepts -- an

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.980
oxidation agent is something
that wants to oxidize

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.190
something else, so it
gets reduced itself.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.640
So it's an agent of oxidation.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.190
It runs around trying to oxidize
other things, but it

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.190
itself is going to get reduced,
and then you can

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.370
probably figure out what a
reducing agent is, it's an

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.890
agent of reduction.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.520
And so it itself will
be oxidized.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.170
It'll try to reduce
something else.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.910
It'll run around trying to
reduce something, trying to

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:33.600
give off its electrons, donate
its electrons so that it can

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.780
be oxidized.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.840
So, keep these definitions in
mind, because you're going to

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:47.580
be using them a lot
in this unit.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.580
So now we're going to use them,
we're going to look at a

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.790
reaction, and we're going to
think about what's being

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.340
oxidized and what is
being reduced.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.870
And this particular type of
reaction, a disproportionation

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:10.760
reaction, the same element can
be both oxidized and reduced.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.890
So let's break this down
into two equations.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.660
In every reaction there's going
to be an oxidation and a

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.820
reduction, and so you can
write those separately.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.940
And poor sodium, sodium is
getting kind of a jip.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:29.140
A lot in these last few units in
acid base, and here again,

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.300
it's a spectator ion here, so
it doesn't even make it into

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.670
the equation.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.430
And it was ineffective as a
conjugate acid, it hasn't

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.160
really been doing very
much recently.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.290
But that's OK.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.620
All right, so let's look at
what's going on here and try

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.540
to figure out what's happening
in terms of what's being

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.490
reduced and what's
being oxidized.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.890
So let's start over here, let's
think about what the

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.560
oxidation numbers are in this
particular molecule.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.130
So what would be true about
oxygen here and chloride.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.840
What do we know about this
combination of things in terms

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:14.090
of oxidation numbers?

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:25.990
So let's start with chloride,
what's that going to be here?

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.410
So, we have a minus 2 here.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.010
And the whole thing is going to
be minus 1, and so what is

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:32.450
that about chloride?

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.900
Plus 1, right.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.950
So this is one of
the exceptions.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.650
Chloride is usually minus 1,
except when it's with oxygen,

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.610
and here we have an overall
charge of the molecule of

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.980
minus 1, so it all has to add
up to minus 1 and it does.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.190
All right, so now let's
do that side.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.030
So what's going on here?

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.270
Are they going to be similar
or different?

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:01.550
Let's start with the oxygen,
what's that going to be?

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.190
So we have three negative 2's.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.360
It's not a peroxide, so it's
negative 2 for oxygen.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.300
The overall has to be
equal to minus 1, so

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.380
what is chloride here?

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.360
Plus 5, right.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.480
So that's unusual, but
that's what it is.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.780
So we use our rules.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.750
Chloride is usually minus 1,
except when it's with oxygen,

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.780
and then it can be something
different.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.690
So, here chloride's going from
plus 1 to plus 5, so what's

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:29.570
happening to it?

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:37.740
Is it being oxidized
or reduced?

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.210
Yup.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.450
So it's going from plus 1
to plus 5, so we have an

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.200
oxidation going on.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.010
So to tell whether something
is an oxidation or not, you

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.330
need to figure out what the
oxidation numbers are and then

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.170
see what's changing in the
course of that reaction.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:57.800
All right, so down here, we've
already done this one, so we

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.840
can put that down here.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.910
So we have minus 2 for oxygen,
overall minus 1, and so

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.700
chloride is plus 1 again.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.090
And what's the oxidation
number on the

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.010
other side for chlorine?

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.310
Minus 1.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.300
I just have to look, and
so that's minus 1.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.680
So here we're going from plus 1
to minus 1, so what is that?

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.320
That's a reduction.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.960
And if we had figured out that
they're both oxidations and

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.280
something we would have done
incorrectly, because in these

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.090
reactions you're going to have
oxidations and reductions.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.650
So, here, and this is
disproportionation.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.280
So, you have chloride in one
state, and in another, it's

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:43.030
undergoing a reduction.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.820
OK, so that's how you sort of
think about what's happening

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.720
in these types of reactions.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.440
So now we need to balance
reactions.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.220
And this is very important in
getting the correct answer to

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.430
the later problems, and so we'll
go through an example of

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.670
how you're going to balance.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.740
You need to think about
whether it's an acidic

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.670
solution or basic solution,
and we'll talk

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.020
about that at the end.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.820
So, first here, we can look at
the two 1/2 reactions going

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.410
on, we have iron, we have
chromium, and so we're going

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.590
to look at those separately.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:22.190
So here is the first one, and
let's think about what's

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.870
happening over here.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:38.010
So, what would our oxidation
number of the oxygen be here?

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.590
What is happening to it?

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.800
So, figure out what the
oxidation numbers are of the

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.480
chromium on one side, you know
what it is on the other side,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:19:06.270
and then tell me what's
happening to it.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.440
I hear some murmuring.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.970
People in one recitation aren't
helping out people in

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:16.900
the other recitation, are they?

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.460
All right.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.060
Do you need more times?

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.130
You good?

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.490
You clicked in?

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:39.930
Let's do 10 seconds.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.770
OK.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.170
People did pretty well
on that one.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.150
Let's look at the
answer to that.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:50.150
So, let's go back to
my Powerpoint.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:56.640
And so, oxidation number for
oxygen here, minus 2.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.890
The overall charge on
that is minus 2.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.590
So you have to figure out what
the math equals there.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.280
And so, if you run through the
math, then you see that you're

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.260
going from a plus 6
to a plus 3 state,

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.580
so we have a reduction.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.810
OK, 75% did that,
got that, good.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:25.720
So, most of you should be able
to get this one now, iron plus

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.610
2 to iron plus 3.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.400
Just yell it out, what is that?

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.970
Yeah.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.500
So here we have our oxidation.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.500
Now let's balance this.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.180
And I left some nice blanks in
your notes, but not so many

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.640
that you won't be able to keep
up and you should feel free to

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.420
yell out the answers and we'll
go through balancing this

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.430
pretty quickly.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.310
So there's a couple of
different rules.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.860
I'll just say some books have
things differently.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.330
If you can get the right answer,
you can use whatever

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.070
procedure you want.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:01.870
I have found in the past that
this particular procedure a

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.150
lot of people find to be the
easiest. So I'll teach you

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.880
this one, but you're free
to use whichever ones

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.830
work well for you.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.270
All right, so the first thing
we want to do is balance all

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.060
elements that are not
oxygen or hydrogen.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.030
To make it equal on both sides,
we're going to do

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.020
oxygen and hydrogen later.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.590
But what do we need to do
up here to balance our

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.440
non-oxygens?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.470
We need to add a what?

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.150
A 2.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.250
So we need to add a 2 over here,
two chromiums here, two

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.390
on the other side.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.590
What about for iron?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.230
Nothing.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.560
All right, so that was
pretty simple.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:52.530
Now, in this procedure you add
water to balance the oxygens.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.400
So, what are we going
to do up here.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.560
How many waters do
we need to add?

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.270
So we need to add 7 waters.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.200
And the bottom one, bottom one's
pretty easy so far, we

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.220
don't have to do anything.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.380
So, go ahead and write
in your 7 waters.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.710
Next step is we're going to
balance the hydrogens that we

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:24.780
just added, and we can balance
here with h plus, and I say

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.850
here's one place that
books are different.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.400
Some of them balance in the
more sort of technically

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.310
correct way with hydroium ions,
but then your oxygens

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.340
get unbalanced again, so it's
OK to use the simpler

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.520
approach, and just balance
with h plus.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.380
So how many h plusses
do we need to add to

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.720
balance the top part?

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.840
Yup, so we need to
add 14 over here.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.550
Again, the bottom one,
nothing to do.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.800
Pretty simple.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.280
Now we need to balance the
charge, so we just added h

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.770
plusses, so we just added some
charge to this, and now we

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.720
have to balance the overall
charge, so you want the charge

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.350
on one side of the equation to
be equal to the charge on the

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.440
other side of the equation.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.150
So how many electrons are we
going to have to add to this

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:30.860
top equation to balance
the charge?

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.700
I heard the answer.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.740
6.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.410
So we have to add 6.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:41.530
I told you, this unit involves
adding and subtracting in your

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:45.430
head, and you always want to
check your work when you're

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.340
doing this on an exam, because
it's really sad when you lose

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.220
points for something that is
adding and subtracting.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.640
So you want to make sure that
you don't lose points on these

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.560
on an exam.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.120
So what about the bottom --
finally we get to do something

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.550
with the bottom one,
what do we do?

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.010
So, we add how many electrons?

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.750
1, right.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.530
OK, so now our charge
is balanced.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:18.350
So now, we want to multiply up
one of the 1/2 reactions so

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:23.190
that the electrons are going to
cancel, and so what do we

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.950
have to multiply by the bottom
equation so that the electrons

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.320
cancel with the first?

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.440
6.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:40.180
So we have 6, 6, and 6.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.520
And now, we're going to add
those together and make the

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.750
appropriate cancellations.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.120
So here is our overall equation
-- we have the 6

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.690
electrons, the 14 protons, we
have our chromium oxide

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.970
compound, we have the 6 iron 2
plusses, on the other side,

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:05.060
the 2 chromium 3 plusses, the
7 waters, the 6 iron 3

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.150
plusses, and the 6 electrons.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:11.010
So, we should be able to cancel
the electrons, so we

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:15.630
cancel those out.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.420
And now we want to double
check that,

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.710
in fact, it's balanced.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.300
Again, this is very important to
do on the test, it's really

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.230
easy to make some kind of math
mistake, but you should be

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.190
able to figure it out
at this point.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.000
It won't be balanced if you've
made a math mistake.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.830
So there should be 14 hydrogens
over here, 14 over

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.670
there, 2 chromiums, 2 chromiums,
you have 7 oxygens

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.590
here, 7 oxygens there,
6 irons, 6 irons.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.680
And the charge also should be
balanced on both sides.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.290
So you can double check
that and if it's

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:48.910
good, then you're done.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.970
And this was in acidic solution,
so we should have

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.240
again this number and a charge
of plus 24 on each side,

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.830
double check, make sure
it's correct.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.580
So, that was acidic solution
and we ended up with an

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.660
equation that had
h plusses in it.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.740
You can also be asked to do it
in basic solution, and again,

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.960
books have different
approaches here.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.200
What I like to do is the
simplest thing, which is to

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.480
use the same steps all the way
up to here to get your same

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.380
answer that you had for the
acidic solution, and then

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.590
neutralize it at this point.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.955
So, adjust the p h in quotes
by adding hydroxide ions to

00:26:33.955 --> 00:26:40.090
both sides, and so, if we have
14 h plusses here, we can add

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:45.120
14 o h's on one side, and 14 o
h minus on the other side.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.760
And then we can add those
guys together.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.670
So we have now 14 waters
over here.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.310
And we have still our 7 waters
on this side, and then the 14

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.570
hydroxides on this side.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.710
And now, we should be
able to cancel out

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.810
some of those waters.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:08.090
So, we had 14 over here, 7 over
here, so we can just have

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.530
7 on this side.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.480
And now we have an equation
that looks like

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.040
it's in basic solution.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.090
So instead of having h plus,
which you would have in acid,

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.990
you have hydroxide for
basic solution.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.340
So you can follow
the same rules.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.760
Again, some books do
it differently.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.030
I think this is the simplest way
to do it, the least likely

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:29.510
to make those kind of adding
and subtracting errors.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.480
So those are sort of the
fundamentals you

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.720
need for this unit.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.120
You need to figure out oxidation
numbers, looking at

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.120
the composition of a molecule,
and you need to be able to

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.390
balance equations.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.370
When you can do that, you can
go on to do other things.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:49.350
So, at this point -- oh, let me
just say, those are the two

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.520
answers there, so you can see
acid and then in base.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.960
So, at this point then, I want
to try to do a little demo to

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.390
show you that when you do do
oxidation reduction reactions,

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:08.230
cool things can happen.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:13.070
So, it's more exciting, perhaps,
in real life when

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.830
oxidation happens
than on paper.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:20.780
So I'm going to turn it over
now to Dr. Taylor and Dr.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.310
Patti Christie who's here to
help us with this demo.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.520
And they will -- go for it.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.390
PROFESSOR: OK, so this is mostly
visual, there's not too

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:29.520
much we'll need to say.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.820
Basically what we're
going to do for

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.250
you is oxidize magnesium.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:38.720
So we have a source of
oxidation, which is going to

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.440
be carbon dioxide, which is
dry ice, and what we put

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.540
inside the dry ice is
solid magnesium.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.830
So we're going to set the
magnesium on fire, and then

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:53.430
put the oxidating agent on top
of it, and you can see the

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.070
rest of what's going
to happen there.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.070
And you can actually also
determine if this is an

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:34.940
exothermic or an endothermic
reaction while you're at it.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.090
[EXPERIMENTING]

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:36.040 --> 00:30:36.260
PROFESSOR: Thanks
to my helpers.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:46.160
All right.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.400
So oxidation reduction reactions
can be quite

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:56.280
interesting, and don't
try that at home.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.890
So, we're going to continue on
now, you know the basics and

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.110
we're going to talk about
electric chemical cells.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:06.620
We're going to introduce
Faraday's law, and a thing I

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:11.320
love to do, is come back to my
friend Gibb's free energy.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.540
So, thermodynamics is all over
the place in chemistry and you

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.420
can't get very far
away from it.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.540
So hopefully, by the end of the
class today, we'll come

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.060
back to free energy.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.790
All right, so what is an
electric chemical cell.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.000
It's any device in which
electric current, which is a

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.630
flow of electrons through a
circuit, is either produced by

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:39.470
a spontaneous reaction, or
used to bring about a

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.780
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.530
And so a battery is technically
a collection of

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:49.090
cells in a series, so that the
voltage that each cell

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.905
produces is the sum, the battery
has the sum of the

00:31:52.905 --> 00:31:55.640
voltages of each cell.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.200
So, let's take a look at what
some of these might look like.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.960
Here's a little cartoon
of a simple version.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.590
We have a beaker --

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:07.180
2 beakers with different
solutions in them, 2

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.270
electrodes, a salt bridge
across, and as electrons

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:18.530
transfer through this, you can
read a current on an amp meter

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.170
here, you can read some kind
of voltage coming off.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:26.590
And so, I like to talk about how
good you guys have it at

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.750
MIT with the Web and handouts
and everything and how

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.010
students in the old days at MIT,
if they're going to do

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.400
their problem-sets at night,
first they had to build a

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.070
battery to get electricity
to be able to see.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.550
So you guys have it easy, you
have these electric lights and

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:47.080
all this fancy stuff now here.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.940
So, let's sort of break apart
sort of a components.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:55.010
Here is my beautiful picture
that I drew of this system,

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.090
that's why I show you a better
cartoon first. So this is a

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.100
beaker that you -- here's one
beaker with one solution on

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.030
this side, here is
the other beaker.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:09.520
So we have two electrodes put
in, we have a salt bridge, and

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.570
then we have a wire across where
we can measure voltage.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:17.000
So, let's think about what is
happening on each side.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.260
So in one beaker you're going
to have an oxidation

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.570
reduction, and in the
other beaker you're

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.980
going to have a reduction.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.050
So if we think about what's
happening over here, you could

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.750
have a zinc system, is
oxidized from zinc 0

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.190
to zinc plus 2.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.270
And so, this is sort of a view
of what would be happening at

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.720
the electrode, you have zinc
solid or zinc 0, and you've

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.360
also have zinc plus
2 in solution.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.690
And so, as you take a zinc solid
atom, going into zinc

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.550
plus 2, you can have an
oxidation reaction.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:56.590
And here would be the
equation going down.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.650
So zinc solid to zinc plus
2 with two electrons.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.370
Those electrons can go through
to our other beaker on this

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:09.770
other side, and so here we have
a copper solid electrode

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:15.150
or a cathode in this case, and
we have copper plus 2 in

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.940
solution, which is being reduced
to copper solid, and

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.220
so we're plating on to our
electrode on this side.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.040
And so, here we have the
reduction reaction, copper 2

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.570
with two electrons going
to copper solid.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.630
So our oxidation is
happening at an

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.280
electrode called the anode.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.030
The reduction is
happening in an

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.480
electrode called the cathode.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.260
And as these reactions occur,
you're changing the charge on

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.380
either side.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.030
So, you have this salt bridge,
and so to neutralize the

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.850
change in charge, you would have
negative ions come down

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.120
here, because we're producing
more plus 2.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.790
And on the other side potassium
is going in as we're

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.470
going from copper plus 2 to
copper solid, again, to

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:59.430
balance this change in charge
that's occurring.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.800
So those are the basic
components of a simple

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.980
electrochemical cell.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.510
So, we could talk about the
cell -- here's some

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.820
nomenclature that represents
the cell.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:18.120
So, the one that I just showed
you, you have one electrode, a

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:23.670
zinc solid, and we also have
zinc plus 2 in solution.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.650
You have a single line between
the solid and the zinc plus 2

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.640
ions in solution, that indicates
there's a phase

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.610
boundary, so you're changing
phase from solid to aqueous.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:38.600
Then if you see two little lines
that tells you, okay,

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.450
one part of the reaction's in
one beaker, the other part is

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.240
in the other beaker, that
represents the salt bridge

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.580
which separates out the
two 1/2 reactions.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.360
And then on this side, we're
going from copper 2 in

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.130
solution, single line which
indicates the phase boundary,

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:59.210
to a copper solid over here.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:08.150
So the amount of charge that
goes through the system, it

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.850
depends -- and how much of the
zinc that is consumed or the

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.960
copper that is deposited, is
proportional to that charge,

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.750
the number of electrons that
go through the system, and

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.160
this is called Faraday's law.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.280
So let's look at what is
happening a little bit here,

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.760
so we have a little movie that
shows the oxidation reaction.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:35.800
So in green is the electrode,
and then here are the water

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.790
molecules, and let's look
at what happens when

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.660
there's this oxidation.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.610
So here things are floating
around, and

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:43.740
there go the electrons.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.860
And this pops off into
solutions, so if this is zinc,

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.970
so then as this is happening,
we have a zinc plus 2 now,

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.990
it's aqueous.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.310
There go electrons, we
have our oxidation.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.320
Here comes off zinc plus 2
floating around, there's

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.280
another zinc plus 2 that
just came off.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.600
And so our electrode here is
being consumed as this

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.290
oxidation occurs.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.430
I think it's really cool, the
electrons, you can see them as

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.790
this green going along
in this movie.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:18.250
So, this is a little thing to
think about what's happening.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.520
So what's happening at the
cathode, we have a reduction.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.230
So if we have our copper
ions are going to

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.990
plate onto our electrode.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.890
So here in blue is the
electrode, and again the water

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:32.530
molecules, here's a little
copper 2 in solution.

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:37.010
And when it gets electrons and
gets reduced, it's going to

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:40.450
start plating, so let's
take a look at that.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:42.990
So, here's -- oh, there
comes the electrons.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.770
And so now it becomes part of
the electrode there, the

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:49.160
electrons come in, and so you're
building up, you're

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.970
adding, your plating on
to your electrode.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:55.380
Now it got its electrons, it
got reduced, got reduced

00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:05.160
again, and it becomes solid, and
plates onto the electrode.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.380
And we see the electrons
coming in.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.620
So again, the amount of current
that flows, the number

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.860
of electrons that flow are going
to be proportional to

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.600
the chemistry that's happening
at the two electrodes.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.540
So you can figure out how much
zinc would be consumed, how

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.440
much of the zinc solid electrode
could be consumed,

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.600
and how much copper would be
deposited on the copper

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.380
electrode for a particular
amount of current.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:36.910
So say we have 1 amp of current
for 1 hour, what are

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.600
we going to do to our system?

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.100
So we can calculate this out,
so we use this equation to

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.420
find out how much charge is
going to pass through the

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.500
system, we have this term q,
the magnitude of charge and

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.170
it's in Coulombs, those are our
units, and that's equal to

00:38:54.170 --> 00:39:00.310
the current in amps, and just
for unit conversion, amps are

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.910
Coulombs per second, so that's
very convenient because we're

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:07.510
going to take the current and
times second, so times time.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:12.520
And so if we work that out, we
had 1 amp and we had 1 hour,

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:18.660
so we're going to have 3,600
Coulombs that are our

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.110
magnitude of our charge.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:25.570
So once we know that, we can
convert, using Faraday's

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.720
constant from charge into moles
of electrons that had to

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.870
pass through the system to
generate that kind of current.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.370
And here is our friend Faraday's
constant, and so

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.680
that's in Coulombs per mole.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.570
And so, we can we can convert
the number of Coulombs into

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.970
the number of moles of electrons
that were passed

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.540
through the system with
that amount of

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.860
current, 1 amp for 1 hour.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.080
Now, how is this going to relate
to the zinc consumed or

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.920
the copper deposited?

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.430
So we know the total number
of moles that

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:02.660
passed through the system.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.810
And so, then we have to think
about for every 1 mole of zinc

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:12.020
that was consumed, how many
moles of electrons went

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.590
through the system?

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:17.560
So why don't you yell
out and tell me what

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.600
you think that is.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.900
What do you think?

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:26.410
2, right.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:30.360
So we are going from zinc
solid to zinc plus 2.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.130
So, we need to do -- to consume

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.590
one, we need two electrons.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:42.410
So then we can look up the
atomic weight of zinc and

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:45.470
calculate the number of grams.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:49.160
We can do the same
with copper.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.440
So for one mole of copper
deposited, how many moles of

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.800
electrons needed to pass
through the system?

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:02.480
two, right.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.630
And then we look up the atomic
weight, which is very similar,

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.820
and actually with significant
figures, it's the same amount,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.180
which won't be true
for most things.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:19.020
All right, so these problems
are not too complicated.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.470
So let me just tell you a little
bit more about types of

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.670
electrodes that can be used.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.900
It's not always true that you
have to use electrodes that

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.210
are going to be consumed
or have species

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.700
deposited on them.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.370
You can use an inert electrode,
such as a platinum

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.640
electorate, and here is
an example of that.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.750
So here, this cell has a
platinum electrode, and the

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.180
reaction that's happening, you
have actually two things in

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.510
solution instead of going from
a solid to a solution.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:54.470
So this is just another example
of a type of cell.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:57.580
So let's think about, then, what
equations we would write

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.180
for this chemistry and
what's going on.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.810
So over here at the cathode,
what happens at a cathode,

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:11.430
oxidation or reduction?

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.040
I'm hearing somewhat
of a consensus.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.850
That's correct.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.240
Reduction.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.950
That's the thing you're going to
need to memorize, it'll be

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.390
important in doing problems
later on.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.720
So, what is the reduction
reaction that you imagine

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.000
would be happening if
you have copper plus

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.590
2 and copper solid?

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.940
So, if you're reducing it,
you're going to be reducing

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.400
copper plus 2 with two electrons
to copper solid.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.280
So, same reaction
we saw before.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.930
So what about over here.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.940
This is the anode, which has the
oxidation reaction going

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.130
on, and what oxidation reaction
can you imagine

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.660
happening with chromium plus
3 and chromium plus 2.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:43:03.760
What's going to what?

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.350
So, you're going from plus
2 to plus 3 with

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.370
one electron here.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:11.440
So that would be the
oxidation reaction.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.490
So let's think about how
we would actually

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.200
write this down then.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.530
So the notation for this type of
cell, we're going to have a

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.260
platinum that indicates the
electrode, a single line that

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.940
indicates a phase boundary.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.550
And in solution, you have the
chromium plus 2, chromium plus

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.320
3, those are both aqueous,
so they have a

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.840
comma between them.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.950
So this is on one side in one of
the beakers, so that's the

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.100
reaction at the anode.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.910
And then we have a bar here that
indicates a salt bridge.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.390
And then in the other beaker, we
would have the copper plus

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.500
2 and the copper solid,
separated by a single line,

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.370
because there's a phase boundary
between the aqueous

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:50.890
and the solid.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:54.360
And then here are our
two equations.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.840
At the anode, we have
copper plus 2.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.580
Aqueous going to copper
plus 3 aqueous in an

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.370
electron at the cathode.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.120
We have copper plus 2 aqueous
and two electrons going to

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.310
copper solid.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.950
So those are our two equations
and how we

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:12.680
would write that down.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.760
Another example of an electrode

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.700
is a hydrogen electrode.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.070
And this is very common.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.900
In fact, most potential standard
reduction potentials,

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.400
or as they're also known,
oxidation reduction potentials

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.100
are measured against a standard
hydrogen electrode,

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.970
and it'll be abbreviated
s h e.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.985
And so, if you see it was
measured against s h e, you

00:44:34.985 --> 00:44:36.870
will now know what that means.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.510
So that's a standard
hydrogen electrode.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.790
So there's a couple of
different variations.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:45.200
It can be used at the cathode
or at the anode.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:50.280
And so, if you're using it
at the cathode, h plus is

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.100
reduced, and at the anode,
h 2 is oxidized.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.750
And often you have a platinum
system there as well, for the

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:02.260
standard hydrogen, so platinum
is commonly used in a standard

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.000
hydrogen electrode.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.350
So, let's just sort of look at
a little picture of this.

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:11.975
So here, we may have like a
glass cylinder here, we're

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:13.680
pumping in h 2 gas.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.740
And here you can see it
sort of bubbling down.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.050
We may have a solution of
hydrochloric acid, which would

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.750
have a lot of h plus in it,
and so this would be a

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:27.000
hydrogen electrode on one side,
the other side may have

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.070
something more common or
something that we saw before

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:33.290
with the zinc solid and
the zinc in solution.

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:37.670
So since on this side we have
the cathode, of we can write

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:42.670
about the h plus aqueous, a bar
for the phase transition

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:47.300
to h 2 gas, and then we indicate
that there's also a

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.940
platinum electrode
going on here.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:53.230
And the other side is what we
saw before, the zinc solid and

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.550
the zinc plus 2.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.920
So you're just introducing
different types of electrodes

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.360
that you may be seeing in
this particular unit.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.550
And again, you want to remember
what reaction's going

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.590
on at the cathode,
and at the anode.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:14.070
All right, so just very briefly,
I will mention cell

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.490
potential, which has many
different names -- cell

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.880
voltage, EMF it's
often called.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.020
And so the flow of electrons
generates a potential

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.900
difference between the
electrodes in the current.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:34.320
And this can be related back
to our friend, delta g.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.650
So in this equation you have
this potential difference

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:44.760
that's generated by the flow
of the electrons, and that

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.960
times Faraday's constant times
the number moles of electrons,

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.590
and if you have a negative sign
here, that's equal to the

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.040
free energy of the cell.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.850
So we can relate that back.

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:03.340
And a little bit
of information.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.390
We have the standard
terms as well.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:09.010
We can have the delta e nought,
the cell potential,

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.810
cell voltage, you'll see
many names for this.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:14.410
And that's when the products
and reactants are in their

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.860
standard states.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.740
The units we're talking about
here are in volts, sometimes

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.690
you'll see things reported
in millivolts as well.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:27.720
And let's end with one final
clicker question, and then we

00:47:27.720 --> 00:48:11.650
can announce our clicker
winner for today.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:18.980
OK, 10 seconds.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.340
Most people should
get this right.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.240
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.930
Our main aim today
is to successfully

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.320
conclude block three,
and to set the stage

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.530
for introducing block four.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.730
Now by way of brief review,
we may have become so involved

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.680
with our discussion of
the last few lessons

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.000
where we've done the chain
rule, that we may have forgotten

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.360
that the basic ingredient
that we had arrived at,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.880
that set up our proof
of the chain rule--

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.441
and then after that,
we got involved

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:02.440
in the computation of how
to use the chain rule.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.849
But the basic
ingredient was the idea

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:10.140
that we had obtained a linear
approximation, a delta w tan

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.190
idea.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.680
And this concept leads to the
idea of a differential, which

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.170
is an extension of the
idea of differentials

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.510
as we knew them in
part one of our course.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.860
And what I would like to do
is to talk somewhat briefly

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.570
about this topic, to show
how it introduces what

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.200
will be the main
body of material

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.080
in block four and an
important application

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.780
that we can handle now that
will show why it's worth

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.086
understanding certain things
about differentials, even

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:40.130
on a very elementary level.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.840
At any rate, the topic
that I've chosen for today

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.330
is called "Exact Differentials."

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.650
And the idea,
again, is completely

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.110
analogous to what we did in
calculus of a single variable.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.870
We start with w
equals f of x, y.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.950
And we showed that if w was
a continuously differentiable

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.390
function of x and
y, it made sense

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.030
to emphasize the expression
called delta w tan, which

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.650
was the partial
of f with respect

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.930
to x evaluated at a
given point times delta

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.080
x, plus the partial
of f with respect

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.090
to y at that same
point times delta y.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.040
And what we do is the
same thing that we did,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.260
as I say, in calculus
of a single variable.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.540
We introduce a new language.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.160
We write delta w tan now as dw.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.010
We write delta x as
dx, delta y as dy.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.650
And what we say is that dw is
the total differential of w.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.300
To see how this is analogous
to what happened in calculus

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.450
of a single variable, notice,
for the sake of argument,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.890
that if f happens to be
a function of x alone,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.440
so that there is
no second variable.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.740
In other words, if f
is independent of y,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.450
notice that the partial of f
with respect to y will be 0.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.170
And we will then have that
w is a function of x alone.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.830
dw, then, will be what?

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.590
Well in that case, the
partial of f with respect to x

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.470
is the ordinary derivative of
f with respect to x times dx.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.780
And we're back to our old recipe
that dw is dw/dx times dx.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.040
That this is a natural extension
of what happened in calculus

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.370
of a single variable.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.090
All right?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.700
Now what leads
into the next block

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.200
and why we're going to drop this
for the time being but to go up

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.290
to a different
aspect of this, is

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.130
notice that if we can
assume that dw can replace

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.665
delta w-- if we can
assume, as we talked

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:30.040
about in the case
of continuously

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.430
differentiable functions, that
the difference between delta w

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.010
and delta w tan is negligible
for sufficiently small delta

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.780
x and delta y, notice that the
equation dw equals f sub x dx

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.265
plus f sub y dy, since f sub
x and f sub y are computed

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:48.500
at a given point,
these become what?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.900
Linear combinations of dx
and dy, a constant times dx

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.760
plus a constant times dy.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.480
And we're into the subject
of linear equations, which

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.640
we will talk about next time.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.490
For the time being,
all I want to point out

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.920
is that dw is called the
total differential of w.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.330
And that conversely, starting
with any expression of the form

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.430
some function M of x and y
times dx plus some function

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.600
N of x and y times
dy-- in other words,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.800
M of x, y dx plus N
of x, y dy, no matter

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.200
what functions of x
and y M and N are,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.140
any expression of this form
is called a differential.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.670
By the way, you
may recall that you

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.180
were used to calling dx a
differential back in calculus

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.490
of a single variable.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.910
Notice that in particular,
one choice of capital N

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.540
is to have N of x,
y be identically 0.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.200
We could have M of x,
y be identically 1.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.470
In which case, M*dx plus N*dy
would simply be 1*dx plus 0*dy,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.130
or dx.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.560
In other words, notice that
this extended definition

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.430
of a differential for
two or more variables

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.820
includes the definition
for a single variable.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.920
At any rate, any
expression of this type

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.740
is called a differential.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.750
And again, a very natural
question that comes up

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.250
is who wants differentials?

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.880
Why do we need them?

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.000
And perhaps the best
application comes

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.260
from the clue that
a certain subject is

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.370
called "Differential
Equations," rather than

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.190
derivative equations.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.000
Let me illustrate this
in terms of what I think

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.780
is a rather nice
example, in the sense

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.610
that it will be hard
to guess the answer,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.060
but rather easy to visualize
what the problem says,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.077
at least.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.785
Let's imagine that I
have a certain curve

00:05:28.785 --> 00:05:31.220
S in the xy-plane.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.030
I don't tell you anything
else about that curve

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.160
except that its slope
at any point x comma y

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.660
is given by the very
interesting relationship

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.680
that it's the quotient of
the square of its distance

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.280
from the origin over twice the
product of its coordinates.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.525
In other words, to find
the slope of the curve S

00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:56.720
at the point x comma y, I
square the distance of the point

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.340
from the origin, take
the negative of that,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.720
divide by twice the
product of the coordinates,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.956
and that's going
to be the slope.

00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:06.830
Now certainly that makes
sense geometrically.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.190
But what type of a curve
would have that property?

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.090
And even assuming that we knew
such a curve, how in the world

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.540
can you express it in
a convenient manner?

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.780
Well here's the idea.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.250
Again, back to
the same technique

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.240
that we used in calculus
of a single variable.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.030
Algebraically, this
is our equation.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.260
If we cross-multiply and
collect all our terms

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.300
onto one side of
the equation, we

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.650
obtain what we call the
differential equation, see?

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.900
It's an equation
involving a differential.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.550
In fact, in this case, using
our general notation, M of x, y

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.390
is x squared plus y squared.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.790
And N of x, y is 2x*y.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.510
We have a differential
equal to 0.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.340
Now without going
into this right now,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.576
suppose I just happen to
have a very quick eye.

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.280
Well in fact, before I even say
that, let me point this out.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.020
We've had problems like this
in part one of our course.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.660
The main difference was
that we could separate out

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.310
the variables.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.690
We could get the x's
and the y's separated.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.790
Remember now, y is implicitly
a function of x here,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.240
in this expression,
because of the equation.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.580
See? x and y are no
longer independent

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.570
when we equate this to 0.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.450
The question is though,
we cannot separate

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.540
the x's and the y's here.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.500
But if we were lucky-- that's
where luck comes in-- we would

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.790
recognize that treating
y as a function of x,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.910
the differential on
the left-hand side

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.650
is precisely the differential
of 1/3 x cubed plus x squared y.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.160
In other words, the partial
of this with respect to x is

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.890
simply x squared-- do I have...

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.522
I think I may have
this thing in reverse.

00:07:40.522 --> 00:07:41.230
Let me make sure.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.060
If I take the partial of
this with respect to x,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.170
I have 1/3 x cubed
plus 2x*y, right?

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.290
And if I take the partial
with respect to y,

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.455
I simply have x squared.

00:07:53.455 --> 00:07:55.670
At any rate-- what
I'm saying is,

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.837
if we knew a function whose--
see, I have this in reverse.

00:07:58.837 --> 00:08:00.170
That's what's bothering me here.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.051
I think the square
should go this way.

00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:03.925
That's not important.

00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:05.780
All I'm saying is if I've
done this thing correctly,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.710
if you take the partial
of this with respect

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.220
to y-- with respect x,
you should get this.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.887
If you take the partial
of this with respect to y,

00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:14.720
you should get this.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.350
And that comes
out correctly now.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.220
In other words, the partial
of this with respect to x

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.350
is x squared plus y squared.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.250
The partial of this with respect
to y-- this term drops out,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.670
and there's just 2x*y.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.330
I'm sorry for that
little mistake.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.000
But I won't really apologize
for it in the sense

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.559
that once we've found it--
or even if we didn't find it,

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.820
the key theory is the same.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.850
The point is that if we knew a
function whose differential was

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.110
this, then the fact that
this differential is 0

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.760
means the expression
itself must be a constant.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:54.570
In other words, 1/3 x cubed plus
x y squared must be a constant.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.520
And therefore, what
we're saying is if we now

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.525
solve the equation-- I
really am sorry to have

00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:02.400
botched this for you.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.060
But again, as I say,
the idea basically

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.440
comes through unimpeded.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.080
I now solve for y in terms
of x, and I get what?

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.460
That y is equal to--
transposing here--

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.720
plus or minus the square
root of c minus 1/3 x

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.960
cubed, all over x.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.330
In other words, the
family of curves

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.900
that satisfies this
differential equation

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.714
is precisely this family here,
whatever that may look like.

00:09:27.714 --> 00:09:29.130
In other words,
this is the family

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.110
of curves that has the
interesting slope property

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.495
that we just discussed.

00:09:33.495 --> 00:09:35.350
Now you see, again,
the reason I say

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.340
that I wasn't too
concerned about what

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.720
this function actually
was is, notice

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.580
that I was just pulling it out
of the hat for you here anyway.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.620
I said suppose we could
find a function w such

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.800
that dw was this.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.950
The major question that comes
up in how one uses differentials

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.990
and the like is as follows.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.440
Suppose all I told you was
that we had the differential x

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.620
squared plus y squared dx plus
2x*y*dy, and I said to you,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.390
find a function w such that
dw will be x squared plus y

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.590
squared dx plus 2x*y*dy.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.740
The key computational aid in
doing this involves the fact

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.670
that if u and v are
independent variables--

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.550
and it's crucial that
they be independent--

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.580
that if a*u plus b*v
equals c*u plus d*v,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.780
it must be that a equals
c, and b equals d.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.360
In other words, the only way
that two linear combinations

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.860
of independent
variables can be equal

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.310
is if they're equal
coefficient by coefficient.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.150
You see, the proof
is very simple.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.540
Namely, after all, if u and
v are independent variables,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.660
why can't I pick v to be 0,
let u be any non-zero number.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.500
Then if v is 0, when
I equate these two,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.740
it says a*u equals c*u.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.550
Since u is not 0, I can cancel,
and obtain that a equals c.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.690
And in a similar way letting u
equal 0, I have b*v equals d*v.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.620
I can cancel the v's
and get that b equals d.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.410
But it's crucial that
u and v be independent.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.440
Because if u and v
are not independent,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.320
how do I know that I can have
u equal to 0 when v is not 0?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.470
For example, let's suppose
that v and u were dependent.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.500
Suppose, for example,
that v equals twice u.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:25.410
Observe, in this case, that
9u plus 4v-- since v is 2u--

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.540
turns out to be 17u.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:34.570
On the other hand, 7u plus 5v is
7u plus 10u, which is also 17u.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.410
Notice that 9u plus
4v equals 7u plus 5v,

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.780
even though the coefficients
don't line up as far

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.540
as being equal is concerned.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.200
You see?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.130
In other words, notice that
being able to equate things

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.860
coefficient by coefficient
hinges on the fact

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.740
that the variables that we're
dealing with are independent.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.810
And the key thing going
back to this problem

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.780
is, what were dx and dy?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.800
They were delta x and delta y.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.620
And as long as x and y
are independent variables,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.185
certainly the change in x
can be done independently

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.670
of the change in y.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.540
In other words, dx and dy
are independent variables.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.550
So if we now say, let's find
that function w such that dw is

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:23.550
x squared plus y
squared dx plus 2x*y*dy,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.650
the one thing we know
about dw, if it exists,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.070
by our basic definition of
this section of this lecture,

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.530
is that dw is the partial of f
with respect to x times dx plus

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.540
the partial of f with
respect to y times dy.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.420
Since dx and dy are
independent variables,

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.170
the only way these two
expressions can be identical

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.170
is coefficient by coefficient.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.230
That means in
particular, therefore,

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.740
that the partial
of f with respect

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.750
to x, which is the
coefficient of dx here,

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.670
must be x squared
plus y squared, which

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.350
is the coefficient of dx here.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.990
And similarly, the partial of
f with respect to y must equal

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.800
2x*y.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.030
Now, armed with
this information,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.750
I can actually go
out and construct f.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.420
And the way I do
this is remember--

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.170
as soon as I see the partial
of f with respect to x,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.460
it means I'm treating
y as a constant.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.170
If I'm treating y as a constant,
I just integrate this thing

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.080
as if x were the only variable.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.820
Treating x as a variable
and y as a constant,

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.680
the integral of x
squared is 1/3 x cubed.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.830
The integral of y
squared is simply

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.160
y squared x, because y is
being treated as a constant.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.180
And finally, there must be
a constant of integration,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.460
but my constant now
is any function of y.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.700
In other words, if
I have any function

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.360
of y, its partial with respect
to x, by definition of x and y

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.890
being independent-- the
partial of any function

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.890
of y with respect to x is 0.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.640
Therefore my constant of
integration, in this case,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.349
is a function of y alone.

00:13:51.349 --> 00:13:53.640
Again, to look at this in a
different perspective, what

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.920
I'm saying is the
most general function

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.910
of two variables
in the whole world

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.760
whose derivative
with respect to x

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.020
is x squared plus y squared
is 1/3 x cubed plus y squared

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.410
x plus a function of y alone.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.920
Now all I don't know so far
is what specific function of y

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.400
is g?

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.620
In other words, I've
determined f now up

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.940
to this particular arbitrary
constant of integration.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.850
How do I get a
hold of this thing?

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.340
Notice that as yet, I have not
used a piece of information

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.020
that tells me the partial of
f with respect to y is 2x*y.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.320
And to utilize that piece
of information, what I do

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.570
is I come to this equation,
and I say, lookit.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.720
Let me, from here, just
differentiate this with respect

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.880
to y, treating x as a constant.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.070
If I do that, this
term drops out.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.250
This term becomes 2x*y.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.910
And this, being a
function of y alone,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.940
its derivative with respect
to y is just g prime of y.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:55.810
So whatever f is, the derivative
of f with respect to y is 2x*y

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.640
plus g prime of y.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.310
On the other hand, we also
know that the partial of f with

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.860
respect to y is 2x*y.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.640
Consequently, since these
are two different expressions

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.040
for the same quantity,
they must be equal.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.210
Equating these two,
the 2x*y's cancel.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.060
We obtain that g prime of y is
0, which means, in this case,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.960
that g of y was a bona
fide constant, that not

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.702
only is g independent of x,
it's also independent of y.

00:15:22.702 --> 00:15:24.410
And we see that the
most general function

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.410
f which has the desired
property is what?

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.560
All we have to do is now go
back to this expression here,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.140
which gave us the
answer up to g of y,

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.780
put this value of g of y in,
and we see that the most general

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.530
function whose total
differential is x squared plus

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:48.070
y squared dx plus 2x*y*dy is 1/3
x cubed plus y squared x plus

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:48.660
c.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.700
And I guess there's a moral
to this story, after all.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.200
You know?

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.690
When I did it the
quick way, I made

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.910
a careless computational
mistake earlier

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.220
in the lecture that sort
of threw me off a bit

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.640
and perplexed me.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.520
And it seems it
was poetic justice.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.360
Because, you know,
when I took this method

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.900
where we pretended we didn't
know the answer in advance

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.270
and just worked the
thing out systematically,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.150
we came up with the right term.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.810
In other words, it should be
y squared x, not y x squared.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.417
And that was what we saw
should be the correct answer.

00:16:19.417 --> 00:16:21.750
So maybe there's something
to be said about doing things

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.870
systematically, after all.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.370
You see?

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.810
If I can't win
them all, at least

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.780
I have the gift of rationalizing
to think that I win them all.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.320
Time after time, I snatch
defeat from the jaws of victory.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.820
No?

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.330
All right.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.240
You know what I mean.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:36.890
Lookit.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.200
Anyway, the question that
we've now solved is what?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.180
We have worked out this routine.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.560
Notice that what
we are really doing

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.220
is the counterpart of calculus
of a single variable, that

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.680
knowing what a partial is,
we can integrate with respect

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.440
to that variable, treating
all the other variables

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.650
as a constant.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.690
And this is the
general technique.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.250
Now let's summarize
this more generally.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.760
The general definition is this.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.579
And by the way, for the sake
of conserving space, I will now

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.619
abbreviate M of x, y and
N of x, y just by M and N.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.270
But whenever I
write M and N here,

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.339
it's assumed that M and N
are functions of x and y.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.420
Well what we say is this.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.170
M*dx plus N*dy,
which by the way,

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.510
by a previous definition
is always a differential.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.380
But this differential is
called an exact differential

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:30.010
if and only if there exists
a function w-- f of x, y--

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.720
such that dw is M*dx plus N*dy.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.340
Or in terms of our
previous discussion,

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.790
what this means is what?

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:45.330
dw is also equal to f
sub x dx plus f sub y dy.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.410
Since x and y are
independent variables,

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.520
dx and dy are
independent variables.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.870
So an alternative
definition is what?

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.940
That M*dx plus N*dy is an exact
differential if there exists

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.950
a function f such that the
partial of f with respect to x

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.310
is M, and the partial of
f with respect to y is N.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.190
Now, by the way, let's just
pause here for a moment.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.700
You might suspect that
with all the functions

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.920
to choose from, that no
matter how M and N were given,

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.235
we're bound to find at least
one function which satisfies--

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:18.610
I should put this
in, because you

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.340
want both of these conditions
fulfilled at the same time.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.260
The amazing thing is
that it is not always

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.240
possible to find
a function which

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.040
has a given differential
as its total differential.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.570
In fact, let me show you why,
if we can just do something

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.990
a little bit tricky here.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.630
Let's suppose that the
function f exists such

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.100
that its partial
with respect to x

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.190
is M and its partial
with respect to y

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.640
is N. Suppose that both of these
happen to be differentiable.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.520
Take the partial of f
sub x with respect to y.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.980
That tells me that f sub
x, y is the partial of M

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.010
with respect to y.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.860
Let's take the partial of
f sub y with respect to x.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.160
That tells me that the partial
of f sub y with respect

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.070
to x is N sub x.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.820
In other words, f sub
y, x equals N sub x.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.100
Now if f is
continuous-- see, if we

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.605
have the right
amount of continuity

00:19:09.605 --> 00:19:11.230
and differentiability
that we've talked

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.670
about in previous
lectures, notice

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.690
that for most well-defined
functions-- in particular,

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.430
if these two partials-- see,
we don't know what f is.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.790
We're trying to find f.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.034
And we're assuming it exists.

00:19:22.034 --> 00:19:23.700
The thing that's given
in our definition

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.900
are M and N. So to word this
more succinctly, if it turns

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.570
out that the partial
of M with respect to y

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.750
and the partial of
N with respect to x

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.550
happen to be
continuous functions,

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.820
notice that these
two things are equal.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.690
And in particular, that
means that the partial of M

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.440
with respect to y has to
equal the partial of N

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.940
with respect to x.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.490
Coming back to the
original definition here,

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.290
this is a rather amazing thing.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.060
It says that if this
differential is exact,

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.450
if you take the
coefficient of dx--

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.265
see, think of M as being
the coefficient of dx and N

00:19:58.265 --> 00:20:00.450
as being the coefficient of dy.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.870
If you take the
coefficient of dx

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.390
and differentiate that
with respect to y,

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.360
you must get the
same answer as if you

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.790
took the coefficient of
dy and differentiated that

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.160
with respect to x.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.440
That's an amazing
coincidence if that happens.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.020
Given two arbitrary functions,
this indeed won't happen.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.560
Now before I show you
that, let's summarize this

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.900
in words written down
so that I make sure

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.260
that you understand
what I'm saying.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.880
What I'm saying is, if the
partial of M with respect to y

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.220
and the partial of N with
respect to x are continuous,

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.470
then if M*dx plus N*dy is
exact, the implication is that

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.820
the partial of M with respect
to y must equal the partial of N

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.100
with respect to x.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.130
And to invert the emphasis here,
another way of saying this is

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.290
that if the partial of M with
respect to y is not equal

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.310
to the partial of N
with respect to x,

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.860
then M*dx plus
N*dy is not exact.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.690
And let me show you that
by means of an example.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.890
Let's look at the differential--
a very simple-looking one.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.600
In fact, it looks far less
complicated than the expression

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.610
that we worked with previously.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.720
Let's look simply
at y*dx minus x*dy.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.070
In this problem, the
coefficient of dx is y.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:19.050
That plays the role of M. The
coefficient of dy is minus x.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.450
That's what we're
calling N, you see.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.060
And the partial of
M with respect to y

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.040
is just the partial of y with
respect to y, which is 1.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.400
The partial of N
with respect to x

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.120
is the partial of minus x with
respect to x, which is minus 1.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.542
Since 1 is not equal to
minus 1, this is not exact.

00:21:36.542 --> 00:21:38.375
Because if it were
exact, these two partials

00:21:38.375 --> 00:21:39.600
would have to be equal.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.800
What does it mean to say
that this is not exact?

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.130
What it means is
that there is not

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.550
a single function in
the whole world that

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:50.250
has the property that its
partial with respect to x is y,

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.280
and it's partial with
respect to y is minus x.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.040
You can look forever.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.800
And not only won't you
find one, there isn't one.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.470
And by the way, let me make
one very quick aside here.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.080
Notice the difference between
saying you can't find one,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.250
and there isn't one.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.940
There may be one,
and you're just not

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.444
lucky enough to find it.

00:22:08.444 --> 00:22:10.860
I'm saying that the reason you
don't find an answer here--

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.750
unless you make a mistake and
think you've found an answer--

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.320
the reason you don't find
an answer is there is none.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.310
And how can I show you
that there is none?

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.320
Well the best way is
to do the same thing

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.220
that we did in the
previous example,

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.970
and see something go wrong.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.810
Let's suppose there
were an answer to this.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.350
Well if the partial of f
with respect to x equals y,

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.330
let me integrate
this with respect

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.470
to x, treating y as a constant.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.760
It means that the function
that I'm looking for

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.140
must have what form?

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.500
It's x times y plus some
function of y alone.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.570
And now we say, gee, we're
in pretty good shape.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.730
All we've got to do is find what
g of y is, and we're home free.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.210
Let's continue to mimic
what we did before.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.090
Knowing this, I can take the
partial of this with respect

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.860
to y, OK?

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.860
Which is what?

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.230
If I take the partial of
this with respect to y,

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:04.830
this is f sub y is
x plus g prime of y.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.050
All right?

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.850
Now this is the partial
of f with respect

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.010
to y, computed from here.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.750
I know by hypothesis that
the function I'm looking for

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.580
must have its partial with
respect to y equal to this.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.780
Consequently, these two
expressions must be equal.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.840
And equating these
two expressions says

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.080
that g prime of y--
see, x plus g prime of y

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.550
must equal minus x.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.660
Transposing says that g
prime of y is minus 2x.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.880
And this is a contradiction.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.930
Because lookit, g prime of
y is a function of y alone.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.780
And here we have it equal
to some function of x.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.730
Or another way of
looking at it, this

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.590
says that x depends on y. x
is some function of y, which

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:46.330
is a contradiction since
we assumed that x and y are

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.400
independent variables.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.470
By the way, just
as a quick aside,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.910
notice that in the case where we
were able to succeed at this--

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:59.570
namely the previous example, x
squared plus y dx plus 2x*y*dy,

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.010
M was x squared plus
y squared, N was 2x*y.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:07.270
Notice that the partial of
M with respect to y is 2y.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.800
And the partial of N with
respect to x is also 2y.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.240
So it seems that the
deciding factor really

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.530
seems to be that the partial
of M with respect to y

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.100
has to equal the partial
of N with respect to x.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.552
And the major result is--
and I didn't write this in,

00:24:22.552 --> 00:24:24.510
because I didn't want to
use up too much space.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.700
But this is emphasized in the
text and in the exercises.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:34.870
If M, N, M sub y, and N sub x
all exist and are continuous,

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:40.240
then not only can we say that
M*dx plus N*dy is exact implies

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.640
this part, but we can
do the converse too.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.860
That in particular, if
M sub y equals N sub x,

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.914
we can conclude
that this is exact.

00:24:48.914 --> 00:24:50.330
And the reason for
this-- and I'll

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.371
go through this very
quickly because the proof is

00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:53.464
given in the text.

00:24:53.464 --> 00:24:55.880
I just want to show you the
highlights of what happens is,

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.090
what really happened
when we tried

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.270
to construct f that made
things work in one case

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.480
but not in the other?

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.200
I think the best way to do
this is to work abstractly

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.070
here without specifying
what M and N are,

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.420
and see what happens.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.490
What we were trying to solve
was a pair of equations--

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.140
we were trying to find f
such that the partial of f

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.970
with respect to x is M,
partial of f with respect to y

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.080
is N. The first
thing that we did

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.140
was we treated y as a
constant and integrated this

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.650
with respect to x.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.680
Well, I can't do
this specifically,

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.050
because I don't know what M is.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.095
So let me just put the integral
sign in here to say what?

00:25:31.095 --> 00:25:32.470
I'm integrating
this with respect

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.480
to x, treating y as a constant.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.150
That's some function of x
and y, you see over here.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.800
See M is a function of x and y.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.840
I'm holding y constant.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.890
I'm integrating this.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:45.000
Plus a constant of integration
which depends only on y.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.500
All right?

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.760
Same as before.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.080
What was my next step?

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.470
I took the partial of
this with respect to y,

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.500
and I was going to
compare that with what

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.420
I knew the partial of
f with respect to y

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.440
had to be-- namely, N.
So I then took what?

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.530
The partial of this
with respect to y.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.040
That gave me the partial of
this integral with respect

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.510
to y plus g prime of y.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:10.070
And equating that to N,
I get that g prime of y

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:14.390
was N minus the partial with
respect to y integral M dx.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.200
And again, don't be
alarmed by this expression.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.550
If M had been
given explicitly, I

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.530
would have solved explicitly
for what this function was.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.570
The key point is to
notice that this side here

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.120
is independent of x.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.250
Consequently, this equation
will be a contradiction

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.500
unless the right-hand
side is independent of x.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.820
In other words, we
have determined f up

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.450
to this function g of y.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.570
And what's going
to happen is we are

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.670
going to be able
to compute g of y

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.140
if this expression is
independent of x, namely just

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.270
by integrating this.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:56.070
But if g of y is not independent
of x, we are in trouble.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.880
It means that it's
not going to exist.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.880
The key step is, is
this independent of x?

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.710
And the answer is, the
best way to find out

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.820
in terms of calculus is to take
its derivative with respect

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.570
to x.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.300
If this depends on y alone,
its partial with respect to x

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.600
must be 0.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.570
In other words, if this partial
with respect to x is not 0,

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.080
it means that this
expression varies with x.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.720
At any rate, to see
what this derivative is,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.770
we just differentiate
term by term.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.990
And then we say, you know?

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.540
It's rather interesting.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.530
If this thing had been first--
notice that if you integrate

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.445
with respect to x and
then differentiate

00:27:33.445 --> 00:27:37.150
with respect to x, you wind
up with just the integrand.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.360
Well again, if we have
enough continuity,

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.020
the order of differentiation
is irrelevant.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.690
We can reverse the order
without changing anything

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.820
if we now interchange
this order,

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.230
take the partial first
with respect to x.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.640
That will give us just
M. And the partial

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.800
of M with respect to y
is just the partial of M

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.180
with respect for y, of course.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.930
What we're saying is that from
this step, we get to this step.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.920
And this in turn implies this.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.940
Notice that the only
way that this can be 0

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.510
is if the partial of
N with respect to x

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.630
equals the partial of
M with respect to y.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:14.850
So in summary then, this is
a very interesting device.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:19.000
It tells us how to tell whether
a differential is exact.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.950
And the proof is very
nice in this case

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.290
because the proof
exactly imitates

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:28.020
how we construct the function
f if it turns out to be exact.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.880
But the point is, if
given M*dx plus N*dy,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.240
if the partial of M with
respect to y is not equal

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.920
to the partial of N
with respect to x,

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.330
there's no hope that the
function will be exact--

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.160
the differential be exact.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.220
At any rate, we will
have sufficient exercises

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.670
for drill in how one
uses exact differentials.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:52.180
This concludes block
three of our material.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.670
Our next block of
material which will

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.690
concern linear
systems of equations

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.710
will begin with
our next lecture.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.500
And until next time, goodbye.

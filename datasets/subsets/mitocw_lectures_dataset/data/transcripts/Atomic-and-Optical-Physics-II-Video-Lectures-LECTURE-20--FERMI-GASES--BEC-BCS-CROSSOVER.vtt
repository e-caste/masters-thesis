00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:27.480
PROFESSOR: Most likely this
will be a two-hour lecture

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.930
with a short break, so I
am teaching until 3 o'clock

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.250
and we have of the
classroom until 3 o'clock.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.580
Let's jump right
into cold fermions.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.600
Almost everything
I say in this talk

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.380
is some advice in a review paper
which Professor [? Swiller ?]

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.200
and myself wrote
a few years ago.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.250
The paper will be posted
to the group website

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.690
later this afternoon.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.100
OK, when we cool down fermions,
Lithium-6 and Boson sodiums

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.440
we immediately
notice a difference.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.910
The sodium cloud shrink,
shrink, shrinks and forms

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.190
a small Bose-Einstein
condensate,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.140
whereas the lithium
cloud stops to shrink

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.850
when we reach the
degeneracy temperature.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.650
And, of course, you know
it's at low temperature.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.170
At high temperature the gases
have very similar behavior,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.190
but at low temperature they
look very, very different.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.200
And that can be
directly observed.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.220
We know that bosons do something
very special at low temperature

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.460
and we talked a lot
about it in this course.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.616
Namely, they become
superfluid and form

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:33.190
a Bose-Einstein
condensate, whereas,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.610
for single-component
fermions, there

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.520
is some interesting physics
in form of Fermi sea,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.130
but nothing really special.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.830
So, in order to do something
more interesting with fermions

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.010
you need two kinds of fermions.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.160
And two kinds of
fermions can form pairs.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.330
To think, for a moment, two
atoms can form a molecule

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.750
and those Bosonic
pairs can condense

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.320
into Bose-Einstein condensate
and becomes superfluid again.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.010
If that would be all to
Fermionic superfluidity

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.980
I would be almost done
right now and would say,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.789
"OK a Bosonic atom is
a composite particle

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.870
made of nuclei and
nucleus and electrons.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.540
Well, a bosonic molecule
is a composite particle,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.270
but in the end they
do both the same."

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.310
But the special
things about fermions

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.720
is there is another form of
pairing, which is much, much,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.310
weaker.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.690
And this is the form which
leads to superconductivity

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.030
of electrons.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.890
It's Cooper pairing.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.370
And this is really
much more subtle

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.170
because the pairs
are much larger

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.640
than the inter-particle
separation.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.020
Now, in atomic physics,
we have a wonderful tool

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.940
to study pairing because
atoms can form molecules,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.580
weakly bound molecules or
tightly bound molecules.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.850
And we can control
that in experiments

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.790
with the Feshbach resonance.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.320
Assume you have two
atoms, which collide,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.390
and they can form a molecule.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.800
And if you apply
a magnetic field

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.570
the two free atoms
and the molecule

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.560
may have a different
Zeeman shift,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.730
and therefore, there
may be a level crossing.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.610
And this is called, as a
function of magnetic field,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.160
the Feshbach resonance.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.750
If the crossing isn't
crossing nothing

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.750
happens because the two
configurations would not

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.600
interact.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.670
So, physics happens when
there are interactions

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.200
for some hyperfine
coupling, for instance,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.210
which takes the crossing
into an anti-crossing.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.120
And now you see the
following physics

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.830
around this Feshbach resonance,
that we have two atoms here.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.950
Here, we have a stable molecule.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.430
And there are many, many more
molecular states down there,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.827
but for this restricted Hilbert
space this is the lowest state.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:48.785
It's a stable molecule.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.770
The atoms, if you compare the
solid line with a dashed line,

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.384
attract each other because the
solid line has lower energy,

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:01.550
whereas, on the other side
of the Feshbach resonance

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.130
they repel each other.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.530
So therefore, if you
look at the scattering

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.950
lengths of the normalized
force between atoms

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.190
we find this disparity feature
around the Feshbach resonance,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.640
and atomic physics
wouldn't be the same

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.320
without Feshbach resonances.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.720
We can now tune attractive
repulsive interactions.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.810
In a richer situation
there may also

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.160
be Zero-crossings of the
scattering lengths, which

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.940
allows us to realize
non-interacting systems

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.620
and such.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.930
And Feshbach
resonances were first

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.460
observed at MIT
some 15 years ago.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.130
So coming back to fermions.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.040
This Feshbach resonance gives
us something very interesting

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.270
regarding to pairing.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.680
On that side where we
have stable molecules,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.930
those molecules are
bosons and those bosons

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.000
form a Bose-Einstein
condensate of bound pairs.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.200
Over here, we have attraction.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.220
But the attraction is not strong
enough to form a bound state,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.160
at least two atoms
in vacuum would not

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.720
find form a molecular state.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.860
The attraction is too weak.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.400
But we know from condensed
matter physics textbook

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.100
if you have many fermions,
if you have a Fermi sea,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.780
then the Fermi sea
plus attraction

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.060
equals BCS Cooper pairs.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.190
So now we have an opportunity,
by simply changing

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.800
the magnetic field, to go from
real, strongly-bound pairs

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.890
to weakly-bound pairs, and
eventually to Cooper pairs,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.640
which would not form
pairs in vacuum.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.630
And this is a kind
of physics, which

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.840
was for the first time
explored with ultra cold atoms,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.731
in the BEC-BCS crossover.

00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:45.230
Jenny.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.271
AUDIENCE:Just to clarify.

00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:49.514
So in the repulsive regime, you
said the atoms form molecules,

00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:50.942
but the atoms repel each other.

00:05:50.942 --> 00:05:53.560
So you're saying atoms that
don't form molecules repel each

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.750
other or [INAUDIBLE]--

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.600
Actually if I go back to that,
here they form molecules,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.350
here they repel each other.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.840
And actually a lot
of people think,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.350
the repulsive side of
the Feshbach resonance

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.610
means there is repulsion.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.790
But look, the atoms
attract each other

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.670
so much that they
form a molecule.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.590
You can actually see the
repulsion of the atoms

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.580
comes because there is a very
attractive molecular state

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.950
below, and those two
states repel each other.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.020
So the repulsion
up here is actually

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.300
caused by the molecular
state down there.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.270
So in other words,
if you go from

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.790
the attractive to
the repulsive side--

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.070
many people use it, in terms
of pairs-- you go actually

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.190
from very weak
attraction, which is not

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.940
sufficient to form
the bound state,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.090
to stronger and
stronger attraction,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.871
which now forms a stronger, and
more strongly bound molecule.

00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:48.370
Mark.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.693
AUDIENCE: Are there ways you can
tell whether the molecules are

00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:55.639
repulsive, or attractive just
by physics, or [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:01.085
PROFESSOR: You mean what the
force is between the molecules

00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:02.590
now?

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.370
It turns out that the
molecules are repulsive.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.080
In some picture here,
when the molecule forms,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.540
you can see it's a
loosely bound molecule.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.530
And the repulsion
between atoms turns

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.700
into repulsion of molecules.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.510
If you use an [INAUDIBLE]
which has approximations,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.710
you would actually find
that the scattering lengths

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.040
for molecules is
exactly two times

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.040
the scattering length for atoms.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.790
But if you work
it out correctly,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.250
the factor is different than 2.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.350
Colin.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.760
AUDIENCE: You said that
the molecules are boson.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.540
I guess they're only bosons
if the size of the molecule--

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.160
PROFESSOR: I come to that later.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.420
We come to that later, yes.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.870
AUDIENCE: My question was, I
guess the size of the molecule

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.570
scales pretty strongly with how
far away you from resonance,

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.650
C6 R6 balance for---

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.670
PROFESSOR: In the
universal regime, which

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.680
is open channel dominated--
sorry for talking shop--

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.060
in that regime, the
size of the molecule

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.430
is equal to one-half of
the scattering lengths.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.360
So as the scattering
lengths diverges,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.090
the molecule is very, very big.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.600
And as we move
away, the molecule

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.330
gets smaller and smaller.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.990
But once we get out of
this quadratic regime,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.360
out of the universe of the
halo regime, then, of course,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.630
the molecular size is
completely determined

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.750
by the close channel.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.720
And it is whatever it
is in the close channel.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.830
And there's no relation
to the scattering lengths.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.559
OK.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.679
So in other words,
it is now possible

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:43.799
using Feshbach resonances-- Yes.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.080
I'm just missing colors,
those dots should be red.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.710
Do you have a color problem.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.131
The red has turned into black.

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:52.130
At least on the monitor.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.870
That is much nicer.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.440
On the internal
monitor it's red,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.746
it's just that the
computer does not show red.

00:09:11.746 --> 00:09:12.800
Let me just try that.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.150
No, it's not cooperative.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.075
Just one more second.

00:09:36.112 --> 00:09:37.570
I have many more
slides with color,

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.075
so I just want to make sure
that you recognize the features.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.880
I don't see any easy fix.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.700
So maybe we should
live with just

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.400
imagining some of
the black is red.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.580
So in other words, by
using a magnetic field,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.340
we can go from
strongly-bound pairs, which

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.830
form a Bose-Einsten condensate,
to weakly-bound pairs, which

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.940
resemble Cooper pairs of
electrons in superconductors.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.620
So this is the physics
of the BEC-BCS crossover,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.410
and in the middle of it we find
a new form of superfluidity,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.050
which has not really
been realized before.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.380
Namely, you can see
these are molecules

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.720
which are too big be
to be called molecules.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.340
Or these Cooper
pairs, which are too

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.930
small to be called Cooper pairs.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.800
It's really pairs which
sort of elbow each other.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.730
They just fill all the space.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:55.250
The pairs are exactly as large
as the spacing between atoms.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.340
OK.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.300
In class I always try to teach
you something conceptional.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.210
And the conceptional part
I want to address now

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.570
is, let's assume we are
on the right-hand side,

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.160
on the attractive side of
the Feshbach resonance.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.606
Two atoms weakly
attract each other

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.230
with their negative
scattering lengths,

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.530
but there is no bound
molecular state.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.050
So how should you now understand
that if you have many fermions,

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:28.440
that those fermions form
Cooper pairs in pairs?

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.700
And the question I
would have for you,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.690
is-- definitely probably
heard about it--

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.000
is this paring mechanism,
which requires the Fermi

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.180
sea Is that many-body pairing?

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.100
That somehow correlation between
many particles are necessary,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.250
and it's a genuine
many body effect?

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.400
Or can you still
understand Cooper

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.180
pairing as mainly
a two-body effect?

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.190
So in other words,
how much many-body

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.319
is really involved
in creating pairs

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:05.610
in the presence of a Fermi sea?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.150
Does anybody know the answer?

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.760
What you hear from
most people is

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.265
that it's a real
many-body effect.

00:12:18.265 --> 00:12:21.740
Two particles cannot found
form a pair in vacuum.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.670
So it really many-body physics,
and you say "Wow, I really

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.020
have to understand
complicated physics."

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.238
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:29.238 --> 00:12:29.988
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:12:29.988 --> 00:12:31.956
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:38.330
PROFESSOR: It has something
to do with a Fermi sea.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.434
What-- [? Timor ?] first.

00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:43.844
AUDIENCE: I may know the answer.

00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:48.182
Maybe you would like to--

00:12:48.182 --> 00:12:49.330
PROFESSOR: Take it away.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.913
AUDIENCE: There's
always a bound state

00:12:50.913 --> 00:12:55.292
in two dimensions, I think,
between both [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:55.292 --> 00:12:58.897
the Fermi sea helps you
get the two dimensions.

00:12:58.897 --> 00:12:59.980
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.710
So what I want to show you is
exactly what [? Timor ?] said.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.760
You can really
understand Cooper pairs.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.140
You can understand the
exponential dependence

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.250
on the scattering
lengths by simply

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.290
looking at one particle,
at two particles,

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.010
with a very weak potential.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.800
But you have to look
at it in two dimension.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.170
And it is eventually
the Fermi sea

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.590
which provides a two-dimensional
density of states.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.570
So in other words,
the binding of Cooper

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.740
pairs, at least
qualitatively, can

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.840
be understood with a
single particle Schrodinger

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.800
equation with undergraduate
physics knowledge.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.300
Colin

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.228
AUDIENCE: I guess
the picture that

00:13:36.228 --> 00:13:39.156
was sort of when
you think of PCS

00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:41.912
and a real solid, like a
three dimensional solid,

00:13:41.912 --> 00:13:46.470
is that one electron
traveling through the lattice

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.340
repels all the electrons
of similar spins

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.768
[INAUDIBLE] exclusion.

00:13:51.768 --> 00:13:53.690
And then the electron
of another spin

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.490
moving with opposite
momentum, sort of,

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.700
sees that as a
deficit of that spin

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.200
and sort of attracted
to that region.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.176
So in that sense isn't, sort
of this effective clearing out

00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:09.993
of other particles to make room
for [INAUDIBLE] many bodies

00:14:09.993 --> 00:14:11.592
associated with
Fermi sea [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:11.592 --> 00:14:14.310
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.720
So we are talking about
two different things here.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.220
One is we need an attraction.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.700
In the atomic system
we get an attraction

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.750
because of van der Waal's
molecular forces, that's it.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.180
For electrons which
have Coulomb charge,

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.780
where is the attraction?

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.320
And you wonderfully
described that there

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.060
is attraction between electrons.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.630
It's like the couch effect.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.500
If you sit on the couch,
you indent the couch,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.120
and the person next to
you will move towards you.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.980
Similarly, when an electron
goes through a lattice

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.390
it leaves a polarization
of the lattice behind

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.910
and the next electron is
attracted to this trajectory.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:57.600
So what you are explaining is
the phonon-mediated process

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.450
which leads to attraction.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.039
But if I have two fermions
which attract each other

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:03.330
I don't need this complication.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.121
AUDIENCE: But couldn't
you even get it

00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:12.070
without a lattice
[INAUDIBLE] the Fermi gas.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.872
If I have one fermion,
and I move it,

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:19.320
the location that it was has
been-- All the other fermions

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.144
have been pushed away
from that so there's

00:15:23.144 --> 00:15:25.534
a sort of a density
depletion there.

00:15:25.534 --> 00:15:27.541
So couldn't the
other spin component

00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:29.358
see that as
effective attraction?

00:15:29.358 --> 00:15:33.730
PROFESSOR: Density
depletion are density waves,

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.665
and these are
sound waves-- maybe

00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:39.020
there is a possibility to map
it on phonons in the lattice.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.580
I haven't heard about it.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.960
So I've never heard about
such an attraction which

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.280
would happen in a Fermi gas,
which would give the Coulomb

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.522
repulsion for some correlation
attractive component.

00:15:49.522 --> 00:15:51.490
What is well-described,
of course,

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.910
is the couch model or the
phonon model you mentioned.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.920
But I'm saying, this is just
giving you the attraction.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.160
But the question
is now, and that's

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.490
the next expression
I raised, once we

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.380
have an attraction
between two particles,

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.140
do we need many-body physics
or single-particle physics

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.660
to have pairing?

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.480
So let me address that.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.380
Now this is out of
the review paper,

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.130
you could be much more about it.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.480
But it simply reminds you--
undergraduate problem--

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.910
what happens when you have
two particles with a very

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.316
weak attractive potential?

00:16:25.316 --> 00:16:26.940
And, of course, since
you can eliminate

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.470
the center of mass motion,
when I say two particles

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.830
it's the same as one
particle attracted

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.660
to a central potential.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.100
What you learn, or what could
may have already learned

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.940
in your undergraduate
days, is that in 1D,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:45.750
if you have an infinitesimal
depths of the square of L,

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.130
you found a bound state.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.420
The bound state will decay very
slowly, but it's a bound state.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.570
In two-dimension you
also find a bound state.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.720
In two dimensions
logarithm appears.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.440
Often when logarithm appears
it's sort of the limit.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.300
The logarithm is the
weakest form of binding.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.599
And if you go one step
further, for a very small

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:11.000
attractive potential, you
do not have a bound state.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.730
So in three -dimension
you need a minimum.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.902
You need a critical
energy of the square

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:19.740
of L-- critical depths
before your bound state--

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.099
whereas, infinitesimal
attraction

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.900
is enough to bind particles
in one or two-dimension.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.580
So therefore, when we
talk about fermions

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.670
with very weak attraction--
in 1D and 2D, no problem.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.550
They can form pairs by that,
pairs even in vacuum. --

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.520
but, in 3D we need something
else because an infinitesimal

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.586
attraction is not
enough to form a pair.

00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:47.335
Now let me ask you the
following question.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.790
Let me just cover the slide
because it gives the solution-.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.480
You all know that in
three dimension, when

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.080
you have radio symmetry,
you can transform

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.710
the three-dimensional
Schrodinger

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.020
equation into an
angular equation,

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.580
but then also into a
one-dimensional equation

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.950
for the radial wave function.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.170
And of course, this
one-dimensional radial equation

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.410
has the same potential as the
original three-dimensional

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.170
equations.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.320
So I don't know, I want
to hear from one of you.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.790
Why does now an
infinitesimal square

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.940
of L potential with
attraction give bound states

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.260
in 1D, but not in 3D?

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.440
Because in 3D, the
radial wave equation

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.472
uses the same infinitesimal
potential as in 1D.

00:18:36.472 --> 00:18:36.972
Jenny.

00:18:36.972 --> 00:18:39.860
AUDIENCE:Because you have
to break down an effective

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.870
potential that takes into
account the centrifugal

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.870
PROFESSOR: Perfect, but
let's use L equals zero.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.360
Then the centrifugal
correction is zero.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.490
Otherwise you are right.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.900
It's an effective potential.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.720
But let's talk about L
equals zero, S states.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.660
Then there is no correction
due to the centrifugal forces.

00:19:01.396 --> 00:19:02.770
Colin.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.656
AUDIENCE: Radial
derivative is no longer

00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:09.357
just a simple second
derivative [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.190
PROFESSOR: No it is.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.990
You have a more complicated
radial derivative,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.000
but then you go to
an equation which

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.290
just says D2DR squared
over function U

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.530
and it's exactly the
one-dimensional Schrodinger

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.510
equation, which you write down.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.820
You can transform
the radial equation

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.910
with a more
complicated derivative

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.910
into something which is exactly
a 1D Schrodinger equation.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:32.410
Yes.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.366
AUDIENCE: You can
[INAUDIBLE] relationship

00:19:34.366 --> 00:19:35.344
between [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:39.210
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.157
Uncertainty of relation
always can immediately

00:19:41.157 --> 00:19:42.990
help you if you have
an uncertainty relation

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.260
for for kinetic
energy and you realize

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.770
that you don't have enough
potential, but maybe

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.020
mathematically, what
is different between

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.790
the identically-looking
1D Schrodering

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.130
equation and the
radial Schrodinger

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.084
equation for the
wave function U?

00:20:01.084 --> 00:20:03.375
AUDIENCE: I don't know how
this is going to lead to it,

00:20:03.375 --> 00:20:06.579
but I noticed one difference
is that in in the three

00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:08.610
dimensional case you
can't go less than zero.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.580
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.630
In the three dimensional case
you have a wave function psi,

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.860
but then you do a substitution
that the 1D Schrodinger

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.710
equation is not for
psi, it is for U.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.800
And U is the radial
part divided by R.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.760
So you transform to a
different function, which

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.570
is one more power of R. And
the requirement because of this

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:34.090
is that your radial
wave function

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.450
of this one-dimensional
radial equation

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.220
has to have a node
in the center.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.450
And now you see what happens.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.520
If you start at zero, your
wave function shoots up.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.620
If you don't have
enough attraction

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.150
it will never curve down and
become a normalizable state.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.500
Whereas, in 1D you do
not have the requirement

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.210
that the wave function
if your 1D Schrodinger

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.560
equation has a node.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.280
So you have the same equation,
the same infinitesimal

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.980
potential, but the
radial equation

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.410
has a different
boundary condition.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.540
So that's the difference.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.500
And that's important.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.380
It changes the
physics completely.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.450
OK.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:17.388
Now it looks very different and
it seems you have to-- Niki.

00:21:17.388 --> 00:21:19.660
AUDIENCE: What about 2D?

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.025
PROFESSOR: Limiting case,
we come to that in a second.

00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:25.795
In 2D an infinitesimal
potential is still enough.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.530
Now I want to show you how you
can take care of all dimensions

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.040
with one equation and not
solve three different equations

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.730
with three different
kinetic energy terms.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.285
That goes as follows.

00:21:40.285 --> 00:21:42.410
Recognize that this is just
Schrodinger's equation,

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.960
kinetic energy minus
energy equals potential.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.060
But now we can
Fourier transform it.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.280
And the nice thing about
Fourier transformation

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.590
is that the second derivative,
spatial derivative,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.160
is simply q squared.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:05.000
So therefore, if you describe
now everything in Fourier

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.540
space, you have q squared
plus k squared times psi,

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.450
but you divide by q
squared plus k squared.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.520
Here you have a product.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.700
The product turns
into convolution.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.580
Anyway, it may be not the most
familiar way you've seen it,

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.510
but this is just Schrodinger's
equation in Fourier components.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.750
And now we want to
simplify that we

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.440
have a short-range potential.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.970
So we assume we have a
short range potential.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.680
If you had a delta function,
the momentum components

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.290
of the potential would
be constant for all R.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.440
But, we get into
something unphysical

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.100
if you don't put in a cutoff,
so we put in a cutoff.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.050
But with that
cutoff, you can now

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.630
re-write the
equation as follows.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.200
And now we want to do one thing.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.530
We want to integrate over q.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.210
Then on the right-hand side we
also have an integral over q.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.760
And then we divide
by the common factor.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.750
And what you get is this.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.910
I know I'm going fast,
but this is nothing else

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.540
than re-writing Schrodinger's
equation for you.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.550
But now look at it.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:15.120
It has an integral
over all energies

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.020
with the density of
states, or of E, of energy.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.130
E is k square.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.000
This is the energy
of the bound state,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.180
and we want the bound state.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.900
And on the left
hand side we have

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.370
our infinitesimal potential.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.210
And one thing is
clear, if you have

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.600
an infinitesimal
potential, we can only

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.490
get an infinitesimally
bound state.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.290
So now we do the following.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:53.450
If the left hand side
goes to 0, If you

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.270
go to an infinitesimal
attraction,

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.680
the left hand side diverges.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.020
And the question is now,
if the energy goes to 0,

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.370
does the right hand
side diverge or not?

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.500
In other words,
if this integral,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.320
where you said E equals
0, does not diverge,

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.840
you cannot fulfill this
equation with an infinitesimal

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.090
attraction in the
square of l potential.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.830
So therefore, the
condition for bound state

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:24.490
is now that this expression
here with E equals 0, diverges.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.010
And this combines
now all the cases.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.340
And you have now an
integral equation,

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.050
and you can now solve
it for infinitesimal V0.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.870
You can solve it, what is the
energy as a functional of V0?

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:48.460
And in two dimensions, when the
density of states versus energy

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.542
is constant, you have
the weakest divergence

00:24:51.542 --> 00:24:52.500
on the right hand side.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.340
It's logarithmic divergence.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.310
In three dimensions,
this doesn't diverge.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.030
In one dimension it
diverges big time.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.830
Two dimensions is the limit.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.710
There's a logarithmic
divergence.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.890
And if you do the math,
which is elementary,

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.730
but I'm not doing it,
you find that the energy

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.930
of the bound state depends
exponentially on minus 1

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.450
over the attraction.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.430
So for infinitesimal
attraction, this

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.870
turns to E to the
minus infinity.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.380
It's the weakest bound
state you can imagine,

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.500
and this happens in 2D.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.160
OK, let's go from one particle
physics back to fermions.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.690
And let me now present to
you how Leon Cooper really

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:38.185
found the key ingredients to
the long standing problem, "How

00:25:38.185 --> 00:25:40.680
do electrons pair in
a superconductor?"

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.820
And he did the following.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.520
He made an artificial
simplification,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.240
which you can see is ingenious.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.690
He assumed the following.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:55.290
He just wanted to understand,
how do two electrons pair?

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.060
But he simply assumed
that those two electrons

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.480
are on top of a Fermi sea.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.790
So he pretty much said, "I
want to solve the problem where

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:09.860
two electrons just scatter
through all available states

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.910
and then figure out if an
infinitesimal attraction

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:18.190
between those electrons
leads to binding."

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.740
Of course, in the real world,
the electrons in the Fermi sea

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.860
are identical to
those electrons,

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.720
to those two special electrons,
and they're constantly

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.700
exchanged.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.430
But he simply made
this artificial model.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.680
And then, of course,
we can immediately

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.090
write down the
equivalent equation.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.850
It's exactly the same
formalism, except for when

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.770
we integrate over
all energies here.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.090
We integrate, yes.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.020
We integrate over the
three-dimensional energy.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.120
But now, we integrate
only over a small region

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.230
on top of the Fermi sea.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.310
And everything looks the same.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.830
We just have sometimes
subtract the Fermi energy.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.340
All energies are now
measured not relative to 0,

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.400
but relative to
the Fermi energy.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.870
If you compare it to the
equation I just showed you,

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.000
forcing the particle
bound state,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.020
you pretty much see that
everything is the same,

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.560
except for energies are measured
relative to the Fermi energy.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.340
And secondly, we're not
integrating from zero,

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.420
as before.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.830
We start integrating
from the Fermi energy.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.760
And that means now, that in
this area of integration,

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.860
the three-dimensional density
of states is constant,

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.960
namely it's the density for
where the energy is the Fermi

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.220
energy and can be pulled
out of the integral.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.640
And then we have the same
logarithmic divergence

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.910
as we had in two dimensions.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.860
So therefore, the problem
of two electrons scattering

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.040
on the surface of
the Fermi sea means

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.890
that we have essentially
the same condition

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.760
for the electrons as if they
would live in two dimensions.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.310
Question.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.030
If the world were
four-dimensional,

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.960
and we would have
the same physics,

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.870
we have two electrons on the
surface of the Fermi sea,

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:21.320
would the physics of the two
electrons, in that regard,

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.871
be 4 minus one dimension,
three dimension,

00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:26.120
or would it be two dimensions?

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.550
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
exactly the question.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.450
Let's assume you had
four spatial dimensions.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.690
For this kind of analysis,
it's the effective density

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.550
of states on the Fermi surface.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.766
Now, two dimensional?

00:28:48.766 --> 00:28:49.910
Or is it three-dimensional?

00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:55.600
AUDIENCE: It should
be three, right?

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.556
You remove one
dimension by restricting

00:28:57.556 --> 00:29:00.980
yourself the area
in the Fermi sea?

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:06.645
PROFESSOR: It is, if you say
the particles have momentum

00:29:06.645 --> 00:29:10.630
on the Fermi surface, if
the Fermi surface fixes

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.350
one momentum, and now they
have three different momenta.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.800
So in that sense, the motion on
the surface in four dimension,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.380
is three-dimensional.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.350
But, it was sort of a trick
question, to some extent,

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.635
because here we have
reformulated everything

00:29:24.635 --> 00:29:26.730
with energy.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:31.240
And the answer is now, the
density of state is constant.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.440
It is the four-dimensional
density of states,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.790
but evaluated at
the Fermi energy.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.910
So therefore, no matter
in what dimensions

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.370
you are, because you are
restricted to the Fermi sea,

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:50.460
you integrate over energy with
a constant density of states.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.742
And if you pull the
constant density state out

00:29:52.742 --> 00:29:55.500
of the integral you have
a logarithmic divergence.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.890
And you pretty much
get the same answer.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.840
So, therefore the
physics in four dimension

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.990
would be the same.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.960
It would be the fermions
which live on this Fermi

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.980
surface would just
marginally pair.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.880
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
the reduction of dimensions?

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.350
Where does [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.740
PROFESSOR: Well, the motion,
you can see on the Fermi surface

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.560
is n minus one dimension.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.970
But the energetic
analysis always

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.240
uses a constant
density of state.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.810
And the constant
density of state

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.880
is characteristic
for two dimensions.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880
So you have both.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.350
If you analyze the
motion, yes, you

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.670
have n minus one dimensions.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.260
But if you look at the
question of bound states,

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.110
you encounter the same
situation as in two dimension,

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.280
because the effective density
of states is constant.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.750
OK so with that, the
message I have for you is,

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.510
Cooper pairing is a
single particle effect.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.755
A single particle trapped to
an arbitrarily weak potentially

00:31:06.755 --> 00:31:08.360
in two dimensions.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.500
And the only many-body
physics which

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.380
allows those Cooper
pairs to form

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.920
is, that you have
a Pauli blocking,

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.490
that you have Fermi sea,
which prevents particles

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.390
from going into
the deep Fermi sea.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.800
They stay on the surface,
and therefore, they

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.210
form weak pairs.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.020
So the only many
body physics, which

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.668
we need for that kind of
pairing is Pauli blocking.

00:31:29.668 --> 00:31:30.496
Mark.

00:31:30.496 --> 00:31:31.162
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:31:31.162 --> 00:31:35.150
Can you explain what is
ER in the previous slide?

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.495
PROFESSOR: ER was the cutoff.

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:38.800
We were cutting
off the potential

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.580
at a short-- we didn't
use a delta potential,

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.660
we used a square of l potential,
which extends out to R. And ER

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:52.260
is the recoil energy associated
with R. Its 1 over R squared,

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.800
with a few h bars and n to
give it the units of energy.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:58.680
Colin.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.650
AUDIENCE: If you
go back to that,

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:05.143
I can imagine Taylor
expanding my density of states

00:32:05.143 --> 00:32:09.090
in any dimension
around Fermi energy.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:12.010
I'll always have my constant
term, and the first term is 3D,

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.540
it's E to 1/2, or
some linear term.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.923
Doesn't that imply that
even if give the system

00:32:21.923 --> 00:32:25.787
any infinitesimal
amount of energy,

00:32:25.787 --> 00:32:31.580
that integral no
longer diverges and--

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.540
PROFESSOR: No.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.000
The question of
divergence is robust.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.010
Depends only on the leading
term and not on the expansion.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.190
If you have a
divergence you are not

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:47.610
changing it by a
small correction term.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.990
Because a small correction
term is on top of unity.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.700
If you start with the
density of states at 0,

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.020
which goes with
epsilon to some power,

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.460
you have a different situation.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.530
You catch really the
physics by saying

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.760
you take a constant
density of states here.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.840
Anyway, let me just go on and
say we should now figure out--

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.370
and this is also
important when it

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.090
comes to pairing-- which pairs
are the most important ones.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.040
And the message I
want to give you here,

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.250
the pairs which are
most important one,

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.990
on the ones which
have zero momentum.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:27.680
Because those pairs can scatter
to all states on the Fermi

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.460
surface without violating
momentum conservation.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.080
However, if you have the total
momentum of the two particles

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.080
which is non-0, they
can only scatter

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.010
on the segment of the sphere.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:45.640
And you got already the message
that the higher the density

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.410
of state, the better
it is for the binding.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:52.260
So therefore, the pairs
which have the largest

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.740
binding energies will be the
one with total momentum zero.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.370
OK, now we go from
Cooper to BCS.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.250
Those three guys figured
out how they can now

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:10.360
take the physics
described by Cooper,

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.090
and really fold it into a
correct many-body formalism.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.280
In other words, not to
artificially have 2 fermions,

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.560
which scatter, and there
is just the Fermi sea

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.710
of the other ones.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.940
They are now treating
the two electrons,

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.020
which scatter, on equal footing
with the whole Fermi sea.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.800
So, now we have democracy, all
electrons are created equal.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.449
So I want to derive for
you the BCS wavefunction

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:38.520
in the way which was not the
way done by Bardeen, Cooper,

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.060
Schrieffer, but it makes
an immediate analogy

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.215
with Bose-Einstein condensation.

00:34:43.215 --> 00:34:46.770
, So what happens is you
could now have the idea--

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:50.239
of course I'm very suggestive
in leading you to this idea--

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.770
two fermions form a pair.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:57.060
And if the pairs both
condense, then each pair

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.940
would be identical.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.260
So maybe we should
take our n particles,

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.395
our n fermions-- n half spin
up, n spin down-- each of them

00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:07.890
should form a pair.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.910
So one and two forms a pair,
three and four forms a pair,

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.860
and such.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.955
And then we see,
our wavefunction

00:35:13.955 --> 00:35:17.890
of identical fermion
pairs slash bosons is just

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:19.800
the product of those pairs.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.666
But the pairing wavefunction,
the molecular wavefunction

00:35:22.666 --> 00:35:24.040
if you want, so
[INAUDIBLE], it's

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.060
the same for all particles.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.030
So this is just like in the
Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.720
We have a product state of n
times the same wavefunction.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.070
Here we have a product
state of n over two

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.907
times the same
pairing wavefunction.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.650
We should anti-symmetrize
that's important.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:47.310
Now let us see what we got.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.710
Well, we describe everything
in second quantization.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.070
We use field operators
which create particles

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.560
at a certain
position, and then we

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.080
have the wavefunction
of the pairs

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.160
to make sure they are created
in the right position.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.070
We transform everything
our operators

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.040
and do Fourier transform.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.330
We go from operators
and positions space,

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.310
to operators in momentum space.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.517
But now, it's just formalism.

00:36:22.517 --> 00:36:23.600
You can read up about it..

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.891
But the important thing is
now I define a pair creation

00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:26.520
operator.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.910
This pair creation operator
creates one of those pairs.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.190
And what it does is it creates.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:37.000
We want to focus on the
pairs we zero momentum.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.720
It forms a plain wave fermion
in the momentum state with minus

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.620
k, with opposite
spin with plus k.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.450
So these are sort of two
opposite, plain waves

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:47.540
with zero momentum.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.560
But now the leading factor
is the Fourier transform

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.670
of this pairing wavefunction.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.210
So if you want to assume it's
a molecule or wavefunction,

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.240
Fourier transformers, and
this is the leading factor.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.795
And with that definition, this
is now the creation operator

00:37:04.795 --> 00:37:06.975
of a molecule consisting
of two fermions.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.980
OK.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.290
So now, we can say, well
maybe a good idea of what

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:19.100
describes our system
is now, so to speak,

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.210
a Bose-Einstein
condensate, where

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.530
we create n over two
pairs out of the vacuum.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:32.160
Well, first I want to show
you that this is actually

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.080
the BCS wavefunction.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.380
Most people do not to use this
form for the BCS wavefunction,

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.790
but I want to show you
mathematically identical

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.530
the BCS wavefunction.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:45.670
But first I have to clarify is
that really a Bose-condensate?

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.920
If I would have shown you this
equation without telling you

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:54.170
anything about it, ya, this
looks -- n over 2 identical, b,

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.460
boson-- Bosonic particles.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.260
But now we have to
be more careful.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.220
We have our definition
for the pairing operator.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.580
And now we can calculate.

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.440
Are those bosons?

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.070
Let's just look at
the communicator

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.130
between b dega, b dega, bb.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.520
Yes fine fine.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:15.470
But now, the commutator
between b and b dega is not 1.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:19.220
It would be 1 if
the probability,

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.360
that the population of one
of those plain waves k,

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.380
is much, much
smaller than 1, then

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.830
the commutator is full filled.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:35.920
But the population
of momentum states

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.530
depends on the size of the pair.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:43.830
If the size is huge, you have
low lying momentum states,

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.270
which have a huge population.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:49.530
If the size is small of
the pair, you can say,

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.130
in a tightly-bound system,
particles have so much

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.670
0 point energy that
every given momentum

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:58.100
state has pretty
much 0 occupation.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.920
So in other words,
this criterion here,

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:06.815
tells us that our
pairs are bosons if nk

00:39:06.815 --> 00:39:08.930
is much smaller than 1.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:13.350
But if nk is not smaller
than 1, then those pairs

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.020
act out in a Fermionic way.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.120
And the criterion
happens exactly when

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.090
the size of the pairs is
comparable to the particle

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.060
spacing.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.560
So in other words,
what we have described

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.440
with this wavefunction
is, we have a wavefunction

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.410
which is a two
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.460
for tightly bound pairs.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.320
That's what we expect.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.610
It still has this form,
but those pairs now

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.780
feel the Fermi pressure.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.570
And therefore, this
is automatically

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:46.905
taken account in the formalism.

00:39:46.905 --> 00:39:47.405
Colin

00:39:47.405 --> 00:39:48.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:50.632 --> 00:39:51.465
PROFESSOR: This one.

00:39:51.465 --> 00:39:53.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.320
PROFESSOR:It's a commutator
not the anti-commutator.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.230
It's bb dega minus b dega b.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.720
I just want to be careful here
because, for fermions, you

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.440
often use the anti-commutator.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.580
But I want to check
with these bosons,

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.151
so I use the Bosonic,
the commutator,

00:40:08.151 --> 00:40:09.150
not the anti-commutator.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.260
Let me just show you
one thing real quick.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:20.870
Namely, that this wavefunction
is identical to the famous BCS

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:22.830
wavefunction.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:26.860
Well, almost, not quite.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.040
You know that this
is a state which

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.380
has n particles,
n over two pairs.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.250
Remember when we
talked about photons,

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.640
we had Fock states with n
particles, with n photons.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.220
But we also had coherent states,
where alpha square was n.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.190
But this was sort of, the
classic coherent state.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.480
And this coherent
state could be expanded

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.860
as a sum over Fock states.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.300
And one can now
say, to some extent,

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.680
when it comes to certain
properties of light, n photons

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.810
sometimes it's
important to distinguish

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.970
whether it be a Fock
state or coherent state.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:06.540
But, for many
things, if you have

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.337
n photons in the same
state, you can have a laser,

00:41:09.337 --> 00:41:10.920
then you have a
coherent state, or you

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.470
have n photons in a cavity.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.500
And that may be similar.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:20.390
So let me show you what happens
when I take this Fock state,

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:24.390
but construct what is now
the coherent state version.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:30.200
In the coherent state
version-- this here

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.950
is a Fock state
with j particles--

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.310
but now I take a
coherent superposition,

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.395
and I've chosen my
factors such that I

00:41:39.395 --> 00:41:41.150
will get a coherent state.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.490
And indeed, I get
the coherent state.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:51.860
This is now sort of, what
the laser is for Fock state,

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.320
is this coherent state for a
state with a specific Fermion

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.290
number.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.505
And this state now,
when I just-- you

00:41:58.505 --> 00:42:00.790
can also say in many-body
physics-- we say,

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:04.510
I just went from the
canonical ensemble,

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:06.290
which has a fixed
number of atoms

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.485
to the grand canonical ensemb.e,
where the number of atoms

00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:11.230
fluctuates.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:15.540
But now I can simply
use the definitions.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.310
If I Taylor expand
this component

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:22.300
because all higher powers of the
Fermionic creation [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.850
operators give 0.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.490
The Taylor expansion ends
after the first term.

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:32.980
And with one more step, I have
the famous BCS wavefunction.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.100
So therefore the
BCS wavefunction,

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.420
which has been widely used
to describe superconductors,

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:46.620
is really identical to
creating n over 2 pass b,

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.300
identical pass b, in the vacuum.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.000
And I'm just telling you
that, because that means now,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.430
mathematically, the BCS
wavefunction, which many people

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:59.020
say describe a very,
very different physics,

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.522
is formally equivalent
to the wavefunction

00:43:01.522 --> 00:43:02.730
for Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.910
OK.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.840
So what have you done so far?

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.960
We talked about one
particle physics,

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.690
how very weak attraction
leads to bound states.

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:27.900
We realized that if fermions
live on top of a Fermi sea,

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.636
it gives at least the binding,
the energetic consideration,

00:43:31.636 --> 00:43:33.930
a two dimension character.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:35.610
And we have two states.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:39.200
And we have bound states for
infinitesimal attraction.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.840
And now we have
used our intuition.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.770
If those pairs exists, if they
form kind of a Bose-Einstein

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:51.410
condensate to construct
a trial wavefunction.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.110
And now I want to take
this trial wavefunction

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:58.700
and show you how we can use
it to solve the Many-Body

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.960
Hamiltonian.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.820
So far, single particle
physics, two particle physics,

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.170
intuition to get a
trial wavefunction,

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.680
but now we go to
many-body problem.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.455
Colin.

00:44:11.455 --> 00:44:14.466
AUDIENCE: Can you go
to the last slide?

00:44:14.466 --> 00:44:18.434
So the BCS wavefunction has the
normal component and the parody

00:44:18.434 --> 00:44:19.922
component.

00:44:19.922 --> 00:44:24.390
Where does the normal
component come into the Bose--

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:25.620
PROFESSOR: This one?

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.100
Oh we are talking
here about t equals 0.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.980
We are talking about
a wavefunction.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.771
We are not talking
about finite temperature

00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:34.540
where you have distribution
over excited states.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.690
This is really
temperature physics.

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:38.690
Was that your question?

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:42.685
100% superfluid fraction.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.294
OK, we are back
now. [? Timor. ?]

00:44:51.294 --> 00:44:52.960
AUDIENCE: Just before
you get into this.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.610
This maybe a silly
question, but why is it

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.135
that up has to pair with down.

00:44:58.135 --> 00:45:01.777
It seems ok for up to
pair with up, right?

00:45:01.777 --> 00:45:02.360
PROFESSOR: No.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.090
What happens is, we
have assumed here

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.770
that we have
short-range interaction.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.313
And up and up can never
come close together

00:45:09.313 --> 00:45:10.812
because of poly
exclusion principal.

00:45:10.812 --> 00:45:14.402
AUDIENCE: But then in
principal, if you have key wave

00:45:14.402 --> 00:45:16.330
attraction, it could work.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:20.050
PROFESSOR: You're talking
about now, different pairing

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:20.890
mechanisms.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:26.080
I'm talking here about the plain
vanilla BCS s-wave pairing.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.000
And that means spin
up and spin down pair.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.220
Also, this is where
I can work out

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.310
the analogy with BEC-BCS
cross-over and such.

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:38.450
So I'm just giving you
the simplest example.

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:41.980
But yes, in helium-3
at high magnetic field,

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:46.670
you have one of the phases where
up and up pair for key waves.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.500
It's a triplet, superfluid.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.930
OK so we the Many-Body
Hamiltonian, and what

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.390
I want you to sort
of, enjoy now is,

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:58.220
I took you last class
through the bosons.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:02.000
And you should maybe see how
the Fermions are different,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.450
but we use similar concepts.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.792
And so you may ask yourself
at the end of the day,

00:46:06.792 --> 00:46:09.000
"Are the fermions really so
different from the bosons

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.375
when it comes to
super fluidity?"

00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:11.510
But we're getting there.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.940
Let's make the
same approximation,

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.830
we use the delta function here.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.410
And we Fourier transform.

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:25.430
We go from position
space to momentum space.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:30.220
But now comes one
important approximation.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.570
Fermions are fairly complicated.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.310
Look I mean, we have
products of four operators

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.910
and we integrate over three
momenta, Initial momenta,

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:41.017
and to the initial momentum,
the final momentum,

00:46:41.017 --> 00:46:42.100
and the momentum transfer.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.430
So we have an integral
over three momenta.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.290
We have to do something,
this is too complicated.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:52.156
And the BCS approximation
is, the only focus

00:46:52.156 --> 00:46:58.400
in these sum of pair operators
that we scatter, or we have.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.340
k prime minus k prime
scatters into k minus k.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.360
So we pretty much
save whenever we have,

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.470
in the interaction
term, two fermions.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.860
We are only looking
at pairs, where

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:13.220
the center of mass
momentum is 0.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.810
You can say it's an
uncontrolled approximation,

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:18.260
but it's based on intuition.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.860
So the hope is that
we still capture

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:25.014
the essence of super fluidity by
doing this major simplification

00:47:25.014 --> 00:47:25.805
of the Hamiltonian.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:31.580
So now I want to show you
that this Hamiltonian can

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:33.030
be solved in two ways.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:34.730
And this really
connects me with things

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.890
you have learned previously.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:40.380
One is, we can use as
a variational ansatz

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:44.080
these pair of wavefunctions
which I just constructed.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.850
That's actually what Bardeen
Cooper Schrieffer did, but they

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.020
used, as a tidal wave
function, the BCS wavefunction

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.510
with the use and [? Weiss, ?]
which is identical.

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:55.820
But then I want to
show you, partially

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.209
because I'm feeling
nostalgic about the bosons,

00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:00.375
that you can also use the
Bogoliubov transformation.

00:48:00.375 --> 00:48:03.430
The same method we
learned for the bosons.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:05.530
So variation on
this just means use

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:09.220
this BCS wavefunction,
which I just showed you,

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.900
plug it into the
Hamiltonian, and all

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:18.350
you do is, you vary the
coefficients u and v until you

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:21.540
find the minimum of the energy.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:26.110
And this gives you the
famous BCS solution.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:31.941
And this is the plain
vanilla formalism

00:48:31.941 --> 00:48:33.940
for superconductors in
Fermionic super fluidity.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.200
OK I don't have time
to go into details,

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.640
but I think you've
got the big picture.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.710
But let me know just
emphasize the similarities

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.280
we had with the bosons.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:53.670
We have a Hamiltonian, even
with the BCS approximations

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.240
that we got writ over 1,
sum over momenta by focusing

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.000
on the pairs with c
[INAUDIBLE] mass momentum.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.460
You still have products
of four operators.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.310
We want to get rid of it.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:09.560
But now we use a
mean field idea.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.530
We always get rid of
products of four operators

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.070
by grabbing one or two
of them, and saying,

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.520
"we don't look at
the operator, we

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.340
look at the expectation value,
which is the mean field."

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.430
So we want to make a
mean field approximation.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.720
But when you go for
bosons more simply,

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.934
you just took the operators,
c zero, zero momentum,

00:49:29.934 --> 00:49:31.350
and replacing with
the square root

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:34.380
of n 0, the number of
atoms in the condensate.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.900
But now we have to be a
little bit more subtle.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.690
So what we should now define,
is a pairing mean field.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:46.350
Not an expectation value of
c 0, but an expectation value

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:49.800
of this creational annihilation
operators four pairs.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:54.410
A little bit more abstract,
but it follows the same logic.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:57.640
And then we do the
decoupling approximation,

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.580
which I lectured about to you
with a [? mod ?] insulator,

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:05.290
that whenever we have products
of operators, of products

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:09.770
of pair operators now,
we take the mean value,

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:14.200
but we neglect the product
of the fluctuations.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.370
Exactly what I've shown you
before when we described

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:20.530
the [? mod ?] insulator
to superfluid transition.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:21.030
OK.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:28.850
This is the pairing
field with an index k

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:32.010
and eventually it's
important to define a delta.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:37.020
The famous gap in the BCS,
with the BCS COE, which

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:40.750
is a sum over all
pairing fields with k.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:44.680
And it is this delta which
plays the role of the condensate

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.320
wavefunction exactly
the same way as psi,

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.810
the macroscopic wavefunction
in the [? Kospiesky ?] equation

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:53.700
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:57.600
So you do the same thing,
we just write it down,

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.170
we drop quadratic terms,
which are fluctuation terms.

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.960
And the moment we
have now, simply

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.340
bi-linear product of operators.

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.750
We do exactly the same
as we did with bosons,

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:13.560
we transform to a new
set of operators, which

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.910
is the Bogoliubov
Transformation.

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:17.720
Of course, this time,
we want to make sure

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.990
that those transforming
Fermionic operators,

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:27.360
we want to make sure that
after transformation we

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.700
fulfill Fermionic commutator.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.300
And then we determine
coefficients

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:43.630
in such a way that
cross-terms cancel out,

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:47.030
and what we obtain now is
a diagonalized Hamiltonian.

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:50.590
It's diagonalized, it has
the ground state energy.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.750
And this, you now
realize, this is

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:54.690
nothing like an
harmonic oscillator.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:58.460
It's a quasi particle gas
of independent excitations.

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:02.260
Gamma k is an excitation
with energy E K,

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.430
and this means we've
diagonalized the problem.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.507
I can't do justice
to the formalism.

00:52:07.507 --> 00:52:09.090
I think the best I
can do here for you

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:12.270
is to show how the
same ideas come back

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.460
and solve the same problem.

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.322
Also everything is
now for fermions.

00:52:16.322 --> 00:52:17.286
Mark.

00:52:17.286 --> 00:52:30.995
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Separate to [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:30.995 --> 00:52:36.563
At the very top of the line,
you have [INAUDIBLE] then

00:52:36.563 --> 00:52:38.920
the next slide,
you have the delta,

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:44.240
which is the sum over k
expectation [INAUDIBLE] sum.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.580
PROFESSOR: I derived it
myself because it confused me.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.150
But I can just reassure you.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:53.170
If you take the
original Hamiltonian,

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.540
pluck this into
here, and neglect

00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:00.540
the product of the
smaller fluctuations,

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.600
you get exactly this equation.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.660
It's really just accounting
and regrouping terms.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.890
There is no assumption,
no concept involved,

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:10.550
it's really just plugging it in.

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:14.070
The physics is that we
neglect the correlation

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.530
of the fluctuations.

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:19.316
OK.

00:53:19.316 --> 00:53:21.190
Yeah, I think I want to
wrap up the fermions.

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:23.290
We still want to talk a
little bit about ions,

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:27.450
but we have now solved it.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:29.200
Either with the a
variational [? onsets ?]

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.900
or with the Bogoliubov
Transformation.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:35.850
Two very different ways
lead to the same solution.

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:38.670
We have quasi particles.

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:41.509
Here, we determined
what the energies are.

00:53:41.509 --> 00:53:43.300
They are a little bit
complicated equations

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.480
to find what the
quasi-particle energies are.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.180
But everything is known, we
can now throw in temperature.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.080
Colin wanted final temperature.

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.860
Well what happens with this
Hamiltonian final temperature?

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.840
Well, we just have
occupation number

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.740
for those quasi-particles,
the thermal occupation,

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.020
and we have to self-consistency.

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:05.560
Now look what happens in the
presence of quasi particles.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.350
This eventually
leads to an equation

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:10.230
for the critical temperature.

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:12.850
So what we see
here is a function

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.900
of the inverse
scattering lengths.

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.910
Here we have a BEC
temperature which is constant.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:23.440
And when we go on the BCS
side, where we no longer form

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.750
bound molecules, we
have is exponentially

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:30.731
decaying temperature for
very small attraction.

00:54:30.731 --> 00:54:33.230
The transition temperature to
the Superfund superfluid state

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:34.188
is exponentially small.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.510
All this is theory, but it has
been experimentally observed.

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:46.470
If you want to pair fermions,
we just need two states.

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:49.780
At MIT we use mainly Lithium-6.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.180
Lithium-6 has many
hyper find states,

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.190
but we just use
the two lowest one.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:58.250
In a high magnetic field, where
we have a Feshbach resonance,

00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:00.940
we pair the particles--
well we needed the lasers

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:05.540
and equipment-- and then we
observe pair condensates.

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.690
They look exactly like
atomic condensates,

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.920
but their pairs inside.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.470
That they're really
pairs inside we

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:14.050
found out with a f spectroscopy.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:19.790
And eventually when you locate
the gases we find vortices.

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:22.880
And you know already,
vortices are the smoking gun

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.690
of super fluidity.

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:30.790
So with that I've rushed you
through an important and very

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:37.230
elegant chapter of physics,
the BEC BCS cross-over.

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:39.390
Let me just sort of
end with an outlook

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:42.900
that I've talked about
basic phenomenon in bosons

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.270
and fermions, both centered
about super fluidity,

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:48.270
because I think it was
pedagogical to show

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:51.540
you the differences
and the similarities.

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:55.440
But we can now regard those
ultra-cold bosons and fermions

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.210
as building blocks of
quantum simulators,

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:02.010
building blocks to
understand, in its simplest

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:04.840
manifestation,
interesting physics.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.780
So you can see, the Bosic
gases are quantum simulator

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.630
for superfluid helium.

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:15.780
The Fermi gases are a quantum
simulator for superconductors.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.694
We briefly talked
about optical lattices,

00:56:17.694 --> 00:56:19.360
which can be regarded
as a [? quantum ?]

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.980
simulator for
crystalline materials.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:25.220
But there is much more you can
do with those building blocks.

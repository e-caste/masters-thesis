00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:24.257
MICHEL DEGRAFF: I
think it's a nice topic

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:28.661
to end this semester, because
in a way, it brings together,

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.897
I think, some of the
main threads that we've

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.298
through this semester.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.901
But also, in fact, the
last point of the text,

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:40.006
alliteration I can sense my
point to wait into the future.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:46.012
So without further ado, we have
Lorraine, Will, and Cynthia.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:50.583
GUEST SPEAKER: So this is
our presentation on language

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.252
resistance and liberation.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.653
Welcome to the
last day of class.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:57.657
Congratulations (CHUCKLING)
for getting this far.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.660
So as the road map, we're
going to go through first

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.829
"Rethinking Literacy,
A Dialogue,"

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.431
the piece by Freire and Macedo.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.083
Macedo?

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:06.499
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Freire and Macedo.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.200
GUEST SPEAKER: Macedo?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.158
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Macedo.

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:09.269
GUEST SPEAKER: Macedo.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.685
And then we're going to look
at the "Literacy and Critical

00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:18.912
Pedagogy" piece, and then end
with the MIT Haiti initiatives.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.280
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.982
So this is just a little bit
of a background on the writers

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.818
of the first two pieces.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.821
Both of them are educators
in critical pedagogy.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:35.328
And one is from Brazil, and
one is Cape Verdean-American.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.898
GUEST SPEAKER: So
in the first piece,

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.762
Freire mentions the premise--
the main premises of culture,

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.136
and I think that
these are really

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.271
important to keep in mind,
because this is a really

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:49.709
interesting and, I think,
powerful way to frame culture.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.313
The first one is that cultural
processes are intimately

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:56.316
connected with social relations,
especially with class relations

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.884
and class formations,
with sexual divisions,

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:01.287
with racial structuring
of social relations,

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:05.792
and with age oppressions
as a form of dependency.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.794
Got it? [chuckling]

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.794
OK.

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:10.697
The second one,
culture involves power

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.833
and helps to produce asymmetries
in the abilities of individuals

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:17.437
and social groups to define
and realize their needs.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.739
And third one, culture
is neither autonomous

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.574
nor an externally
determined field,

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:29.482
but a site of social
difficulties and struggles.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.885
Those ideas are really
important to keep in mind,

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.654
because this paper
also raises the idea--

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.523
I know it is a
social field, which

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:41.728
is kind of the combination
of all of the beliefs, myths,

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:46.166
aspirations, hopes of a part
of a society, of a culture,

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:50.904
and so it includes things
such as why racial hierarchies

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.506
exist, to why sexual
divisions exist,

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:58.478
and like what roles gender
people play in a society.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.480
And it's really important
to keep that in mind,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.348
because if you're able
to keep that in mind,

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.150
then you're able to think
critically about that.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.358
And through the critical
process of engaging with it,

00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:08.482
you're able to change
the social field.

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:10.023
And so I think that
that's important,

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.564
because even though
this paper raises

00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:15.461
a lot of really powerful
ideas, it's still not perfect.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.964
So one of the
quotes of this paper

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.300
is, "Literacy's oral
dimension is important,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.535
even if it takes place
in a culture, like that

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.471
of the United States, whose
memory is predominantly

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:30.577
written, not oral,
like that of Africa."

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:36.049
Africa is not
(LAUGHING) country.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.418
And so something like that is
also part of the social field,

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.353
and would make it
into this paper.

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:44.691
Because even though Freire and
Macedo are thinking critically

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.560
about this, they
are not engaging

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.265
with the full reality of
cultural objectivity and being

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:57.103
subjects within that.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.103
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:01.374
So in the next
article, Paulo Freire

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:04.844
talks about the use of language
as a form of resistance.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.413
And he first starts
talking about how

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:10.850
the current traditional methods
in literacy how they tend

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.653
to ignore the
importance of language

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.022
in a person's education.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:21.226
And he bases a lot of his
theories on his experiences.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:26.299
And from the second quote he
says that, "The sad reality

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.034
is that while
education in Portuguese

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:31.471
provides access to positions
of political and economic power

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.906
for the higher echelon
of African society,

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.276
it screens out the
majority of the masses, who

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.944
fail to learn
Portuguese well enough

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.180
to acquire the necessary
literacy skills for social,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.582
economic, and
political advancement."

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:47.831
And you definitely-- from the
way that he mentions this,

00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.956
you could definitely see
a lot of like correlations

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.659
between what's going on
around the world and currently

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.795
in the United States.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:05:04.470
And you could definitely
see that the 1%

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.806
usually have the most
control over things,

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:10.476
and that they usually tends to
drive how policies are made.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:13.212
But the fact is that
when a person is taught

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.648
in their native language, they
tend to learn things better

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.217
and comprehend things faster.

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:21.554
And can we go to the next slide?

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:25.457
There's usually backlash when
it comes to different languages

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:27.627
taught in schools.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.996
For example, in
the US, people say

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.633
that students should learn
how to speak standard American

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:35.001
English.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.772
But when it comes to providing
these sort of opportunities

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.974
to minority groups of,
I guess for instance,

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:44.444
like students of
color, there is usually

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.946
some racial tensions
that develop

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:50.216
that make minority
students feel inferior.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.418
For example, there was
an article mentioned

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:56.122
of like recently, like
March of 2017, that

00:05:56.122 --> 00:06:00.093
talked about a robotics
team that recently had won

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:05.998
the challenge, and the fact
that after they had won

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:07.928
the students-- or I
guess people in the crowd

00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:09.469
started screaming
at them and telling

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.738
them to go back to Mexico.

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:15.041
And so this form of like
demeaning commentary

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:19.579
tends to drive the dropout
rates of minority groups,

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.723
and all of this
tends to contribute

00:06:21.723 --> 00:06:25.651
to like the prison-- sorry,
the school to prison pipeline.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:28.321
As you can see in
the infographic,

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.656
it gives a lot of
percentages talking

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.392
about this sort of issue.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.159
You can see in the
bottom, it says

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.765
that 68% of all males in
state and federal prison they

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.200
do not have a high
school diploma.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.173
And this tends to be-- gives
statistics on students.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:51.210
And all of this tends
to stem from the fact

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.979
that minority
students do not have

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.682
the same access to education
as the elite part of society.

00:06:56.682 --> 00:07:00.586
And from personal experience, I
can definitely relate to this.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:04.023
I went to a school about like an
hour and a half from my house,

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:08.461
and I definitely did have a lot
of good role models growing up.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:11.030
But were definitely students
around my neighborhood

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.668
that didn't have the same
access to the same opportunities

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:18.037
that I did.

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:20.306
Some of them did drop
out to start working.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.809
Others were influenced by
gangs around my neighborhood.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.938
And you could definitely--
things are definitely

00:07:25.938 --> 00:07:27.902
getting better, but
things could definitely

00:07:27.902 --> 00:07:33.352
be improved from an emancipatory
literacy approach, which

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:37.723
is what Paulo Freire mentions.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:38.658
Yeah.

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:42.061
So in emancipatory
literacy, this

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:44.730
involves using the
language of the people,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.865
rather than the elites.

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:48.167
It teaches students to
accept their experiences

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.936
and their culture.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.805
And this moves from the
world of objectivity

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.842
to the world of subjectivity,
where individuals learn

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:57.844
to accept themselves
for who they are,

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.279
rather than feel like
they're a victim of society.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:04.684
And Paulo Freire does
mention that achieving

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:08.321
emancipatory literacy is
hard, but it's not impossible.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:13.159
And now I'll-- and so Lorraine
wants to talk about a few

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:17.697
examples of how this
is being used today.

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:21.767
So considering specifically
the case of Haiti--

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:25.404
which Michel works a lot on,
the MIT Haiti initiative--

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:28.975
virtually all of the schooling
in both K through 12 education

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:32.078
and then in higher education
is done in French, and not

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.712
in Kreyol.

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:36.549
But the problem is that most
people only speak Kreyol

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.751
fluently, so like 95% or
so, and very few people

00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:42.041
speak French fluently, at all.

00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:44.624
So when you go through school,
and everything is in a language

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:46.425
that you don't
understand, how are you

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:49.295
supposed to be able to actually
get any of the education,

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.097
get any of this
social engagement,

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:52.565
especially if
children are punished

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.333
for speaking Kreyol in school.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.402
And they can't interact
with each other,

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:58.437
can't ask questions,
can't gather

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:01.374
any of the information
that's coming at them.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:05.344
So it's based on this false
belief and really outdated

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.346
belief about the
hierarchy of languages,

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:10.116
about which languages are
created or are younger,

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:13.286
or anything like that, and that
Kreyol isn't developed enough

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:17.523
to be able to be used for
technical language for STEM

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:21.894
education to have anything
translated into Kreyol.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.297
And part of that is
saying that like Kreyol

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.432
isn't widespread enough,
even though Kreyol

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.367
has almost 10 million speakers.

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:31.571
Finnish has only about
5.5 million speakers,

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.707
and yet in Finland all of that
education is done in Finnish.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:38.844
And people have-- studies have
found that, in Finland, kids

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:42.548
are much better equipped
to be able to learn

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:46.085
a second language, and to
go into higher education

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.888
and gather all of these
like technical studies,

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:53.259
because all of their
education is done in Finnish.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:58.898
And over at IAP, I was doing
MISTI GTL in the Catalonia

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:04.270
region, in Spain, and there
Catalan also has a little

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.539
under 10 million speakers.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:10.064
But in Catalonia all of the
education is in Catalan,

00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:13.366
which made it difficult for me
as like a "Spanish speaker"--

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:16.616
like not even fluent, but trying
to speak Spanish speaker--

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.317
to be able to
teach the students.

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:20.853
But they had such
a better experience

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:24.156
with all of their
textbooks in Catalan

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.892
all of their computer software.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:28.928
So I was trying to teach
them Inkscape and Gimp,

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:30.696
but everything was is
(CHUCKLING) Catalan,

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:34.100
and I just couldn't understand
like even how to open a window.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.935
So they taught me
a lot about this.

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:38.771
And they-- all of
them speak Catalan,

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:41.240
and Spanish, and
English, and then they

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.443
can like learn German or
French on the side, as well.

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:47.580
So all of them, because
their initial education

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.248
K through 12 and then
higher education,

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:52.118
if they want it to be,
is in Catalan, then

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.853
they can learn all
of these other things

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:58.691
just as well as we do like
in English, which is mostly

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:03.329
our one and kind of only
language in the United States.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.196
Yeah.

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.898
So that was my experience.

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:11.170
And what-- a school that is like
a really good model in Haiti

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.672
is the LKM School.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.307
I didn't know how to pronounce
it in Kreyol, so it's LKM.

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:17.877
It's a K through 10
school in a rural part

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:20.913
on an island of Haiti,
and their education

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:23.983
is starting to be in this
model of all Kreyol education,

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.985
trying to teach all
of these subjects, all

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.720
of the technical
terms in Kreyol.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.989
And the students are
learning much better

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:33.125
than the rest of the students
in Haiti, who's schooling

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:38.297
is French and who only 10%
graduate from high school.

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.132
So the linguistic
apartheid part of this

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:43.069
is that, when you teach somebody
in a language they don't

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.337
understand, you
prevent them from being

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:48.007
able to move into different
socioeconomic classes

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:50.242
to attain the education
and the success

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:54.080
that they should be able to.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.148
And this all leads to
the MIT Haiti initiative

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:59.585
that Michel started
here between MIT and all

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:01.887
the Haitian education systems.

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:07.893
So a couple of their main points
are to teach educators in Haiti

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:10.096
that teaching in Kreyol
is perfectly fine,

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:12.264
that it is actually
better for the students,

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.600
that it gives them
more opportunities,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.002
and that STEM and
technical subjects

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:18.637
can be taught in Kreyol.

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:21.273
So a lot of the
worries or concerns

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.744
are that like Kreyol doesn't
have words for these languages.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.245
We didn't have
words for a computer

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.514
either up until when
they were created.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:32.118
A lot of other languages borrow
words from other languages.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:35.454
So I learned Japanese,
and in Japanese there's

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.289
this lovely thing called
[speaking japanese]

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:40.286
where you just grab words
from other languages.

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:41.994
So if you don't know
how to pronounce it,

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:44.230
you kind of like make
it sound like it,

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.632
and oftentimes, it is
what has been borrowed.

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:49.835
So for example, bread
is pan, from German.

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.504
And all of these
other languages have

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.806
words borrowed from
other languages,

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.641
and that's what
globalization does.

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:58.377
So the same thing should be able
to happen with Kreyol and STEM

00:12:58.377 --> 00:12:59.478
learning.

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:01.514
And the really good
results of this

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:04.116
are that they affirm students'
cultures and backgrounds,

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:07.219
and their own upbringings, and
how the society actually works,

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:10.556
as opposed to a colonial
oppressive society.

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.892
And it equalizes students
being able to have

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.761
more social mobility, and
to attain what they want

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:20.699
and what they should be able to.

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.735
GUEST SPEAKER: So
to kind of tie this

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:27.439
back to what we can do to stay
woke, with regards to literacy,

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.108
I think it's important
to remember that,

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.943
"language is a mediating
force of knowledge,

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.711
but it is also
knowledge itself."

00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:37.116
And so one approach
is for groups

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.752
to kind of come together
and create a language that

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.021
describes their experience
amongst themselves,

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:44.523
and then to share that language
and to share that experience

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:47.326
in their own language.

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:50.429
And I think that that is one way
that we can start breaking away

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:57.136
from the kind of putting
standard English on a pedestal,

00:13:57.136 --> 00:14:01.607
and can also kind of
validate other discourses,

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.210
and other ways of being,
and of other just languages

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:13.519
that kind of already exist in
the US and across the world.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:17.189
Questions.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.991
How have our
understandings of literacy

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.126
evolved in response
to the internet,

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:22.928
unprecedented
global integration,

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:25.798
and increased pressure
to preserve human rights?

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.833
For example, what does
it mean that schools

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.969
repress the development
of subjectivity,

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.204
but do largely ensure literacy?

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.706
How can modern
notions of literacy

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:37.009
evolve to address the phenomena,
such as the proliferation

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.410
of fake news?

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.615
So if we're moving past literacy
as just the idea of being

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:45.017
able to read, and
we are entering

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:49.555
this new kind of this new
wave being defiantly pushed

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.523
by the internet and the
influence of technology

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:53.726
on the way we live,
literacy is coming

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.996
to be a more critical
approach to life in the sense

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:59.665
that fake news is
a thing, you know,

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.401
and it's actually quite hard to
distinguish what news is really

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.521
what news is fake.

00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:05.771
And the ability to do that,
having that critical lens,

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:08.841
is maybe the next
evolution of literacy.

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:14.867
So any ideas on that, I
guess, is the question.

00:15:14.867 --> 00:15:17.283
AUDIENCE: So I'm just gonna
answer the first part of this,

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.985
because I'm not sure if I have
an answer for the next two.

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.788
But something that
I think is kind of

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.957
hilarious about like the
integration of the internet

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:27.092
is that I think it's
simultaneously making us more

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.128
literate and less literate.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:31.830
So like-- or like pressuring
you to be more literate.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.465
So "pressuring" you
to be more literate

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.567
is like, now there's a bunch
of sources that you can read,

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:37.150
and like now you can
be more educated,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.072
it's all open to the public
if you have a computer.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.707
And then there's also
like the pressure

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:45.377
to speak English properly,
based off either, you know,

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:48.380
like there's one viral video,
this old grandma screaming

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.582
at this Hispanic woman
in IHOP because she

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.551
was paying in Spanish,
or something like that.

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:55.721
So like it puts pressure on
you to speak English correctly,

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.424
and then meanwhile, because
of like things like Facebook

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.459
and like any social
media, people

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:05.097
like don't speak English
correctly, like typing,

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:07.132
you know,
abbreviations and stuff

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.268
that's acceptable in text,
but like meanwhile we're

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.337
saying you should
speak English properly.

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:14.540
So it's kind of a
weird dichotomy.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.208
GUEST SPEAKER: I'm
interested in the age

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:19.211
implications of
what you just said,

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:23.545
kind of aligning-- kind of
a critique towards the use

00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:26.485
of different varieties of
English with older generations

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.054
and the use of nonstandard
varieties of English

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.789
with younger generations.

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:33.158
I'm interested in that.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.661
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think--

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:40.095
I mean, I guess like-- so like
there's a grandma that I know

00:16:40.095 --> 00:16:43.891
that's on Facebook, and like she
makes sure to type everything

00:16:43.891 --> 00:16:45.637
out, including punctuation.

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.539
And like her Facebook
posts are longer

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:51.010
and they're more like here's
a card, that type of thing.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.507
Whereas like my Facebook,
A, I'm just sharing things,

00:16:54.507 --> 00:16:56.215
but B, if I write
anything, it's probably

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:58.550
not good, proper English.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.386
So I think it does
depend on your age group,

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:03.689
but also like going back to the
original point of, you know,

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.523
that grandma screaming
at the Hispanic woman

00:17:05.523 --> 00:17:08.794
in IHOP, like it's not just
like an older woman screaming

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.429
because, you know,
she's more literate.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:12.765
Like there's also like
kids who think like, oh,

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.933
you have to speak
English in here.

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:18.637
So like there is still that
weirdness between like how

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:21.006
older people act on Facebook,
and stuff like that.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:24.576
But I still think like the point
of, you know, pressuring people

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:29.909
is regardless of age.

00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:31.450
AUDIENCE: I think
because we're gonna

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.187
be talking about language,
which is dialect in this class,

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.790
I would kind of risk
saying that we're

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.092
kind of creating a new language
because of the internet

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.327
with like all the
abbreviations and things.

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:45.380
And there's the way-- the
push for speed and everything

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.065
like that.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.867
So I think the reason
that older generations

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:51.236
don't use it as much is
because they're not used to it,

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.167
and they're in a different
frame of reference

00:17:53.167 --> 00:17:55.541
and they just haven't learned
this new dialect that we're

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:57.242
starting to use.

00:17:57.242 --> 00:18:01.380
So I think that it's a
good thing, in a sense,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.615
but a lot of people who
want that standard American

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:06.351
English are going to be
pushing us to go back to that,

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:08.387
as opposed to using
the internet language.

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:13.058
But going as far as our
changes in literacy because

00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:15.828
of the internet, like I didn't
know if the ending was satire,

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:16.356
at first.

00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:18.397
Well, I just didn't know
that the ending existed.

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:20.833
And then when I saw that, I
realized that that was satire.

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.601
I think that nuance
like that is something

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.770
that you miss especially
with the internet,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.540
because you can't really express
sarcasm very clearly over just

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.186
plain text.

00:18:29.186 --> 00:18:31.477
And I think that's something
that we're like struggling

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:35.814
with, because of the internet.

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:37.382
AUDIENCE: But I
think that you said--

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.784
you talked about The Onion.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:43.856
I think that shows like Stephen
Colbert or the Colbert Report,

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:46.191
and shows like
that, show that we

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:48.961
have been dealing with that
sort of satire language issue.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.629
Because for a long
time, people rushed

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:54.032
[inaudible] didn't realize
that it was satire.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:57.436
So I think that we've
done this before,

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.404
and it's sort of
a different cycle.

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:03.695
Now it's on the net
instead of being TV.

00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:06.111
AUDIENCE: I wanted to bounce
off what you originally said.

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.113
Like with like it's
not a bad thing

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:09.648
that we're checking
the language,

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.884
I agree with thi It's
kind of like [inaudible],

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.185
as you mentioned.

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:16.155
Do you think like there
are certain rules,

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.890
like the way we type,
and like is there

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.226
like a way to be literate like
with our new abbreviations?

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:22.828
AUDIENCE: I think
there definitely is.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:27.266
Like for instance, punctuating
sentences with like LOL or ha

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:27.785
ha.

00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:29.868
Like the beginning of the
end, where you put that.

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.570
Using emojis to get
more emotion in it.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.642
Like there's definitely like
a science to it that we kind

00:19:34.642 --> 00:19:38.043
of fell into, but didn't
realize was [inaudible]..

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:38.677
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:39.611
OK, cool.

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:44.716
I understand what you're saying.

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:47.186
GUEST SPEAKER: My question
is, so knowing now

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.321
that people grow up in
the type of literacy,

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:52.090
whether it's traditional
or emancipatory,

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.860
what are the pros and cons
of your type of literacy?

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.664
And explain why we should
move towards or away

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:08.140
from an emancipatory literacy.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.644
AUDIENCE: I think you all
gave some really great points

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:17.082
towards moving to
emancipatory literacy.

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:23.722
I mean, if it's helping people
learn, I don't see a down fall,

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:29.394
especially because it's kind
of broadening their world view.

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:32.397
A couple of presentations
ago, there were other students

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:35.934
who were playing
jeopardy with AAE,

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:39.238
and that was kind of like
broadening their worldview.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.706
Like even if you
went to the school

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:44.843
and didn't speak AAE you were
learning about a new language

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.478
that you weren't familiar with.

00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:49.248
And so they were able to do this
through the emancipatory sort

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.048
literacy.

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:51.383
MICHEL DEGRAFF: What's AAE?

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:54.453
AUDIENCE: Oh,
African-American English.

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:55.420
Sorry.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:05.449
Not AAPE.

00:21:05.449 --> 00:21:07.532
AUDIENCE: So kind of just
playing devil's advocate

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:09.401
a little bit, I think--

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:12.137
I guess one of the dangers
of emancipatory literacy

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:15.274
might be kind of this
non-standardization

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.576
like with issues like Common
Core and things like that.

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:19.511
We kind of have an
educational system

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.413
that's set up so that
everybody's kind of put

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:24.116
on the same level,
to some extent.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:27.619
Like everybody has that same
kind of baseline education.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.855
But like with
emancipatory literacy,

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.958
I think you're going to find
educational programs are more

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.694
geared towards a specific
like cultural norms

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:37.763
and things of that nature
related to whatever

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.231
population it targets.

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:42.567
So I wonder if that
could potentially

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.665
produce a system in which
certain students, even

00:21:44.665 --> 00:21:47.167
though they're receiving
an education that is geared

00:21:47.167 --> 00:21:49.956
towards them, it's objectively
not that same quality

00:21:49.956 --> 00:21:53.962
of student who are receiving
more of a traditional

00:21:53.962 --> 00:21:58.183
There's the
approach. [inaudible]

00:21:58.183 --> 00:21:59.618
GUEST SPEAKER: I
want to push back

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:02.087
on that just a little
bit, because I think

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:05.857
that the standardized
approach to education

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:08.627
is the approach that's
been taken with, you know,

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:10.896
teach for a test
approach, and it's failed.

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.497
It's been failing
for a while now,

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:15.400
and I think that a lot of people
in education policy and even

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.469
just teachers are
recognizing that now.

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:21.372
And I think that education--
emancipatory literacy gives us

00:22:21.372 --> 00:22:24.206
an interesting lens to think
about how to educate people

00:22:24.206 --> 00:22:25.544
so that they can learn.

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:28.347
And I think maybe
another place you

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.015
can start kind of
investing energy

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.284
is thinking of ways in
society that we can value

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:35.620
those different ways of
knowing and being and learning,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.357
so that it's not just,
you went to college,

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:40.826
so you deserve to be paid a
lot of money kind of thing,

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:44.096
and it's a, oh you can
build a table from scratch.

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:47.466
How do you get paid to do that?

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:49.101
AUDIENCE: Where do
you think MIT falls

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:53.505
on the spectrum of like
emancipatory literacy?

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:54.873
[laughing]

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:58.009
GUEST SPEAKER: I think MIT
is way far on the tradition.

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.579
MIT is the Alt right of
traditional literacy, I think.

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:06.485
[laughing] I just
think that there are--

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:08.453
I think that the
immense pressure that

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:11.056
falls on students, just on
students physical bodies,

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.091
is definitely a symptom
of a larger problem.

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:15.160
And for me, the fact
that that symptom is not

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.197
enough of an impetus to
change, is heartbreaking.

00:23:19.197 --> 00:23:20.465
Because I think that--

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:24.068
I didn't come to college
expecting it to be the best

00:23:24.068 --> 00:23:27.285
four years of my life, but I
didn't come here also expecting

00:23:27.285 --> 00:23:30.316
to just suffer.
[laughing] And so I

00:23:30.316 --> 00:23:31.691
think that there's
definitely got

00:23:31.691 --> 00:23:36.014
to be a way where I can bloom,
can reach my best potential.

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:37.048
And I love learning.

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:38.850
I love-- like I love
school, you know,

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:44.322
and the fact that I have
just kept running up

00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:48.126
against the institution, I
think, as a creative person,

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:51.897
has made me kind of step
back and think again

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:54.766
about emancipatory literacy
and how I can do that after.

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:57.035
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So I have a
question for you, Cynthia.

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:58.937
So given what you
just said, how would

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:01.940
you-- so if you were
to be MIT's president,

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.241
what would you change?

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:07.646
What-- how would you make
it better more emancipatory?

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:10.482
Keeping in mind that
there are certain goals

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:12.284
that you have to reach
in terms of, say,

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.519
chemical engineering,
if you're a chemist,

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:15.620
how would you do that?

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.823
How would you advise
administration be better

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:18.792
on that score?

00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:20.625
CYNTHIA: I think very
first thing I would do

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:23.662
is have people who are
more interested in research

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:24.763
not be professors.

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:26.097
So the ones who are
interested in research

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:27.299
should be doing
research full time,

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.533
and the people who are
interested in teaching

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:29.568
should teach.

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:34.706
Because I think that that
gives like-- that gives people

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:37.248
more impetus just to
connect with their students

00:24:37.248 --> 00:24:39.265
and actually get to
know them, and I think

00:24:39.265 --> 00:24:40.937
in that kind of
environment, you would

00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:43.658
foster like a safer, healthier
environment for learning.

00:24:43.658 --> 00:24:45.116
Whereas if you have
a professor who

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:48.053
is more interested in
winning the Nobel Prize,

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:51.756
like what are you-- what do
you do coming up against that?

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:56.127
I also would have MIT think
very, very hard about where

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.262
the funding is coming from?

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:58.457
What it's going to?

00:24:58.457 --> 00:25:00.665
And how that kind of fits
in the global system, where

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:03.368
MIT as an institution fits
into the global system,

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:07.138
as kind of not only
an institution that

00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:09.608
does propel you to a
higher class, but kind of

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:14.279
does that at the expense
of a lot of other people

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:16.715
and systems across the globe
even if it's not directly

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:17.916
in the area.

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:20.185
So I think that being more
critical and intentional

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:23.355
about our values, and
also maybe adding soul

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.758
to the end of that--
end of the that motto.

00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:27.459
But--

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.660
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, OK.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.363
CYNTHIA: Yeah.

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:33.365
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Attention
to the third question.

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.966
Thank you.

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:37.669
AUDIENCE: The last question is,
from your personal experiences,

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:40.071
or what you've
seen or read about,

00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:43.008
how do you think we can
improve students' experiences

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.876
and confidence through
intentional language

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.244
use in schools?

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:51.082
Like what mottoes do you think
are working, or would work?

00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:52.951
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Dana?

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:55.987
AUDIENCE: Well there's a model,
the only one of it's kind,

00:25:55.987 --> 00:26:00.258
it's in Canada, it's a Mohawk
language immersion school

00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:05.397
that's K through six, but it
struggles to secure funding

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:08.166
because it also doesn't
follow a standardized Canadian

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.568
curriculum.

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:12.904
In fact the community has sort
of decolonized the curriculum,

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:16.308
and they teach history, for
instance not Canadian history,

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:19.644
they teach Mohawk
history, and it's

00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:22.347
been really affirming
for children

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:25.116
in the community,
Especially a community that

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:28.219
has its own struggles
with language preservation

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:31.122
and revitalization, and
passing on the language

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:33.358
to continued generations.

00:26:33.358 --> 00:26:36.861
Especially after a history
of residential schooling

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:41.232
that-- main aim was a cultural
and linguistic genocide

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:43.101
of these people.

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:47.606
So this is a great model,
but it's funded entirely

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:50.342
by community fundraisers
and every year

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:53.278
struggles with staying open.

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:55.647
And it's never certain
that it will be there

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:56.681
in the next school year.

00:26:56.681 --> 00:26:59.184
But it seems to have
had a really, really

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:04.289
a positive impact on the
Mohawk community in Canada.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:09.294
And so programs like that I
think need to now be funded,

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:14.265
and that involves challenging
our federal and local

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:19.037
requirements for funding, and to
do that we need to interrogate

00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:22.474
what value there is in
the curriculum we have

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:26.111
standardized, and why that
is considered objectively

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:29.481
the standard that should
impart the best learning

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:43.595
experience upon students?

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:44.896
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Go ahead Colin.

00:27:44.896 --> 00:27:46.498
AUDIENCE: So bouncing
of that it seems

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:50.402
we get to [inaudible]
thing where it [inaudible]

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:53.471
is inculcated in this
standard curriculum.

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:55.273
It goes into society
and then perpetuates

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:58.743
the standard curriculum
back on the Indian students.

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.545
So I'm curious about
if anyone has thoughts

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:04.983
how you could make knowledge
about-- because one

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:08.753
of the main hurdles is people
instituting, or interrogating

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:12.557
the standard curriculum
is just strictly about how

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:15.627
the story of America's history
has been with regarding

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:18.730
the Native American
genocide, slavery,

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.666
and, for lack of a
better word, mean

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:25.170
that it is manifest destiny.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.474
How do you make people
aware of that on a level

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:32.777
that they can see those
things playing out today,

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:34.846
then work to interrogate
that curriculum?

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.810
Especially if they are
coming from a background

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.184
where race isn't talked about
in this family because it's

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:43.154
an uncomfortable
topic, or if they just

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:50.462
haven't heard about these things
necessarily because of school.

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:52.664
AUDIENCE: For me, I feel
like it's more about where

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:56.167
do you learn to interrogate
your own beliefs,

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:59.070
and I feel like
that's hard to find.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.607
And I came to-- this class was
a huge part of that for me.

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.576
And I don't know if that
because I started out,

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:07.879
or if I just happened
to stumble upon a place

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:11.182
where I learned to
interrogate my own beliefs.

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:14.252
But I think this isn't a
point to make for themselves,

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:18.309
but I don't really have an
answer for how we get triple

00:29:18.309 --> 00:29:20.725
the value in evaluating in
interrogating your own beliefs,

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:26.097
or how much more in [inaudible]
learn to interrogate your own

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:29.119
beliefs before attacking
someone else's.

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:31.369
AUDIENCE: Yeah, bouncing off
of I think a common theme

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:34.405
that we come up in
this class is how

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:36.441
do we have conversations
with people who don't

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:39.744
want to these conversations?

00:29:39.744 --> 00:29:42.057
And I think the only way
for them to figure it out is

00:29:42.057 --> 00:29:43.515
for them to
interrogate themselves,

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:46.151
but most of those people won't.

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:50.722
So finding ways to make
them interrogate themselves,

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:54.826
I think is gonna be a common
problem throughout history.

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.761
And unfortunately I
don't know I, personally,

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:59.063
have a great solution for that.

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:02.700
But I think more
opportunities like this--

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.236
I mean obviously you mentioned
this before, the people who

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.605
are taking this class,
were not really diversified

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:09.507
at all right?

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:13.211
We all sought this
class out mostly,

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.989
so I don't know how
you can get someone

00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:16.614
who doesn't want
interrogate themselves

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:17.949
in to a situation like this.

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:20.718
So maybe mandating
something like this

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:22.754
where you have to
go a black history

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:24.689
class, or a Native
American history class,

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:31.262
or whatever might force people
to start talking about it.

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:34.933
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I almost
think it might be better

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:38.570
to not have a
separate class where

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.206
this is your
well-roundedness class,

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.374
this is where we're going
to learn about the others.

00:30:43.374 --> 00:30:46.678
But to integrate
what you would learn

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.813
in a specific
black history class

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:50.582
into the general curriculum.

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:53.251
Which of course is
harder, but I do

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:56.621
think would require the
same amount of conversations

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.857
and connections,
and negotiations

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:02.627
as making a requirement
of a separate class.

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.963
But I think that a
better approach that

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:10.768
might be more palatable and
have more positive effects

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:13.571
would be just straight up
integration, decolonizing

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.173
the current curriculum.

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:15.974
CYNTHIA: I totally-

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:17.275
AUDIENCE: Yeah, go ahead.

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:19.525
CYNTHIA: I was going to say
I totally agree with Dana,

00:31:19.525 --> 00:31:22.714
I think that--

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:26.985
I'm losing my train of thought--

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.620
I totally agree
with Dana because I

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:34.025
think that the history
will speak for itself.

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:36.085
I think that history
is-- if you know

00:31:36.085 --> 00:31:37.700
the full history of
the United States

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.116
for example-- it's
pretty terrible

00:31:39.116 --> 00:31:41.733
and I think that you do need
to know the whole history,

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.768
and also need to get
the alternative sides

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:47.505
and have those be integrated
into the curriculum.

00:31:47.505 --> 00:31:51.709
I also was interested in
thinking about entry points

00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:53.878
into these
conversations, and ways

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.546
that our humor can
function as entry

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:56.814
points in these conversations.

00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:58.816
I've been having
this conversation

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:01.753
with a friend of mine of
how humor, for example,

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.149
gives us a way to
kind of express

00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:05.857
some of these things
that are more taboo,

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:08.526
and kind of laugh them off,
and kind of integrate them,

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:10.028
as opposed to
everyone shunning them

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:11.195
and people feeling bottled.

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.898
So I am interested
about humor and art

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:19.037
specifically as entry point
into these conversations.

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:21.039
MICHEL DEGRAFF: [inaudible].

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:24.642
So Dana, I think
what you say in a way

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:27.779
answers the concern that
Shope expressed right?

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:31.282
Because Shope put
it as dual choice.

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:33.584
That you either do this
or you do that, right?

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:35.920
So Dana is right, right Shope,?

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.689
One can imagine
having in the class--

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:41.325
the principle math class,
chemistry class-- paying

00:32:41.325 --> 00:32:42.627
attention to those issues.

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:45.263
In fact there room
for that, even

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:48.399
if you take a simple
photography class

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:51.135
one can even think about
what kind of choices

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:52.422
go into making your camera?

00:32:52.422 --> 00:32:54.505
And actually, I have friends
who are photographers

00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:57.442
and they explain to me that
actually most cameras were not

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.344
geared to take pictures
of black people.

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.945
So even as a white
photographer he

00:33:00.945 --> 00:33:03.381
finds that when he takes a
picture with his regular Cannon

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:05.817
of a white person it comes
much better than when

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.352
takes it of a black person.

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:08.586
Why?

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:11.756
Because the lenses are
designed with a normal gaze

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:14.459
of the white subject right?

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:17.228
So he had to tweak his
camera to make it take

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:18.796
good pictures of black people.

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:21.566
So even there, even
in physics there's

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:24.235
a way to interrogate
the curriculum.

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:27.338
Why selections are made
with the lens for example?

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:30.174
So in a way it could
both, you could

00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:33.444
both have the necessary interest
in human beings the quote

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.613
unquote more
"traditional curriculum".

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:37.448
And going back to
the other point,

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:39.617
can you imagine also
in history, in biology,

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:42.820
biology could include
text like I mentioned

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.325
earlier, The Mismeasure
of Man if you wish,

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:49.794
goes into lots of integral
issues about biology.

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:52.106
About how we make--
heads were measured

00:33:52.106 --> 00:33:53.731
to show that humans
are as intelligent.

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:56.200
At Harvard for
example, for many years

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.202
when you were coming
in you had to undress

00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:00.171
and they took your
picture naked,

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:03.775
and they would at your picture
to decide what kind of students

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:07.578
you would become based
on physical traits,

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.047
like because your head.

00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:11.049
This was Harvard.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:13.985
I guess this was one
proponent of what

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.987
was called then phrenology.

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.455
Which is the measure of--

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.424
So there is plenty,
plenty of room

00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:21.426
to integrate those
kind intricacies

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:23.828
within traditional curriculum.

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:28.065
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and I want
to express the fact that

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:31.469
to do such a thing is
not just to include

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.505
all of the hushed
historical abuses

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:38.708
that we gloss over in
our current curricula.

00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:43.380
But it's also to acknowledge the
good that we have overlooked.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.951
So discoveries and innovations
that other people who are not

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:50.922
quote unquote "western", and
who are not Anglo-American

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:54.659
have made and contributed
to the fields of science,

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.561
and history, and literature.

00:34:56.561 --> 00:35:00.098
So not only to recognize
these historical evils,

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:03.334
but also the grand positive
impacts that others have had.

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:07.772
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:10.641
So are you guys happy
with the answers?

00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:17.430
[laughter] OK, so thank
you very much. [applause]

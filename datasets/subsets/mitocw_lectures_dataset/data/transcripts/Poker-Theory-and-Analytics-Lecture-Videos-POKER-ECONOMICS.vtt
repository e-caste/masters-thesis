00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.740
PROFESSOR: OK, what
we're going to do,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.100
we're going to start our
story in what at the time

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.590
would have been called the
Northwest United States.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.790
We're in the first
part of the 1800s,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.550
and we're really talking
about this portion of it here.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.550
Although later on in our
story, we'll actually

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.340
cover this whole region here.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.360
This was a sparsely-populated,
impoverished area.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.630
There were basically
no roads or towns.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.520
There was lots of swamps,
mountains, rivers,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.300
land transportation
was very difficult.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.860
The area was more or less
under constant warfare

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.040
from 1800 till about 1880.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.610
I'm talking about
large scale armies

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.530
in what would be called the
Indian Wars, but also smaller

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.140
scale raids of dozens
or half a dozen people,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.150
and individual murders.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.500
It was among the
poorest areas on earth.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.050
Who lived there?

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.370
Anybody know?

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.030
So early 1800s, 1810, 1820 in
the Northwest United States?

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.989
AUDIENCE: No one?

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:39.780
PROFESSOR: Anybody?

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.090
No, people lived there.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.132
AUDIENCE: People
looking for gold?

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:45.090
PROFESSOR: Gold miners
were a little bit later,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.254
but sure, they would come along.

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:50.170
There were some Native
Americans, many of them

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.080
had been pushed from
other places, right?

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.249
The east coast Native Americans
had been pushed in there.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.040
There were some Native
Americans that lived

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.010
there who were resisting that.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.648
There were also Natives being
pushed in from the South

00:02:02.648 --> 00:02:05.110
by the people in Mexico.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.870
So we've got people being in.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.539
How about Acadian Driftwood?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.280
Anybody here--?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000
So the Canadian rebels,
who were French-speaking,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.610
are being pushed
here by the English.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.861
Whiskey Rebellion, right?

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:19.610
The rebellious people
in the United States

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.630
are being pushed out here,
escaped slaves, debtors.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.950
There is an expression
at the time, GTT.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.920
If you didn't want
to pay your debts,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.710
you wrote GTT on your door.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.200
It meant "Gone To Texas,"
and you headed over here.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.460
So we got this area full of
losers, violence, very little

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.170
in the way of
economic resources.

00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:54.050
A few years ago, somebody did
a list of the 100 wealthiest

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.975
Americans of all time.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:55.850
And they compared it.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.250
They tried to estimate
the wealth of these people

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.780
and they compared it to the
total size of the economy

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.190
at the time.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.850
19 of the 100 wealthiest
Americans of all time

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.340
were in that Northwest
area in 1850,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.010
and they made their money
from about 1850 to 1880.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.200
So what happened?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.500
How did this poor economic
place with no prospects

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.570
for anything, the last place in
the world you'd expect anybody

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.360
to get rich, how did it generate
such tremendous fortunes?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.490
And it isn't just money.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.170
I mean you say, OK,
well, some of them

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.731
struck gold or oil or
something like that.

00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:36.730
But listen to the names.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.775
It wasn't just robber barons
like Rockefeller, Mellon,

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:41.420
and Carnegie.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.300
It was great inventors like
McCormick, Westinghouse,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.710
and Pullman.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.680
Innovators in other fields,
such as Swift, Pulitzer, Hearst,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.870
Armor, Marshall Field.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.810
These people are
household names today.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.390
I challenge anybody in this
room to name any other business

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.900
innovator anywhere in the
world in the entire 1900s.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.610
OK, so we got 19 of them
in this little area.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.080
And we know them today, right?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.727
None anywhere else.

00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:13.560
There were some innovations
in other places,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.182
but here was clearly the
place where modern business

00:04:17.182 --> 00:04:17.890
was being formed.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.170
So what was it that they had?

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.360
Was it something in the water?

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.130
Something in the air?

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.520
What did this region have
that nobody else had?

00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:34.490
AUDIENCE: Labor?

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.410
PROFESSOR: No, it was
very sparsely populated.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.930
Labor was extremely expensive.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.930
And your laborers had to
spend most of their time

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.090
eking out subsistence
living, right?

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.380
It would be very expensive
to bring in food or supplies

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.375
for them.

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:52.750
No, labor was
extremely expensive.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.530
Well, I'll tell you
one thing they had was

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.864
they had a game called poker.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:58.780
[LAUGHTER IN AUDIENCE]

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.710
All right, you're laughing.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.710
I hope you won't be
laughing at the end of this.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.390
Let's go back.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.120
The first written records we
have from outside this region

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.655
about poker come to us
from about the late 1820s

00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.719
and the early 1830s.

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.260
It's a lot more
interesting what they

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.510
don't say than what they say.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.690
One thing they don't say
is, people in this region

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.040
played this game called poker,
and here's how it works.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.221
None of them explain
the game at all.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.470
That's kind of strange, right?

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.810
Somebody comes and
tells you, hey, there's

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.226
this game people
are playing here,

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.790
but they don't
tell you the rules.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.910
They didn't even
describe it as a game.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.750
The one thing they
were very clear about

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.300
is it involved transferring
large amounts of money.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.700
They also-- nobody said, oh,
it's a variant of this game

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.550
or that game somebody
plays somewhere else.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.480
Nobody said, this is some game
you might be interested in.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.439
Everybody already knew.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:50.229
I mean, it was-- you
can read these things.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.310
It was common knowledge
that people in this area

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.870
played a game called poker.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.780
It was a very serious game
played for very large amounts

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.440
of money.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.240
It was played nowhere else.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.250
Nobody mentioned
any antecedents.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.170
Nobody said it was brought in
by the French or by the Indians

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.880
or by the Persians or
by any other group.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.700
It was just there.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.144
It was there in the area.

00:06:13.144 --> 00:06:16.580
A couple other interesting
things about this game.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.695
First of all, what we know that,
far more popular than poker

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:22.820
at any period of time, and
certainly in this period

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.560
as well, were standard
gambling games

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.640
that are played--
variants of which

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.830
are played all over the world
by people of all classes.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.020
Dice games, faro
was very popular

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.927
at the time, wheel-based
chance games.

00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:40.010
We also know though, the
other kind of game people

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.790
were familiar with is played by
aristocrats-- things like whist

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.170
or chess-- that don't
necessarily involve gambling,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.220
although they can, and
involve a lot of skill.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.520
Poker was neither of the above.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.490
OK, so let's start
asking, what is there

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.750
about poker that was
different from any game that

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.824
came before it?

00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:01.240
This might give us some clue
as to why this was different.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.050
What was going on here?

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.470
Ace beats king.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.930
OK, that doesn't
seem like much today.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.930
That was pretty
revolutionary, right?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.270
You'd go to get executed in
most countries in the world

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.470
in those days for saying that.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.307
And an ace was, by the
way, in early poker,

00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:19.140
ace was always high.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.520
There was no such thing
as a low/high ace.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.804
So that tells you something.

00:07:21.804 --> 00:07:23.220
OK, the people who
made this game,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.170
they weren't monarchists, right?

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.382
They were thinking
a different way.

00:07:27.382 --> 00:07:28.590
Here's another thing, though.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.375
The hand rankings are
in order of rarity.

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:35.590
The rarer the hand,
the higher it ranks.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.940
And in early poker, we didn't
have straights and flushes,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.142
so it's even more
straightforward.

00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:43.850
But here's something
kind of interesting.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.599
Here's something that
changed in the game.

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:49.520
So in the early poker up
until about the 1830s,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.150
this principle that
the rarer the hand,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.940
the more valuable it was was
actually employed much more

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.440
consistently.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.100
So today when you
compare two hands that

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.520
are of the same
time-- so two people

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.010
each have two pair,
two people each

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.950
have a pair, two people
each have a nothing hand.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.915
You decide the winner starting
from the highest cards on down.

00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:12.040
Right, so if I have two
pair and you have two pair,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.522
we first look at who has
the higher highest pair.

00:08:14.522 --> 00:08:16.230
Then we look at who
has the higher lowest

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.500
pair if that's a tie.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.610
But in early poker,
it was reversed.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.830
And you can see if you rank
it the way we do today,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.300
we've inverted our principle.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.730
Now, the more common the
hand-- like ace high hands,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.424
there are 500,000 out
of the 1.3 million.

00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:34.590
These are hands with no
straight, no flush, no pair,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.495
no match.

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.120
The ace high hands
are the most common,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.470
but they rank the highest.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.527
In poker up till about,
like I say, the 1830s,

00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:45.360
we ranked it by the
lowest card in the hand.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.193
So you first compared
your lowest card, then

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.320
your second lowest.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.620
And there you see we are
true to the principle

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.590
that the rarer the hand,
the higher it ranks.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.030
Can anybody see the strategic
difference this makes?

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.690
Why is this important?

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.872
Is it just completely arbitrary?

00:09:02.872 --> 00:09:04.080
What difference does it make?

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.340
Let's say we did things
this way in poker.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.550
What difference would
it make to the play?

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.460
What it means is aces
are much less valuable.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.090
It's a lot like-- anybody
here every play lowball poker?

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.250
Lowball poker, your best
cards don't help you.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.434
The question is,
what's your worst card?

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:23.850
You talk about a
lowball hand, you

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.800
talk about the highest card
in my hand that makes it.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.990
You can have four great
cards, and a fifth card

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.980
can completely ruin it.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.610
You can ace, king, queen,
jack and then a two,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.920
and you've got a two low hand,
and you lose to everybody else.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.757
In the modern poker,
if you have an ace--

00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:40.840
let's say we both have
hands and neither one of us

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.790
has any matches or
straight or flush.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.830
If I have an ace, I have an
83% chance that I beat you.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.500
But if we rank them
by low card, an ace

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.770
only gives you a 56%
chance of winning.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.854
An ace is much less valuable
because really the difference

00:09:56.854 --> 00:09:58.270
between ace, king,
queen, and jack

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.436
is very little, because
it's your lowest card that's

00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:03.911
going to determine how
strong your hand is.

00:10:03.911 --> 00:10:05.910
Now, the biggest point I
want to make about this

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.920
isn't the subtleties
of a strategy

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.050
when you rank hands this way.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.374
This is a game
that was designed.

00:10:13.374 --> 00:10:15.665
This is a game that somebody
thought about, articulated

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:19.710
a rational principle, and
did what was at the time

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.390
some pretty clever mathematics
to figure out the ranking.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.500
This is not a game that
evolved by long tradition.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.660
This is not a game where
somebody in a court

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.177
sat down and wrote the rules.

00:10:31.177 --> 00:10:32.760
This is a game that
somebody designed,

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.200
and they designed
it for a reason.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.840
But actually, the
card playing poker

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.940
is pretty trivially simple,
and especially straight poker.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.500
It was called straight
poker at the time.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.930
The way the game was played
was you were dealt a card,

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.540
you had a betting round, you
were dealt a second card,

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.720
you had a betting around.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.090
You were dealt a third card,
you had a betting round,

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.866
and then that was
the last round.

00:10:55.866 --> 00:10:57.240
The last two
cards-- at the time,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.906
they were called the
turn and the river,

00:10:58.906 --> 00:11:01.920
just like in hold 'em
today-- were dealt together,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.590
and there was no betting
after the final card.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.121
I'll tell you why that's
important in a bit.

00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:09.120
Another thing about the
way the betting was done

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.700
is there was no ante.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.910
There was no blind in the
sense we know it today.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.390
The way the betting
worked-- and again, this

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.890
shows some very careful
design on somebody's part--

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.950
the dealer dealt the cards.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:26.140
The person to the dealer's
left was known as the age.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.590
The age posted a
stake, and they could

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.410
post any, before they saw
their card, their first card.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.460
They could post a stake,
any amount they wanted,

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.510
including zero.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.947
They didn't have
to post anything.

00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:38.530
But the rules were
a little different.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.650
On the first-- and this is
only on the first round.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.233
All the subsequent
rounds, the betting

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:44.400
is exactly the same
as modern poker.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.980
But on the first
round, you were not

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.900
allowed to call the age's bet.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.360
So let's say the age bets $1.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.300
You cannot call that.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.455
You can fold, or you can raise.

00:11:54.455 --> 00:11:57.350
And the minimum raises the
amount to the minimum bet

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.290
would be $2.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.940
So this gives a
lot more advantage

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.410
to the age compared
to somebody who

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.070
posts a blind today, a
blind that can be called.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.609
In a way, you can
see the analogy

00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:11.900
between what the age does
and what the small blind does

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.690
in poker, that somebody has
to double the bet in order

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.190
to play.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.430
Although in modern poker, with
a small blind and a big blind,

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.930
someone is forced to
come in and double.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.210
The poker players at the
time were very insistent.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.850
They said poker is not gambling.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.730
And the difference
between poker and gambling

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.380
is no one is ever
forced to make a bet.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.435
You look at your
cards, you voluntarily

00:12:36.435 --> 00:12:38.310
make a bet that you
think has-- they wouldn't

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.226
use the word at the time,
but we would say now

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:43.350
is that you think has
positive expected value.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.150
The first, the blind
bet, was empirically

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.570
known to be a winning.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.060
It was an advantage
people posted.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.510
Now mathematically, you can
show that can't be true.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.590
But psychologically
and empirically,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.260
it was true, that posting the
blind with other people being

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:02.560
forced to either double or fold
was empirically an advantage.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.220
Anyone else betting,
they could bet

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.520
if they thought they would win.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.925
They didn't have to
bet if they didn't.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.629
So let's talk about
the betting in poker.

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:16.170
There are a couple
of things about it

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.460
that are different from any
other game that comes before.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.960
The first one is that at the
end of every betting round,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.150
everyone remaining in the hand
has bet exactly the same amount

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.910
of money.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.690
The hand is mark-to-market
after every round.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.320
So ultimately,
you're betting on who

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.019
has the best hand
at showdown, or who

00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:36.060
has the best surviving
hand at showdown of people

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.570
who haven't folded.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.070
But in between the way,
at the end of every round,

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.800
the game cannot continue until
everyone remaining in the hand

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.915
has bet the same amount.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.770
This didn't last all that long.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.040
So by the 1840s,
1850s, we're saying

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.950
there's a lot of fight against
these very strict rules.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.440
People started adding antes.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.160
People started adding
straights and flushes.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:15.300
People started adding betting
after the final round of cards.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.280
People started adding all kinds
of more complicated games--

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.390
draw poker, stud poker
with some cards revealed.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.870
They started adding
new kinds of hands.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.610
So the game starts to
change a little bit.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.615
And R.F. Foster,
who was probably

00:14:32.615 --> 00:14:34.240
one of the first
people to really write

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.660
a comprehensive
history of poker--

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.820
and this was 100
years later, really--

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.820
explained what happened.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.080
So there is this
conservative, old game,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.290
scientific based on
very rigid principles,

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.400
that eventually evolved
into the modern game.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.290
The modern game, a
lot more fun to play.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.890
The modern game allows
gambling, clearly.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.410
The modern game is really for
a somewhat different purpose.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.080
But so far, we've
talked about the cards

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.180
and we've talked
about the betting.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.820
We actually haven't talked about
the most revolutionary thing

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.710
in poker that, again, is like no
other game that came before it.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.060
Most gambling games throughout
history-- and remember,

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.890
gambling goes back
to human prehistory.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.610
Virtually every culture
has forms of gambling.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.840
But gambling is almost always
done for either goods or cash.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.840
When credit was used, credit
was provided by a trusted

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.780
central counterparty.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.350
So somebody who organized the
game might organize credit.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.330
Poker was never played for
cash, never played for goods.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.720
Poker was played
for what were called

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.577
at the time "poker checks."

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:45.660
And this is a distinction
that goes all the way up

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.830
to about the 1980s before
it finally got erased.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:56.270
Even as late as the 1980s
when I was playing poker,

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.720
there was a distinction,
and people understood it.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.090
There were two similar things
that were often confused.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.930
There were checks,
and there were chips.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.912
And they looked kind of similar.

00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:11.150
A check had intrinsic value.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.440
Checks were used for cash.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.370
Casino checks were used
for cash in Las Vegas.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.320
Nobody ever used cash.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.260
You just used casino chips
for all your transactions.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.290
But they were also used for
all different kinds of games.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.450
Chips are just markers.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.670
Chips are things you
buy at the table,

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.310
and you're supposed to cash them
in when you leave the table.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.750
You're not even supposed to take
them from the roulette table

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.217
over to the craps table
or something like that.

00:16:37.217 --> 00:16:38.300
So chips are just markers.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.580
They have no intrinsic value.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.037
There is a complicated
story which

00:16:43.037 --> 00:16:45.120
I'd be happy to talk to
you people about sometime.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.330
The IRS came down.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.050
And some casinos, when they
pushed organized crime out,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.620
they got rid of checks.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.290
So right now, there's no such
thing as, a least a legal,

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.830
chip with a real,
intrinsic value.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.040
They're just markers.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.381
If you show up to a
casino with a $5,000 chip

00:17:04.381 --> 00:17:05.839
and you want to
cash it in, they're

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.470
going to ask you
where you got it,

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.680
prove that you bought it at a
Casino or won it at a casino.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.400
If you can't, they won't
give you any money for it.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.750
But let's go back
to the early 1800s.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.790
The way poker was played
was with poker checks.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.349
Poker checks were markers.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.040
Often, they were
made out of clay.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.930
People would make little
disks out of clay,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.370
and they would put
a thumb print in it.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.036
They would put some
identifiable marker.

00:17:31.036 --> 00:17:36.630
The key thing is that they were
identifiable to an individual.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.190
You were playing poker with
money you created yourself.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.570
And if you lost, other people
would have these markers,

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.470
and these markers
would be claims on you.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.110
If you won, you had
other people's markers.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.700
At the end of the
game, people did

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.421
something called ring
clearing, which means, oh, OK.

00:17:53.421 --> 00:17:54.670
You played a game for a while.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.410
You've got a bunch of
checks in front of you.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.868
You're going to take the checks
you have from other people,

00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:01.477
you're going to trade them
for your own checks back.

00:18:01.477 --> 00:18:03.560
You're going to end up
with, if you were a winner,

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.101
you're going to end up with a
bunch of other people's checks,

00:18:06.101 --> 00:18:08.050
and suddenly a bunch of
people owe you money.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.520
Or if you were a
loser, other people

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.030
are going to end up with yours.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.405
But it's a winners
responsibility

00:18:13.405 --> 00:18:14.600
to collect from the losers.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.933
There's no central counterparty.

00:18:15.933 --> 00:18:17.460
There's no trusting.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.460
You play.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.494
If you don't like a
guy's checks, too bad.

00:18:20.494 --> 00:18:22.660
You got some things that
aren't-- maybe you can find

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.589
somebody else to trade
you something for them.

00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:27.880
Now what you've done is you've
created a form of money.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.350
It's this credit creation that
is a really essential element

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.437
of early poker.

00:18:33.437 --> 00:18:35.520
And let's talk about another
financial institution

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.170
from this period-- the
soft money bank, otherwise

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.630
called a wildcat bank.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.090
People created banks.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.090
And the way they created
banks is somebody said,

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.329
I have a bank, and I'm
going to make loans.

00:18:48.329 --> 00:18:50.620
And I'll either print up some
bank notes, some of which

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.520
were extremely crude.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.932
People even used markers,
twigs, old tally sticks,

00:18:55.932 --> 00:18:56.640
things like that.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.640
They used anything they
could find as bank notes.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.270
Or they just kept an
accounting system.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.920
If you want to spend
the money, somebody

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.020
has to deposit it into the bank.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.777
If it worked, this generated
a lot of economic activity.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:13.860
Everything was successful.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.090
The loans paid off.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.047
Deposits were honored.

00:19:16.047 --> 00:19:16.880
Everything was fine.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.530
If it didn't work,
everything was worthless.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.520
If you add one
feature to this, it

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.270
comes what most people
think of as a bank.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.860
The one feature we're missing
from this bank is what?

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.890
Actual money, gold.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:30.720
Right.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.750
Now, this is kind of an
interesting dichotomy

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.220
in economics.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.320
To me, a classic bank
is a soft money back.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.650
Capital, to me, is an
additional feature that gives it

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.070
some credibility, right?

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.270
It means two things.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.920
It means the person
creating the bank

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.390
is going to have some
skin in the game,

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.973
is going to take a loss if the
whole bank collapses, if nobody

00:19:50.973 --> 00:19:52.370
ever pays back their loans.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.530
So that shows-- it's a signal to
show they have some confidence.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.700
Also, the cash they put in, the
capital they put in, in theory

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.602
is going to help people
if the bank fails.

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.310
It'll pay off some
portion of the losses.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.410
In practice, it never does.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.409
In practice, the people
who run the banks always

00:20:08.409 --> 00:20:12.360
get their capital out
before anybody else.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.880
But a lot of the legislation
on banks, a lot of the way

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.250
people think about
banks, is the opposite.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.960
They think about it as a
classic bank is something

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.930
that has 100% capital, and
that fractional reserve

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:28.940
is some kind of like little
extra thing you do to a bank.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.550
But we see, if you look again,
human prehistory cultures,

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.400
you see almost all cultures have
some form of this self credit

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.480
equation, all kinds of things--
susus, tontines, [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.650
All over the world, we
have these kinds of things,

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.240
and they were useful
in the American West.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.729
Well, poker was one of them.

00:20:47.729 --> 00:20:49.770
Poker was a way you could
create a form of money,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.600
your own money.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.230
You could play a game.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.940
If you won, you picked up a lot
of credit from other people,

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.365
and you could use
that to generate

00:20:57.365 --> 00:20:59.005
some economic activity.

00:20:59.005 --> 00:21:01.792
If you lost, other people
had to employ you, right?

00:21:01.792 --> 00:21:03.500
They had to get their
money back somehow.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.599
You didn't have any money.

00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:06.140
They had to find
things for you to do

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.380
to work in their businesses.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.869
And this is how
a lot of business

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.035
was created in the old west.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.680
Now we're going to move a little
forward to around the 1840s.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.490
Anyone know what this is?

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.990
It is the Chicago
Board of Trade.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.960
This is actually around 1900,
so it wouldn't be quite so fancy

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.320
back in 1840.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.290
Futures exchanges,
again, appeared

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:37.750
in exactly the same geographic
area as the game of poker

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.850
about 20 years later.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.530
Nobody invented it.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.116
Suddenly, these things started
popping up all over the place.

00:21:45.116 --> 00:21:46.740
A financial institution
no one had ever

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.000
seen before, completely
unlike anything in the past,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.815
none of them outside the region,
ubiquitous inside the region,

00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:55.190
and nobody said
they invented it.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.390
There was something
in the culture,

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.070
in the way people thought, the
way people did business that

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.670
made this a very
natural thing to do,

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.280
even though it had
never been done before.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.130
And the analogies with poker
are pretty obvious, right?

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.940
Mark-to-market.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.310
Every day, you're betting on the
price of wheat in three months,

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.120
but every day you settle up so
that you got the same amount

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.750
of money at stake.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.730
Clearing-- again, the initial
exchanges in the early days,

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.360
they used ring clearing,
exactly the same as poker.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.340
Later on, they went to
a full clearinghouse

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.760
that was a little
more sophisticated

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.900
and allowed people to do it.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.650
But what's the purpose
of these exchanges?

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.396
What does this futures
exchange do for people?

00:22:36.396 --> 00:22:37.987
AUDIENCE: To lock in the price.

00:22:37.987 --> 00:22:38.820
PROFESSOR: Like who?

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.650
Who would want to
lock in a price?

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.596
AUDIENCE: The farmers.

00:22:40.596 --> 00:22:40.940
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.148
Well, let's think about this.

00:22:42.148 --> 00:22:45.470
I'm a farmer in 1840.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.440
I'm about a two-week journey
from Chicago over bad roads.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.940
Normally, I do what farmers
have done since the beginning

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.440
of private agriculture.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.940
They would sell to a crop buyer.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.940
I would go to the place
where I buy my supplies,

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.440
and there's a crop buyer
who has an agent there,

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.191
or that agent also comes by
my farm every month or so

00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:08.440
to check out how the crops
are going, because he wants

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.570
to keep tabs on the crops.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.020
And also, I can lock
in a price with him.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.037
He will buy exactly my crop.

00:23:15.037 --> 00:23:17.120
He will buy whatever
quantity I happen to produce.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.494
He'll agree on a price now,
or he'll set the price later.

00:23:19.494 --> 00:23:21.090
Whatever I want.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:21.730
I deliver it.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.280
I can deliver it to him, or
for a slightly lower price,

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.184
he'll come and pick
it up at my farm.

00:23:27.184 --> 00:23:28.850
Now let's compare
that with this futures

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.490
exchange, a brand
new innovation that's

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.590
going to make my life better.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.340
I can take a two-week
journey into Chicago.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.820
I can promise to
delivery set quantity

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.720
of a set grade of wheat that
I don't produce that I can't

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.742
be sure I will have on time.

00:23:42.742 --> 00:23:44.700
I don't know the quantity
I'm going to produce,

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.924
but I have to specify that.

00:23:46.924 --> 00:23:48.340
I have to put down
initial margin.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.260
I don't have any cash.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.860
All my cash is
tied up in my crop.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.785
Farmers only have
cash after harvest.

00:23:54.785 --> 00:23:56.410
And I have to stay
in Chicago every day

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.860
to make mark-to-market payments,
since who's growing my wheat?

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.924
OK, so this makes
absolutely no sense.

00:24:01.924 --> 00:24:03.340
Anytime you read
a textbook and it

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.700
talks about farmers
using futures exchanges,

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.887
you know they haven't spent half
a second thinking about this.

00:24:08.887 --> 00:24:10.720
There were no farmers
involved in setting up

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.140
the futures exchanges.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.570
In fact, farmers were
suspicious and have often

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.510
tried to have them shut down.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.880
When farmers do use
futures exchanges,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.190
they almost always
buy the product.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.750
They don't sell it.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.340
So let's talk about what people
really use these things for.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.440
Here is the canonical
trade that you

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.470
can think about, what you want
to understand futures markets.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.820
I'm a processor.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.530
All the people who
set these things up--

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.780
and by the why, all the
people who set these things up

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.930
were poker players.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:40.724
I'm not kidding.

00:24:40.724 --> 00:24:42.140
Look it up, you
find the name, you

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.848
find all these people
were poker players.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.047
I grind wheat, OK?

00:24:49.047 --> 00:24:50.630
I'm not going to use
this for hedging.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.350
I can't use it for
hedging, right?

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.660
I buy wheat, that's true.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.230
But is my exposure to
wheat going up in price

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.830
or going down in price?

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.017
One going up.

00:25:02.017 --> 00:25:03.350
OK, let me tell you two stories.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.317
Story number one,
there's a sudden increase

00:25:06.317 --> 00:25:07.150
in demand for wheat.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.380
There's a big war in
Europe, other crops

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.780
fail in other regions.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.769
The price of wheat goes way up.

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:14.935
What happens to my business?

00:25:18.107 --> 00:25:19.440
I'm making lots of money, right?

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.780
They've got to
grind lots of wheat.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.260
They're bringing all the wheat
in from all the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.580
Everybody grinds it, there's a
shortage of grinding capacity,

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.450
I can raise my prices.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:25.950
I'm rich.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.540
So it that way, I'm
long wheat, right?

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.220
Price of wheat goes up,
my business goes up.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.230
Let's say-- sorry?

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.140
AUDIENCE: So you're
assuming that the price

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.260
of grounded wheat is directly
correlated to the price

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:37.760
of wheat?

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.460
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.530
I'm saying the price of
ground wheat is what went up.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.810
And because the price
of ground wheat went up,

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.450
my business is more valuable.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.960
And you're exactly-- you
hit the point exactly,

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.580
if that's the stuff I'm selling.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.240
Now let's do a different story.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.184
There's a crop
failure in the area.

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:54.600
Price of wheat
goes way up, right?

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.060
Wheat is scarce.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.460
Who wants my
grinding facilities?

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.020
Nobody.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.728
There's an excess of
grinding facilities.

00:25:59.728 --> 00:26:01.220
I can't charge a penny.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.160
OK, so I have no
natural wheat exposure.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.380
I can't hedge my wheat exposure
in this futures market.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.620
Also, for the same reasons
I mentioned of a farmer,

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.630
it's not a convenient
place to do it.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.660
It's a type and grade
of wheat I don't

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.370
want at a place I don't want.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.620
Also, the price of
wheat has very little

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.740
do with my business.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.795
What I care about is my
machinery operating properly,

00:26:25.795 --> 00:26:28.170
what's the price of fuel,
what's the price of labor, what

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.836
are the regulations
on the stuff, what's

00:26:29.836 --> 00:26:31.800
the equality of the
stuff I'm getting.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.440
I can lock in prices with
suppliers and either buyers

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.100
or the flour or sellers of
the wheat anytime I want.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.820
That's not the point
of the futures market.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.435
What you want to think
about is I'm growing wheat.

00:26:44.435 --> 00:26:46.240
I'm going to go to a
silo, a grain silo.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.870
A grain silo is a guy, he buys
wheat from all over the place

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.024
and he sells it
to people like me.

00:26:51.024 --> 00:26:52.690
I'm going to say, OK,
I want these wheat

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.360
deliveries over the
next three months,

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.250
so much and so on
these various times.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.980
I want it delivered to
my grinding facility.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.660
I want exactly this
type and kind of wheat.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.810
And he'll agree, and
we'll settle a deal.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.060
Now I'm going to go to
the futures exchange.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.390
I've just bought a
quarter's worth of wheat

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.484
from the wheat silo.

00:27:16.484 --> 00:27:18.150
I'm going to go to
the futures exchange,

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.280
I'm going to sell a quarter's
worth of wheat forward.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.840
What have I done?

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.550
Well, now I have no
price risk, right?

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.560
Now if the price of
wheat goes up or down,

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.461
I don't care, because
I bought we today,

00:27:30.461 --> 00:27:31.960
and I sold it three
months from now.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.672
I have borrowed wheat.

00:27:34.672 --> 00:27:35.880
Now, what could I do instead?

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.760
I could borrow money.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.160
I could borrow money
and buy the wheat.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.050
But then I take
two price risks--

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.559
I take the price risk of
the money, and remember,

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:45.850
this is an area where there's
very little money around.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.070
These futures
exchanges were invented

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.361
in a place where there was
very little gold and silver.

00:27:49.361 --> 00:27:51.570
There wasn't a good
banking system.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.830
Bank notes weren't
very trustworthy.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.570
So taking the risk of
money was a big risk.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.719
And also, price of
wheat going up and down.

00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:00.510
The simplest thing is
just to borrow wheat,

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.490
which is what I want to do.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.140
And like any business loan,
I never intend to repay this.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.850
If I'm doing a business
loan, say to buy machinery,

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.800
I make the loan.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.127
And when the loan comes
due, I borrow again

00:28:13.127 --> 00:28:13.960
to run the business.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.660
The only time I pay
back my business loans

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.035
is when I shut down the business
and liquidate everything

00:28:18.035 --> 00:28:19.585
and pay off the creditors.

00:28:19.585 --> 00:28:20.460
Same thing with this.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.900
I'm going to roll these futures
contracts forward forever.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.100
I'm never going
to take delivery.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.930
But what I've done is I've
perpetually borrowed wheat.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.770
I've taken part of
my business input

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.130
and I borrowed it
instead of buying it.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.160
So one thing is the
futures exchanges create

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.454
a tremendous amount of credit.

00:28:40.454 --> 00:28:42.870
But they do something else too
that's kind of interesting.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.370
Anybody here know how to
take flour and turn it back

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:45.885
into wheat?

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.360
Anybody here know how
to take August wheat

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.010
and move it back in time to May?

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.000
All right, I have something
very surprising to tell you.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.570
For 175 years, the
Chicago Board of Trade

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:05.030
here has been quoting prices
on both of those services.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.150
A futures exchange quotes
prices on services nobody's

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.400
ever thought of.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.120
It opens tremendous
scope for innovation.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.834
Let's say I want
to build a bridge.

00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:17.250
And when I build
this bridge, it's

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.839
going to divert wheat that
was going to Saint Louis.

00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:22.130
It's going to get diverted
to Chicago, because now it's

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.600
going to be cheaper to
move it into Chicago.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.360
I can hedge that.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.120
I can sell those transportation
services on the futures market

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.920
by buying Chicago wheat and
selling Saint Louis wheat.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.910
I can do calendar spreads.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.170
I can do grade spreads, cleaning
spreads, all of these things

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:44.020
are a way of buying and selling
all the services involved

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:50.370
in an agricultural
processing business.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.460
And this turns out to be
a far more efficient way

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.300
to organize things.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.190
It's got its internally
generated credit.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.390
It's got far better
information flows.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:02.699
And this is what touches
off a tremendous explosion

00:30:02.699 --> 00:30:04.740
of business activity and
business innovation that

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.470
goes throughout the world.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.210
Now, one of the things that's
kind of strange about futures

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.817
markets is they were only used
for agricultural commodities.

00:30:12.817 --> 00:30:15.150
Now, granted, that was a much
bigger part of the economy

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.560
than it is today, but
in the global economy,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.300
this was not a big deal.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.550
There were much, much more
valuable commodities that never

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.250
went to futures exchanges.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.300
And there were things--
commodities weren't even

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.640
the most valuable things.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.060
When things really took
off is in the 1970s

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.970
when people took the same idea
and moved it to financial.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:43.394
But my story is about poker.

00:30:43.394 --> 00:30:44.810
One of the things
people sometimes

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.410
say is that futures evolved
from to arrive contracts.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.110
Now, to arrive contracts
have been around longer

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.750
than we have written records.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.970
In ancient Mesopotamia
in the early days,

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.340
we see in the earliest writings
that we can still read today,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.140
we find that these to arrive
contracts were common.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.110
A to arrive contract
says, essentially,

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:11.010
I will sell you 10,000 bushels
of wheat at $0.50 a bushel

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.520
as soon as wheat
comes to the market,

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.450
wheat come to the city market.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.660
OK, it's a price guarantee.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.910
It's not a delivery guarantee.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.610
I don't tell you when
you're going to get it.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.880
I don't even guarantee
you will get it.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.379
I'm just saying,
when it comes, this

00:31:23.379 --> 00:31:25.630
is what I will sell it you at.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.320
The largest to arrive
market in the United States

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.980
was in Buffalo.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.140
OK, everybody remember all
those stories about the fortunes

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.260
won and lost on the
Buffalo to arrive

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.967
exchange, the
fistfights, the corners?

00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:44.050
We had people who made
their fortunes there, never

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.424
went on do anything else?

00:31:45.424 --> 00:31:45.923
Exactly.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:53.040
To arrive contracts are run
by quiet commission clerks.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.530
Futures exchanges are populated
by tough, brawling innovators

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.140
who often make fortunes
or lose fortunes and go on

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.540
to do dramatic
business activity.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.530
There's no connection
between the two.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.642
Now, can anybody tell me which
ones of these are poker games?

00:32:08.642 --> 00:32:09.557
AUDIENCE: Omaha.

00:32:09.557 --> 00:32:10.265
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:32:10.265 --> 00:32:10.960
AUDIENCE: Omaha.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.910
PROFESSOR: Omaha, Texas.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:12.250
Yep.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.010
AUDIENCE: Chicago.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.567
PROFESSOR: Chicago, yes.

00:32:14.567 --> 00:32:16.650
This one you guys might
not have heard of so much,

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:17.733
but there is a Cincinnati.

00:32:17.733 --> 00:32:20.670
It isn't played much anymore.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.130
There is no poker
game called Buffalo.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:27.760
There is no poker game named
after any place except places

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.910
where, if you lose all
your money in the game,

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.170
drown your servers by
jumping in a river,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.420
you float down to New Orleans.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:43.325
Even today, poker is very,
very strongly regionally-- it's

00:32:43.325 --> 00:32:44.820
a regional attitude.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.340
It's an extraordinarily
explosive innovative

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:52.280
economic attitude, and it
has never really seeped out

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.750
except the place it was born.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.600
Now, that may no longer be
true with internet poker.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.050
The question is, is the
soul of poker alive?

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.070
Internet poker has this economic
innovation and freedom and self

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.757
credit creation.

00:33:05.757 --> 00:33:08.340
Is this something's that's going
to spread to the whole world,

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.350
or has somehow poker
been neutralized

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.020
and, when it comes to a
computer and becomes virtual,

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.515
it's no longer got that soul?

00:33:14.515 --> 00:33:18.540
It's something we're going to
find out in the next few years.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.130
Now we're going to
jump forward to me.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.810
I was born in the 1950s.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.111
I was raised in Seattle.

00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:28.610
And one thing you
have to understand

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.150
is two people can be raised in
exactly the same time, exactly

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.650
the same environment, and have
totally different ideas of what

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.510
it was like.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.890
I think most people
would say, if a movie was

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.640
made of my childhood,
they would say, hey,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.080
that was an idyllic childhood.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.467
Your dad was a professor.

00:33:44.467 --> 00:33:46.050
You didn't have so
much money that you

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:49.675
had affluenza and were wrecking
cars or things like that.

00:33:49.675 --> 00:33:51.701
But you were never
embarrassed that you

00:33:51.701 --> 00:33:53.950
didn't have clothes for
school, you were never hungry,

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.430
anything like that.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.350
You were treated well.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.630
It was a suburban neighborhood.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:58.546
It was a pretty place.

00:33:58.546 --> 00:34:00.690
You had lots of stimulation,
all of that stuff.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.780
But I hated it.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.020
I was oppressed
by lots of things.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.895
I believed, I
sincerely believed,

00:34:08.895 --> 00:34:10.880
that the world was going
to end in nuclear war

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.480
before I was in college.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.428
It just seemed like it
clearly was likely to happen.

00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:16.969
I was interested in
math and science,

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:20.050
but all the math and
science was defense related.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.150
Only big government
projects to kill

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:26.860
people were the only way you
could get funding for things.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:32.070
More than half the world was in
the grip of brutal totalitarian

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:36.370
dictatorships, and no country
had ever emerged from communism

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.618
to freedom and prosperity.

00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:42.590
It seemed like the entire,
world even the free world, even

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.460
the relative democracies,
were run by paranoids

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.760
and total incompetents.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.170
The economy was terrible.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.659
Seattle was a few years ahead
of the rest of the country

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:55.090
and we had sort of slipped
into that '70s malaise

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.889
back in the '60s.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.420
A friend of the family who
was an aerospace engineer who

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.190
was the world expert--
in fact, he went to MIT.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.460
He was the world expert in
materials for supersonic wing

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.630
design.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.310
He was fired because
nobody wanted

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:10.890
to build supersonic planes,
and he was driving a cab.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:13.327
Another thing about this
is this is, again, Seattle

00:35:13.327 --> 00:35:15.410
was kind of forward looking
in terms of economics.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.167
We were getting economic malaise
before the rest of the country.

00:35:18.167 --> 00:35:20.000
In another way, we were
kind of a throwback.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.230
It was more like the '50s than
other parts of the country.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.809
And it was this really
weird social dynamic.

00:35:27.809 --> 00:35:30.100
OK, I don't want to tell you
the neighborhood I grew up

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.380
in was any worse or weirder
than any other neighborhood.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.020
But there was a certain
percentage of alcoholics,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.476
or child molesters,
of wife beaters,

00:35:39.476 --> 00:35:42.030
of drug addicts, all the stuff.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:47.004
And in the '50s and in Seattle
by the time I was growing up,

00:35:47.004 --> 00:35:47.920
nobody cared about it.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.210
Nobody would ever talk
about any of that stuff.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:54.540
If a man cut his grass and
brought home a paycheck,

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.460
he was a good guy.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.280
He could do anything else and
nobody would talk about it.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.414
But if you didn't--
and we would have this.

00:36:01.414 --> 00:36:02.080
It would happen.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.926
Like a neighbor, the
guy would lose this job.

00:36:04.926 --> 00:36:07.050
They would quietly move
away, and nobody would ever

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.860
talk about them.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.420
It was just weird.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.450
And you got the message, OK,
the economy was very insecure.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.616
If you could earn money,
everything was fine.

00:36:16.616 --> 00:36:18.490
You didn't have to worry
about anything else.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:23.020
But if you couldn't earn
money, it was unspeakably bad.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.340
Well, I was a shy kid.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.750
I was introverted, awkward.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.509
But I liked looking in the back
of a newspaper at the numbers.

00:36:31.509 --> 00:36:33.550
The patterns in the numbers
really fascinated me.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:37.285
And I worked out ways, and
I would bet money on horses,

00:36:37.285 --> 00:36:39.435
I would bet money
on other sports.

00:36:39.435 --> 00:36:42.051
And I found out I
could win doing this.

00:36:42.051 --> 00:36:44.550
I also found out-- and this was
true throughout the American

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.600
West at the time.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.590
I couldn't really find
a good picture of this.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.798
This is just something I
found on the internet that's

00:36:49.798 --> 00:36:51.420
roughly equivalent.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.150
Taverns, in the back
room of the taverns

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.400
or the basement of the taverns,
there were these poker games.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:01.360
And I'd go in and I'd
play, and I'd win.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.510
And more important than that
I would win, I could walk in.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.980
I could collect the money.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:14.000
I could walk out, and this was
enormously liberating to me.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.180
It said to me, OK.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.420
You don't have to get a job.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.540
You don't have to go to college.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.090
Anywhere you go in the world,
you can find a poker game.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.690
You can win money.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.204
And when you're a good
player and people know it,

00:37:25.204 --> 00:37:27.370
even if you run out of
money, people lend you money.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.882
People stake you.

00:37:29.882 --> 00:37:32.329
You also start getting
into this network.

00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:34.370
And this was something I
had not expected at all.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:35.390
I had gone there, I thought, OK.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.889
I'm going to win
some money, and I'm

00:37:36.889 --> 00:37:39.790
going to prove that I can
get this monkey off my back

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.400
and I don't have to
worry about this anymore.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.240
These people-- the
people I was playing with

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:44.760
didn't look like this.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.770
One or two of them might
have looked like this.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.770
But there were policemen,
there were sailors,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:49.580
there were clerks.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:50.760
You know, people.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.861
And they end up owing you money.

00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:54.610
Right, if you're good
player, these people

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:56.580
end up owing you money.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.190
And I later kind of
figured, I sort of

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:00.150
had a half idea of what
was going on at the time.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.066
But I've later figured
it out a little better,

00:38:02.066 --> 00:38:04.730
and later in life as
I've played more places,

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:09.050
I've figured out the
system a little better.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.340
I had a purpose
for these people.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.660
I had two purposes.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.997
One is because I was a good
player I protected their game.

00:38:17.997 --> 00:38:20.080
Let's say somebody showed
up, a really good player

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.480
wanted to take all
their money, show up

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.300
and-- well, they had
somebody there who was good.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.591
And by the way, being a good
poker player in those days

00:38:25.591 --> 00:38:27.890
didn't just mean good card play.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:32.840
In fact, it would be trivially--
and I'm sure anybody here

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.020
what have no trouble cleaning
up in terms of pure card play

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.580
in this game.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.570
But you had to be
able to spot cheating.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:43.197
You had to be able to figure
out who might risk of arrest.

00:38:43.197 --> 00:38:45.030
You had to figure out
who might get violent.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:48.120
I mean, there's a lot of
social skills involved in this.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.670
So by being a good player,
you protected the game,

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.340
but you also connected
them with a bigger network.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.675
So remember, a lot of this
is about credit equation.

00:38:57.675 --> 00:39:00.700
A tremendous amount of
economic activity goes on here.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.560
There's doctors, lawyers,
police, mechanics,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.660
whatever-- people exchanging
services, underground economy,

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.380
people who couldn't make
it in the normal economy.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.920
Like let's say you're a lawyer,
and you're a really bad lawyer.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.300
And you can't get any business.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.630
You hang [? out a shingle, ?]
nobody's going to hire you.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:22.796
Your resume isn't very good.

00:39:22.796 --> 00:39:24.290
There's too many lawyers around.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.956
But you know, you owe
somebody money at a poker game

00:39:27.956 --> 00:39:30.330
and they want you to write a
letter and do some for them,

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.840
whenever, you can do a little
legal business on this stuff.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.180
And by connecting into the
broader network in the city,

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.150
you connect these people in.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:43.260
Some of these people had really
dropped out of normal life,

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.686
or they weren't
getting paychecks.

00:39:45.686 --> 00:39:48.060
They were subsisting entirely
on the underground economy.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.143
And this was a very important
organizational tool.

00:39:50.143 --> 00:39:51.620
Other people like
to keep one foot

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.630
in that world-- maybe a
little side income, maybe

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:55.380
a little fallback.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.170
We weren't doing like
big organized crime,

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.980
but there'd be a
sailor in the game who

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.884
could bring in Cuban cigars.

00:40:03.884 --> 00:40:05.550
There was a guy who
was maybe a bathroom

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.990
attendant at a fancy
restaurant who could sell them,

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:12.570
and this kind of stuff could get
organized in a game like this.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:15.970
The poker was very important
because you actually

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.910
spend a lot of time
with these people.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.540
You learned a lot about them.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.880
You couldn't fake it in a way.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.807
An undercover cop could
show up for two days

00:40:24.807 --> 00:40:26.390
or act something
this, but they aren't

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:30.130
going to be playing poker
every day for years.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:35.900
So I'm kind of moving up in
the Seattle poker network,

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.070
and I come to Boston.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.330
I went to Harvard.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.700
And again, remember, I'm shy.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.520
I'm awkward.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:48.460
I'm from the west, a little
overwhelmed by all this stuff.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.580
But I walked in with a network.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.170
It shocked me when I got
here that this network was

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:59.210
seamlessly translated across
the country, that I knew police,

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:05.410
I knew poker people of all
different ranks and stations

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.390
of life.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.750
I got into poker games
at Harvard itself.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.495
People talk about going to
college to get contacts.

00:41:13.495 --> 00:41:14.620
Let me tell you about that.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.600
I had three roommates.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.220
I love my roommates.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.010
These are great guys.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.680
I'm not saying anything
bad about them.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.170
But in terms of like useful
contacts for me in life,

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.420
well, one of them's a
corporate lawyer, one of them's

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.620
a TV producer, one of
them's a law professor--

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.060
all great things, that's nice.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.000
Never really a lot
of use to me in terms

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.580
of advancing my business
interests or whatever,

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.611
and not exactly hard things
to break into, right?

00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:39.110
You want to know a
corporate lawyer?

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.970
Well, it's pretty easy to
know a corporate lawyer.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.344
Poker games at Harvard, I
played with George W. Bush,

00:41:46.344 --> 00:41:47.510
who went on to be president.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:51.710
I played with Bill Gates,
Steve Ballmer, Scott Turow,

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.987
people who are celebrities,
politicians, rich people.

00:41:55.987 --> 00:41:57.320
Those are the poker connections.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.550
And a poker connection
is very different.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.660
You're not playing
poker with your friends.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.640
A poker connection is,
there is a business

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.484
relationship in there that
can be extremely useful.

00:42:06.484 --> 00:42:08.150
My whole life, my
whole career, has been

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.460
informed by poker networks.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.450
Now I'm going to zip
through a few things.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:19.250
I'm playing in Boston,
a guy shows up.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.220
He actually managed a card
room near Stanford University.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.040
He was, again, it's
this network thing.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.720
So I'm playing now in a
pretty senior game in Boston,

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.220
some the best card
players in Boston

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.640
are here, pretty high stakes.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.350
And they invite visiting pros
from other parts of the country

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.800
to keep the network connected
throughout the country.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.310
And this guy said to me,
he said, well, I was good.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:46.770
I played well that night.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:47.790
But it wasn't just that.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.320
He said, you know, you're
a kind of strange guy.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.890
You've got this sort of
mathematical poker sense.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.460
You think about it in
theoretical terms, whatever.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.130
There are a lot of guys like
you out in Gardena, California.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:02.040
So that's where the best poker
in the world is being played.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.610
He said, I'm a good player.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.320
I'm a national pro.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.580
I go around from city to
city sitting in end games

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.996
with the best
players in the city.

00:43:08.996 --> 00:43:12.890
And I win in those games, but I
can't turn a profit in Gardena.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.720
You should go the Gardena and
see if you can match yourself

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.480
up with the best.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.730
So I go there.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.520
How many people have heard
of Gardena, California?

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.400
Yeah.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.290
If you're interested, there's
a movie called California Split

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:27.560
that's got some good scenes.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.510
It's stupid poker movie
for the most part,

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.380
but it has some actual scenes
shot in Gardena at that time.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.910
That was the best
poker in the world.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:41.090
And it was the network theory
I was talking about on steroids

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.570
because of a few things.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.969
First of all, this
is in the late '70s.

00:43:44.969 --> 00:43:46.760
Marginal tax rates have
gotten really high,

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.820
regulation has gotten
crazy, the tax code

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.320
is incredibly
complicated and corrupt.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.840
Community property, big
thing-- a lot of these guys

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.007
were wiped out in a divorce.

00:43:55.007 --> 00:43:56.506
I mean, that was
something that just

00:43:56.506 --> 00:43:58.220
didn't happen 10 years earlier.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.792
A lot of them had tax liens.

00:43:59.792 --> 00:44:02.250
So you have this whole group
of people, they tend be-- they

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:04.860
were much better
educated than the guys

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:09.210
I was playing with in Seattle or
even really the guys in Boston.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:10.570
They were smart.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:13.594
Not only were they broke,
they were financially toxic.

00:44:13.594 --> 00:44:15.260
Any money they put
in a bank was getting

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.800
whisked away by somebody.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.500
If they were walking down the
street with $1 in their pocket,

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.170
somebody could grab it.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:24.060
Poker chip, not so much, right?

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.540
Poker debt, they lent some money
to somebody in the poker room,

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.530
nobody could collect that.

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:34.400
Tremendous about of very active
underground economy going on.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.850
I go there, and first day I'm
there, guy comes up to me.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.310
He manages a motel.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.907
He used to own
it, went bankrupt.

00:44:40.907 --> 00:44:42.365
Now the bank pays
him to manage it.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:48.744
If you're a poker player, he'll
give you a room to stay in.

00:44:48.744 --> 00:44:49.410
You have to pay.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:50.990
You slip him a
little bit of money,

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.792
much less than
the rent would be.

00:44:52.792 --> 00:44:55.250
It's kind of furnished with
broken down stuff other tenants

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.780
have left.

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.160
But poker players
don't care, right?

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.260
Poker players are
there, they go,

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.620
they sleep on the broken
couch, and then they leave.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.180
Maybe take a shower if
it's the first of the month

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.920
or something.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.860
And you'd stay there for
three or four months,

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.820
and eventually the owners
would kick you out.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.540
And he'd just say, oh, well,
the guy never paid any rent,

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.559
and he would cover all
this for you and do it.

00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:18.850
And then you just move to
the next motel down the line,

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:20.505
and he moves somebody else in.

00:45:20.505 --> 00:45:21.880
You wanted to get
your car fixed,

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.250
you wanted to get
a lawsuit filed,

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:28.260
you wanted to get
your operation done,

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.820
whatever, there were people
in the room to do it,

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.070
all for under the table,
you could borrow the money.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:37.560
And all of the people who can
invented the modern poker,

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.210
if you talk about the David
Sklansky's, Mason Malmuth, Mike

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:40.710
Harrow.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.600
I don't know if these
names mean anything to you,

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.900
but these were the first people
who actually sat down and wrote

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:45.795
poker theory books.

00:45:45.795 --> 00:45:47.940
This was the only place
where people were really

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.970
thinking about it.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.100
Las Vegas, they hated poker.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.930
Casinos hate poker.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:55.490
The reason casinos hated poker
is somebody in the building

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.724
was losing money and the
Casino wasn't getting it.

00:45:58.724 --> 00:46:01.140
And they would stick it-- they
either wouldn't have poker,

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.080
or they'd stick it next to
the layout of slot machines

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:03.970
under the stairs.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.140
They'd open and close the
room at random intervals.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.348
The one thing they did was
the World Series of Poker.

00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:09.950
It was a pure Casino
publicity stunt.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.580
It had nothing to do
with poker in those days.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.290
Only in like the late
'90s, early 2000s

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.790
with lots of people
being brought in

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.120
by internet, with
the poker boom,

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.040
with television did casinos
really come to terms with it

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.940
and start liking poker.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.130
But Gardena was pure
poker, and that's

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:31.060
where the good stuff was done.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:34.650
Now, I'm making my
living by poker.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:40.730
But I have broader interests.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.150
I'm thinking-- I was really,
when I came to Boston for four

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:49.970
years, I was shocked at
how shoddy I felt that most

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.160
quantitative analysis was.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.624
I thought, people
are doing this work.

00:46:53.624 --> 00:46:54.790
They're teaching this stuff.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:55.840
They're advising the government.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.840
They're running the government.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.673
They're writing these
papers, this and that.

00:46:58.673 --> 00:47:01.230
They have terrible data.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.670
They have really
stupid analysis.

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:05.030
And the biggest thing, the
way I kind of encapsulated

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:06.820
all of this is, none
of them would bet

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:09.780
a nickel on their own results.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.570
Every single one of them,
if they were buying a car,

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:15.320
they would spend a lot more
serious commonsense analysis

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.790
to get the right car
than they do recommending

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:21.260
a plan for the government to
take over the steel industry,

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.240
or something like that.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.360
And a lot of other
people felt the same way.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.260
And we had both
some philosophical

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.280
and some empirical
ideas that we were

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.050
sold on the idea of
quantitative analysis.

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:38.962
We were confident in our
ability to make bets and win.

00:47:38.962 --> 00:47:41.170
One of the things about
hanging around with gamblers,

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:42.086
there's a lot of bets.

00:47:42.086 --> 00:47:45.400
Gamblers are really
nasty people,

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.470
a lot of really bad stuff.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.970
One of the flip
sides of that is you

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:52.950
don't have to be nice, which
takes a lot of pressure off.

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:58.470
But they do take things
seriously, right?

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:03.050
Anything you say, somebody
can say, put some money on it.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:07.740
If you won't, you're just
an idiot loser chattering.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.105
You'd start really thinking
about things if you actually

00:48:10.105 --> 00:48:13.900
have to bet money on
anything, any opinion you get.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.000
A lot of silly
chattering conversation

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.230
never happens if people have
to bet on everything they say.

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:24.584
Anyway though, the natural
thing to do is to say,

00:48:24.584 --> 00:48:25.750
OK, I want to go to a place.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.654
I want to prove that
my methods work.

00:48:28.654 --> 00:48:30.570
And the way I'm going
to prove my methods work

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.611
is I'm going to go to
places where people gamble,

00:48:32.611 --> 00:48:34.742
and I'm going to
prove that I can win.

00:48:34.742 --> 00:48:37.415
Now, all of us had read Ed
Thorpe's Beat the Dealer.

00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:39.876
Do people here know Ed Thorpe?

00:48:39.876 --> 00:48:40.500
OK, you should.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.877
You should read his books.

00:48:41.877 --> 00:48:42.710
You should meet him.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:44.700
He's still alive.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.280
He was a mathematics professor.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.870
He invented blackjack
card counting.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:52.350
He managed to beat virtually
every other Casino game.

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:56.972
And he's also either invented
or perfected almost all

00:48:56.972 --> 00:48:58.680
of the quantitative
hedge fund strategies

00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.690
that people use today.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.910
He was one of the most
successful hedge fund managers

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:05.110
for many years.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:09.279
So one thing we did is we wanted
to go and beat casino games.

00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:10.820
And then what I'd
like to talk about,

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.653
I'm just going to mention
this very briefly.

00:49:12.653 --> 00:49:15.874
But roulette, to
me, was the one that

00:49:15.874 --> 00:49:18.040
really changed the way I
think about a lot of stuff.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.600
It's a very, very
important lesson

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.360
for people who have academic
statistics backgrounds.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.140
How do you beat roulette?

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.550
OK, well this Ed Thorpe's.

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.510
Ed Thorpe was
thinking about this.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.950
And he was hearing this
debate, and some people said,

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:34.640
you should [INAUDIBLE]
You should just

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.140
record the patterns
of the wheels

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.830
and see if you can notice
patterns, like the wheel's

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.480
a little weighted,
what number comes up

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.890
a little more than the others.

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:43.500
But other people said
no, that's impossible.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.340
The wheels are too good.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.060
And Ed had a really remarkable
insight that not enough people

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:48.700
know about.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.980
He said, you can win
money either way.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.500
If the wheel's broken and
13 comes up a little more

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.280
than it should,
you can bet on 13.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.890
That's easy.

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:02.130
But if the wheel is so perfect
that every number comes

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:04.764
up equally often, it must
be machined to perfection,

00:50:04.764 --> 00:50:06.180
then you can use
a little physics.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.610
We had some mechanics up on
the board when I came here.

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:13.230
Use Newtonian physics, and
you can figure out where

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.920
the ball is going to end up.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.130
So it's a lot of work.

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.390
He did it with Claude Shannon.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:22.315
Again, we're back to
MIT, one of the fathers

00:50:22.315 --> 00:50:23.900
of information theory.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.540
And they sat down, and
they worked on roulette.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.510
And if you study this
problem for a bit,

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:33.020
you pretty quickly find
out, here's how things work.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.570
The way roulette works, they
spin a wheel in one direction,

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.290
and they spin a ball
around the outside

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:39.420
of a bowl the other way.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:45.440
OK, everything is very Newtonian
until the ball goes away

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.610
from the edge.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.557
It is very easy with a little
bit of electronic aids--

00:50:49.557 --> 00:50:51.640
which at the time were
legal, and are now illegal.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.130
But with electronic
aids, it's very easy

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.350
to tell what number
will be under the ball

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:01.040
when the ball leaves the edge.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.220
Now, there's a lot of
bouncing and banging

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.610
around between that and
when the ball comes to rest.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.480
And that's pretty
chaotic, essentially

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.700
impossible to predict.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.550
So you have this perfectly
predictable section,

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.940
and then you have
this chaotic section.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.740
But here's the insight.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.050
The predictable section,
you can calculate.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:21.800
You can know, OK.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.591
You say, when the ball
goes under the edge,

00:51:23.591 --> 00:51:26.340
number 17 will be
directly underneath it.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:30.224
The chaotic part cannot
be uniform on the wheel.

00:51:30.224 --> 00:51:33.560
You can say, if 17 is under
it when the ball comes down,

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.132
here is the
distribution of places

00:51:35.132 --> 00:51:36.840
the ball is going to
end up on the wheel,

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.250
and it's nowhere near
random, nowhere near uniform.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.290
So you can make good bets.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.279
Now if you actually
want to do this,

00:51:44.279 --> 00:51:45.570
you have to get several layers.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:49.400
You have to keep
refining this notion.

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.190
But I just want to focus
on the big picture.

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:55.820
A lot of statistical theory,
the basic theory of statistics,

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.130
was based on dice.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:00.620
That's what Nassim Taleb calls
the ludic fallacy-- people

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.160
trying to create randomness.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.020
The real world is
nowhere near so random.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.860
Even when people try to create
randomness, even in a Casino,

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.930
they can't do it.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:16.620
And the reason they can't do it
is if you build things really,

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.600
really precisely,
they're predictable.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.470
If you build things kind
of loose and sloppy,

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:25.690
they have non-uniform patterns.

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:28.960
What you can't do is build
a device that's both.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.680
It exceeds human capabilities.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.480
And when we're talking about
the practical randomness

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:39.720
you see in the world-- in the
stock market, in politics,

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.840
and in war, anything you
want to talk about-- people

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.070
are way too sloppy in
modeling things as random.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.800
Whenever somebody says
this thing is random,

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.950
you say, I'm going
to take a hard block.

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:53.420
And I'm going to find little
pockets of predictability

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.270
that I can calculate.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.370
And in between those
pockets of predictability,

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:01.101
I'm going to find patterns
that are non-uniform.

00:53:01.101 --> 00:53:02.600
And what I'm going
to end up with is

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.016
I'm going to end up with a
system where people are saying,

00:53:05.016 --> 00:53:08.224
you know, you're obsessing
about data and data quality

00:53:08.224 --> 00:53:10.140
for things that don't
really matter very much.

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.223
Nobody else thinks these
statistics are important.

00:53:12.223 --> 00:53:14.220
Why are you spending
all your time

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.650
cleaning data for
something that's

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.440
far removed from the essential
economics of this problem?

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.260
And they're also going
to say, and here are

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:22.990
the really important things.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:24.670
And you're just
waving your hands.

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:25.836
You're not paying attention.

00:53:25.836 --> 00:53:28.610
You're making criminally
reckless or crude assumptions

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:30.196
about those things.

00:53:30.196 --> 00:53:31.570
But what they
don't understand is

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:34.180
that's exactly how you beat it.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.470
That is what you do.

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:37.720
When you figure this stuff
out, you really come up

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:42.390
with this thing that will
understand and make a profit,

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.340
it will look like
that to outsiders,

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.340
that you're focused on
stuff that doesn't matter

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.510
and you're ignoring the
stuff that does matter.

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:50.310
Put another way,
the stuff you think

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.710
that matters doesn't,
and the stuff you

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:54.160
don't think that matters does.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.243
And when you do enough
work on this kind of stuff,

00:53:56.243 --> 00:53:58.550
that's how you win.

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:00.520
Now, the thing
about the people who

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:04.320
did blackjack card counting and
roulette and baccarat and craps

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.600
worked on all those
other games, what

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:13.200
happens when people find out
that's what they're doing?

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it depends
on the time and the place,

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:19.440
whether you're buried in the
desert or just warned off

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:19.940
or whatever.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:24.150
But basically, you have
to fool the casino.

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.670
You're taking money
from the Casino.

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:30.230
The people who stuck with
this hate casinos a lot more

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:32.370
than they like money.

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.900
They tend to be
antisocial people.

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:37.432
You don't need any
social skills, right?

00:54:37.432 --> 00:54:38.890
All you need is--
I mean, if you've

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:41.310
seen some of the movies, the
MIT blackjack team, Bring

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:43.710
Down the House,
whatever, you see

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:46.464
some wildly over the top
play acting to get things.

00:54:46.464 --> 00:54:48.130
That isn't what most
of these guys were.

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.460
Most of these guys were quiet.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.770
They went in, the
casino gets a game.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:53.640
The casino takes care of stuff.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.440
You just go in and play, but you
have to stay under the radar.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.802
You can't let the casino notice.

00:54:58.802 --> 00:55:02.050
Now, people also looked at
another field, sports betting.

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:04.910
Now, sports betting, this
is frequent of stuff.

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:07.240
This is Bayesian stuff.

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:12.080
It is a lot easier
to predict how

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.680
people are going to bet than
how a game is going to come out.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:19.530
If you wanted to predictive
a game from first principles

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:21.550
and figure out what the
proper point spread was,

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.070
well, you've got a
big job ahead of you.

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:23.490
It can be done.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.698
People have done it and made
some successful results,

00:55:25.698 --> 00:55:27.140
but that's a big job.

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.470
Here's an easy observation
that was enough.

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:32.730
In the 1970s, this was
enough to make money.

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:35.360
Los Angeles Lakers
are a glamorous team.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.320
They were at the time.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.709
Los Angeles is a
big betting city.

00:55:39.709 --> 00:55:41.250
When the Lakers play
at home, there's

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:43.860
a lot of money coming
in and betting on them.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:46.580
The point spread is going
to be too favorable.

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:49.079
Bet against the
Lakers at home, right?

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:50.870
Don't need a genius,
don't need a math PhD,

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.640
don't need a computer.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.900
You can just figure this out.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.960
And patterns like this
are very easy to catch,

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.160
but they're based on
understanding people.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.320
So the malcontents,
the introverts,

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.810
the autistic people,
they all went here.

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:06.022
The people who like people
went into sports betting.

00:56:06.022 --> 00:56:07.730
Now what happens if
you're sports betting

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:08.646
and you're successful?

00:56:08.646 --> 00:56:10.080
What happens?

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.140
Well certainly in those
days, they hire you.

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:15.407
Right?

00:56:15.407 --> 00:56:15.990
They want you.

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:17.720
Great, hey, you're winning?

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.150
We want to take
advantage of that.

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:20.170
We'll pay you a salary.

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:20.861
You bet for us.

00:56:20.861 --> 00:56:22.860
And then the way they
would pay you, by the way,

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.680
is they would let
you make bigger bets.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.520
And so you become part
of the organization.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.160
And pretty soon, you're running
your own bookmaking operation

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:33.660
and so on.

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:35.560
So these are social people.

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.060
These are Bayesian people.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.770
These people are
betting on frequencies.

00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:41.340
These people are
betting on people.

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.366
Both of them are learning
skills and techniques

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:44.990
that nobody taught
in a classroom, that

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:49.550
were totally generations ahead
of what statisticians were

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:52.030
doing in academics, what people
were doing in econometrics,

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:52.821
anything like that.

00:56:52.821 --> 00:56:55.460
These people were because
these people had to.

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.060
It only worked if you're right.

00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.480
You're betting every day.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.600
Smartest people in the world
are spending every waking moment

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.960
trying to find a way to beat it.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.340
I did some of both of these.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.150
I also did some poker.

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:09.960
I was mostly a poker player.

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.140
Poker is kind of in between.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:15.490
OK, you've got
some cardplay kind

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:18.725
of thing, shuffle
reading, things like that.

00:57:18.725 --> 00:57:20.850
But you've also got to know
something about people.

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:23.050
Not as much as a guy
doing sports betting.

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:25.924
You don't have to predict
actions of thousands of people.

00:57:25.924 --> 00:57:27.590
But you do got to be
able to look around

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.859
the people at the table
and figure some stuff out.

00:57:29.859 --> 00:57:31.775
You've got to be able
to get invited to games.

00:57:31.775 --> 00:57:33.649
You've got to be able
to collect from losers.

00:57:33.649 --> 00:57:37.240
You've got to be able to avoid
arrest or getting cheated

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.540
or beaten up and
stuff like that.

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.840
So we were kind of in between.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.420
So a lot of people I know
from those days-- this

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:49.710
was the '70s, '80s, early '80s--
a lot of people stayed at it.

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.110
But a lot of us, having
honed our skills and figured,

00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:56.050
OK, now we think
we know something.

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:58.110
I've been playing
poker since I'm 14.

00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:02.971
I've had moderate success in
beating casino games and sports

00:58:02.971 --> 00:58:03.470
betting.

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:06.070
I've had some really
strong success at poker.

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:07.380
I have some confidence, right?

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.130
I don't just think
I know something.

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:09.860
I know something.

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:13.230
And the reason I believe it
is I've went to the places

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:15.307
where you test that
stuff and walked away

00:58:15.307 --> 00:58:16.140
with people's money.

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:21.280
So a lot of us
went into finance.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.700
So this is really now we're
talking about the early '80s.

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:28.230
The people who
like casino games,

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:30.447
they like secretive
little hedge funds.

00:58:30.447 --> 00:58:32.030
They wanted to invest
their own money.

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:34.254
There are only a few
wealthy investors.

00:58:34.254 --> 00:58:35.670
As soon as they
could, they wanted

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:39.100
to pay off their investors
and just be by themselves.

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.070
And some of this really
brilliant stuff [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:44.170
fairly narrow focused.

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.460
They had to like pick some
narrow niche kind of thing

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:48.840
and do it.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.580
Bayesians, these
people were naturals.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.280
These people went
into big bank stuff.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.150
They knew people.

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:54.160
They knew businesses.

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.530
They were bank executive types.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:01.019
And by the way, in these
days I'm talking about,

00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:02.810
you left math off your
resume if you wanted

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:05.090
to apply for a Wall Street job.

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:06.079
I'm not kidding.

00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:07.620
People thought if
you knew math, it'd

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.727
be like you want
to go to the NFL.

00:59:09.727 --> 00:59:11.310
You know, the NFL,
they don't want you

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.520
if you've got a PhD in math.

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.030
It's like they don't
want smart people.

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:18.000
Wall Street did not want
people who knew math.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.120
Some of them understood
that smart people

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.460
would be dangerous.

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:25.190
Others just thought that anybody
in math had to be ivory tower

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:28.520
and couldn't possibly
know anything.

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.730
But still, once you
got there, these skills

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.040
were incredibly useful.

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:36.570
If you'd been five, six years
betting sports successfully,

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.180
you know a lot of stuff
about markets and businesses

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.140
and how to run
things with people

00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:43.160
that some of these
other people would never

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.760
learn their whole lives.

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.390
These people didn't have to get
a job, but they're problem was,

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:51.050
could they find
somebody to trade with?

00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.560
Could they get people
to broker for them,

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.930
to trade with them, and so on?

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:57.870
So they had a lot
problems with that.

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:01.930
Me, poker players, people
like me, we could get jobs.

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:04.500
We didn't want high level
executive jobs though.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:08.030
We wanted to run some little
department under the radar

01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.530
screen.

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:10.220
We'd run a quant trading team.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.350
We do some pairs trading.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:12.860
We do some quant stuff.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.440
We do structured products.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.730
We did a lot of
that kind of stuff.

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:20.150
We were used to networking--
we were good at that--

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.320
but under the screen.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.750
We weren't good at like
showing up in a suit and tie

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.190
and being nice to bosses
and things like that.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:29.270
We weren't good
at raising money,

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:33.200
which is why we had to go
hook up with a big firm.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.330
We liked the fact that a firm
would give us trading capital,

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:39.010
the firm would give us
setup relationships,

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:41.260
so we didn't have any problem
opening up trading lines

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.135
and things like that.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.800
But we basically got
to keep what we made,

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.530
or we got to keep a
portion of what we made,

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:52.680
which is a way we like to do it.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.190
This is what really
revolutionized Wall Street.

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.890
The thing I tell people is,
having lived through this

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:02.900
from the early '80s
to now, it's people

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.180
don't understand how
much finance has changed.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.840
An awful lot of
finance is written

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.490
as if there's some
continuous history,

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:11.520
some minor technical
innovations,

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.120
electronic trading is just a
little bit faster way of people

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.110
yelling at each other in a pit.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:18.190
Well, it's not true.

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:21.170
The entire fundamental
technological basis of finance

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:24.760
has changed, has
completely been redone.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.530
I use the analogy of a digital
camera versus a chemical

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:29.824
camera.

01:01:29.824 --> 01:01:31.740
They kind of look the
same-- or they used, now

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.656
they're in your phone.

01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:35.895
But a few years ago, a digital
camera looked kind of the same.

01:01:35.895 --> 01:01:36.822
It runs on battery.

01:01:36.822 --> 01:01:37.530
It's got a flash.

01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:38.390
It's got a lens.

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.456
It's got a shutter button.

01:01:40.456 --> 01:01:41.830
People use it for
the same thing.

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:44.038
They take pictures of their
friends, their vacations,

01:01:44.038 --> 01:01:46.170
their parties, things like that.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.170
But the technology inside is
entirely, totally different.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.485
If you want to
make a camera, you

01:01:51.485 --> 01:01:52.860
hire completely
different people,

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.270
use completely
different processes,

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:55.750
the theory is
completely different.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.510
Well, that's the
difference in finance.

01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:00.435
And the people of my generation,
the quants in my generation,

01:02:00.435 --> 01:02:02.120
are the ones that built that.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.490
And most of it has a
lot more of its genetics

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:08.010
come from sports betting and
betting casino games and poker

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:12.680
than it does from economic
theory of the 1970s and 1980s

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.230
era vintage.

01:02:15.417 --> 01:02:17.500
For those of you who are
interested in this stuff,

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.750
I put a few books here.

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:21.607
I did these in alphabetical
order of title.

01:02:21.607 --> 01:02:23.190
I do have couple of
my own books here,

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:26.420
but Beat the Market
by Ed Thorpe.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.140
Just read anything
you can by Ed Thorpe.

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.339
A lot of it's
available free online.

01:02:31.339 --> 01:02:32.130
You've just got to.

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:38.790
That's a guy who
understands stuff.

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:42.330
James McManus, a friend of
mine, wrote Cowboys Full.

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.200
Some of you may remember James.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.460
He made the final table at
the main event of the World

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.070
Series of Poker and wrote a
best selling book about it,

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:52.260
which is a lot of fun,
too-- Positively 5th Street.

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.087
But this is a history
of poker if that's

01:02:54.087 --> 01:02:55.170
what you're interested in.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.882
It's really the only
good history of poker.

01:02:58.882 --> 01:03:01.215
This is a really interesting
book, The Economic Function

01:03:01.215 --> 01:03:03.120
of Futures Markets.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.520
For about 100 years, people
wrote nothing but nonsense

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.200
about futures markets.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.100
And then this guy came along.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:14.460
He had a PhD, came along, and
wrote a thin book about 1990

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.290
that absolutely explained it.

01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.740
And it's funny, because
after reading nonsense-- just

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.694
transparent nonsense about
futures markets all the time--

01:03:21.694 --> 01:03:22.610
this guy wrote a book.

01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:24.980
And the thing about this
book is it's logical.

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.630
It makes sense.

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:26.590
He's got a story.

01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:27.332
It makes sense.

01:03:27.332 --> 01:03:28.790
He's got empirical
evidence for it.

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:29.570
He nailed it.

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:32.102
He explained what
futures markets are.

01:03:32.102 --> 01:03:33.560
And nobody ever
paid any attention.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.410
I mean, nobody ever cites it.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.330
Nobody ever reads it.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:35.780
Whatever.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.446
But if you want to
know futures markets,

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:40.600
this is the guy who explains it.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.430
Fischer Black-- by the
way, this is the hardback

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:44.600
which has a blue cover.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.670
If you buy the paperback
with a black cover,

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:48.510
it has a foreward by me.

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:51.430
So I go for the paperback.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.459
But this is really interesting.

01:03:54.459 --> 01:03:56.000
If you're interested
in the time when

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.737
I was at Harvard and
hanging around MIT

01:03:57.737 --> 01:03:59.320
and talking to people
who were arguing

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.000
about this kind of
stuff, Fischer Black

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.790
was a very important
part of that.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:06.450
I knew him pretty
well in those days.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:11.000
And there's a lot of really
interesting stuff about how

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.200
logic and rationality
and mathematics actually

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.030
came into finance.

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.420
It didn't come in naturally.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.680
It was some eccentric thinkers--
Fischer Black was nothing if

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.830
not eccentric-- who did it.

01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:24.950
And this book explains it.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:27.230
A guy by the name of Perry
Mehrling, Perry Mehrling's

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:30.837
a nice guy who wrote another
good book, The New Lombard

01:04:30.837 --> 01:04:33.045
Street, that's very interesting
about modern finance.

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:39.260
This is a book by Daniel
Usner, who I do not know.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.790
This kind of covers
the prehistory.

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:42.510
This tells you
what the world was

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:47.070
like in the Northwest United
States before poker came in.

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:51.670
It goes up to, I
think, 1791 or so.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:53.370
So it's a pre-history.

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:55.240
But it's really
fascinating economics.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.717
There was a really
fascinating economy

01:04:57.717 --> 01:04:58.800
in this part of the world.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.450
The pre-modern economy,
but it had within it more

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:07.110
of the design of the modern
economy than if you'd

01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:10.380
gone to London or New
York at the same time.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.170
This is a book, another
guy I don't know.

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:13.669
I actually talked
to him a few times

01:05:13.669 --> 01:05:15.495
about this book when
he was writing it,

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:17.010
but this is More Money Than God.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:18.947
It's an excellent story
of the early hedge

01:05:18.947 --> 01:05:20.780
funds, a lot of these
people who were coming

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.800
from these sorts of
backgrounds, bringing

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.185
some mathematics into finance.

01:05:26.755 --> 01:05:28.390
It doesn't have a
tremendous insight.

01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.490
He doesn't get
into the strategies

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:32.750
or the intellectual
ideas behind the things,

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.690
but he'll tell you the
stories of the people

01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:37.890
and what happened
and stuff like that.

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.790
Two books that I--
I sort of did this

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.550
as I was coming up with this
and I just pulled up some books.

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:44.039
But there are two
that I left off

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:45.580
that I was thinking
on the train ride

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.240
up I should have put on here.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.745
One of them is
called Poker Faces

01:05:48.745 --> 01:05:52.510
by a guy named David Hayano.

01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:54.560
He's another guy,
knew him in Gardena.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.720
He was a player in Gardena.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.750
He was also working on
his PhD in sociology.

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:05.040
Actually, he called himself
an autoethnographer.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:11.639
So he was an ethnographer
who studied himself.

01:06:11.639 --> 01:06:12.180
And he wrote.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.554
Anyway, he wrote he wrote a
book on Gardena and the poker

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:15.940
economy and what it was like.

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.567
I'm actually in the book.

01:06:17.567 --> 01:06:19.400
But it really is a great
book, and it really

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.190
tells you kind of what the poker
economy was like in the '70s.

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:27.090
I think that was the last
gasp that takes us back.

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:31.530
It was a lot weaker than it
was in the 1840s Chicago.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:34.140
So it wasn't as
important to the economy,

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.670
but it was still there.

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:39.720
You could really see a lot
of the relations, how things

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.187
worked, really were there.

01:06:41.187 --> 01:06:42.520
I think that's kind of gone now.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.890
You really don't
find that today.

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:47.610
Another one is by a guy, a
friend of mine, professor Phil

01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:49.500
Tetlock lock at Wharton.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.240
He wrote a book called
Expert Political Judgment.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.790
And that tells you
a lot about what

01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:57.630
the things that drove
me away from basically

01:06:57.630 --> 01:07:00.240
how bad experts are
predicting stuff.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.124
And what really drives
you to-- if you're

01:07:02.124 --> 01:07:04.540
good at this tough stuff, if
you're a quantitative person,

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.660
if you like to make bets, if
you like to back your judgment,

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.510
you've just got to
stay away from experts.

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:12.220
You've got to go someplace where
you find out in cold, hard cash

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.700
whether you're making
good or bad predictions.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.800
Pokerface of Wall
Street, this is by me.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.060
This covers a lot of
stuff I'm talking about,

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.050
the connection between
poker and finance.

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:26.990
And Red Blooded
Risk, also by me,

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:29.870
this tells a lot more about
how people brought ideas

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:37.380
from sports betting and
poker and Casino games

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:43.390
and how that entered
into mainstream finance.

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:46.250
OK, that's what I've got.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:48.651
Any questions, comments?

01:07:48.651 --> 01:07:49.150
Yeah?

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:54.870
AUDIENCE: How good was George
Bush and Bill Gates at Poker?

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.565
PROFESSOR: I can't really
answer that in the sense that--

01:07:57.565 --> 01:07:58.940
to really answer
that, you'd have

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.870
to like tracked their
winnings and losing

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.180
for long periods of time.

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.640
Bill ran a game
in Courier House.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.100
I didn't like the game.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:09.420
It was a very tense game.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:13.330
I always got the feeling people
lost more than they wanted to

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.680
and it wasn't a
lot of fun to play.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.226
He was certainly a respectable
player at the time.

01:08:20.226 --> 01:08:21.850
You also have to
understand, I'm coming

01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:23.020
from a slightly
different perspective.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.700
I'm really at this
point one of the best

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.145
players in the country.

01:08:26.145 --> 01:08:27.811
We didn't really have
ranking back then,

01:08:27.811 --> 01:08:29.149
it was kind of hard to tell.

01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:31.800
But I would say there were
maybe 100 people in the country

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.675
that I would have felt
more or less equal to,

01:08:33.675 --> 01:08:34.970
and I wasn't afraid of anybody.

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:36.260
I would sit down at
the table with anybody

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.609
and play them kind of even.

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:39.729
So none of these people
where that level.

01:08:39.729 --> 01:08:41.180
None of these
people were kind of

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.510
serious, professional players.

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:50.779
But in somebody can be a very
competent, careful player.

01:08:50.779 --> 01:08:52.529
George Bush was a lot
of fun to play with.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.359
Ran a great game.

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:59.979
I don't think he was too
interested in the money.

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:00.700
I'm not sure.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.840
He didn't seem to be.

01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:07.390
Probably more interested in
the connections, by the way.

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:08.569
By the way, that
drove a lot of people.

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:10.849
A lot of people-- I'm
talking about this networking

01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:12.130
in kind of this abstract.

01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:13.510
See, I'm an introvert.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:16.222
So for me, it's kind
of this amazing thing

01:09:16.222 --> 01:09:17.680
that you can create
these networks.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.263
I'm thinking of them
very mathematical

01:09:19.263 --> 01:09:20.729
and have a diagram.

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.740
A lot of people are
just wired that way.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.412
They understand on some--
they don't sit down and draw

01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:26.120
network diagrams.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.399
They say, I'm going
to play in this game.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:28.229
I'm going to make some friends.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:29.450
I'm going to chat
with my friends.

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.930
I'm going to buy
a baseball team.

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:32.569
I'm going to be
president, whatever.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.374
It works for them.

01:09:34.374 --> 01:09:35.790
And that stuff
never works for me.

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:36.831
I have to think about it.

01:09:36.831 --> 01:09:40.310
I have to do this on
an intellectual level.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.439
[INAUDIBLE] I would say
of the people I played

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:47.060
at Harvard at that time,
the two that were probably

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:50.990
the best in my recollection were
Scott Turow, the author, who

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:54.790
was really could have
been a pro level player.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:59.310
Probably didn't play enough to
do it, but had the instincts,

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:01.820
had the people skills and so on.

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:04.690
And a guy named Lloyd Trefethen
who's a mathematician at Oxford

01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:07.800
now and just was a
really good-- actually

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.220
taught me a lot of theory.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.000
We talked about
that stuff a lot.

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:18.400
But all this, one thing I
will say in terms of that.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.740
The people at Garden,
the people at Gardena

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.930
really were a cut above that.

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:26.460
A pretty good club player
at Gardena, somebody

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.690
who just kind of was
playing at the top stakes

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:32.380
and breaking even, somebody
like that was so much

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.330
better than the leather
ass Texas road gamblers

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:37.916
who were playing off in
the World Series of Poker

01:10:37.916 --> 01:10:38.790
and things like that.

01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:40.350
You went to Las Vegas,
and these people just

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:41.630
were not very good at poker.

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:44.220
Now, they were very
good at making money

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.640
at poker, which is a
little bit different.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.510
But if you just sat down, if you
just listened to the analysis

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:51.880
they gave for why they
did things when they did,

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.790
it was just-- they
believed in luck.

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:59.370
They would make these
arguments that just

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:01.870
made no strategic sense at all.

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.110
They weren't even thinking
in terms of what you think

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.150
of [? as ?] [? poker. ?] Now,
that had very little to do with

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:10.260
making a living at poker.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:14.630
One of the stories I like
to tell is there's a story

01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:16.700
that's-- I read it
in a book, actually.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.700
I didn't know this at
the time, but three

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.770
WSOP winners-- It
might have been

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:23.250
Dolly Brunsen, Sailor Roberts.

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:26.150
Sailor Roberts
was a good player.

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:29.280
He was probably the only one in
that crowd that was really top.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.070
And one other, they used
to drive around Texas

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.410
and play in just
local [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:38.100
OK, 3 WSOP winners playing
in these Texas games

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.830
and stuff, just local people.

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.240
They should clean up, or they
should make tons of money.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.234
Sailor told me they broke even.

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.400
They just weren't really
making money playing poker.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.860
What they were
doing was they were

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.284
bag men for betting on
high school football.

01:11:52.284 --> 01:11:53.700
So they were going
to these towns,

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.900
they were playing some poker.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.483
And then they were
collecting the bets

01:11:56.483 --> 01:11:58.460
and moving around and
getting paid for that.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.960
But the poker was a break
even operation for them.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.860
So a lot of people who have
great reputations in the poker

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.275
place, lots of colorful stories,
and just you set them down

01:12:08.275 --> 01:12:11.220
at a computer, you set them down
at a tournament or something,

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:15.940
they would just be
toast in five minutes.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.130
But the people, the
people in Gardena--

01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:21.857
who were much better in
terms of theoretical poker

01:12:21.857 --> 01:12:24.065
playing and playing the
game-- we would've been toast

01:12:24.065 --> 01:12:25.380
in that tavern in Texas, right?

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.588
We would've been beaten over
the head with a pool cue

01:12:27.588 --> 01:12:30.432
and left out with the
cows or something.

01:12:30.432 --> 01:12:31.890
I don't just mean
we weren't tough.

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:32.900
We weren't tough.

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.390
We aren't tough.

01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:35.860
We didn't have social skills.

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:37.790
We had just enough
social skills,

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:40.260
some of us-- most of them
didn't even have that.

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.441
I was considered pretty social
because I could actually

01:12:43.441 --> 01:12:45.690
get a game together of normal
people and collect money

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:46.200
and so on.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.970
Most of these people couldn't.

01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:50.710
They couldn't play
with normal people.

01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:56.890
And none of us had the kind of
skills that those people did.

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:58.030
Other questions?

01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.530
Yeah?

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:00.529
AUDIENCE: You think if
you're a good player,

01:13:00.529 --> 01:13:02.570
are you better off making
a big name for yourself

01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:04.814
or staying under the radar?

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:06.480
PROFESSOR: That's
hard for me to answer,

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.539
because I come from
a strong tradition

01:13:08.539 --> 01:13:09.580
of being under the radar.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.038
It was very hard
for me to come up.

01:13:11.038 --> 01:13:13.750
When I wrote this book,
this was my first public

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:14.430
acknowledgement.

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:15.930
I mean, people who
knew me knew I played.

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:17.763
Including on Wall
Street-- you know, I mean,

01:13:17.763 --> 01:13:19.700
a lot of famous
people on Wall Street

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.250
play and play with whatever.

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.660
But to sort of
come out in print--

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.110
and when I talk
to people, I said,

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:27.110
I'm going to tell a story
about you in the book.

01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:28.820
And people who you
would think would

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.790
have no problem being identified
as a poker player just

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:34.590
would not let me do it.

01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:37.950
But that said, there's a
whole career out there.

01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:39.700
I don't know if it's
still true, but there

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.790
are people who made fortunes
by being famous poker players.

01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:45.710
And the thing I always
kind of wanted to do,

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.410
I never liked tournaments.

01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:48.760
I don't like casinos.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.304
I played them
sometimes, but I like

01:13:51.304 --> 01:13:52.470
playing when I want to play.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:54.011
I don't like being
told when to play,

01:13:54.011 --> 01:13:56.490
and some of these
casinos, the experience

01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:58.940
is just so physically
unpleasant,

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:01.220
playing at 2:00 in the
morning and getting bad chairs

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:01.750
or whatever.

01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:07.050
But I was tempted by
high stakes poker.

01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:10.585
And I always thought that would
be kind of fun to go in there

01:14:10.585 --> 01:14:12.710
and play for cash and be
on television and do that.

01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:16.454
That was one that I
kind of thought of.

01:14:16.454 --> 01:14:20.480
But you also have to think
a little bit-- like I say,

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.450
people in AQR have no problem
with me writing the books

01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:25.295
and giving talks
like this and so on.

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:27.670
I don't know about me being
actually in poker after that.

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:31.920
That probably would
be a step too much.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.990
So I think it's a choice
you make, who you are.

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:37.690
And I think if you decide who
you are and you're true to it,

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:39.530
you can be successful.

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:41.364
What you don't want to
do is put on a front.

01:14:41.364 --> 01:14:43.280
If you put on a front
for something like that,

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.850
it can come back to haunt you.

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:48.070
So if you are a celebrity--
I'm just not a celebrity.

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.810
I never could be.

01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:50.310
I'd never be happy being one.

01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:54.009
Nobody's offered to make
me one, but-- and it

01:14:54.009 --> 01:14:55.050
wouldn't be right for me.

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:57.990
But if you are cut from that
cloth, you should do it.

01:14:57.990 --> 01:15:00.370
Be true to yourself.

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:00.870
Yeah?

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:03.036
AUDIENCE: How do you feel
the view of mathematicians

01:15:03.036 --> 01:15:08.399
on Wall Street has
changed since [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:08.399 --> 01:15:09.940
PROFESSOR: Sorry,
perception of what?

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:12.720
AUDIENCE: Of mathematicians.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.100
PROFESSOR: It's gone through--
it kind of goes through.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:19.190
OK, so first, it
was just laughable.

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:21.860
And let me explain how Wall
Street works, by the way.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:22.910
Wall Street is sales.

01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:23.810
Finance is sales.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:26.890
All the money in finance always
has, always will be in sales.

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.530
A few quants can make
a couple of bucks

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:30.950
on the edges-- a
few billion, even--

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:33.270
but it's just not a lot in
the whole scheme of things.

01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:36.710
If you can bring money in,
if you can gather assets,

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:39.050
it's always been rewarded.

01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:42.370
So when the early quants
came, the attitude is,

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:46.490
let's say you're
like LOR associate.

01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:52.932
People [? know ?] [? that. ?]
O'Brian, Rubinstein,

01:15:52.932 --> 01:15:53.640
and I'm blanking.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.070
These are the people who
did portfolio insurance

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:56.040
in the '80s, whatever.

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.030
Anyway, so these finance
professors show up,

01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:59.377
these quants show up.

01:15:59.377 --> 01:16:00.960
What Wall Street is
saying, hey great.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.915
We don't care.

01:16:01.915 --> 01:16:03.190
You could astrologers.

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:06.080
You could be
chartists, whatever.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.289
If you're gathering assets
and you're giving it to us

01:16:08.289 --> 01:16:09.830
and paying us
commissions to trade it

01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:12.390
back and forth, if you're
giving people reason to trade,

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:13.835
we're happy to service you.

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:15.120
And we'll pretend we
like you, and we'll

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.120
pretend to respect you.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.274
Whatever, we don't care.

01:16:17.274 --> 01:16:18.190
And they really don't.

01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:20.990
And so that was kind of the
attitude toward mathematicians.

01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:22.860
If you have a way
to generate trades

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.390
and to talk people into
trading, great, because we're

01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:26.690
just taking a commission.

01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.273
All we care about is that people
are coming in and doing this.

01:16:31.251 --> 01:16:33.375
Then they started figuring
out that, you know, hey,

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:33.958
wait a minute.

01:16:33.958 --> 01:16:35.890
These guys aren't
like everybody else.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:38.390
These guys actually
are making money.

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:40.620
Some of this stuff
really does make money.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:43.630
That's very, very
difficult for Wall Street

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:45.160
to come to terms with.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.540
There's a New York
Times Magazine article

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:51.760
about Lehman Brothers with Lou
Gluckman and Peter Peterson,

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.880
the clash of those cultures--
the shirt sleeve, cigar

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.940
chomping trader culture, totally
at odds with the white shoe

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.020
investment banking culture
when these two things crashed.

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.920
So then people were kind of
afraid of mathematicians,

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.930
but also somewhat
dismissive of them.

01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:17.110
So then I think it's kind of
mellowed out a little bit.

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:20.330
But I will still say, AQR
is a quant hedge fund.

01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:25.450
When we go and do
our credit thing,

01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:29.280
the credit counterparties,
the assumption

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.975
is nobody can understand
your black box trading.

01:17:31.975 --> 01:17:33.087
Now, that's just not true.

01:17:33.087 --> 01:17:34.420
I mean, we are very transparent.

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:35.211
We can sit it down.

01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:38.110
And certainly any of you could
figure it out in five minutes,

01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:40.292
but other people would
maybe take an hour.

01:17:40.292 --> 01:17:41.250
But we can lay it down.

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:42.410
Here's what we do.

01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:44.830
Here are the eight signals
and we measure these things.

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:47.210
And we add them up
and we find the best

01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:49.590
and we buy this
and we short that.

01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:53.220
It's a lot simpler than
somebody who's saying,

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.100
oh, I'm doing this quantitative
analysis or technical analysis

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.451
or fundamental stuff and I'm
thinking about all these 80

01:17:58.451 --> 01:17:58.950
factors.

01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:02.220
We tell you exactly what we do.

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:05.144
And they always assign the most
junior credit person to us,

01:18:05.144 --> 01:18:07.310
because they figure nobody
can understand it anyway,

01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:10.550
so why waste somebody who
knows what's going on?

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:14.650
That kind of prejudice you
still find a lot, that somehow

01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:16.370
what we do is crazy.

01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:17.597
It's a little weird.

01:18:17.597 --> 01:18:18.930
Nobody can really understand it.

01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:21.517
It seems to kind of work, so
we'll continue to do business.

01:18:21.517 --> 01:18:22.350
We'll recommend you.

01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:24.570
We'll put our client's
money in you, but not

01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:28.290
with the same confidence we
have with a guy who's saying,

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:31.160
I went to the company
and I pounded the tires

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.150
and I talked to the CEO
and I shook him and said,

01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:35.810
tell me what's
really going on here.

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:38.320
And I understand this stuff.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.270
The biggest problem is
you're quant's not confident.

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:47.024
It's still the case that people
measure your credibility,

01:18:47.024 --> 01:18:49.190
how much they believe you,
by how confident you are.

01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:51.290
So if I come in and say,
well, I got this model.

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:52.498
It seems to work pretty well.

01:18:52.498 --> 01:18:55.250
I think I got a 60% chance that
this trade will make money.

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:57.750
They just think you're-- they
don't know where you're coming

01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:58.820
from, what planet.

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.153
A guy comes in and says, I'm
sure this is going to work.

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:01.830
It's got to.

01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:03.930
I've got all these
87 reasons, whatever.

01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:05.220
Now, they don't believe them.

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.300
They think it's 51% just like.

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.390
But they expect
him to be confident

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:10.967
and they understand that.

01:19:10.967 --> 01:19:12.550
So I think that's
the biggest problem.

01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:14.216
If you want to be a
quant and you really

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:17.020
want to be honest about
your confidence for things,

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.696
it is shocking to people
how little you know.

01:19:19.696 --> 01:19:22.950
It is shocking to people
that with all this work,

01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:25.890
51% is still pretty good.

01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:28.480
And that, I think,
is a barrier we're

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.730
going to have real
trouble ever surmounting.

01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:33.610
A quant can
understand, hey, 51%?

01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:35.930
Enough bets, you can
be a casino raking

01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:37.110
in the money in roulette.

01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:38.830
That's great.

01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:41.210
Non-quants have problem
with that concept,

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:47.180
which is why they're playing
roulette without the glasses.

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.274
OK, we--

01:19:51.274 --> 01:19:53.007
AUDIENCE: We don't
have enough time.

01:19:53.007 --> 01:19:55.340
PROFESSOR: Well, thank you
very much for your attention.

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.690
[APPLAUSE]

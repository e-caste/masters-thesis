00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.430
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
So we're here.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.880
So we're in lecture four,
and this is really exciting

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.420
because we're going to be
talking about an application.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
We sort of spent three lectures
introducing and building up

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.550
some of the framework
that the computer solves

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.710
to do quantum
mechanics, and now we're

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.490
going to actually look
at a real problem.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.850
It's a really cool problem.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.000
And then that'll sort of--
we'll follow up with this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.625
We might do a little bit more
of this to start on Tuesday,

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:58.500
and then we'll talk
about hydrogen storage is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.420
another problem.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.690
We'll go back after that
to a little more formalism

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.660
to get to solids because
these are molecules so far,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.470
and then we'll do
some more problems.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.810
OK, so that's our plan.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.800
What I want to do today is
I want to review a little.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.200
Since I didn't-- so Michelle
came in and gave the lecture,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.920
lecture number three, because
I was in San Francisco.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.230
And so I'd like to review
some of the key points

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.332
from that lecture.

00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:33.290
So we're going to review
a little bit to start.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.140
And then I want to do some
interactive calculations

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.350
together because,
first of all, there's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.910
no better way to
spend time, really,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.340
with a person or
a class or any--

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.070
to compute together is
to know one another.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.010
And through these interactive
calculations on the hydrogen

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.720
dimer, we will
pose some questions

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.150
and answer them
together, make sure

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.220
that we're kind of
collectively understanding

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.380
some of the key points of
the first three lectures.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.870
Then I'll tell you about why
this is such a cool problem,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.070
what solar thermal
fuels are, and why this

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.720
is such a cool energy problem.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.000
And then we'll end with a
discussion and some more

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.340
interactive calculations
of the solar thermal fuels

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.370
and kind of talking about
why we need quantum mechanics

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.798
to tackle this problem.

00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:18.590
So that's our plan.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.620
Is anybody else-- yeah,
we're good with that?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.113
We got a thumbs up.

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:26.780
I'm ready to go.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.380
I love it.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.830
You can give me a little private
thumbs up like that any time,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.540
and I love that
kind of feedback.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.860
That's helpful.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.320
And I was actually
thinking that you

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.410
were thinking of the Celtics
securing the division

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.025
title anyway.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.410
I think you talked about this.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.785
This is sort of
where you started

00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:48.660
because we had this kind
of quantum mechanics

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.618
that we couldn't solve.

00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:52.350
And then we said, well, but
you can solve it analytically

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.450
for hydrogen, and we did.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.050
And we said that that explained
the periodic table, amazingly,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.410
if you only had one
electron and one proton.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.730
Unfortunately everything
has a lot more than that,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.900
and what happens
is that when you

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.860
put more than one
quantum-mechanical particle--

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.940
by which I mean what?

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:15.870
AUDIENCE: More
than one electron.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.120
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Electrons.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.260
For us, that's the
quantum-mechanical particle

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.152
that we care about.

00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:22.360
Of course there are more
quantum-mechanical particles

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.940
than that in the world.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.343
Everything is
quantum mechanical,

00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:26.760
but those are the
things we really

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.210
care about in this class.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.390
And if you put more than
one into the whole thing,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.005
then you've got to think about
how they talk to each other,

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.740
and that's the killer.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.220
So you can talk about
how they talk to the ion.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.840
That's this 1 over r term--

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.060
how they talk to the
proton I mean, right?

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.683
But talking to each other,
that's this many-body problem.

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.100
It's called the
many-body problem.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.740
That's really hard, and
analytically it's a nightmare,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.040
and that's where
computation comes in.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.580
Unfortunately, so this
is sort of showing--

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.130
this is just all review for the
first little bit of this class.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.350
I want to talk about review.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.925
Those good-old days of
one electron are over.

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:05.550
They were good.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.310
They were fun.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.580
We had a blast for one lecture,
and now we're moving on,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.213
and we're going to multibody,
many-body problems.

00:04:13.213 --> 00:04:15.130
And that's the many-body
Schrodinger equation.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.350
And you can see
that the thing goes

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.392
from this where you get
those hydrogenic orbitals

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:19.899
and everything's
beautiful to this

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:24.660
where it's just a complete
mathematical nightmare.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.570
And this cannot be
solved analytically.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.450
And so these are sums
over all of the ions,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.140
sums over all the electron-ion
interactions and sums

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.500
over all the electron-electron
interactions.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.450
This is the killer right here.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.798
We make some approximations.

00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:42.840
That's how we get there
because as I talked about

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.890
in the beginning, even if
our computers were seriously

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.070
like 10 orders of magnitude
faster than they are today,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.140
we still wouldn't be able
to solve this problem

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.760
in a straightforward way.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.130
We cannot solve it
directly and exactly,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.990
so we have to make
approximations.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.000
One of the first
ones we make is--

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.740
oh, and that's just
those are the labels.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.565
One of the first ones
we make are-- right,

00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:04.440
there's the equation.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.510
That's the
Schrodinger equation--

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.420
is this Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.050
I think Michelle probably
showed you my tattoo.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.390
Did you see the tattoo?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.847
That was my--

00:05:16.847 --> 00:05:18.930
I tried to find a good
image for Born-Oppenheimer,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.370
and that came up first.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.450
And then did she
talk about-- no?

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.177
So when I found the image,
I found it on a blog.

00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:28.010
And that's a dangerous
thing because there's

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.200
a long trail of discussion.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.140
And it was interesting that
the whole discussion was not

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.540
about computational
modeling and it was not

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.930
about physics, Schrodinger,
or Born-Oppenheimer.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.150
It was entirely about
whether this guy was

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.450
going to be able to find
dates or not in his life.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.720
And it was actually a
very engaging discussion,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.520
and it came out--
it was like 50%

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.800
said definitely because of the
tattoo, and 50% said no way.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800
And so I don't know where that--

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.360
but anyway.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.680
Now this is another
cartoon that just

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.070
shows that the
electrons are the flies,

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.560
and the protons, the
nucleus, are these cows.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.040
And they move
really slow, bulls.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.150
I didn't mean to dis.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.420
These guys are
going really fast.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.760
This guy's kind of slow,
and that's really the point.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.860
Electrons are fast
and light, and so it's

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.570
a good approximation.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.370
How much lighter are they than
the proton or the nucleus?

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.328
AUDIENCE: 1 over 2,000.

00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:35.037
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
Yeah, it's a couple--

00:06:35.037 --> 00:06:36.000
it's like 1,000, right?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.320
So that's enough lighter that
you can say, you know what?

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.480
At any given time, it's
a good approximation

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.810
to say that this thing is
pretty stationary with respect

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.810
to these things buzzing around.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.130
That's the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation in cow language--

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.390
OK, cow-fly language.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.820
Actually, this is
more Google image art.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.860
So this is the
approximation we make.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.970
What you can see is that we just
get rid of those nuclear terms.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.900
We treat them as if
they're not moving

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.540
and they don't really matter
because at any given time what

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:25.340
we care about is the electronic
structure with the atoms fixed.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.930
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.130
And you can solve for it.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.810
It's a really good
approximation in many cases.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.110
There are some fields
where it matters,

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.340
where this approximation
actually can break down

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.590
like in superconductivity.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.910
We're not going to go there.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.820
For us and the things we
care about, that's sort of--

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.550
the positions of the
atoms are frozen,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.290
and then we solve
for the electrons.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.970
That's fine, and that's
a good approximation.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.670
OK, so any questions
about Born-Oppenheimer,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.950
the Born-Oppenheimer surface?

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.160
You'll hear people say that,
the Born-Oppenheimer surface,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.990
and now you know what they mean.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.700
They mean the energy surface
where the electrons are always

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.550
in sort of their ground
state with respect

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.730
to the nuclei positions because
they always have enough time

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.332
to get there because they move
so much faster than the nuclei.

00:08:14.332 --> 00:08:16.040
That's the Born-Oppenheimer
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.450
You can pull that out
as well in conversation.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.520
Now that's one approximation.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.170
That kind of helps.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.010
It really doesn't
help the key problem,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.270
which is that
many-body-interaction thing.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.400
So that's like the real--

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.030
that's the real issue here.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:37.140
How do we get over this
electron-electron interaction?

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.020
And don't even let me say it,
electron-electron-electron

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.620
interaction because you can
have like three-body effects.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.680
It's a many-body world,
but we can't do that.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.460
We can't do that on a computer
in a good-enough time scale

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.150
to be applicable to
materials, so we simplify.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.860
And you covered this, right?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.360
This is not-- but
we're getting back

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.210
into our feeling
with this, right?

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.920
But you did cover this.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.760
Am I correct?

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.570
OK, good.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.550
One person got it.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.650
But thank you for
that in the back.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.900
Now, OK, there were basically
two paths because they saw this

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.210
and they knew, they
being the people thinking

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.440
about computational materials,
physics, and chemistry

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.190
back in the 1940s.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.710
They knew they needed
to do something.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.950
And so there were
essentially two paths.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.680
There was a path that
most chemists took,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.840
and there was a path
that most physicists

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.320
took starting in sort of
the '60s really, actually.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:42.700
The path that the chemists
took is to say, you know what?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.910
We're not going to mess
with the Hamiltonian.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.990
We are not going
to mess with this.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.620
This is right.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.570
The physics of this is
correct, so we don't

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.430
want to play around with that.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.490
Most of what the chemists
did was to play around

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.990
with the wave function.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.120
So what they did is--

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.790
let me go back.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.000
Sorry.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.670
I think I had the
Schrodinger equation here.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:11.530
H-- remember Schrodinger
equation, H psi equals E psi.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.030
Well, they played with psi.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.550
So instead of saying
that psi can be complex

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.760
as it needs to be with all the
freedom that it needs to have,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.890
they said no, we're going to
start to restrict that freedom.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.290
That's really how quantum
chemistry sort of began.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.082
I mean, there was some
perturbation theory,

00:10:29.082 --> 00:10:32.240
but a lot of the real
advances in quantum chemistry

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.860
in the beginning happened in
making approximations for this,

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.270
for the wave function.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.490
They said keep H, mess with psi.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.940
Make it simple.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.660
And if you make it simple, it
becomes a tractable problem,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.090
right?

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.030
How many of you have heard
of a determinant, a Slater

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.520
determinant?

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.360
Slater was here at MIT, and
it was a really important

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.010
contribution to
quantum chemistry

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.568
was to be able to write psi,
keep the important properties

00:11:02.568 --> 00:11:04.610
that you need but to write
it in a much simpler--

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.100
in a very simplified way.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.760
So you lose information.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.590
It's not the same
psi that you need.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.420
It's not the correct
psi, but it's

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.233
sort of an approximate
version of it.

00:11:13.233 --> 00:11:14.900
That's kind of where
quantum chemistry--

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.130
that's what Hartree-Fock
theory is based on.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.430
Then you have sort of the
physics world in the 1960s.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.430
And I've shown you the
picture of Walter Kohn, who

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.440
is the only person to win a
Nobel Prize in computation,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.140
so far at least.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.908
And he won it for a
density function--

00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:33.950
for his development of
density functional theory.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.890
Now that is taking sort
of the opposite approach.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:42.980
What that is doing that
is saying, OK, ignore psi.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.450
Psi is just too hard.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.750
Even if you simplify it,
it's a really hard thing

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.100
to write in a computer and to
represent accurately, and so

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.150
let's just forget about that
and work only with the density.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.580
I take it you did talk
about this last week, right?

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.970
So in density functional theory,
that's where it gets its name.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.430
You just get rid of psi
by not thinking about it

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:10.160
and by solving the problem of
the density instead of the wave

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.820
function.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.960
So it's the density of the
electrons instead of the wave

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.670
function of the electrons.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.590
Now when you do that,
effectively-- and again,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.605
my goal here in this class is
not to go deep mathematics here

00:12:23.605 --> 00:12:25.730
because I know many of you
haven't had quantum yet,

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.980
but I want you to come
away with an intuitive

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.540
picture for what's happening.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:35.890
What happened in the 1960s when
these communities were really

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.860
developing computational quantum
mechanics for the first time?

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.670
And what this
does-- no, but stay.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.500
It's still going to be good.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.190
OK, go ahead.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.430
We'll fill you in
when you come back.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.290
What this does to
say that I want

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.080
to think about the density
instead of the wave function

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.850
is effectively it modifies H.
So now instead of modifying psi,

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.430
you actually are
changing H considerably--

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.440
considerably.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.540
But you hope that
you don't change it

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.710
so much that it's wrong or
that it's unphysical, right?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.380
And density functional
theory effectively

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.120
is a theory that simplifies
H, the Hamiltonian,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.940
the expression for the energy.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.290
You basically get rid of
those complex, many-particle

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:31.710
interactions from H and you put
effective potentials into it.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.300
That's density
functional theory.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.050
Now, both of them get rid
of this many-body problem.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.890
Actually, see, what you do in
quantum chemistry is you change

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.290
the wave function so it's
a single-particle wave

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.890
function, which basically means
when you solve the equations,

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.005
there are no more
many-body terms left.

00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:51.380
And in density
functional theory,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.530
you change the Hamiltonian so
that you explicitly get rid

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.360
of the many-body interactions.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.950
Either way, you're left with
a single-particle picture.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.120
That's really the trick.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.060
In both communities,
what you end up with

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.380
is a single-particle picture.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.440
Now that's something that you
can solve in less than the age

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.810
of the universe on a
computer, and that's the key.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.838
You're left with these
single-particle pictures.

00:14:14.838 --> 00:14:16.380
What is this
single-particle picture?

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.730
Who can tell me?

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.720
Did you talk about that?

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.220
You go from a many-body picture
to a single-particle picture.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.000
Take a guess.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.430
Yeah, I see that
you want to guess.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.010
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.970
AUDIENCE: It's one where all
the variables in your theory

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:45.060
only sort of depend on--

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.000
all the things in
your theory only

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.530
depend on the variables
for one particle.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.240
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
Basically yes.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.800
I mean, that's
exactly it, right?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.560
So now my electrons--

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.780
my electrons are like this.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.570
In my real system, here
are my electrons, all

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.420
those E's, and there they are.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.610
But what I'm saying
is that this isn't--

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.295
I can't describe
this because, look,

00:15:14.295 --> 00:15:16.420
that's when I have to take
into account these guys.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.050
Look, that's this term
here, the R minus r

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.940
is the relative positions
of two electrons.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.640
And I even need
to take these guys

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.030
and these guys and those guys,
and that's the many-body part.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.900
That's not solvable, basically,
not for computational material

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.710
science.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.860
So what we need to do is--

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.070
I mean, it's solvable in certain
ways, but it's very hard.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.410
I should put it that way.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.490
So the single-particle
picture is to say, sorry,

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.820
but you're going to lose all
this individualness here,

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.500
and each electron--

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.600
I'm going to now map
this guy over here--

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.960
is only going to feel
some potential field,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.060
some mean field, some
mean potential average

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.800
of all of those other electrons.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.920
It swims in an
average potential now.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.770
And so I basically have
just eliminated the problem.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.650
The problem was this.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.840
It's too hard to solve on
the computer, certainly

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.280
analytically but
also on computer.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.380
And so I've changed it to this.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.680
That's basically what
both of these things do.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.140
Quantum chemistry and
density functional theory

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.720
both result in this picture,
this very simplified picture.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.040
It's called a mean-field
picture because each electron

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.260
is in a mean field
of the rest of them.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.110
They do it in different ways.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.550
Quantum chemists do it by
simplifying the wave function,

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.460
and the physicists
did it originally

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.003
by simplifying the Hamiltonian.

00:16:46.003 --> 00:16:47.920
And there was a lot of
really interesting sort

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.230
of discussion, to
put it lightly,

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.450
about which path was better.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.640
And then I think now
both communities,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.607
I think, work in both ways.

00:16:57.607 --> 00:16:58.940
There's a lot of back and forth.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.040
But density functional
theory is definitely

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.110
the one we're going to
work on with this class

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.730
because it strikes a balance.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.930
It strikes a very nice
balance as a method that

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.060
can capture enough accuracy.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.202
It sacrifices something.

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.660
It definitely
sacrifices something.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.700
You approximate the Hamiltonian.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.450
But it doesn't sacrifice--
it still is pretty accurate,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.310
and it's been shown
to be pretty accurate

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.690
for many, many, many problems.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.485
And you can see that it's also
right in this region here,

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.110
which is a really
nice region to be in.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.660
Now why is this a nice region
to be in on the vertical axis?

00:17:43.287 --> 00:17:45.270
AUDIENCE: You can solve
for larger molecules.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.520
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: You can
solve for large molecules,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.350
yeah.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.860
What else?

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.890
Yeah?

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.510
AUDIENCE: It's growing pretty
quickly, so in the future

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.240
you'll be able to
do even more atoms.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.407
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Totally.

00:18:01.407 --> 00:18:04.830
Nice n-cubed scaling--
well, sorry, n-cubed scaling

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.780
with the method with size but
also increase in the speed

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.280
here.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.282
What else?

00:18:12.282 --> 00:18:13.990
What else might this
be a nice sweet spot

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.820
for computational
materials design?

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.620
1,000 to 10,000 atoms, sort of
where the limits of DFT are.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.060
Well, what are we solving for?

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.065
Electrons, right?

00:18:31.065 --> 00:18:34.020
We're solving for those
properties of electrons.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.060
Now, why is this
a nice sweet spot?

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.280
Well, when might I need less
or more atoms than that?

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.290
OK, so let's say I'm in
coupled cluster, which

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.380
is one of these ways of making
the wave function simpler.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.510
It's a very accurate method,
but you can only do today,

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:04.763
I don't know, 15 atoms
accurately, maybe 20.

00:19:04.763 --> 00:19:06.180
What would be
limiting about that?

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.380
Is 20 atoms enough?

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:10.980
Yeah?

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.260
AUDIENCE: If you're
trying to figure out, say,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.160
the electrical properties
of some material,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.560
you don't really
have enough space

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.350
to take into account some
three-dimensional block

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.017
of stuff.

00:19:20.017 --> 00:19:22.350
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: And when
would you run out of space?

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.892
What matters?

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.540
AUDIENCE: Boundary conditions
and things like that.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:28.650
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.050
AUDIENCE: So if you're
talking quantum dots or things

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.670
like that, you have
different sizes

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.713
contributing to the
properties of the material.

00:19:34.713 --> 00:19:36.630
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah,
and you can't really

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.370
explore those with
just 20 atoms.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:39.660
Definitely a good point.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.460
Anything else?

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.880
Why else might this--

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.500
so it's not just--

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.760
it's the size.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.120
When I hear it's the size of
the material you want to study

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.730
and 1 to 10,000 is a
pretty good region,

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.280
you can play a
lot-- welcome back.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:04.310
You can play a lot
with that size range.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.670
You can model a lot of
materials in that size range.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.670
But importantly, the
thing you're modeling

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.090
are the electrons.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.080
And so what counts,
it's not just

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.680
about how many atoms you can
put into your simulation.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.160
That's not what counts.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.470
You see these titles of papers
like million-atom simulation,

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.980
billion-atom simulation,
trillion-atom simulation.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.822
OK, that's cool.

00:20:28.822 --> 00:20:29.780
You get a lot of atoms.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:30.560
Good for you.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.190
But what matters?

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.350
What matters is did you need
those atoms for the property

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.240
you care about?

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.110
Did you need them?

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.800
Now in some cases, maybe you do.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.870
But for electrons, very
often they're spread.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:52.110
What they want to do is
kind of more dominated

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.360
by a few nearest-neighbor
distances,

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.110
maybe 10-nearest-neighbor
distances in a crystal.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.170
In some cases they're very
spread out, like in a metal,

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.530
and then we can use periodic
boundary conditions,

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.890
and we can still
capture all the physics.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.340
But when you have interfaces
or roughness or molecules,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.570
the electrons aren't going to--

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.850
even if you put a
million atoms in,

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.790
you won't see anything different
than if you put a thousand

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.110
atoms in.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.730
And that has--
for many problems.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.850
For many problems, not all, but
for many cool materials-design

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.380
problems, that's the case.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.230
And that's why this is such
a nice sweet spot of a method

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.950
because it hits in this range
where the stuff we care about,

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.440
electrons, happen
to kind of play

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.310
in this phase space of distance.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.930
That's where DFT is.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.840
That's why it's so powerful.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.660
Any questions?

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.425
And right, I'm not
going to review.

00:21:50.425 --> 00:21:51.800
I just kind of
went through this.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.110
The approximation is to
work with the density,

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.920
and you sort of throw everything
into a density formalism,

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.630
and you punt on the exchange--
on this interaction term that's

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.440
all about this V. So density
functional theory is about what

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.000
functional you use to capture
these many-body effects

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.670
in a single-particle way.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.600
That's really what
it comes down to.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.710
And this is all sort
of review, right?

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.880
I kind of went through this.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.580
You will not be
tested on this math,

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.663
but I think you went through
it already last week.

00:22:29.663 --> 00:22:30.610
Correct?

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.870
Some nods.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:32.920
OK.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:42.120
And so you get
basically an equation

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.450
where the potential
that I just showed you

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:53.550
can be written as this potential
plus this exchange correlation

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:58.200
functional, which is basically
a function only of this one

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.100
electron.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.520
That's why it works so well.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:06.195
It's not a function anymore
of all these other electrons.

00:23:06.195 --> 00:23:08.670
I kind of want to make
sure we get the key points.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.170
Now the way you solve
this in a computer, which

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:20.220
is what the nanoHUB does
for you when it works--

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.684
I had some interesting crashes
last night on the nanoHUB--

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.375
is basically you
have this equation.

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:30.000
So what density
functional theory does,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.690
you see, this is
the beauty of it.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.460
What does that look like to you?

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.870
I mean, that looks like
something that we did. ,

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.700
That's definitely
your Hamiltonian,

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.280
but this equation now--
remember the many-body,

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.460
multiparticle mess that
we just showed you?

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.740
Now we're back
from that to this.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.640
What does that look like,
it's reminiscent of,

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.780
and for which material?

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.140
It sort of looks back like
hydrogen almost, right?

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.410
That's not as simple as hydrogen
because V is now more complex,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.350
but it basically
turned the problem back

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.800
into a single-particle problem.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.500
So now that's the
equation we solve

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.200
once we go through the
density functional theory

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.930
approximation.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.210
And you have to
solve it in what's

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.300
called a self-consistent
way, which

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.910
is to say you have to start
with a guess for your density.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.880
You plug it into the
equation, and you get out

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.527
these wave functions.

00:24:32.527 --> 00:24:34.860
So you do get wave functions
in density function theory,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.870
but they're essentially just
a basis for the density.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.580
The conceptual framework is
to work with the density.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.280
So you start with the density.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.303
You plug it into here,
and you solve this.

00:24:46.303 --> 00:24:48.720
The computer solves this, and
it gets you a wave function.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.960
And then from that wave function
you can get a new density

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.670
because the density
is, after all, just

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.380
this sum over these
things squared.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.620
We know that because we
talked about how that's what

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.420
density is, electron density.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.930
So does everybody know
what I'm talking about?

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:08.690
Probability-- electron
density is where it is.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.750
It's a probability distribution.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.750
And so that you get from that.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.750
You put it back in here.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:20.055
You do it again, and
basically you stop when what?

00:25:20.055 --> 00:25:20.937
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:20.937 --> 00:25:22.770
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
When you're about right.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.390
I love that answer.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.430
Tell me more.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.210
When do you stop?

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.660
If it's a self-consistent
loop, I guess for this.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.660
I put it in here.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.360
I get a new set of these.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.670
They give me a new this, and
I put that back in there,

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:36.900
and I get a new set.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.120
When should I stop?

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.478
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah,
when it doesn't change,

00:25:42.478 --> 00:25:43.770
when the answer doesn't change.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.190
And so that's what this
is showing you here.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.790
Is it self-consistent means
it didn't change, basically.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.417
You did this loop,
and it didn't change.

00:25:53.417 --> 00:25:55.250
And that's what it'll
look like in the code.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.190
You'll see energies,
total energies

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.140
coming out of the
system, and they'll

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.707
be sort of converging
to a value.

00:26:01.707 --> 00:26:03.790
And then the code will
say, OK, it's close enough.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.760
Now the other key thing is
you have to write these phis.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.840
When you talk about a phi--

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.330
so this is the
Schrodinger equation.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:25.270
And then you write the psi in
terms of some set of orbitals.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.360
But to write an orbital--

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.840
I mean, if I want
to write anything--

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.940
if I want to write anything
on a computer-- that's

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.230
my electron density.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.520
It's my orbital.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.250
I need to represent it
mathematically somehow.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.520
The computer can't
just take that.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.860
So you need functions
to represent these,

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.530
and those are called
basis functions.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.240
So those basis
functions-- and you

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.580
can use different kinds
of basis functions.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.050
You can use Gaussians.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.120
You can just use--

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.570
if I want Gaussians, I would put
a nice one there and then maybe

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.530
some more ones here.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:01.813
Well, that wouldn't work.

00:27:01.813 --> 00:27:03.730
Anyway, you need a bunch
of Gaussians centered

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.770
in different places,
and you add them up,

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.070
and they'd give you that
function back, approximately.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.790
So we have to represent these
things with basis functions.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:17.860
You can use plane waves, which
are really good for solids.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.810
You can use plane waves
for atoms as well.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.370
They're nice.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.995
Plane waves are nice for solids
because they're periodic, which

00:27:23.995 --> 00:27:26.270
is what your wave function is.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.280
Gesundheit.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.060
Gesundheit.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.878
The double.

00:27:30.878 --> 00:27:32.920
You can use them for atoms
and molecules as well,

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.750
but you have to be a little
careful because a plane

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.150
wave goes through the whole
cell of the simulation,

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.330
but your molecule only
takes up a small part of it.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.830
So with plane waves,
you're actually

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.880
sort of wasting those functions.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.430
But if you do it in a
smart way, it's not so bad.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.410
All right, so that's sort of--

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.180
I wanted to kind
of touch on that.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.440
This is a really cool
movie that Lynn found.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.500
Why do we care?

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.080
Well, this is the
kind of thing you

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.760
can do when you know
where these electrons are

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.760
for complex systems.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.040
This is a porphyrin ring.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.300
I think it's got zinc in the
center from this group here.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.108
And you can actually show--

00:28:16.108 --> 00:28:17.900
this is a computation,
and you can actually

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.850
show what happens
to the electrons--

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.550
the density of electrons
when you shine lasers on it.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.042
Now it turns out that
this is-- and there it is.

00:28:25.042 --> 00:28:26.750
So now you're going
to push on the system

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:30.020
with lasers, which
cause a resonance,

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.790
and it causes these
electrons to start

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:35.780
sloshing back and forth
as you pump this porphyrin

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.620
ring with lasers.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.350
So you can see the
lasers down here.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.550
They're not actually real.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.020
It's a computation.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.428
But what you see
is very important.

00:28:45.428 --> 00:28:46.220
Look at that slosh.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:46.880
Look at that.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.220
Now that is really important.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.600
The sloshing of those electrons
is really, really important

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.610
for how this molecule
absorbs light,

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.690
and that's why it was studied
because this is what we're

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:05.190
going to end with today is where
those electrons are determines

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.380
the band gap of the
molecule, and it determines

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.900
its optical properties,
what we talked

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.970
about in the very beginning,
something we really

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.830
need when we're talking
about photoactive materials

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:17.760
like porphyrin.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.270
And porphyrin has many
important properties, right?

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.880
It's a beautiful molecule.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.630
These are the kinds
of molecules and these

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.910
are the kinds of
things you can get now

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.740
using these approximations.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.000
You can get electron densities
and then correlate those

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.490
to something really important.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.810
And that's what we're going
to do by the end of today

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.150
and in our homeworks
for solar thermal fuels.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:46.160
Do you guys want me to post
these videos on Steller?

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.870
Do you guys look at
the Stellar stuff?

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.370
OK, I'll definitely
do that then.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.230
I wasn't sure if anybody--

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.730
OK.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.490
So any questions?

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.657
So that was sort of a little
review of where we are.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.860
Let's do a calculation.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.800
Actually, before we move
on, let's just do a calc--

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.490
now that's a little
embarrassing.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.710
Let's put that over here.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.680
That was taken a few years ago.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.360
Now there's MIT.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.980
Oh yeah.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.526
It was out in Berkeley, yeah.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:22.290
Now let's see if this works.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:22.790
Aha!

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.030
Now the two tools that
matter for quantum mechanics

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.700
in this toolset are quantum
chemistry-- and this

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.810
is doing just what I said.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.893
It's doing what those
quantum chemists like to do.

00:30:34.893 --> 00:30:37.010
It's messing with
the wave function.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.260
And this is the density
functional theory code

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.490
we're going to use SIESTA,
which is a cool name.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.873
And this is actually
messing with the density.

00:30:45.873 --> 00:30:47.290
This is density
functional theory.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.180
Although this now, like I
said, the two communities

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:49.990
have overlapped.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:53.545
This code now can also do
density functional theory.

00:30:53.545 --> 00:30:55.420
But these are the two
quantum-mechanics codes

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.570
we're going to use.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.390
And if you go-- let's
say you go to here.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.660
I just want to just do one
little calculation together.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.900
And what I want to
do is the following.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.340
There's some inputs
here that are

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.960
worth-- oh, you're kidding me.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.605
I can't scroll.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.840
Unbelievable.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:26.930
Well, that's really frustrating.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.160
So there's no way-- it
doesn't let me actually

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.450
scroll down here.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.680
Oh, there.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.640
Thank you.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.190
OK, I'm good.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.297
So here you see it's got water,
and there are some things

00:31:40.297 --> 00:31:41.380
you can do-- that's right.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.080
So the cursor has to
actually be over there.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.410
And here are some inputs.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.960
So we'll work with water.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.520
That's the basis set.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.590
Low means like what?

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.540
Do you think that's good or bad?

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.220
Yeah, it's not very good.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.220
Medium and high, those
are the three options.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.500
Now G means Gaussians.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.800
The other person who won the
Nobel Prize together with Kohn

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.140
that year was Pople,
and Pople won it

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.330
for some really
important work that he

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.730
did relating to these
basis sets, basically,

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.580
and some important
chemistry work he'd done.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.300
But that G stands for
Gaussian, and the 3-21G

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.260
is a set that he
made which became

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.020
incredibly important to helping
quantum chemistry move forward.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.080
He made sets of basis sets.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.560
And if you google
"basis set order form,"

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.750
there's a website where
you can enter any element,

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:42.620
and there are hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of basis

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.610
sets that have been
developed and published,

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:47.092
and these are some of them.

00:32:47.092 --> 00:32:48.550
And this is just--
you go from here

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.450
to the next and the next one.

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.320
You just add more
functions, basically,

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.650
and so the calculation
gets longer.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.870
When is it enough?

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.580
When do I have enough
of a basis set?

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.330
That was one question
I wanted to discuss.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.740
10?

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.990
Oh, I love that answer.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.790
I thought 10 was
pretty good too.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.410
It depends.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.700
That's the answer.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.820
Now what does it depend on?

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.820
AUDIENCE: What kind of
calculation you're doing.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:21.420
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: And?

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.290
AUDIENCE: How accurate you
want the results to be.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.850
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: How accurate
you want your results to be,

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.410
what calculation you're doing.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.897
What do you mean by what
calculation you're doing?

00:33:27.897 --> 00:33:29.272
AUDIENCE: If you
just want energy

00:33:29.272 --> 00:33:31.860
or whether you want to get
properties [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.690
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
OK, so the property.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.010
It depends on the property
you're calculating.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.850
How do you know when to stop?

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:42.410
So I'm going to do a
calculation with 3-21G,

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:47.520
and I'm going to calculate
the water molecule using

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.870
the formalism you just saw.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.448
That's what this code is doing.

00:33:50.448 --> 00:33:52.740
And you're going to see a
nice pretty picture of water.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.970
There it is.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.160
And then you have
these key outputs.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.050
And there's my total energy.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.360
My total energy of
this water molecule

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.860
is 2,056.56 electronvolts.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.465
Yes?

00:34:06.465 --> 00:34:08.110
AUDIENCE: What's a basis set?

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.152
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:34:09.152 --> 00:34:12.429
So a basis set is
those functions

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:17.480
that the computer needs to
represent the wave functions.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.440
So if this is your
wave function--

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.440
if your wave function
looks like this--

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.520
let's say this is phi versus r.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.120
By the way, does anybody know
which wave function this is?

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.239
That is a wave function.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.739
I didn't just make it up.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:39.090
It belongs to an element.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.409
It's the 1s orbital of
hydrogen. You got it.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.900
That's the r dependence of
the 1s orbital of hydrogen.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.770
It looks like an exponential.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.370
So should I use an
exponential to represent

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.239
this in a computer?

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:58.900
You bet except
no, and the reason

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.340
is that those are
slow to calculate.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.590
Exponentials are kind of
slow, exponential functions.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.230
So early on
exponentials were used,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.230
and then it was realized
that you could actually

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:18.550
represent this pretty darn
well with Gaussians, like three

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.930
or four Gaussians, and
you'd kind of get it right.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.330
You'd never get this part here.

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.300
You can't get a finite slope
at zero with Gaussians,

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.820
but you can come so close
that it doesn't matter.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.555
And so because Gaussians
have advantages--

00:35:30.555 --> 00:35:31.930
we won't go into
details, but I'm

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.440
happy to talk to
anybody who wants.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.870
Gaussians have
advantages in terms

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:37.470
of computing
integrals on computers

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:41.850
so that you can actually use
some of the formalism that's

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.160
been developed to do
integration with Gaussians

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.800
and do it very quickly
and efficiently.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.000
You cannot do it
with exponentials.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.600
And because of that,
the chemists early on

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.790
started using Gaussians
for their basic sets,

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.820
and all these Pople sets,
those are all Gaussians.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.500
Now when you use
plane waves, that's

00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.760
a different kind of function.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.750
That's a sine and
cosine function.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:06.660
And so there you're
using functions like this

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.270
to reproduce your psi.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.920
Either way, what
you're doing is you're

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.330
going to add a
bunch of functions

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.600
together to try to
make up your psi,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.845
and you've got to have
enough to do it justice.

00:36:17.845 --> 00:36:19.470
And that was the
question is how do you

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.637
know when you've had enough?

00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:24.840
It's a very important part and
problem in quantum mechanics--

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.400
in computing with
quantum mechanics

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.060
that doesn't exist in
classical potentials, right?

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.970
See, classical potentials, this
is not a convergence problem.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.920
You don't converge
your basis set.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.460
You just have a potential,
and you calculate it.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.340
Here you have to represent
psi mathematically somehow.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.840
Here you're doing
it with Gaussians.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.570
With SIESTA, actually
it's not plane waves.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:51.670
It's a different kind of
function like Gaussians.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.900
But in a way, it doesn't matter.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.053
They should all converge
to the same answer, right?

00:36:57.053 --> 00:36:58.720
You just have to
understand that this is

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.230
what's going on under the hood.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.110
So again I ask,
when is it enough?

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.228
When do I have enough
basis functions?

00:37:08.448 --> 00:37:10.990
AUDIENCE: When you approximate
your wave function well enough

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.100
with your basis set.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.433
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: And how
do I know if I've done that?

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.700
AUDIENCE: When you check
for self-consistency.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.050
Is that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:25.090
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: That's
within a single calculation.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:28.920
How do I know I've used
a good-enough basis set?

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.270
Well, let's go back.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:32.570
Let's go back a second
to what Sam said.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:34.530
It depends on the property.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.290
So now I'm going to
tell you a property.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:41.700
I want to know the binding
energy of a water molecule.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.247
How can I calculate that?

00:37:44.247 --> 00:37:45.830
Somebody tell me how
I calculate that.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.535
I have the energy of
the water molecule.

00:37:47.535 --> 00:37:48.660
Is that the binding energy?

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.705
Yeah?

00:37:49.705 --> 00:37:51.580
AUDIENCE: The atoms that
are really far away,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.286
and then you
calculate the energy.

00:37:52.286 --> 00:37:54.273
And then if they
have energy with them

00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:56.690
close together minus the far
away, that will [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:57.857
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:37:57.857 --> 00:38:02.720
So the energy-- so the
binding energy, E bind,

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:08.247
is equal to the energy of the
molecule minus the energy sum

00:38:08.247 --> 00:38:09.455
over the energy of the atoms.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.030
So that's the property
I want to calculate.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.740
It could have been
another property.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.060
Could have been-- let's
say this is the gap.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.560
Yeah, it could have been the
electronic gap of the material.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.038
Now how do I know if I've
used enough basis functions?

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:28.080
This is really important.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.783
Yeah?

00:38:29.783 --> 00:38:30.950
AUDIENCE: Experimental data.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.158
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: OK, good.

00:38:32.158 --> 00:38:33.920
See if it matches
experimental data.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.110
Except there may
be other reasons

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:43.530
it doesn't match experimental
data, not just the basis set.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.780
So how do I know if I've
just converged the basis set?

00:38:54.418 --> 00:38:56.210
AUDIENCE: Get the
lattice parameters of it.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.150
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
OK or along those

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.020
lines, but that's still
comparing with experiment,

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:06.740
which is always a good
thing to do when you can.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.480
Well, what if I just
do this calculation

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.610
and then I do another one
with a higher basis set

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.210
and it doesn't change?

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.000
How about that?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.860
Well, it's the same as
the self-consistent thing.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:22.060
Once the answer doesn't
change, I've converged.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.192
But this isn't part of a
single calculation now.

00:39:24.192 --> 00:39:25.900
This is part of more
than one calculation

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.733
that you have to do.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.010
So I'm going to go to a
larger basis set like medium

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.500
and do simulate.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.330
And then it's going
to calculate this,

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:38.560
and let's see what happened.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.540
The gap-- OK, there it is again.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.910
Thank you.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:43.810
The gap went to 19.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:44.550
Oh boy.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.160
So now my key output--

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:52.190
let's see, is
2,068.6 electrons--

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.220
electronvolts-- is the
energy with this basis set.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.490
Everything else is the same.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.770
And with the first basis set,
it's 2,056 electronvolts.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.170
Am I converged?

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.240
Trick question.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.550
You still don't know.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.730
Well, except there's
something else to it

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.200
that I'm trying to
get out of you guys.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.560
It's not an easy-- it's
not an easy thing to see,

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.990
but it's really
important because we're

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.210
talking about something
called convergence

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.920
that you don't really have in
your classical force fields.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.560
You just have a
classical force field,

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.500
and then you have another
one or another one, right?

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.140
But here we're converging
within one calculation,

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.520
one level of theory.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.940
And so what counts--

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.350
you have to do this
when you do simulations.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:43.620
But what counts here is
not the total energy.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.120
Why?

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.760
Because that's not the thing
I'm trying to converge.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.310
I'm trying to
converge this I said,

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:53.340
the binding energy, which
is a difference of energies.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:58.700
And it very well may be that
the binding energy converges

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.580
with a really bad
basis set right away

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.987
and doesn't change when I get my
next basis set or my next one.

00:41:05.987 --> 00:41:07.820
Even though the total
energies are changing,

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.040
they're changing in such a
way that the error cancels

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.600
completely.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.430
This is the thing.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.680
It depends-- that's
why I love it depends.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.440
It depends is such
a great answer--

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.950
on the property
you're simulating,

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:25.650
and you have to do convergence
for the property you

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.220
care about.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.600
It could have been the gap.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:33.600
20.7 was the low basis, and
the higher basis is 19.7.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.200
That's a whole EV difference
in the electronic gap.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.700
That's a lot of difference.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.020
That doesn't sound very good.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.353
Maybe we should go to-- let's
say we care about the gap.

00:41:42.353 --> 00:41:44.120
Let's go to one higher.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.810
Use a higher basis set.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:51.590
And we see here now the
gap, oh, it changed again.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:52.410
Uh oh.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.390
And so now it went to 18.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:02.060
So we had, with the
highest basis set,

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:07.590
18, with the medium one, 19,
and with the lowest one, 20.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.273
So you can see it's
actually going down,

00:42:09.273 --> 00:42:10.940
which means the right
answer is probably

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.108
going to be even lower.

00:42:13.108 --> 00:42:14.150
Does that look converged?

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.080
Not to me.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.140
You actually need a
higher basis set still.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.547
This tool won't allow it because
it's not a very flexible tool,

00:42:21.547 --> 00:42:22.130
but that's OK.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.690
That's not the point.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.250
So does everybody
understand what

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:26.990
I'm talking about when
I say convergence?

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.300
We will come back
to convergence again

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.330
when we do solids because
there's another thing in solids

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.990
you have to converge, not just
your basis set but something

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:37.850
else, which we'll
come back to and I'm

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:43.150
going to save it as a surprise,
very exciting surprise.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:47.770
So we know that it can calculate
the binding energy of water.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.470
There's one more question I
want to ask you about, this spin

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.850
thing here.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:56.030
Default-- default means
that it took a guess.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.700
And you can see that the
guess it made for water

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.620
is that it's a spin singlet.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.990
Now we talked about
this in lecture two.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:07.390
Does everybody know what
a spin singlet means?

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.050
So we're talking about
electrons filling orbitals.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:13.510
Remember, we're solving
for those electrons,

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.730
and they fill
orbitals like this.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:22.250
Remember Pauli exclusion
and all that and filling--

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.820
OK?

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:27.290
Now if I-- this is the last
question I want to ask.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:30.230
Then we'll go back
to the lecture.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.300
Oxygen is 1s.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.962
Somebody tell me what else is
in oxygen. How many electrons?

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.150
Three?

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.320
Eight.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.715
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:43:46.715 --> 00:43:47.600
Right?

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.200
Good.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.260
Very good.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:54.020
Now, is that a spin singlet?

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.290
Does everybody remember what
singlet, doublet, triplet--

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.380
so singlet, triplet,
doublet is very important

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.810
because it tells the computer
how these electrons are

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.550
filling these orbitals.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.350
So that's another
really important part

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.340
of these simulations.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.300
A singlet means that
overall you have

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.460
the same number of
spins pointing up

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.410
as spins pointing down.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.230
Is that what I have for oxygen?

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.230
Uh uh.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:31.470
So a doublet is when I have
one more pointing up or down,

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:35.880
and a triplet is when I have
two extra electrons pointing

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.140
up or down.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.030
Doesn't matter.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:45.580
So this is actually-- the
oxygen atom is a triplet.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.620
Now what about water?

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.640
Well, it turns out
water is a singlet.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.620
So the default
guessed it correctly.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.530
Let's do the oxygen atom.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.270
Well, the code will do
whatever spin state you say.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:06.505
I'm going to say now that I just
want oxygen. So there it is.

00:45:06.505 --> 00:45:08.130
I'm going to do it
with the same basis.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.780
And now here it
is, and oh, that's

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:21.880
a beautiful picture of oxygen.
And now you go to key outputs,

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.990
and there's the energy.

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:26.390
OK, so I'm going to do my
calculation of this binding

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.890
energy.

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.470
I just calculated the
energy of the atom.

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.380
Can I use that?

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.740
What's wrong with that?

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.410
Look at the top line.

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:41.670
No, second from the top line.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.380
What did it do?

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.140
It did a singlet.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.180
Uh oh.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.230
It did this.

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:48.970
It defaulted incorrectly.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:52.400
Never trust tools.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.650
Always know what you're doing.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:54.370
That's my point.

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:57.128
And these are the key
things you need to know.

00:45:57.128 --> 00:45:58.920
You need to know that
the basis, and you've

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.320
got to know about spin.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.050
You've got to know how those
electrons filled their levels.

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:09.280
And what this calculation
did is it did this.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.210
Did it get an answer?

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.260
Sure.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:13.350
Is it oxygen?

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:14.100
Well, yes.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.000
in some very strange,
excited state of oxygen. But

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.530
that's not the right
state of oxygen.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:23.190
And, in fact, you can
tell because remember

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.800
this energy, 2,032.1?

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.530
And now let's give it
the right spin state.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.530
Let's make it a triplet,
which we know oxygen is,

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:35.520
and let's see what
the energy is.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.660
OK, go away.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.220
I know you're there.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.240
Yes, that's the oxygen atom.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.980
And now when I use the right
spin state, it's 2,035.6.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.170
Do you see how much
lower the energy went?

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:54.720
Because, see, the right oxygen
is the way oxygen wants to be.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.980
It's the ground
state of that atom.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:02.300
If I compare it with
this excited state,

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.990
it's three electronvolts
higher in energy.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.660
The more negative,
the more stable,

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:12.810
the more energy that has, the
more happy those electrons are.

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.895
So that means that the
electrons and oxygen really

00:47:14.895 --> 00:47:16.770
want to be in a triplet
state, and you better

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:20.250
use that energy to do
things like calculate

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.360
the binding energy.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.870
So you've got to think
about the spin state.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.370
So that was the
other thing I wanted

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:28.965
to mention in doing this,
spin state and basis sets.

00:47:28.965 --> 00:47:30.280
Any questions?

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.090
No questions?

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:40.425
In the last half hour or
so, I want to get to--

00:47:40.425 --> 00:47:43.110
oh, 35 minutes even--

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:44.790
I want to get to this
first application

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.470
that I'm really excited about.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.512
And I think you're kind
of now in a place where

00:47:48.512 --> 00:47:50.220
we can actually think
about these-- think

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:55.260
about applications
for molecules.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.490
And that's an area--

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:59.400
I want to introduce solar
chemical fuels to you,

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.610
and then we're going to talk
about why this kind of modeling

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:05.380
is so important here
and what we can do.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.640
And then you'll have a
homework related to this.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.560
OK, I love this.

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.840
I love that materials
are going to determine--

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.600
and then here we are down here.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.590
I love this too.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.480
I think I've shown
this to you, right,

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.550
but it never hurts
to show this again

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:23.730
because it's a cool picture,
and this is where we live.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.020
We're past silicon, man.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:25.680
That's old.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.240
Never better against silicon.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:27.990
Never.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:29.910
It's still a really
important material.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.640
But on the left, plastics.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.640
Oh, what's that?

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.970
That is, I think, a
nanotube or a-- it's

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.820
either a nanotube or some
other sort of 2D material

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:48.930
wrapped up into like a gear that
I think has never been made.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.770
Maybe it's not a good
picture, but it looked good,

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:57.270
and I grabbed it in five
seconds from Google.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:01.440
Anyway, I'm going to skip this.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.240
I'll talk about this later.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.210
Solar, we get a
lot of it, right?

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.380
You guys have seen this.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.270
How many of you have seen this?

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:12.340
There's a whole lot of solar.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.240
So this is a cool comparison.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:14.740
Look.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.150
It beats coal.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.800
I mean, forget
about like we know

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.330
the resource of
solar beats things

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:23.510
like tidal and tides,
waves, geothermal, hydro,

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.490
all the other
renewables combined.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.130
But it beats coal.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.240
That's pretty cool.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:35.620
Well, biomass would be if
you take all the arable land.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.620
You've got to remember,
these numbers-- and this

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.030
is the author of this
fairly recent study.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:45.032
But those numbers have many
assumptions go into them,

00:49:45.032 --> 00:49:46.740
and so there's a lot
of debate about what

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.760
the right numbers are.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.640
To within a factor
of 2 to 10, these

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.920
are probably the right numbers.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.430
But biomass, if you
take the arable land

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:59.670
where you're not going to
cause a huge famine in the area

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:02.640
and you kind of add
that up, you try

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.680
to consider water
resources and other things.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.330
You can actually
compute using, say,

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.920
some crop or set of crops--

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.760
sugarcane, maybe other things,
switchgrass-- how much energy

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.790
could you generate in a year?

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:16.780
And that's about it.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.120
I think-- and I don't remember.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.790
There was a number with
biomass that was 11

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:22.380
that I saw for a
while in the study,

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.190
but that was if you literally
stop growing food for people

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:30.600
and you just take all land that
can be used to grow anything

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.885
and you make fuel, and you're
still at considerably less

00:50:34.885 --> 00:50:35.760
than other resources.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.210
I'm not saying biofuels isn't
a really important direction.

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:42.150
But I kind of like
these comparisons.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.800
There we are.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.230
We use not much compared to
how much we have in the sun.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:50.110
These are the different
ways you can use the sun.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:52.030
And I want to talk
about this one now.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:53.690
So I think you know about this.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.818
You take the sun, and
you make a lot of heat.

00:50:57.818 --> 00:50:59.360
I'm going to actually
start with this

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.890
because it's related to this.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:02.810
Here we take sun and
we make electrons.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:06.470
That's going to be our next
homework-assignment example

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:09.920
that we'll talk about when we
do solids because from the band

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.470
structure of a solid--
and the band structure

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:16.640
is nothing more than
this for solids.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.350
From the band
structure of a solid,

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:21.440
I can explain to you-- you
can explain to your friends

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.038
why silicon is so expensive--
why silicon is too expensive.

00:51:26.038 --> 00:51:27.830
And then you can also
take the sun's energy

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:30.510
and just try to make
fuels directly out of it.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.000
So what are solar thermal fuels?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.833
Well, like I said, I
want to start with heat

00:51:33.833 --> 00:51:34.565
because heat is--

00:51:34.565 --> 00:51:37.370
and this will be a fairly
quick introduction.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:39.680
But heat is something--
it's one of the oldest

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.952
technologies we know about in
terms of how to use the sun.

00:51:42.952 --> 00:51:43.910
Paint the barrel black.

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:44.930
Put it on the roof.

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:45.650
Put water in it.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:47.370
It gets hot.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.290
It's a really simple technology.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:53.380
It works really well, and
it's used all over the world.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.810
You can also, if you want
higher temperatures because you

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:59.140
want to make electricity, you
can go to large-scale plants

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.750
because there you need
large scale because you

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.990
need to focus the sun's energy
to get much higher temperatures

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:07.990
like, say, 500 Celsius to
drive some sort of cycle

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:09.490
like a Stirling
engine or something.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:11.380
If you do that, you
can make electricity.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:15.550
Those are concentrated
solar power plants.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:16.550
Here's the distribution.

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:18.050
That is actually
interesting, right?

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:21.260
This is how much-- there's
sort of capacity and produced.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.290
But you can see that using
solar thermal as heat

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.720
is actually the
second-most-utilized renewable

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.920
resource in the world.

00:52:32.353 --> 00:52:33.770
But that's the
painting the barrel

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.790
black and putting
it on your rooftop.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.890
That's not making electricity.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:41.270
So in the world this is actually
a very heavily used alternative

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.930
energy.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.330
That is almost completely
unused in this country.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:47.550
I think in terms of countries
that use the sun in this way,

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.362
we're like number 17.

00:52:50.362 --> 00:52:52.820
There are some places that are
trying to make power with it

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:53.600
but very few.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.640
It's a hard thing to do.

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.000
I think 15 of the 20 existing
CSP plants are in Spain.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.455
The Spanish love this.

00:53:00.455 --> 00:53:02.330
But you can just sort
of see where it stands.

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:06.530
Anyway, the point is there are
challenges with using the sun's

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.870
energy in the form of heat.

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.840
One of them is that you lose
the energy, reradiation.

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.090
As soon as you absorb heat,
it starts going out way,

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:17.052
so you've got to contain it.

00:53:17.052 --> 00:53:18.260
And it's still going to leak.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.720
So in some of these
plants, you actually

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.480
pump in
fossil-fuel-based energy.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.720
So you use the sun to
concentrate on, say,

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.800
a molten salt in a tower, so
a phase change of material.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.410
You get it up to really high
energy over the phase change.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.420
You all took 3012.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.980
Know many of you
did, so you know

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.522
about when I say
phase change, you're

00:53:38.522 --> 00:53:41.660
going up this heat,
this latent heat,

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:44.210
and you're storing a
bunch of energy that way.

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.490
And then you want
to keep it up there.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:48.373
So you actually pump
in fossil-fuel energy

00:53:48.373 --> 00:53:50.540
because it's reradiating
heat out and losing energy,

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.207
and you don't want
it to slip back down.

00:53:52.207 --> 00:53:53.780
That's not a good thing.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.540
And really importantly is
this is not transportable.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:01.070
So you can't use heat from the
sun except where you make it.

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.795
So that's where solar
chemical comes in.

00:54:02.795 --> 00:54:04.170
Oh, there's that--
we're number--

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.460
well, we're after Macedonia.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:12.500
Anyway, Albania.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.000
We don't use solar
thermal this way,

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.125
and I don't understand why.

00:54:15.125 --> 00:54:17.270
It's a very inexpensive
renewable resource.

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:24.130
Solar chemical-- so in
solar chemical, what you do

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.710
is you take a molecule-- in
this case, it's azobenzene.

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:31.300
And you shine a light on it, and
it goes into a different state.

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.270
Now the important thing is
that-- so that's the charging.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:35.260
Charge it by the sun.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.080
In this different state,
it's storing energy,

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.220
and that can be released.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.200
It can be released
in the form of heat.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:45.190
So you've got a
way of closed-cycle

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:47.620
capturing and storing
the sun's energy,

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.870
triggering this state
to release that energy

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:50.920
in the form of heat.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.540
It's transportable.

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.600
It can be stored for
as long as you want.

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.440
It's renewable.

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.320
It's cheap, and
it's a closed cycle.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.960
That's the dream.

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:06.100
Now this was very heavily
studied 30, 40 years ago.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.250
And the reason as a
field it was abandoned

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:10.500
is because for
all the cases that

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.930
were studied in the 1970s
that do this closed loop,

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.670
they degrade.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.110
So you get this cycle.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.600
You charge up your
fuel from the sun.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.580
You use it as heat somewhere.

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:23.360
You bring it back.

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.140
You charge it again.

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:24.848
You use it again.

00:55:24.848 --> 00:55:29.452
And after 10 cycles, half
of your fuel is toluene.

00:55:29.452 --> 00:55:30.160
That's a problem.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.246
Some thoughts on that?

00:55:34.246 --> 00:55:36.068
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:36.068 --> 00:55:37.110
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:37.943
That was a good one.

00:55:37.943 --> 00:55:40.860
It was actually well timed.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:45.615
And I like that
kind of feedback.

00:55:45.615 --> 00:55:47.610
The papers of the times
were saying things

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.315
like an energy-storage plant,
although technically feasible,

00:55:51.315 --> 00:55:53.190
is not economically
justified because there's

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.990
an upfront cost for this fuel.

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:58.140
And if it doesn't cycle, if
it just degrades in 10 cycles,

00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.580
you can't justify the cost.

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.970
So there's a lot
of work on this,

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:03.690
and those are the
degradation products.

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:06.480
I won't go into it, but
I'll leave it in your notes.

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.860
A lot of work was done.

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.470
Many papers were written,
and a lot of experiments

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.160
were done to fix this problem,
but no magic bullet was found.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.220
So they would substitute
things into molecules.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.260
They'd put metal atoms
into the molecules.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.980
They'd do what are called
push-pull substitutions.

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.980
And no matter what they
did to these things,

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:29.010
if they made them
more cyclical, like 10

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.020
to the third cycles,
which isn't bad,

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:34.620
then they'd be terrible
in their energy density.

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.050
If they made them really
high energy density,

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:40.220
then maybe they were really
bad at absorbing sunlight.

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:44.390
So no matter what they did,
they couldn't fix this problem.

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:48.020
And this is where it's
just such a great time

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.420
to tackle it again.

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.690
The reason is that
if you wanted to do

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:59.360
100,000 calculations of
solids when this material was

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.520
being studied heavily--

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.430
if you wanted to screen
100,000 materials,

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:08.030
it would take you 30
years in 1980 to do that,

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:10.530
and today it takes a few days.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.310
Not on the nanoHUB necessarily--

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:15.710
maybe they're back to 30 years.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.063
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:17.063 --> 00:57:18.980
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
Depends where you compute.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.210
But we're just a
whole generation

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.670
later in what we can tackle
with computational quantum

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:26.480
mechanics.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.938
Now I'm going to
end by telling you

00:57:27.938 --> 00:57:30.170
why you need quantum mechanics.

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:32.570
So this is a really cool
time to work on this problem,

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:34.400
and this wasn't
available back then when

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.030
it was such a big deal.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:38.450
And then, of course,
there's the sort

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:41.990
of advances we've made on
the synthesis side, which

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:45.770
I won't talk about because
this is a class on computation.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:47.780
So what we've done--

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.130
and this is research
that we're doing--

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:54.890
is we've shown that there
are new ways-- we've

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:57.890
shown computationally
that there are new ways

00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:59.760
to tackle the problem.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.140
We've shown that you
can take a molecule that

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.535
does this switch--

00:58:05.535 --> 00:58:07.155
there are many
molecules that do this.

00:58:07.155 --> 00:58:09.030
How many of you have
heard of photo switches?

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:15.780
What have you heard of
them being used for?

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:19.980
Have you heard of them
being used for anything?

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:23.247
Well, they have been studied
a lot but in what fields?

00:58:23.247 --> 00:58:25.080
You have a molecule
that you shine light on,

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.300
and it goes like this.

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.800
And then you shine
a different light

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.955
on it or you just take the light
off maybe, and it goes back--

00:58:31.955 --> 00:58:32.580
photo switches.

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:36.910
Where might that be useful?

00:58:39.878 --> 00:58:42.003
AUDIENCE: It kind of reminds
me of like LCD screens

00:58:42.003 --> 00:58:42.940
but it's a bit different.

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.982
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:58:43.982 --> 00:58:45.820
Well, actually
mechanical computing

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.600
is a big deal or
nanomechanical memory,

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.692
optomechanical functions.

00:58:53.692 --> 00:58:55.150
There are actually
many areas where

00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:56.890
these sorts of
switching molecules

00:58:56.890 --> 00:59:01.330
like stilbene and
azobenzene and stuff

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:04.240
that the name is so long
I can't write it here--

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.160
spiropyran-- these
are very heavily

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.070
studied, these optically
activated switching, big deal.

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:12.160
But they're all terrible
solar thermal fuels.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.153
They're terrible.

00:59:13.153 --> 00:59:15.070
They don't store much
energy, and they go back

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:16.960
in a few minutes.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.860
So what we've realized is that
you can actually turn them

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.710
into good ones, and the
way you do that is you

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:25.030
put them on a template.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:28.540
So you take a molecule
that's one of these switches.

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.430
There are many switches.

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:32.010
You stick it on a
template, and what

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:33.760
happens is when you
stick it on a template

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.180
you have new chemistry
that you can do,

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.440
and that's really the key.

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:42.070
Now we're going to come back
to you in a few minutes is

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:44.320
this picture, so I wanted
to just tell you what it is.

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.470
This is what the molecule does.

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:48.000
This is a reaction pathway.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.790
This is the energy
curve for the molecule.

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:52.740
So it's down here.

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:56.890
You shine light on it, and
it goes up over this barrier,

00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:59.680
and it drops you down
here into a new state.

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.270
In this case, it's azobenzene.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:05.740
It's going from trans to cis.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.260
How many of you have heard
of trans/cis, trans and cis

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.070
isomers?

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:11.590
So you know about
photo switches then.

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:17.280
Not all trans/cis states are
photo accessible, but many are.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.330
That's all this is doing.

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:20.130
And then when you want
to release the heat,

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:21.180
you trigger it.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.210
And it goes over this barrier,
like say with a catalyst,

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:25.840
and it releases
this much energy.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.890
So that's your storage energy.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.240
That's how much energy
that molecule stored.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.840
And this back-reaction barrier's
related to the lifetime

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.550
of the stored state.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.040
We're going to
come back to this.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.320
So these are-- what we
did is some work that

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.340
showed that you can put
these onto nanotubes

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.048
and you can make them
into good switches,

01:00:45.048 --> 01:00:47.470
and I'm not going to
go into the details.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:52.400
But basically you see
this is the advantage

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.940
of computational
quantum mechanics

01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:00.450
today is that we
can do chemistry

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:03.990
in the computer on these
switches and screen

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:07.930
hundreds of ideas in a week.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:11.760
And we can calculate the things
like how much energy they store

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.040
or how stable they
are in a matter

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.400
of an hour on a computer.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.190
So this is the
perfect time to try

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:22.710
to tackle old problems like
this that weren't solved

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:25.950
a generation ago
but that you can

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:28.080
play with them with many
different directions

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.973
computationally.

01:01:29.973 --> 01:01:31.140
And this is just an example.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.000
And don't worry
about the details,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.740
but this was that photo switch.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.590
This is how much energy is
stored on its own, this line up

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:38.610
here.

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:41.850
And now we can tweak it by
putting it on this template

01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:43.260
and doing different chemistries.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.550
We can make it store three
times as much energy.

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:50.250
So we can triple the storage
energy of these molecules

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.700
just by playing with the
chemistry when you put them

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.690
on a rigid template.

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:56.130
That's the idea.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:02:00.000
At the same time, we can
tune the barrier back,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.950
and we can have
cases like this one

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.570
where you triple
the storage density

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:06.120
and you increase the
barrier to going back.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.040
And that's really
important because you

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.998
want to be able to tune
those things separately

01:02:09.998 --> 01:02:13.045
because the back barrier is
related to how long it stays

01:02:13.045 --> 01:02:13.920
in the charged state.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.730
So that's the key, and so
we've developed materials

01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:24.045
like this that are very
competitive with the best

01:02:24.045 --> 01:02:26.420
lithium-ion batteries in terms
of their energy densities.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.955
Any questions about these?

01:02:31.955 --> 01:02:33.580
I'm kind of going
through this quickly,

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.362
but I don't want to
get bogged down by too

01:02:37.362 --> 01:02:38.195
much of the details.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.530
So there are many
template materials

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.210
that you can put these on.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:49.490
You have to use
a template or you

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:51.640
can't get this new chemistry.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.920
And there are many
switches that let you

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.245
go back and forth like this.

01:02:55.245 --> 01:02:56.620
And what we've
shown is that this

01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:00.910
is sort of a large phase space.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.860
And so they're sort of
a new chemistry platform

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.960
out here for making
these kinds of fuels.

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:18.510
When I went to the Sloan
class, Energy Ventures,

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:20.640
and talked about
this, my thought was--

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.595
this is last fall--

01:03:22.595 --> 01:03:23.970
I have this really
cool material.

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.772
It's going to save the world.

01:03:26.772 --> 01:03:28.230
We're going to
replace coal plants.

01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:30.210
We're going to make
electricity this way.

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:32.520
Everything's going to
be heated this way.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.460
And they did a study
on commercialization,

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.710
and they came back and
they said, no, you're

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.370
not going to do any of that.

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:42.420
What you're going to do is
you're going to deice windows.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.750
And at first I was
actually not happy

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:48.460
because I wanted to solve
the world's energy problems.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.460
They looked at all these
different applications.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.960
There's lots of
ways to use heat.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.400
If you can store
the sun's energy

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.470
and release it as heat on
demand, that's a big deal--

01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:59.720
and do it over and over again.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.040
There are many
places you can use.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040
But they said, no, this
is going to be the best.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.768
So actually we started
looking at that.

01:04:05.768 --> 01:04:07.310
Actually Sam started
looking at that,

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:09.390
and he built a whole
test apparatus.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:13.670
And Sam, with our solar
fields when they're made,

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:17.960
he'll be able to deice a window
for you in about five seconds,

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.180
and that's pretty cool.

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.120
So you can embed this
stuff inside of glass

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.310
and have it passively absorb
the sun's energy during the day.

01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:28.280
In the morning, trigger
it, and it gives you

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.580
300 Celsius inside the glass.

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.355
You don't need to melt much
ice to get it to fall off.

01:04:34.355 --> 01:04:35.720
So a lot of people--

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.640
and they talked
with MBTA and others

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.230
who would pay a
whole lot of money

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:41.605
to get something like that
because there's a lot of money

01:04:41.605 --> 01:04:42.510
wasted on deicing.

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:44.385
It actually turns out
to be very interesting.

01:04:44.385 --> 01:04:47.150
We also built a solar
cooker in collaboration

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:50.792
with the Slocum group,
and that basically

01:04:50.792 --> 01:04:52.250
lets you cook with
the sun's energy

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:54.920
when the sun's not out because,
again, you have this ability

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.050
to take the sun's
energy and release it

01:04:57.050 --> 01:05:01.260
as heat when you want it and
then recharge it the next day.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.445
So we're really
excited about this.

01:05:03.445 --> 01:05:04.820
Oh, and there's
our solar cooker.

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.320
I love this.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.980
I'm going to take the last
15 minutes to talk about what

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.250
we can do with what we can do.

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:18.250
But this is the last thing I'll
tell you about the solar fuels.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.560
I love this picture.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.020
So these kinds of
things are not good.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.300
This is a big deal.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:29.320
This causes more deaths in
the third world than malaria

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.440
and AIDS combined,
wood-fired stoves.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.490
Women primarily and sometimes
children spend 20 hours a week

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:38.020
searching for wood.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.240
20 hours a week
of their time goes

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.690
to getting wood for burning.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.380
This is the alternative if you
want to use the sun to cooking.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.890
And I love these because this
is a restaurant in India,

01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:58.480
and you can see these come with
specialized goggles and gloves.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.900
And you can see why because
he's inside the oven.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.450
He's getting burned
when he's cooking

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:07.040
because you can
focus on a point,

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.550
but you're not
going to be perfect.

01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:10.190
So there's a lot
of sun hitting him.

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:12.110
It's not a very
comfortable way to cook.

01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:14.870
But also you can only
cook when the sun's out.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:17.690
So solar cookers, I think, could
play a really big role if you

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:20.750
can get them low cost--
these are over $600--

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:23.270
and if you can get
them to be able to cook

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:25.300
when it's more convenient.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.237
OK, so I won't go
into those details.

01:06:28.237 --> 01:06:30.070
This is the kind of
thing we do in my group,

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.750
and I get so excited about it.

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.090
We design things in a computer.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.940
We make them, and
we build prototypes,

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.520
and it's sort of
a full loop here

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.010
to try to impact
interesting energy problems.

01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:45.830
Now this leaves me
on the last part,

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:48.970
which is what I want to
talk about in the last 10

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:50.240
minutes of class.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.670
Which is, OK, that's a
really cool energy problem.

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:56.907
You have to agree with that.

01:06:56.907 --> 01:06:58.490
OK, you don't have
to agree with that,

01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:00.990
but I think it's really
cool energy problem.

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:06.050
Where does computational
quantum mechanics fit into this?

01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:14.850
OK, so this is what it does.

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:17.190
The fuel goes from here to here.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:18.690
This is the reaction coordinate.

01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:20.940
It goes from a low-energy
state to a high-energy state

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.232
when you shine the light on it.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.960
Could I calculate-- now this
is how much energy it's stored,

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.327
which is related to the
density of the fuel, the energy

01:07:32.327 --> 01:07:33.160
density of the fuel.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.050
Remember, that's something
we had to kind of hike up

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.310
by a factor of three or four.

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:39.200
It's not really that good.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.330
Could I have done that
with classical potentials?

01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:43.610
Can I calculate this with
classical potentials?

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:44.240
What is this?

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.260
How do I calculate this?

01:07:56.950 --> 01:08:04.570
Here's my solar fuel, and
this is the trans state,

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:07.770
and this is the cis state.

01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:09.120
What is this difference?

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.870
How would I calculate
this energy difference?

01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:17.542
How would you do that
calculation in a computer?

01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:18.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:22.890
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: No, no,
no, this is calculationally.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:23.640
Is that a word?

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.380
Yeah.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.130
Go ahead.

01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:29.050
AUDIENCE: So they're
both sort of local minima

01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:29.800
of the potentials.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.842
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:08:30.842 --> 01:08:32.970
AUDIENCE: So you
could theoretically

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:36.920
run some DFT simulation on
your trans configuration

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:40.050
and run a DFT simulation
on your cis configuration

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:42.300
and then get out the sort
of ground-state energies

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.490
for the two and compare them.

01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:50.210
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
E cis minus E trans.

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.470
You bet.

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:52.189
That's it.

01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:53.569
That's all this is--

01:08:53.569 --> 01:08:55.170
equals delta H.

01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:57.410
Now tell me why you said DFT.

01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:02.479
Can't I use reacts or a
Lennard-Jones potential

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:03.380
to calculate that?

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.667
Why not?

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:11.250
AUDIENCE: The trans and cis may
have different types of bonds,

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:12.600
so [INAUDIBLE] electrons.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.975
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
What if I had

01:09:13.975 --> 01:09:15.690
a super-duper good potential?

01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:17.732
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] for
electrons [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:17.732 --> 01:09:19.357
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
But why do I need--

01:09:19.357 --> 01:09:19.859
but hang on.

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:21.942
I mean, that would be true
with all the first part

01:09:21.942 --> 01:09:22.859
of your class, right?

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:24.776
Everything you did in
the first part of class,

01:09:24.776 --> 01:09:27.760
like straining wires and stuff,
captured energy of bonds.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.560
Yeah?

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.319
AUDIENCE: You need to be given
the potential to use in order

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:34.229
to do a classical simulation.

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:36.029
So doing the quantum
simulation, you

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:39.880
just need to give the
configuration of atoms,

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.950
and then it--

01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:41.609
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
Which is nice.

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:42.370
AUDIENCE: --find
the energy for you.

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:44.412
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Which
is certainly very nice,

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:46.649
but let's say I tell you
that I'm giving you a really

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.420
super-duper, really,
really, really,

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.050
honestly really good potential.

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:55.280
And that's what it's
called in the literature.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.070
I put the word honest in it.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.776
Could I calculate this
with classical potentials?

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.880
It's a difference of energies
between two molecules.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.247
Can I calculate that with
a classical force field?

01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:19.480
I'm seeing some of this and
I'm seeing some of this.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.620
Well, actually yes.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.540
You could calculate
the energy difference

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.090
between two molecules using
classical force fields.

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.160
What you have identified
is the challenge

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.400
of doing that, which
is that it's only going

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.200
to be as good as the potential.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.560
Can the potential accurately
represent these two?

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.030
Well, you compare
with experiment.

01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:42.610
You compare with higher-level
theories and you'll know.

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:44.350
But what if it can?

01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:45.160
What if it can't?

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.440
Well, then this is
perfectly reasonable

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.850
to do with classical
force fields.

01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:54.170
I don't need electrons
to calculate this.

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:58.975
I just need the right energies,
which is what classical force

01:10:58.975 --> 01:11:02.280
fields are trying to capture.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.890
Now, there's a key here though.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.282
By the way, you could even
get this using a good--

01:11:07.282 --> 01:11:09.240
if the classical force
fields were good enough,

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.330
you could get the back-reaction
barrier, the activation energy.

01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:18.610
I want to make sure that
we understand context here.

01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:21.380
When you do a
simulation, when you

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:26.540
do your computational
materials research,

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:30.110
it's not a one size
fits all kind of thing,

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:34.670
and it's not even a one problem,
one method kind of thing.

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:38.090
You can have one problem
with different properties

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:40.780
that require different methods.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:43.510
And which is the
right method to use?

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:45.700
Well, very often
the answer to that

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:49.660
is whichever one is accurate
enough for the problem at hand

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:53.140
and fastest, and
so that's where you

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.700
have to know-- you have to
test and know where you sit

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.060
in accuracy phase space
with a given method,

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.840
and then you go ahead with it.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.840
And if you can find a
classical potential that

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.450
seems to represent this
class of materials well

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:08.730
and you can validate that it's
getting this, by all means

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:13.600
use that because it's going to
be a whole lot faster than DFT.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.130
However-- I should do that more
because it kind of felt good.

01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:22.720
It actually kind of loosened my
shoulder, made me look silly.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.170
There are things here I can't
do as classical potentials, not

01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:30.390
even if I really, really
close my eyes and dreamt it.

01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:31.688
They wouldn't happen.

01:12:31.688 --> 01:12:32.480
What would that be?

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:39.748
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:39.748 --> 01:12:40.790
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.440
So you're saying
there's a hint here.

01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:49.110
This is what I'm
shining on the molecule.

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:51.710
Who's seen this before?

01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:54.120
Yeah, you're feeling it.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.850
This is the sun.

01:12:55.850 --> 01:13:00.380
This is how much energy
comes to us from the sun.

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.620
And you can see that it's
dependent on the wavelength

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.940
of the light.

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.140
That's pretty cool, right?

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.540
And you know what's really
cool are these big, huge gaps.

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.915
See, this is if you go outside
of the earth's atmosphere,

01:13:09.915 --> 01:13:12.170
you get this yellow line.

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:15.260
But on the planet, we
get this red curve.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.540
We get all those
parts blocked out.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.430
You just don't get
that frequency of light

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:20.030
on the earth.

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:22.130
And the reason is because
you have these molecules

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:25.100
in the atmosphere that are
blocking that part of the sun's

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.210
spectrum.

01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:28.800
Isn't that pretty cool?

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.210
But this red is what
we get on the planet.

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:37.280
And the question is
how do these molecules

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.720
do in capturing that energy?

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.670
This is how we're
going to charge them.

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:45.770
This is how we're going
to charge them up.

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:49.620
Now that is related to
something else that's not here.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.940
What might that be related to?

01:13:55.450 --> 01:13:57.710
The band gap, exactly.

01:13:57.710 --> 01:13:59.020
Exactly.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.920
That is related.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.980
So this all comes back to
where those electrons are.

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.420
So remember, we filled
these electrons up.

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.950
I'm just making them--

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:12.780
just for simplicity,
I'm not labeling

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.790
them s, p because
I'm not talking

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:16.680
about a particular thing here.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.780
And then we filled them all up.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.450
There were 10 electrons,
and we filled the levels

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:23.470
with those electrons,
and that was it.

01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:25.710
But there's another
level up here,

01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:27.420
and there's many
more levels up there

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.060
that don't have electrons.

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:34.140
And this distance here in energy
between the highest occupied

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:37.500
and lowest unoccupied
level, the HOMO/LUMOS,

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.055
that's called the band gap.

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:45.180
This is called the Highest
Occupied Molecular Orbital,

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:49.148
and this is the Lowest
Unoccupied Molecular Orbital.

01:14:49.148 --> 01:14:50.940
And the difference
between them is the gap,

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:54.470
and that is so important
for optical properties

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:57.170
and electronic properties--
transport of electrons,

01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:59.130
absorption of sun.

01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:02.070
In this case, we care about the
absorption of the sun much more

01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:03.900
than transport of electrons.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.120
Now the reason
that's so important

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.290
is you see it goes back
to the hydrogen atom.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.000
Somebody tell me
a weirdness thing

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.740
about looking out into space.

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:25.230
What do you see when you look
at the colors of hydrogen?

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.010
They're discrete.

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:28.786
Why?

01:15:28.786 --> 01:15:30.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:30.215 --> 01:15:31.590
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
Yeah because,

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:35.010
remember, here's your electron.

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:39.750
It can only be in
these quantized levels.

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:44.860
It can only be in 1s or 2s,
and it cannot be in between.

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:47.720
Remember that?

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.600
How does that relate to
the absorption of sun

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.740
by a solar fuel?

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.740
Well, it's the same idea.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.960
You see, when you
absorb sunlight--

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.070
see this H new?

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:00.800
Sunlight came into
this trans state,

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.950
and it made it go up onto
another energy surface.

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.170
That got it to twist.

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:10.190
Now when it absorbed the
sunlight, what really happened

01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:13.610
is that the sun's energy
came into the molecule

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:17.940
and it kicked an electron
out of some happy place.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:22.910
It's just hanging out with its
buddies, and a photon comes in,

01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:28.070
and that photon kicks it up
here, and that's what does it.

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:31.340
That's what makes the
molecule change its shape,

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:35.900
that electron getting kicked up
into one of these other states.

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.460
Now the key here--

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.620
and this is what's related
to the hydrogen atom--

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:43.520
is that you see you
can't-- if you just shine--

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.030
so let me try to draw this
a little bit more clearly.

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:51.620
These are occupied levels, and
these are unoccupied levels,

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:54.450
and this is the gap.

01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:58.990
So these would be
occupied, unoccupied.

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:00.550
You cannot shine light.

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:03.010
If I only have enough
energy from the photon

01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:05.660
to take an electron
from here to here,

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.480
well, you're in no man's land.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.240
You're just like that
electron in the hydrogen atom

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.480
trying to go in between
a 1s and a 2s orbital.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.310
You can't do it.

01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:18.050
There is no state here.

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:22.000
There's no wave function there
for the electron to be it.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.890
And so there is a gap.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:29.260
That is the minimum
energy it takes, right?

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.300
So how is that now
related to this?

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.530
Gap is related to
absorption how?

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:50.660
So this is actually wavelength.

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:54.300
So the energy gap goes
as 1 over this, right?

01:17:57.153 --> 01:17:59.320
AUDIENCE: So for a molecule
only has a certain range

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.460
over which it can absorb light?

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:01.627
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN: Exactly.

01:18:01.627 --> 01:18:06.660
Actually, for now we're just
saying it has a minimum energy

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.060
below which it cannot
absorb any light.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:12.180
No photon below this
energy can do anything

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:14.580
in terms of exciting
these electrons up.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.290
So the photons have
to be above that,

01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:18.780
which means they have
to be-- if they have

01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.540
to be above a certain
energy, then they have to be

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.270
below a certain wavelength.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.660
So there's some--
does everybody see

01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:32.068
there's some lambda
max where they're not

01:18:32.068 --> 01:18:33.110
going to absorb any more?

01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:38.480
So beyond some point here, they
can't take any of that sun.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.440
That's it.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.820
Does everybody see that?

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.190
They cannot absorb that sun.

01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:46.820
Now would it be good-- if
lambda max were up here,

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.240
would that be OK?

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.400
Seems like it, but
there's a real problem

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:55.130
with that, which I'll come
back to probably next Tuesday.

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.220
But what would happen
if lambda max were here?

01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:01.110
AUDIENCE: You're
missing out on a lot.

01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:02.860
JEFFREY C GROSSMAN:
You're missing so much

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.080
of the sun's energy.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.930
You just can't-- because
of quantum mechanics,

01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:11.040
that darn quantum mechanics and
that electronic thing that you

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.140
cannot get from
classical potentials,

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:18.370
that electronic gap, you cannot
absorb light beyond the gap.

01:19:18.370 --> 01:19:21.180
Which means if your
gap is here in energy,

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:25.760
all of this part of the
sunlight is completely wasted.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:29.180
So I'm going to spend a
little time on this on Tuesday

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:34.010
because there's some really
cool questions about these photo

01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:36.800
switches that we're going to
use quantum mechanics to model

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:37.623
in the homework.

01:19:37.623 --> 01:19:40.040
And so I want to spend a little
more time on this Tuesday,

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.810
and then I'll talk a little
bit about hydrogen storage.

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:47.150
So we're going to pick up
with this picture on Tuesday.

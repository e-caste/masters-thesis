00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:16.059
JOHN DOLHUN: Hello.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.280
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.040
And welcome to the second
to the last lecture.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.920
Next week, the X-ray
diffraction, Peter Mueller

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.190
will deliver that, I
believe, on Tuesday.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.439
And this is the
mass spec lecture,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.690
and then we'll keep you posted
as what happens in between.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.170
There are a couple of
workshops for the oral reports,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.830
and we'll also have a couple of
town hall meetings, one of them

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:52.660
being, I believe, next
week, next Thursday, which

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.570
will cover all three of the
labs that you're working on.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.330
You can come here with your
questions and computers

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.280
and calculations, and all
the TAs and both instructors

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.450
will be here to help you
navigate through the third lab.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.410
So today, I'm going to talk
about mass spectrometry.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:20.080
And J.J. Thompson,
discoverer of the electron,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.010
won the Nobel Prize in
1906 in physics, but not

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.410
for the discovery
of the electron,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.350
for the conduction
of electricity

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.370
through various gases
and discharge tubes.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.500
And then, after he
won that Nobel Prize,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.630
seven members of his research
group won Nobel Prizes.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.890
And then, in 1937, his
son won a Nobel Prize

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.580
for figuring out the wavelike
properties of the electron

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.950
that his father discovered.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.890
Nine Nobel prizes in
one research group.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.290
It's just amazing.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.770
So J.J. went on to
build the first mass

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.530
spectrometer in 1912.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.169
And in honor of him, we're going
to do a little electrical demo,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.370
just to start off
with you today.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.500
So what we're going
to be doing is

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.750
I'm going to be showing you
an incandescent light bulb.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.610
And you all know them.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.780
This is a big version.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.610
This is the small version.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.160
Inside of the incandescent light
bulb, there's the filament.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.520
And they've used
tungsten since the turn

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.780
of the century, the turn
of the last century, 1906,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.270
because tungsten has
the highest melting

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.190
point of all the metals.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.520
Melts at around 3,400
degrees Celsius.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.690
So inside of there, you
can see it in this bulb,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.100
but I'm just going to turn
this on, just for a moment.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.820
So you all know the
incandescent bulbs.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.350
They get so hot.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.590
When the electrons flow, they
flow through the circuit,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.120
and then the tungsten atoms
start to vibrate inside

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.590
and it heats up to
about 2,200 degrees.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.560
Have any of you ever
touched one of these?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.040
You do it only one time
because they are so hot,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.590
and that's why they're so
wasteful of electricity.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.350
That's why we're going
to the LED lights today.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.130
But what I've done
here is inside

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.370
of that light bulb
and this bulb,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.070
there is an inert atmosphere.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.600
There's argon and nitrogen
gases to protect that filament.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.750
If they weren't in
there, I scratch my head

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.040
and I'd wonder what would
happen to that filament.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.240
So what I did is
I took a bulb here

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.010
and I'm going to break one.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.850
Hold your ears.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.820
And out-- oh, beautiful.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.010
The filament's
completely intact.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.320
See, I didn't break it.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.170
But I've already got one here
to show you this demo with.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.550
So what we're
going to do is I am

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.760
going to take one of
these filaments outside

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.700
of the light bulb and I'm going
to turn on the electricity

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.529
and see what happens.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:20.839
Let's turn the lights down now.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.510
Yeah.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.980
And he just shut
this light off here.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.510
You ready?

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.350
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.780
JOHN DOLHUN: Wow,
didn't take long, right?

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.470
In the oxygen
atmosphere, the electrons

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.720
are flowing through there
and the tungsten atoms

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.880
are boiling off
with the electrons

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.880
and the thing just
disintegrates pretty instantly.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.900
So I said to myself, I want
to do one more experiment.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.480
And Amanda's going to
assist me with this.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.590
We're going to fill this
beaker with liquid nitrogen

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.340
and we're going to take
one of these filaments

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.640
and we're going to stick it
down into the liquid nitrogen

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.200
and then we're
going to turn it on.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.820
So think about
that for a minute.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.362
What do you think
is going to happen?

00:05:17.888 --> 00:05:19.872
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.230
JOHN DOLHUN: Go ahead, Amanda.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.030
I just blew one.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.380
OK.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.920
OK.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.820
All right.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.500
I ruined one, sorry.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.060
I forgot this was on.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.480
OK.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.580
All right, let me turn
this off for a minute.

00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:53.520
And I think I can put in
the one that I took out here

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.030
on the desk.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.930
I'm going to put that one in
because the filament is intact.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.820
OK, Amanda.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.170
Just tighten it a bit.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.670
Go ahead.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.825
You OK?

00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:11.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.125
JOHN DOLHUN: Liquid nitrogen,
minus 196 degrees Celsius.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.580
Beautiful stuff.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.190
Put your finger in there and
you know what's going to happen.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.140
It's the skin effect.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.880
Won't get you for the
first few seconds.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.180
OK, good.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.070
So here we go with
our experiment.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.210
That's good, Amanda.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.740
So we're going to
lower this down in.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.964
Amanda, do you
want to hold this?

00:06:48.964 --> 00:06:49.845
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:51.720
JOHN DOLHUN: Just try
to get it in the center

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.463
and just lower it
all the way down in.

00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:54.380
AUDIENCE: All the way?

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.020
JOHN DOLHUN: All the way.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.850
Just go ahead.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.530
Take it down.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.180
Leave more slack.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.930
Yeah.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.130
Let it go down in.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.240
OK, good.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.740
Ready?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.693
There it is in the liquid
nitrogen. Is it burning out?

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:10.235
AUDIENCE: No.

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:10.777
AUDIENCE: No.

00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:12.710
JOHN DOLHUN: No.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.740
Take it out, Amanda.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.180
Doesn't take long
in the air, does it?

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.690
So even the liquid nitrogen
is surrounding that filament

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.810
and protecting it.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:31.070
And you've got the situation
where you don't have

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.586
the oxidation that's going on.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.330
OK, so we take the
lights back up.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.590
So in case you're
interested, tungsten it had--

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.530
anyone read Oliver Sacks
book, Uncle Tungsten?

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.090
It's a great book.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.710
You've got to get that.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.685
Tungsten plus oxygen
goes to tungsten oxide.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.320
And you can
actually-- if you take

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.590
one of these filaments
that burned out,

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.000
you can actually see
the yellow-white powder

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.590
that from the tungsten
oxide that was left over.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:20.660
So J.J. Thompson, because of
his discovery of the electron,

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.480
I wanted to show you
this electrical demo.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:31.903
And now, we're going to get
into the mass spec, which

00:08:31.903 --> 00:08:33.320
is pretty important
because you're

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.450
going to be using the mass
spec to characterize your ester

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.590
products in this lab.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:46.970
So the inside of the mass spec
has several basic components.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.700
You've got an area
outside here that

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.170
is at atmospheric pressure,
and the area inside that

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.660
is under a high vacuum.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.030
Anyone have an idea why that
area is under a high vacuum

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.530
inside?

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.630
No?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.000
So you're generating ions.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.660
The ion are going to get
generated in this source.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.530
The filament is going to shoot
electrons onto your molecule

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.840
and it's going to
ionize your molecule,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.600
and then the molecule's
going to break apart.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.270
And positive ions are
very short-lived species,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.930
so we manipulate
them under vacuum.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.460
And the vacuum--
the vacuum actually

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.525
is great because it
allows us to let the ion

00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:46.260
have a mean-free pathway
from the ion source

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.830
to the detector without any
biomolecular collisions.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.830
So the ions are
generated here and then

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.690
they go into the mass
analyzer and they're

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.260
sorted by their mass
to charge ratios,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.330
and then they're
counted at the detector,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.320
and out comes a spectrum.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:14.590
You kind of get something
like this with abundance here

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.630
and the mass to charge ratio.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.920
And depending on the
iron, so you might--

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:28.510
the detector may see a
lot of this, less of that

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.570
and less of that.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.650
So you're going to get
vertical lines representing

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.700
the abundance of the ions that
were detected in that spectrum.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.030
Each vertical line
represents an ion.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.810
And we're talking about
mass to charge ratios,

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.240
the charges are usually plus 1.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.490
So what we're looking
at in a mass spectrum

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.920
are the masses of
the individual ions.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.540
Mass spec is-- the basic
principle of mass spec

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.310
is you have to have an ion
that enters the magnetic field

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.570
and it gets deflected.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.700
It gets deflected dependent
on the actual mass to charge

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.300
ratio, how big that system is.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.990
Bigger, heavier atoms
are going to be deflected

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.600
less than small, lighter atoms.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.890
But that's the whole underlying
principle of mass spectrometry.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.780
And now, I'm going to
talk about a couple

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:31.550
of the types of ionization.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.360
Electron impact
is the basic form.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.130
So what we have is
we've got our molecule

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.060
and we send it into
the ion source.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:53.360
It gets bombarded by
electrons, and you

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:00.050
create an ionized
molecule, an M plus dot.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.855
And this ionized molecule
can do one of two things.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.300
This could break apart.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.540
So the positive charge could
be retained on one part of it.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.700
The radical would be
retained on the other.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.360
So you could get
something like A plus

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.560
plus some radical given off.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.230
Or it could break apart.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.940
So one part retains both
the plus and radical.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.101
So you could get
this type of ion

00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:39.990
and a neutral
molecule given off.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.020
What we detect with
mass spectrometry

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:48.000
is we're detecting these
daughter ions here.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.920
These are the peaks we see.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.280
We don't see the radicals
or the neutron molecules,

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.450
but we could figure them out
by subtracting the fragments

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.670
from the molecular weight.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.580
And then we can-- we'll
know what's been lobbed off.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:10.530
So if you have a
molecule like this,

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.550
it could ionize
anywhere in this chain.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.540
And if it ionizes,
say, here, and then you

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.740
have a homolytic
cleavage of the bond,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:28.650
you're going to get an R
prime CH 2 plus fragment,

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:35.130
and you'll get an
R2 CH2 radical.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.290
So that's the idea.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.810
Now, sometimes, some of
these bigger molecules,

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:47.540
these proteins and peptides, you
don't see molecular ion peaks

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.440
in the mass spectrum.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.460
Even for some small molecules
you may not see them.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.060
So we have another technique,
a softer ionization technique

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.240
called chemical ionization
that we can use.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:07.450
So in chemical lionization,
what we do is we take a guess

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.590
and we flood the ion
source with a gas.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.740
I'm going to choose
methane for this.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.560
Methane is often use.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.195
And we ionize that methane.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:37.300
And then the ionized methane
reacts with more methane

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:45.880
to produce a super acid, CH5
plus, and a methyl radical.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:53.517
Now, your molecule goes in and
it encounters the CH5 plus.

00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:54.850
What do you think happens to it?

00:14:58.105 --> 00:14:59.402
AUDIENCE: It's acidified?

00:14:59.402 --> 00:15:01.360
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah, it's
going to get acidified.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.160
It's going to get protonated.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.350
So this CH5 plus
protonates your molecule,

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.250
and you get this
huge M plus 1 peak.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.540
So this is great.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.780
If we have these big
proteins and peptides

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.630
and we want to know what
the molecular weight is,

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.680
we can use chemical
lionization, put them in there,

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.540
and we'll see the big M plus 1.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.030
We won't see a lot
of fragmentation,

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.620
but at least we can get some
molecular weight information

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.810
out of the system.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:42.100
CH5 plus is an
interesting molecule.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.770
You all know from your
chemical principles

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:50.200
that CH4 is SP3 hybridized.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.060
So when those two
methane molecules collide

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.410
and it throws the
hydrogen in, that hydrogen

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.270
pushes another
hydrogen out of the way

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.395
and it forms a three-centered,
two-electron bond.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:14.630
This is a pentavalent carbon
atom with a positive charge.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.220
That's a carbocation.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.570
That's the definition of a
carbocation in chemistry.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.940
This is also called
the methanium ion.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.570
And this is one of the last
unsolved problems in physics,

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.630
because no one can
isolate this stuff.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.790
It's very difficult to isolate.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.270
And about three years ago,
at the University of Cologne,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:44.620
they actually trap some of
this stuff in an ion chamber

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.830
at very low temperatures,
near absolute zero,

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.530
and they studied the
vibrational spectra.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.080
What they saw was
all these hydrogens

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.410
are coming off, moving
around the carbon atom.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.730
They're breaking off
and moving around.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.320
So now, scientists are wondering
whether this thing actually

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.170
has any structure at all.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.839
So that's chemical ionization.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.130
Sometimes, electron impact
and chemical lionization,

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.589
both of them won't work for us.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:18.530
We may have a molecule
that's too big

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.510
or that's too nonvolatile.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.349
So we go to fast atom
bombardment, electrospray,

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:28.160
or matrix-assisted laser
desorption spectroscopy.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.150
Fast atom bombardment
is pretty simple.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.400
You take your sample, mix it
with a little bit of glycerol,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.820
put it on a metal
target, and then we

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.940
shoot xenon and
argon atoms at it,

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.340
very high speed, high energy.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.300
And the glycerol in your
sample absorbs the shock

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.450
of the impact with those atoms.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.440
And we have some
trifluoroacetic acid in there,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.830
TFA, so that we can produce
these M plus 1 peaks.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.290
The advantages of
fast atom bombardment

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:14.060
are for high molecular weight
samples, nonvolatile compounds,

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.730
EICI don't work.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.530
Molecular weights here,
I've seen 20,000 or so.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:26.060
So you can go out--

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.770
they're constantly making
innovations with these.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.160
The next technique,
electrospray ionization,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.090
is quite interesting.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.820
The ions are produced,
the molecule is ionized,

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.820
and it's done at a very low pH.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.260
And there's a nebulizer
that actually shoots out

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.440
like an aerosol
through a high voltage

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.590
and you get these charged
droplets coming out,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:59.570
very large droplets with a lot
of positive charges on them.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:06.020
And then we can take a
stream of warm nitrogen gas

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:12.500
and evaporate those down and you
get a smaller droplet and then

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.570
that disintegrates.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:19.570
And what you end up with
are these multi-protonated

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.460
molecular ion peaks.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.190
You could have an M plus 20.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.280
You could have 20 hydrogens
on there, or 10 hydrogens,

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.970
or you get a variety of numbers.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.140
And what that does is it
expands the mass range.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:42.680
Let's say, for example, you have
a molecule that maybe weighs

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.710
70,000, and you produce a--

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.920
you produce an M plus 20.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.590
So what you have to do is--

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.730
you're going to have
a molecule like that.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.230
You're going to
have to divide, now,

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.700
by the charge to get where this
molecule is going to show up.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.110
Because it's mass
to charge ratio,

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.640
and if the charge is 20,
if you divide this out,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.940
you're going to get
something around 3,501.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.540
That's where the peak is going
to show up in your spectrum.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.370
So the advantage
of this technique

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.000
is you can take molecules
that are 70,000, 80,000,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.400
and your peaks could come
out at 3,500 or much less.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.650
So it expands the
whole mass range

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.460
of using a mass spectrometer.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.810
The last technique is
MALDI, Matrix-Assisted Laser

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.950
Desorption Ionization, and
we would use that principally

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.510
for solids.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.800
And these would be like the big
carbohydrates, the big peptides

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.350
and proteins.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.410
And you take your crystal
and you dissolve it

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:02.570
in a matrix, a solvent, and
you put a chromophore in

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:07.580
to absorb the laser
light, and then

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:14.210
this sample begins to evaporate
and you get beautiful crystals

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.340
on this metal target.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:22.730
And then you shoot a nitrogen
laser at it, 337 nanometers,

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:29.180
and you end up getting
M plus H speaks out.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.160
So you can take
these large solids.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:36.450
And molecular weights here
can go out quite a bit.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.660
So the advantages of
all these techniques

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.650
are they can help us
with nonvolatile, high

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:47.990
molecular weight samples
and getting spectra.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.130
We've already talked about
the inductively coupled plasma

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.790
in one of the lectures, so I'm
not going to talk about that.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:00.440
But I would like to cover a
couple types of instruments

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.630
that you will experience.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.860
The first is the
magnetic sector.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.160
The last is the one we have
in the undergraduate lab,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.430
the radio frequency
quadrupole filter trap.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.890
So let's start with
the magnetic sector.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.060
You'll see some
similarities to these.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.830
So here is your ion source.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.170
You can see the filament here.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.870
And the filament is shooting
out an electron beam

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.630
at your sample.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.910
It's about 70 electron volts.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:38.710
That's like about
1,600 kcals of energy.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.160
And 100 kcals, you
can break a bond.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.820
So with all that energy
slamming into your molecule,

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.940
it not only ionizers
the molecule,

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.120
it starts to break
apart into fragments.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.510
And the fragments in this
magnetic sector instrument

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.050
get ushered through a
pair of focal plates

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:04.720
and then they get sent
into the mass analyzer.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.820
There's an electric
field perpendicular

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.810
to a magnetic field.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:13.360
The electric field controls
the velocity of the ions,

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.200
and the magnetic field
will cause the deflection

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:23.230
with the heavier ions deflected
less than the lighter ions.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.220
So you kind of get a spectrum
here on the detecting screen

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.715
based on how they're
deflected by the magnet.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.160
Time of flight, this is
actually one of my favorites.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.770
There are a couple
advantages to this.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:48.020
One is it has almost an
unlimited mass range.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.780
The second advantage is you can
do very small amounts of sample

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.650
with this.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.740
So what happens
in time of flight

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:10.520
is your samples get ionized
in the ion source here.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.840
They get ionized similar to all
the other mass spectrometers.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:23.690
But then they get shot
out into a flight tube

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.900
and they get shot out at
the same kinetic energy,

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.750
all the ions that
are going in there.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:37.880
And kinetic energy is equal to
1/2MV squared, which is also

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.570
proportional to the
charge times the voltage

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.010
when they're being shot out.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.490
So if you look at
the kinetic energy,

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.900
you can see that the
velocity is square root of 2

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.740
of the kinetic energy
divided by the mass.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:25:01.880
So that means that the heavy
ions are kind of lagging here.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.490
They're traveling slower
because they're heavier.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:15.560
So when they're in this
tube, they actually

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.770
measure the time of
flight through the tube.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.860
That's what this-- it's
called time of flight, right?

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.790
So the time of flight
is the distance

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.260
divided by the velocity.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.310
Now, if you put that back
into this equation and you

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:39.890
solve it out, you'll see
that the mass to charge ratio

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:46.160
is equal to the square
of the time of flight

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.210
divided by the distance.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.780
This is a great salute
to the engineers.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.150
They designed this system.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.890
This machine is so simple.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.960
There's no electric field.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.240
There's no magnetic field.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.210
All there is is a tube.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:09.220
Doesn't this remind you
of TLC with the spots?

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.520
Except there's no mobile phase
and no stationary phase here,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.600
right?

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.910
So this is a great instrument.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:20.920
And that's how your mass
spectrum is determined.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:26.000
Now, the next one,
which is also kind

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.140
of like the Cadillac of
all mass spectrometers,

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.066
is the Fourier-transform ion
cyclotron resonance instrument.

00:26:39.084 --> 00:26:43.250
This instrument, ions are
generated the same way

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.010
as in the other
mass spectrometers,

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.690
but when they're
generated, they start

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.410
to get pumped to different
pumping stations,

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:57.210
and every pumping station has
a higher and higher vacuum.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.880
So the pressures
continue to drop

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:07.050
until the ions reach this box,
and then everything breaks

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:07.680
loose here.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.740
Because in this box,
you've got a temperature

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.460
of about 2 Kelvin.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.590
You've got a magnetic
field of about 21 tesla,

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.090
and there's an electric
field in there.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:28.810
And if you think about this,
you have a charged particle

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.920
traveling at a certain
velocity and it enters--

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.010
it enters the magnetic field.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:37.320
What happens to it?

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:47.180
What's going to happen to
that charged particle when it

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.790
gets into that magnetic field?

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:52.387
Autumn?

00:27:52.387 --> 00:27:53.670
AUDIENCE: It'll go around.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.130
JOHN DOLHUN: It's going
to start to spin, yeah,

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.080
like a cyclotron.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.620
It's going to be-- it's going
to be spinning like this.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:07.660
In fact, when the
particle goes in there--

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.430
let me give you an example, like
100 molecular weight fragment,

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:19.590
100 Dalton could
travel 30 meters

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:24.030
in about one second inside
of that box just crazy.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.070
So it has a centripetal
force on it.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:35.680
And force is mass times
acceleration, right?

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.450
So mass times acceleration.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.730
So this is our system.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:50.030
And the angular velocity
of that particle

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.000
is given by velocity over r.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:12.840
So if you plug that in here,
the cyclotron frequency

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.590
of that particle, that
velocity is nothing

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.570
to do with its velocity.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.010
It's only to do with
mass and charge.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.420
That's the bottom line.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.720
That's incredible.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:30.220
And if we hold the
magnetic field constant,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.900
then the cyclotron
frequency is the mass

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:37.060
to charge ratio
of that particle.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.550
So what comes out of
this is convoluted

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:45.210
signals like this
FID, these sine waves,

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.920
and we do a Fourier-transform
on that signal

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.630
and pull out the mass
spectrum that we want.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.270
So it's quite interesting.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:06.280
It's the most sensitive method
of ion detection in the world.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.600
The resolution is greater than
10 to the 7 on this instrument.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.270
And if you think about it,
that spinning particle,

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:20.350
it's spinning so many times,
the detector is on the outside

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.210
here.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.330
The difference between this and
all other forms of mass spec is

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.380
the detector is on the outside,
so it doesn't-- the ions never

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.090
reach the detector.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.730
They only record the image
current from the ions

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.530
as they're going by.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.270
And it's recording it over
and over and over again.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:42.550
That's why you've got such
beautiful resolution here.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.790
And then you've got
the system we're

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:52.880
going to use, the quadrupole
filter radio frequency system.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.930
So what we have for
our mass analyzer

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:02.080
is four rods in parallel,
and the opposite rods

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.210
are electrically connected.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:08.560
There's a DC voltage
put on those rods.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:12.700
And then an RF voltage is
superimposed on one pair

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.320
of rods over the other.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.970
And it's the voltage of
that pulsed radio frequency

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:23.840
field and the frequency
that determines which

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.560
ions get through these rods.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.150
Only one ion can actually make
it through the rods at a time,

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:36.410
depending on the frequency
of that radio frequency pulse

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.740
and the ratio of
voltages on those rods.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.580
And the other ions basically
just crash into the sides here.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:52.120
So a couple of things, before
you actually come in the lab

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.460
and do the lab, we
have to actually

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.830
tune the mass spectrometer up.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:01.210
Because mass spectrometers
have an internal mass scale.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.870
Can actually go off kilter.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.600
And so we've got to make
sure that every mass is

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.220
where it's supposed to be.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.340
The detector gain has to
be cranked up so that we

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.560
can see peaks far enough out.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:22.750
To do that, we
use this compound,

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.425
perfluorotributylamine.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.770
This is the stuff
that we actually

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.300
have in the mass spectrometer
in a little vessel,

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.390
and when we do the tune,
the vessel opens up,

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.010
and a whiff of this comes out.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.820
And the beauty of this is
it can fragment down here.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.630
ScF3 can fall off.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.120
You get a 69 peak.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.340
Can do that from
three directions.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:56.620
You can lose one of these
polyfluorinated butyl groups

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.550
from either of three directions
and you get a 219 peak,

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:05.050
or you can clip it right
here and you get a 502 peak.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.240
And that's pretty
much all you see.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.300
You see the 69, the
219, and the 502.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.280
The spectrum is very simple.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.990
And the molecular weight is 502.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.490
So

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.670
We key in on these and
adjust the internal mass

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.650
scale of the instrument
and make sure

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.520
it can separate
peaks 1 AMU apart.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.980
And for your
samples, your samples

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.930
will be under molecular
weight of 200.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.890
So if we can go out to
500 and have it tuned up,

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:33.700
we'll be fine.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.180
This is water.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.030
Very simple molecule.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:45.080
This is your chance to talk.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.090
I want you to--

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.255
we're going to
actually look at this.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.190
What I'd like to do
is I'd like to see

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:06.030
what the mass spectrum
of water looks like.

00:34:08.711 --> 00:34:10.211
So we're going to
ionize some water.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:24.639
And we've got our abundance here
and our mass-to-charge ratio.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:27.980
So what would you see in
the mass spectrum of water?

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.110
Which peaks would you see?

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:32.570
Royce?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.080
Oh, you were
scratching yourself.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.580
Yeah.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:42.889
[CHUCKLES] What would you see?

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.040
Yes, Alec?

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.780
AUDIENCE: M-to-C equals 18.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.880
JOHN DOLHUN: 18, yes.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.950
You'd definitely see an 18 peak.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:06.370
That's your ionized
water molecule.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.630
What else?

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.130
Alec?

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.400
There's not much to
fragment, is there?

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.400
Well, what would you get
if you tore this apart?

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.700
AUDIENCE: You'd get a 1.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.970
JOHN DOLHUN: A 1, yes, you'd
definitely see a 1 here.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:28.600
That's your hydrogen. What else?

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.100
Yeah.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.350
AUDIENCE: You might see a 16.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.725
JOHN DOLHUN: Yep,
you'd see a 16.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:37.520
What else?

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:42.860
AUDIENCE: Will you see a 17?

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.027
JOHN DOLHUN: Yes, you would.

00:35:44.027 --> 00:35:44.720
Very good.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:55.170
And that is-- that's the whole
spectrum of water, four peaks.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.460
Yes, Autumn.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.380
AUDIENCE: Could you get 32 or
2 in the oxygen and hydrogen

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:00.880
diagrams?

00:36:04.936 --> 00:36:06.510
JOHN DOLHUN: You could get--

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:14.240
if you're looking at air,
air has diatomic gases in it.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:20.380
So if you put air in, you would
see some of those peaks, yeah.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.250
Yeah, let's look at air,
since you mentioned that.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.000
Let me just put this down here.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.930
I mean, air has diatomic gases.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.840
So what would you see in air?

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.655
Yeah, Noah.

00:36:46.655 --> 00:36:47.280
AUDIENCE: A 28.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.690
JOHN DOLHUN: A 28, good.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.490
So you'd see a 28 here.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.590
Yep, what else?

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:01.665
AUDIENCE: 32.

00:37:01.665 --> 00:37:03.040
JOHN DOLHUN: Yep,
you'd see a 32.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.530
AUDIENCE: 44.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.880
JOHN DOLHUN: Very good.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.020
Good old carbon dioxide.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.800
Yep.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.360
What else?

00:37:26.671 --> 00:37:27.620
AUDIENCE: 18.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.440
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah,
you'd see water.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.540
We hate water, but
it's in the air, right?

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.280
So you definitely, definitely
would see an 18 peak.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.070
What else?

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.050
How about some of
the noble gases?

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.860
They're in the air.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.400
Which one?

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.270
AUDIENCE: Ne.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.500
JOHN DOLHUN: Neon, yeah.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.520
Neon is 20.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.100
Any others?

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.350
AUDIENCE: Would you see argon?

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.120
JOHN DOLHUN: Yes, argon.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.200
Argon is 40.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.470
What other gas?

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.970
Yes.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.934
AUDIENCE: Would you
see helium or not?

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.070
JOHN DOLHUN: Very little.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.950
Very little.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.400
What else?

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.120
What's a couple of the
other big inert gases?

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.500
AUDIENCE: Xenon?

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:35.950
JOHN DOLHUN: Xenon, yes, 131.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:38.723
What about the Superman gas?

00:38:38.723 --> 00:38:39.640
AUDIENCE: Oh, krypton.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.370
JOHN DOLHUN: Krypton, yes.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.495
84, krypton.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.170
And you may see a 29
peak, because you might

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:56.510
see nitrogen-15, nitrogen-14.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.650
Because the mass spec
will detect isotopes.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:05.600
You also, for oxygen,
you could see a 34 peak,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:13.340
because you've got-- you might
have some oxygen-18, oxygen-16.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.740
But you've hit them.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.300
And these just came out--

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.652
this was I think in not Time
magazine, but one of the--

00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:25.550
one of the magazines came
out with the periodic table.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.860
The whole issue was
on the periodic table.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:33.690
And they listed all the
gases that are in the air.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.410
So it's kind of neat.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.170
So let's move on here.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.580
I want to show you what a
mass spectrum looks like.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.450
This is hexane, your
good old friend, right?

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.950
C6H14.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.050
So what you've got here is
you've got your molecular ion

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.230
peak at 86, right?

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:02.800
And then everything to the left
of that is fragments breaking--

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.560
the molecule breaking apart.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.890
And notice the
intensity of the peaks.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.680
One of the peaks is a base peak.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.360
That means the detector counted
that more than any other peak.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.640
So what the detector
does is gives

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.400
that 100 and all the other peaks
are relative to that base peak.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.560
And when we give you
your mass spectrum,

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.090
we'll give you a sheet
with the abundances on it.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.830
Notice, if you take
this base peak, 57,

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:43.480
and you subtract it from 86,
that's a loss of 29, isn't it?

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:49.360
So it's pretty much just an
ethyl radical falling off,

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.990
and you've got
this butyl cation.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:54.940
The butyl group has
the plus charge.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.310
That's your 57 peak.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.480
It's that simple.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.200
So you take your peak, subtract
from the molecular ion,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.540
see what's been thrown off.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:08.530
What about the m
plus 1 peak here?

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:09.220
What is that?

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.280
There's no chemical
ionization going on here.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:27.900
[CHUCKLES] What's
the m plus 1 peak?

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.860
Yes, Deb.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.336
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.050
JOHN DOLHUN: Did you say
something with carbon?

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:36.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, 13.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.500
JOHN DOLHUN:
Carbon-13, very good.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.510
Yeah, carbon-13.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:47.890
So carbon-13 has an
abundance of 1.1%.

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:50.950
1.1% of all carbon is carbon-13.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:52.120
Look up here.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.640
You got six carbons, right?

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.180
So 6 times that--

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:02.980
6.6% of the carbons
are carbon-13.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.210
So if I take this molecular
ion peak, which is--

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:13.870
my eye is saying it's
about 15% abundance,

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:22.960
if I multiply that by 0.066,
I get 1%, that m plus 1 peak.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.350
That's approximately
what we're talking about.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.500
What if we didn't know
the number of carbons?

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.690
We didn't know the structure?

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:35.500
We could work backwards
and figure it out

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:40.000
from the molecular ion abundance
and the m plus 1 abundance.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:47.840
The number of carbons would
be equal to the abundance

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:59.190
of the m plus 1 divided
by the abundance of the m

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:07.930
plus dot times 100
divided by 1.1.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:11.710
That would give you the number
of carbons in your molecule.

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:15.480
So mass spec can not only
determine the molecular weight,

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:20.680
you can determine the molecular
formula of your system.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.140
You can also determine the
number of isotopes and elements

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:30.160
that are present in your system.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.880
So there are other isotopes.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.420
Look at chlorine-35
and chlorine-37 here.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:49.720
If you see this in the molecular
ion region of your spectrum,

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:55.140
and your molecular ion is
separated by 2 mass units,

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.490
it's a dead giveaway.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.200
That's chlorine's signature.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.900
That means you have a
chlorine in your molecule.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.450
Bromine is even simpler.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:07.980
Bromine has two peaks,
both equal abundance--

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:15.360
the 79 and the 81
separated by 2 mass units.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.000
Here's an example.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.180
So here's a mass spectrum.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:24.780
Look at our molecular
ion region here,

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:31.260
separated by 2 mass
units, ratio of 3 to 1.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.328
What do we have?

00:44:32.328 --> 00:44:33.120
AUDIENCE: Chlorine.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.410
JOHN DOLHUN: A chlorine, yes.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:35.910
OK?

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.530
So if you take this--

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:42.330
take this peak here,
this is 77, subtract 112,

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.180
you have a loss of 35.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.410
So if you take the--

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:54.490
if you simply take the two
things and put them together,

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.580
the 77 is the phenyl ion.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.040
So if you just stick
a chlorine on there,

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.042
you got chlorobenzene.

00:45:05.042 --> 00:45:05.875
That's the spectrum.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.820
Here's another spectrum.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:15.350
This is very interesting,
because all these peaks

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:21.200
are separated by methylene
units, 14 mass units, CH2

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.970
units, all through
the whole spectrum.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.680
When you see that,
you know you've

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:29.220
got a long chain of carbon
atoms as part of your spectrum.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.360
So this particular
spectrum is decane.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:37.190
And it ionizes at all
these different bonds,

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:44.050
producing this spectrum with
this logical lost ion series.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.770
There's another one,
dodecanoic acid,

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.490
which has all these
methylene units, which

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.430
is a dead giveaway for a long
chain of carbons connected

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:56.565
to something.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.500
Here is a simple spectrum.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:06.260
This is 2-propanol.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.250
Now, the molecular
weight of this is 60.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.730
But look down here.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:12.800
Do you see 60?

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.970
There's no molecular ion there.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:22.780
So this molecule
is doing something

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:27.010
that's energetically
very favorable to itself

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:28.652
to produce a 59 peak.

00:46:28.652 --> 00:46:29.860
What do you think it's doing?

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:40.990
It's one less than the
molecular ion, right?

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.490
Yeah.

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:43.380
AUDIENCE: It's losing
the H on the OH.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:43.660
JOHN DOLHUN: Yes?

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.780
AUDIENCE: It's losing
the H on the OH.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.940
JOHN DOLHUN: Yes, Hannah.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.850
Loses the H, right.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:49.615
So if you take--

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:55.660
this guy ionizes here.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.250
And it has resonance,
because you

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:17.510
can throw that positive
charge out onto the oxygen.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.530
So it's really, really
a very stable system.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:22.840
It loves to do that.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.960
And look at the base peak
in this spectrum, 45.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.190
You can lose a methyl group
from either side here,

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:33.630
and you've got a 45.

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.250
It's left over.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:39.120
And it's resonance-stabilized,
because the positive charge can

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.260
resonate with this oxygen here.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.730
So that's the idea.

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.480
When you see a
base peak, you know

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.230
the molecule is
loving to do something

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:50.490
that's very favorable.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:55.210
And in this case, it could
cleave from two sides.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.150
So this is an ester.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:00.180
This is ethyl-isobutyrate.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:04.680
I don't know if this is
one that's been given out.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.810
I'm not talking.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:09.150
But this is a simple spectrum.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.880
And the idea here
is, what you do

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.950
is you're going to
take this, and you're

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.590
going to break it apart
to try to figure out where

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.090
those peaks are coming from.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:24.430
So if you cleave the ester here,
right, right by this carbonyl,

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:25.840
you lose this--

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.790
do this alpha cleavage,
you'll get this 71 fragment,

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:34.930
which can then lose carbon
monoxide to give you

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.160
a 43 fragment.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.670
So if we actually go back
here, there's our 71,

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.070
and there's our 43.

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.710
And then, look at
this right here.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:51.470
You can actually lose a
neutral molecule of ethylene.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.930
Transfer the hydrogen
back to this point.

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:57.310
And you're losing CH2-CH2.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.640
That's an example where
one piece of the molecule

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.910
retains both the plus charge
and radical that I talked about.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:08.280
And here's your
fragment, your 88.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.390
There it is there.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:15.930
So the idea is to go through
here and try to take your ester

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.450
and try to break it
up and substantiate

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:21.810
some of the fragments from--

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:26.670
in a table or something, to
show that what you've got.

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:32.610
And that way-- that way you'll
convincingly convince someone

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:36.350
that you-- indeed
that is your product.

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:38.690
Do you have some
questions about this?

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:48.140
So if you're on day four,
you'll be doing the mass spectra

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.430
today.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:52.880
And I guess you turn in your
guesses for your unknowns

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.800
today, right?

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.510
Good.

00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:00.100
It was easy, right?

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:00.610
Yes.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:02.896
It was too easy, wasn't it?

00:50:02.896 --> 00:50:03.630
AUDIENCE: Nah.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:06.680

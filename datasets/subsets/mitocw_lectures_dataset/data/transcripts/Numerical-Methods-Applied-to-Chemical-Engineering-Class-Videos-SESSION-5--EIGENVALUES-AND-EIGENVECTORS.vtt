00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:24.590
JAMES W. SWAN: Let's go
ahead and get started.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.550
I hope everybody
saw the correction

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.667
to a typo in homework 1 that
was posted on Stellar last night

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:36.500
and sent out to you.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.140
That's going to happen
from time to time.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.020
We have four course staff
that review all the problems.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.389
We try to look through it for
any issues or ambiguities.

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:47.180
But from time to time,
we'll miss something

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.800
and try to make a correction.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.660
The TAs gave a hint
that would have let you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.800
solve the problem as written.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.440
But that's more
difficult than what

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.700
we had intended for you guys.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.740
We don't want to give you a
homework assignment that's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.932
punishing.

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:03.640
We want to give you
an assignment that'll

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.420
help you learn.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.490
Some people in this class that
are very good at programming

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.420
have apparently
already completed

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.630
that problem with the hint.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.300
But it's easier, as
originally intended.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.310
And the correction resets that.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.452
So maybe you'll
see the distinction

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:18.910
between those things
and understand

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.100
why one version of the problem
is much easier than another.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.940
But we try to respond
as quickly as possible

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.212
when we notice a typo like
that so that we can set

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.420
you guys on the right course.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.320
So we've got two lectures
left discussing linear algebra

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.630
before we move on
to other topics.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.050
We're still going to talk about
transformations of matrices.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.270
We looked at one type
of transformation

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.855
we could utilize for solving
systems of equations.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:47.230
Today, we'll look
at another one,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.170
the eigenvalue decomposition.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.670
And on Monday, we'll look at
another one called the singular

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.470
value decomposition.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.680
Before jumping right in,
I want to take a minute

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.020
and see if there are any
questions that I can answer,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.110
anything that's been
unclear so far that I

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.140
can try to reemphasize
or focus on for you.

00:02:08.672 --> 00:02:10.880
I was told the office hours
are really well-attended.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.640
So hopefully, you're
getting an opportunity

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.677
to ask any pressing questions
during the office hours

00:02:16.677 --> 00:02:18.260
or you're meeting
with the instructors

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.780
after class to ask
anything that was unclear.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.920
We want to make sure that
we're answering those questions

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.030
in a timely fashion.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.760
This course moves at
a pretty quick pace.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.160
We don't want anyone
to get left behind.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
Speaking of getting left behind,
we ran out of time a little bit

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.770
at the end of
lecture on Wednesday.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.370
That's OK.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.927
There were a lot
of good questions

00:02:38.927 --> 00:02:40.010
that came up during class.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.110
And one topic that we
didn't get to discuss

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.220
is formal systems
for doing reordering

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.660
in systems of equations.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.560
We saw that reordering
is important.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.600
In fact, it's essential for
solving certain problems

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.140
via Gaussian elimination.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.880
You won't be able to solve them.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.327
Either you'll incur a
large numerical error

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:01.910
because you didn't
do pivoting-- you'd

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.520
like to do pivoting in order to
minimize the numerical error--

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.390
or you need to reorder in
order to minimize fill-in.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.850
As an example, I've
solved a research problem

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.220
where there was something
like 40 million equations

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.610
and unknowns, a system of
partial differential equations.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.460
And if you reorder
those equations,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.470
then you can solve via Gaussian
elimination pretty readily.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.775
But if you don't,
well-- my PC had--

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:28.205
I don't know-- like,
192 gigabytes of RAM.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.950
The elimination on that
matrix will fill the memory

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.980
of that PC up in 20 minutes.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.800
And you'll be stuck.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.100
It won't proceed after that.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.620
So it's the difference
between getting a solution

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.440
and writing a publication
about the research problem

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.440
you're interested in and not.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.700
So how do you do reordering?

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.534
Well, we use a process
called permutation.

00:03:52.534 --> 00:03:54.200
There's a certain
class of matrix called

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.140
a permutation matrix that can--

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.520
its action, multiplying
another matrix,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.380
can swap rows or columns.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.740
And here's an example
of a permutation matrix

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.740
whose intention is to swap
row 1 and 2 of a matrix.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.280
So here, it looks like
identity, except rather

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.420
than having 1, 1 on the first
two elements of the diagonal,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.209
I have 0, 1 and 1, 0.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.330
Here's an example where I take
that sort of a matrix, which

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.417
should swap rows 1 and 2, and
I multiply it by a vector.

00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:28.250
If you do this matrix
vector multiplication,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.490
you'll see initially, the
vector was x1, x2, x3.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.100
But the product
will be x2, x1, x3.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.250
It swapped two rows
in that vector.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.090
Of course, a vector is
just a matrix, right?

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.320
It's an N by 1 matrix.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.720
So P times A is the same
as a matrix whose columns

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.880
are P times each of
the columns of A.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.160
That's what this
notation indicates here.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.560
And we know that
P times a vector,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.390
which is the column from A,
will swap two rows in A, right?

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.740
So the product here
will be all the rows

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.630
of A, the different rows
of AA superscript R,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.090
with row 1 and 2
swapped with each other.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.750
So permutation, multiplication
by the special type

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.090
of matrix, a permutation
matrix, does reordering of rows.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.260
If I want to swap columns,
I multiply my matrix

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.350
from the right, IP transpose.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.170
So if I want to
swap column 1 and 2,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.300
I multiply A from the
right by P transpose.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.570
How can I show that
that swaps columns?

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.100
Well, A times P
transpose is the same

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.760
as P times A
transpose transpose.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.620
P swaps rows.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.170
So it's swapping rows
of A transpose, which

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.510
is like swapping columns of A.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.210
So we had some
identities associated

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.040
with matrix-matrix
multiplication

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.312
and their transposes.

00:05:49.312 --> 00:05:51.520
And you can use that to work
out how this permutation

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.750
matrix will swap
columns instead of rows

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.110
if I multiply from the
right instead of the left.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.340
Here's an important
concept to know.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.750
Permutation matrices are-- would
refer to as unitary matrices.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.270
They're transposed.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.490
It's also they're inverse.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.060
So P times P
transpose is identity.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.940
If I swap the rows and
then I swap them back,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.634
I get back what I had before.

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:20.050
So there are lots
of matrices that

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.240
have this property
that they're unitary.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.820
We'll see some today.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.430
But permutation matrices are
one class, maybe the simplest

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.840
class, of unitary matrices.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.630
They're just doing row
or column swaps, right?

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.810
That's their job.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.480
And so if I have some reordering
of the equations or rows

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.120
of my system of
equations that I want,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.490
that's going to be indicated by
a permutation matrix-- say, P1.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.040
And I would multiply
my entire system

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.100
of-- both sides of my
system of equations by P1.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.940
That would reorder the rows.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.030
If I have some
reordering of the columns

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.140
or the unknowns in my problem, I
would use a similar permutation

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.610
matrix, P2.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.200
Of course, P2 transpose
times P2 is identity.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.010
So this product
here does nothing

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.210
to the system of equations.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.590
It just swaps the unknown.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.681
So there's a formal system for
doing this sort of swapping.

00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:10.930
There are a couple other
slides that are in your notes

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.330
from last time that
you can look at

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.871
and I'm happy to
answer questions on.

00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:16.230
We don't have time
to go into detail.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.870
It discusses the actual
methodology, the simplest

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.360
possible methodology, for
doing this kind of reordering

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.230
or swapping.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.190
So this is a form
of preconditioning.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.590
If it's preconditioning
for pivoting,

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.090
it's designed to
minimize numerical error.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.300
If it's preconditioning in order
to minimize fill-in instead,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.510
that's meant to make the problem
solvable on your computer.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.404
But it's a form
of preconditioning

00:07:42.404 --> 00:07:43.320
a system of equations.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.770
And we discussed
preconditioning before.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.650
So now we know how to
solve systems of equations.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.750
It's always done via
Gaussian elimination

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.280
if we want an exact solution.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.770
There are lots of variants
on Gaussian elimination

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.730
that we can utilize.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.021
You're studying one of them
in your homework assignment

00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:01.800
now, where you know the matrix
is banded with some bandwidth.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.070
So you don't do elimination
on an entire full matrix.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.280
You do it on a sparse matrix
whose structure you understand.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.070
We discussed sparse
matrices and a little bit

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.500
about reordering
and now permutation.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.140
I feel like my diffusion
example last time

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.540
wasn't especially clear.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.580
So let me give you a different
example of diffusion.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.680
You guys know Plinko?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.780
Have you seen The
Price Is Right?

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.400
This is a game where
you drop a chip

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.030
into a board with pegs in it.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.000
It's a model of diffusion.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.200
The Plinko chip falls
from level to level.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.840
It hits a peg.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.549
And it can go left or it can go
right with equal probability.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.800
So the Plinko chip
diffuses as it falls down.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.880
This guy's excited.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.950
He just won $10,000.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.345
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.330
There's a sparse
matrix that describes

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.810
how the probability
of finding the Plinko

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:14.300
chip in a certain cell
evolves from level to level.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.370
It works the same way the
cellular automata model

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.560
I showed you last time works.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.340
If the chip is in a particular
cell, then at the next level,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.780
there's a 50/50 chance
that I'll go to the left

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.780
or I'll go to the right.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.430
It looks like this, right?

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.120
If the chip is here, there's
a 50/50 chance I'll go here

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.000
or I'll go there.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.810
So if the probability was
1 that I was in this cell,

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.170
then at the next level,
it'll be half and a half.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.350
And at the next level, those
halves will split again.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.820
So the probability that I'm in
a particular cell at level i

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.579
is this Pi.

00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:50.870
And the probability that I'm
in a particular cell level

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.240
i plus 1 is this Pi plus one.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.700
And there's some
sparse matrix A which

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.350
spreads that probability out.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.075
It splits it into
my neighbors 50/50.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.240
Here's a simulation of Plinko.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.060
So I started with
the probability 1

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.540
in the center cell.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.410
And as I go through different
levels, I get split 50/50.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.220
And you see a binomial or almost
Gaussian distribution spread

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.060
as I go through
more and more levels

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.060
until it's equally probable
that I could wind up

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.170
in any one of the cells.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.920
You can think about
it this way, right?

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:37.180
The probability
at level i plus 1

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.410
that the chip is in cell
N is inherited 50/50

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.286
from its two neighbors, right?

00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:45.660
There's some probability that
was in these two neighbors.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.660
I would inherit half
of that probability.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.990
It would be split by these pegs.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.730
The sparse matrix that
represents this operation

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.170
has two diagonals.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.950
And on each of those
diagonals is a half.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.000
And you can build that matrix
using the spdiags command.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.300
It says that there's going to
be two diagonal components which

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.190
are equal to a half.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.000
And their position
is going to be

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.040
one on either side of
the central diagonal.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.670
That's going to indicate that
I pass this probability, 50/50,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.680
to each of my neighbors.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.350
And then successive
multiplications by A

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.990
will split this probability.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.740
And we'll see the
simulation that tells us

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.540
how probable it is
to find the Plinko

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.140
chip in a particular column.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.640
Yes?

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.077
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.670
JAMES W. SWAN: Yeah.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.110
So in diffusion in general?

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.283
AUDIENCE: Well, in this
instance in particular because

00:11:48.283 --> 00:11:50.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.690
JAMES W. SWAN: Well, OK.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.070
That's fair enough.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.030
This is one particular model
of the Plinko board, which

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:02.324
sort of imagines alternating
cells that I'm falling through.

00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:03.990
We could construct
an alternative model,

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.990
if we wanted to, that didn't
have that part of the picture,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.490
OK?

00:12:10.192 --> 00:12:12.150
So that's a matrix that
looks like this, right?

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.440
The central diagonal is 0.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.330
Most of the
off-diagonal components

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.020
here are 0 and 1
above and 1 below.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.095
I get a half and a half.

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:23.720
And if I'm careful--
somebody mentioned

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.460
I need boundary conditions.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.710
When the Plinko chip
gets to the edge,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.530
it doesn't fall out of the game.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.090
It gets reflected back in.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.850
So maybe we have to choose some
special values for a couple

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.100
of elements of this matrix.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.030
But this is a sparse matrix.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.849
It has a sparse structure.

00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:42.140
It models a diffusion problem,
just like we saw before.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.030
Most of physics is
local, like this, right?

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.280
I just need to know what's
going on with my neighbors.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.780
And I spread the
probability out.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.740
I get this nice
diffusion problem.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.780
So it looks like this.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.280
Here's something to notice.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.500
After many levels or cycles, I
multiply by A many, many times.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.044
This probability distribution
always seems to flatten out.

00:13:04.044 --> 00:13:04.835
It becomes uniform.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.350
It turns out there are even
special distributions for which

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.740
A times A times
that distribution is

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.100
equal to that distribution.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.980
You can see it at the end here.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.840
This is one of those
special distributions

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.140
where the probability is equal
in every other cell, right?

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.240
And at the next level,
it all gets passed down.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.925
That's one multiplication by--
it all gets spread by 50%.

00:13:31.925 --> 00:13:33.550
And the next
multiplication, everything

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.422
gets spread by 50% again.

00:13:35.422 --> 00:13:36.880
And I recover the
same distribution

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.430
that I had before, this
uniform distribution.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.290
That's a special distribution
for which A times A times P

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.170
is equal to P. And
this distribution

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:53.500
is one of the eigenvectors
of this matrix A times A.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.070
It's a particular vector
that when I multiply it

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:03.070
by this matrix AA, I
get that vector back.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.420
It happens to be unstretched.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.730
So this vector points
in some direction.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.650
I transform it by the matrix.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.430
And I get back something that
points in the same direction.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.030
That's the definition of this
thing called an eigenvector.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.700
And this will be the subject
that we focus on today.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.110
So eigenvectors of a matrix--

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.340
they're special vectors that
are stretched on multiplication

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.630
by the matrix.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.250
So they're transformed.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.152
But they're only transformed
into a stretched form

00:14:34.152 --> 00:14:35.360
of whatever they were before.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.190
They point in a direction.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.780
You transform them
by the matrix.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.550
And you get something that
points in the same direction,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.258
but is stretched.

00:14:41.258 --> 00:14:43.280
Before, we saw the
amount of stretch.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.470
The previous example, we saw
the amount of stretch was 1.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.659
It wasn't stretched at all.

00:14:47.659 --> 00:14:49.700
You just get back the same
vector you had before.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.370
But in principle, it could
come back with any length.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.680
For a real N-by-N
matrix, there will

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.640
be eigenvectors and
eigenvalues, which

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.565
are the amount of stretch,
which are complex numbers.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.120
And finding
eigenvector-eigenvalue pairs

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.900
involves solving N equations.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.760
We'd like to know what
these eigenvectors

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.920
and eigenvalues are.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.840
They're non-linear
because they depend

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.220
on both the value and the
vector, the product of the two,

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.134
for N plus 1 unknowns.

00:15:30.134 --> 00:15:32.300
We don't know how to solve
non-linear equations yet.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.410
So we're kind of--

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.610
might seem like we're
in a rough spot.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.720
But I'll show you
that we're not.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.130
But because there's N equations
for N plus 1 unknowns,

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.100
that means eigenvectors
are not unique.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.730
If W is an eigenvector,
than any other vector

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.590
that points in
that same direction

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.300
is also an eigenvector, right?

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.840
It also gets stretched
by this factor lambda.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.760
So we can never say what
an eigenvector is uniquely.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.420
We can only prescribe
its direction.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.240
Whatever its magnitude
is, we don't care.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.910
We just care about
its direction.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.160
The amount of stretch,
however, is unique.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.080
It's associated
with that direction.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.589
So you have an
amount of stretch.

00:16:12.589 --> 00:16:13.630
And you have a direction.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.460
And that describes the
eigenvector-eigenvalue pair.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.000
Is this clear?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.250
You've heard of eigenvalues
and eigenvectors before?

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:24.750
Good.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.950
So how do you find eigenvalues?

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.250
They seem like special
sorts of solutions

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.882
associated with a matrix.

00:16:35.882 --> 00:16:38.340
And if we understood them, then
we can do a transformation.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.714
So I'll explain
that in a minute.

00:16:39.714 --> 00:16:41.600
But how do you actually
find these things,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.450
these eigenvalues?

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.570
Well, I've got to solve an
equation A times w equals

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:52.580
lambda times w, which can be
transformed into A minus lambda

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.414
identity times w equals 0.

00:16:55.414 --> 00:16:57.080
And so the solution
set to this equation

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.390
is either w is equal to 0.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.660
That's one possible
solution to this problem

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:09.140
or the eigenvector w belongs to
the null space of this matrix.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.170
It's one of those special
vectors that when it multiplies

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.869
this matrix gives back 0, right?

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:19.250
It gets projected out on
transformation by this matrix.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.829
Well, this solution doesn't
seem very useful to us, right?

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.349
It's trivial.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.510
So let's go with this
idea that w belongs

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.640
to the null space
of A minus lambda I.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.820
That means A minus lambda I must
be a singular matrix, whatever

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.650
it is, right?

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.270
And if it's singular, then the
determinant of a minus lambda

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.460
I must be equal to 0.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.990
So if this is true,
and it should be true

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.000
if we don't want a
trivial solution, then

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.520
the determinant of A minus
lambda I is equal to 0.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.190
So if we can compute
that determinant

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:59.135
and solve for lambda, then
we'll know the eigenvalue.

00:17:59.135 --> 00:18:01.750
Well, it turns out that
the determinant of a matrix

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:09.340
like A minus lambda I is a
polynomial in terms of lambda.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.190
It's a polynomial
of degree N called

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.840
the characteristic polynomial.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.050
And the N roots of this
characteristic polynomial

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.460
are called the
eigenvalues of the matrix.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.850
So there are N possible
lambdas for which A minus

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.680
lambda I become singular.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.680
It has a null space.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.140
And associated with those
values are eigenvectors, vectors

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.610
that live in that null space.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.140
So this polynomial-- we could
compute it for any matrix.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.750
We could compute this
thing in principle, right?

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:47.790
And we might even be able
to factor it into this form.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.100
And then lambda 1,
lambda 2, lambda N

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.210
in this factorized form are
all the possible eigenvalues

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.010
associated with our
matrix A, right?

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.400
There are all the possible
amounts of stretch

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.730
that can be imparted to
particular eigenvectors.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.470
We don't know those
vectors yet, right?

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.384
We'll find them in a second.

00:19:06.384 --> 00:19:07.800
But we know the
amounts of stretch

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.991
that can be imparted
by this matrix.

00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:10.490
OK?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.385
Any questions so far?

00:19:16.385 --> 00:19:18.920
No.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.420
Let's do an example.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.218
Here's a matrix, minus 2, 1, 3.

00:19:23.218 --> 00:19:24.980
And it's 0's everywhere else.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.830
And we'd like to find the
eigenvalues of this matrix.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.650
So we need to know A minus
lambda I and its determinant.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.080
So here's A minus lambda
I. We just subtract lambda

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.850
from each of the diagonals.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.731
And the determinant--
well, here, it's

00:19:39.731 --> 00:19:41.480
just the product of
the diagonal elements.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.840
So that's the determinant
of a diagonal matrix

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.840
like this, the product
of the diagonal elements.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.880
So it's minus 2 minus lambda
times 1 minus lambda times 3

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.140
minus lambda.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.300
And the determent of this
has to be equal to 0.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.600
So the amounts of
stretch, the eigenvalues

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.830
imparted by this matrix,
are minus 2, 1, and 3.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.770
And we found the eigenvalues.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.910
Here's another matrix.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.690
Can you work out the
eigenvalues of this matrix?

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.660
Let's take 90 seconds.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.500
You can work with
your neighbors.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.874
See if you can figure out the
eigenvalues of that matrix.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.420
Nobody's collaborating today.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.936
I'm going to do it myself.

00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:42.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:43.908
JAMES W. SWAN: It's OK.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.320
OK.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.570
What are you finding?

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.114
Anyone want to guess
what are the eigenvalues?

00:21:54.114 --> 00:21:56.757
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:56.757 --> 00:21:57.590
JAMES W. SWAN: Good.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:58.310
OK.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.601
So we need to compute the
determinant of A minus lambda

00:22:00.601 --> 00:22:04.340
I. That'll be minus 2
minus lambda times minus 2

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.310
minus lambda minus 1.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.010
You can solve this to find that
lambda equals minus 3 or minus

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.325
1.

00:22:13.325 --> 00:22:15.052
These little checks are useful.

00:22:15.052 --> 00:22:16.510
If you couldn't do
this, that's OK.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.370
But you should try to
practice this on your own

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.245
to make sure you can.

00:22:22.554 --> 00:22:23.720
Here are some more examples.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.480
So the elements of
a diagonal matrix

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.840
are always the eigenvalues
because the determinant

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.520
of a diagonal matrix
is the product

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.010
of the diagonal elements.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:37.660
So these diagonal values here
are the roots of the secular

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.890
characteristic polynomial.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.080
They are the eigenvalues.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.430
It turns out the diagonal
elements of a triangular matrix

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.090
are eigenvalues, too.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.670
This should seem
familiar to you.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.170
We talked about easy-to-solve
systems of equations, right?

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.987
Diagonal systems of equations
are easy to solve, right?

00:22:55.987 --> 00:22:58.070
Triangular systems of
equations are easy to solve.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.090
It's also easy to find
their eigenvalues.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.630
So the diagonal elements
here are the eigenvalues

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.410
of the triangular matrix.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.090
And eigenvalues have
certain properties

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.990
that can be inferred from the
properties of polynomials,

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.490
right?

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.310
Since they are the
roots to a polynomial,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.470
if we know certain
things that should

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.240
be true of those
polynomial of roots,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.440
that has to be true of the
eigenvalues themselves.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.559
So if we have a matrix
which is real-valued,

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:27.100
then we know that
we're going to have

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:33.330
this polynomial of degree N
which is also real-valued, OK?

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.350
It can have no more
than N roots, right?

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:44.550
And so A can have no more
than N distinct eigenvalues.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.850
The eigenvalues, like the
factors of the polynomial,

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.990
don't have to be
distinct, though?

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.160
You could have multiplicity in
the roots of the polynomial.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:58.550
So it's possible that lambda
1 here is an eigenvalue twice.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.250
That's referred to as
algebraic multiplicity.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.510
We'll come back to
that idea in a second.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.390
Because the polynomial
is real-valued,

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.370
it means that the
eigenvalues could

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.890
be real or complex,
just like the roots

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.810
of a real-valued polynomial.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.220
But complex eigenvalues always
appear as conjugate pairs.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.680
If there is a
complex eigenvalue,

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.860
then necessarily its
complex conjugate

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.129
is also an eigenvalue.

00:24:26.129 --> 00:24:27.670
And here's a couple
other properties.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.180
So the determinant
of a matrix is

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.929
the product of the eigenvalues.

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:34.970
We talked once about the
trace of a matrix, which

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.070
is the sum of its
diagonal elements.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.730
The trace of a matrix is also
the sum of the eigenvalues.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.400
These can sometimes
come in handy--

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.196
not often, but sometimes.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.470
Here's an example I
talked about before--

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.890
so a series of
chemical reactions.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.970
So we have a batch,
a batch reactor.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.260
We load some material in.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.160
And we want to know how the
concentrations of A, B, C,

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.700
and D vary as a
function of time.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.730
And so A transforms into B.
B and C are in equilibrium.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.500
C and D are in equilibrium.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.245
And our conservation equation
for material is here.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.350
This is a rate matrix.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.020
We'd like to understand what
the characteristic polynomial

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.600
of that is.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.115
The eigenvalues
of that matrix are

00:25:29.115 --> 00:25:31.240
going to tell us something
about how different rate

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.770
processes evolve in time.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.700
You can imagine
just using units.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.930
On this side, we have
concentration over time.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.430
On this side, we
have concentration.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:45.540
And the rate matrix has units
of rate, or 1 over time.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.390
So those eigenvalues
also have units of rate.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.110
And they tell us the rate at
which different transformations

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:55.589
between these materials occur.

00:25:55.589 --> 00:25:57.880
And so if we want to find
the characteristic polynomial

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.760
of this matrix and we need to
compute the determinant of this

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.000
matrix minus lambda I-- so
subtract lambda from each

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.340
of the diagonals--

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.570
even though this is a
four-by-four matrix,

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.220
its determinant
is easy to compute

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.170
because it's full of zeros.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.690
I'm not going to
compute it for you here.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.090
It'll turn out that the
characteristic polynomial looks

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:16.600
like this.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.850
You should actually try
to do this determinant

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.490
and show that the polynomial
works out to be this.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.890
But knowing that this is the
characteristic polynomial,

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.080
what are the eigenvalues
of the rate matrix?

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.500
If that's the
characteristic polynomial,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.000
what are the
eigenvalues, or tell me

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.430
some of the eigenvalues
of the rate matrix?

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.930
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:36.638
JAMES W. SWAN: 0.

00:26:36.638 --> 00:26:37.500
0's an eigenvalue.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.470
Lambda equals 0 is a solution.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.020
Minus k1 is another solution.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.236
What is this eigenvalue
0 correspond to?

00:26:48.236 --> 00:26:49.194
What's that?

00:26:49.194 --> 00:26:52.547
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.160
JAMES W. SWAN: OK.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:06.890
Physically, it's a rate process
with 0 rate, steady state.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:10.220
So the 0 eigenvalue's going to
correspond to the steady state.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.560
The eigenvector associated
with that eigenvalue

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.300
should correspond to the
steady state solution.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.430
How about this
eigenvalue minus k1?

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.500
This is a rate
process with rate k1.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.510
What physical process
does that represent?

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.770
It's something evolving
in time now, right?

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.900
So that's the
transformation of A into B.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.090
And the eigenvector should
reflect that transformation.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.044
We'll see what those
eigenvectors are in a minute.

00:27:41.044 --> 00:27:42.710
But these eigenvalues
can be interpreted

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.090
in terms of physical processes.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.230
This quadratic solution
here has some eigenvalue.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.400
I don't know what it is.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.560
You use the quadratic
formula and you can find it.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.380
But it involves k2, k3, k4.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.710
And this is a typo.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.810
It should be k5.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.590
And so that says something about
the interconversion between B,

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.400
C, and D, and the rate
processes that occur

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:11.542
as we convert from B to C to D.

00:28:11.542 --> 00:28:12.250
Is that too fast?

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.280
Do you want to write some more
on this slide before I go on,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.980
or are you OK?

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.190
Are there any
questions about this?

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.690
No.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.500
Given an eigenvalue, a
particular eigenvalue, what's

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.740
the corresponding eigenvector?

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.350
We know the eigenvector
isn't uniquely specified.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.500
It belongs to the null
space of this matrix

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:41.710
A minus lambda I times identity.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.010
Even though it's not
unique, we might still

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.740
try to find it using
Gaussian elimination, right?

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.130
So we may try to take--

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.090
we may try to solve the
equation A minus lambda

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.020
I times identity
multiplied by w equals

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.079
0 using Gaussian elimination.

00:29:00.079 --> 00:29:01.870
But because it's not
unique, at some point,

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.550
we'll run out of rows
to eliminate, right?

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.530
There's a null space
to this matrix, right?

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.140
We won't be able to
eliminate everything.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.160
We'd say it's rank
deficient, right?

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.950
So we'll be able to
eliminate up to some R,

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.310
the rank of this matrix.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.740
And then all the
components below

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.690
are essentially free or
arbitrarily specified.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.770
There are no
equations to say what

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.030
those components of
the eigenvector are.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:35.500
The number of all 0 rows--

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.331
it's called the geometric
multiplicity of the eigenvalue.

00:29:38.331 --> 00:29:38.830
Sorry.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.429
Geometric is missing here.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.750
It's the number of components
of the eigenvector that

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.360
can be freely specified.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.820
The geometric
multiplicity might be 1.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.567
That's like saying that
the eigenvectors are all

00:29:59.567 --> 00:30:01.400
pointing in the same
direction, but can have

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.680
arbitrary magnitude, right?

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.400
It might have geometric
multiplicity 2, which

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.130
means the eigenvectors
associated with this eigenvalue

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.810
live in some plane.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:16.180
And any vector from that plane
is a corresponding eigenvector.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.555
It might have a higher geometric
multiplicity associated

00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:19.302
with it.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.935
So let's try something here.

00:30:23.935 --> 00:30:28.660
Let's try to find the
eigenvectors of this matrix.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.332
I told you what the
eigenvalues were.

00:30:30.332 --> 00:30:31.790
They were the
diagonal values here.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.560
So they're minus 2, 1, and 3.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.080
Let's look for the
eigenvector corresponding

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.300
to this eigenvalue.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.450
So I want to solve this equation
A minus this particular lambda,

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.100
which is minus 2, times
identity equals 0.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.070
So I got to do Gaussian
elimination on this matrix.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.080
It's already eliminated
for me, right?

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.130
I have one row which
is all 0's, which

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:03.080
says the first component
of my eigenvector

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.270
can be freely specified.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.280
The other two
components have to be 0.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.160
3 times the second component
of my eigenvector is 0.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.940
5 times the third
component is 0.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.160
So the other two
components have to be 0.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.110
But the first component
is freely specified.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:22.340
So the eigenvector associated
with this eigenvalue

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.520
is 1, 0, 0.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.650
If I take a vector which
points in the x-direction in R3

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.080
and I multiply it
by this matrix,

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.610
it gets stretched by minus 2.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:36.230
So I point in the
other direction.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:40.210
And I stretch out
by a factor of 2.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:43.380
You can guess then what
the other eigenvectors are.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.810
What's the eigenvector
associated with this eigenvalue

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.830
here?

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.340
0, 1, 0, or anything
proportional to that.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.820
What's the
eigenvector associated

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.830
with this eigenvalue?

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.230
0, 0, 1, or anything
proportional to it.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:00.910
All these eigenvectors have a
geometric multiplicity of 1,

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:01.690
right?

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.960
I can just specify some
scalar variant on them.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.000
And they'll transform
into themselves.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.464
Here's a problem you can try.

00:32:14.464 --> 00:32:16.380
Here's our series of
chemical reactions again.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.390
And we want to know the
eigenvector of the rate

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.630
matrix having eigenvalue 0.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.380
This should correspond
to the steady state

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.227
solution of our ordinary
differential equation here.

00:32:26.227 --> 00:32:28.185
So you've got to do
elimination on this matrix.

00:32:30.764 --> 00:32:31.430
Can you do that?

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.530
Can you find this eigenvector?

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:33.780
Try it out with your neighbor.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.440
See if you can do it.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.180
And then we'll compare results.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.468
This will just be a quick
test of understanding.

00:34:47.454 --> 00:34:50.889
Are you guys able to do this?

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.270
Sort of, maybe?

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:59.630
Here's the answer, or an
answer, for the eigenvector.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.470
It's not unique, right?

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.500
It's got some constant
out in front of it.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.000
So you do Gaussian
elimination here.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.320
So subtract or add the
first row to the second row.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.780
You'll eliminate this 0, right?

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.040
And then add the second
row to the third row.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.970
You'll eliminate this k2.

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:22.870
You have to do a little bit more
work to do elimination of k4

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:23.370
here.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.599
But that's not a big deal.

00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:26.640
Again, you'll add the
third row to the fourth row

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.230
and eliminate that.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.870
And you'll also wind
up eliminating this k5.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.960
So the last row here
will be all 0's.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.140
And that means the last
component of our eigenvector's

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:37.950
freely specifiable.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.970
It can be anything we want.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.770
So I said it is 1.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:43.860
And then I did back
substitution to determine all

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.530
the other components, right?

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:47.990
That's the way to do this.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.780
And here's what the eigenvector
looks like when you're done.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.160
The steady state
solution has no A in it.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.700
Of course, A is just eliminated
by a forward reaction.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.430
So if we let this run out to
infinity, there should be no A.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.660
And that's what happens.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:05.160
But there's equilibria
between B, C, and D.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.130
And the steady state solution
reflects that equilibria.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.294
We have to pick what this
constant out in front is.

00:36:10.294 --> 00:36:12.210
And we discussed this
before, actually, right?

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.030
You would pick that based on
how much material was initially

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.950
in the reactor.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.750
We've got to have an
overall mass balance.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.940
And that's missing from this
system of equations, right?

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.400
Mass conservation is what gave
the null space for this rate

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.890
matrix in the first place.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.740
Make sense?

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.124
Try this example out.

00:36:30.124 --> 00:36:32.040
See if you can work
through the details of it.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.456
I think it's useful to be able
to do these sorts of things

00:36:34.456 --> 00:36:35.249
quickly.

00:36:35.249 --> 00:36:36.540
Here are some simpler problems.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.920
So here's a matrix.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.420
It's not a very good matrix.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.840
Matrices can't be good or bad.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.860
It's not particularly
interesting.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.900
But it's all 0's.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.170
So what are its eigenvalues?

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.750
It's just 0, right?

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:56.090
The diagonal elements
are the eigenvalues.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.010
And they're 0.

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:02.320
That eigenvalue has
algebraic multiplicity 2.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.140
It's a double root of the
secular characteristic

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:08.890
polynomial.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.510
Can you give me
the eigenvectors?

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.820
Can you give me
eigenvectors of this matrix?

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.640
Can you give me linearly
independent-- yeah?

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.381
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:32.381 --> 00:37:33.130
JAMES W. SWAN: OK.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.710
JAMES W. SWAN: OK.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:36.209
Good.

00:37:36.209 --> 00:37:40.470
So this is a very ambiguous sort
of problem or question, right?

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.050
Any vector I multiply by A here
is going to be stretched by 0

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:48.790
because A by its very
nature is all 0's.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.910
All those vectors
live in a plane.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.920
So any vector from
that plane is going

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.320
to be transformed in this way.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.920
The eigenvector
corresponding to eigenvalue 0

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.760
has geometric multiplicity
2 because I can freely

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.590
specify two of its components.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:07.250
Oh my goodness.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.000
I went so fast.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.590
We'll just do it this way.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:13.700
Algebraic multiplicity 2,
geometric multiplicity 2--

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.850
I can pick two vectors.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:20.020
They can be any two I
want in principle, right?

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.600
It has geometric multiplicity 2.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.739
Here's another matrix.

00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:26.780
It's a little more
interesting than the last one.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.115
I stuck a 1 in there instead.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:37.240
Again, the eigenvalues are 0.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.140
It's a double root.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.140
So it has algebraic
multiplicity 2.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.990
But you can convince
yourself that there's

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.760
only one direction
that transforms

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.030
that squeeze down to 0, right?

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:57.840
There's only one
vector direction

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.910
that lives in the null
space of A minus lambda I--

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.560
lives in the null
space of A. And that's

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.890
vectors parallel to 1, 0.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:13.050
So the eigenvector associated
with that eigenvalue 0

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:16.770
has geometric
multiplicity 1 instead

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.200
of geometric multiplicity 2.

00:39:30.209 --> 00:39:31.750
Now, here's an
example for you to do.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.460
Can you find the eigenvalues
and some linearly independent

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.100
eigenvectors of this
matrix, which looks

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.630
like the one we just looked at.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.570
But now it's three-by-three
instead of two-by-two.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:50.180
And if you find those
eigenvalues and eigenvectors,

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.330
what are the algebraic and
geometric multiplicity?

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.114
Well, you guys must
had a rough week.

00:40:14.114 --> 00:40:15.530
You're usually
much more talkative

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.048
and energetic than this.

00:40:17.048 --> 00:40:18.944
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.228
Well, what are the
eigenvalues here?

00:40:27.228 --> 00:40:28.047
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:40:28.047 --> 00:40:28.880
JAMES W. SWAN: Yeah.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.670
They all turn out to be 0.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:35.810
So that's an algebraic
multiplicity of 3.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:39.260
It'll turn out there are two
vectors, two vector directions,

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:43.160
that I can specify that will
both be squeezed down to 0.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.630
In fact, any vector
from the x-y plane

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.100
will also be squeezed down to 0.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.950
So this has algebraic
multiplicity 3 and geometric

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.726
multiplicity 2.

00:40:57.909 --> 00:41:00.200
I'm going to explain why this
is important in a second.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.180
But understanding
that this can happen

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.250
is going to be useful for you.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.225
So if an eigenvalue
is distinct, then it

00:41:08.225 --> 00:41:10.510
has algebraic multiplicity 1.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.070
It's the only eigenvalue
with that value.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:17.420
It's the only time that
amount of stretch is imparted.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.261
And there will be only one
corresponding eigenvector.

00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:22.385
There will be a direction
and an amount of stretch.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.550
If an eigenvalue has a
algebraic multiplicity M,

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:35.040
well, you just saw that
the geometric multiplicity,

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.280
which is the dimension of
the null space of A minus

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.300
lambda I--

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.690
it's the dimension
of the space spanned

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.920
by no vectors of
A minus lambda I--

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.080
it's going to be bigger
than 1 or equal to 1.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.990
And it's going to be
smaller or equal to M.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:56.650
And we saw different variants on
values that sit in this range.

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:59.820
So there could be as many
as M linearly independent

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.042
eigenvectors.

00:42:02.042 --> 00:42:03.000
And there may be fewer.

00:42:06.039 --> 00:42:07.830
So geometric multiplicity--
it's the number

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.979
of linearly independent
eigenvectors associated

00:42:09.979 --> 00:42:10.770
with an eigenvalue.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:13.155
It's the dimension of the
null space of this matrix.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.480
Problems for which the geometric
and algebraic multiplicity

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.070
are the same for all the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors,

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.570
all those pairs, are nice
because the matrix then

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:34.250
is said to have a complete
set of eigenvectors.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.190
There's enough
eigenvectors in the problem

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:43.000
that they describe the
span of our vector space

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.300
RN that our matrix is doing
transformations between.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.250
If we have geometric
multiplicity that's

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.420
smaller than the
algebraic multiplicity,

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.520
then some of these
stretched-- we

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.460
can't stretch in all
possible directions in RN.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.609
There's going to be a direction
that might be left out.

00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:04.650
We want to be able to do
a type of transformation

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:08.325
called an eigendecomposition.

00:43:08.325 --> 00:43:09.950
I'm going to show
you that in a second.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.290
It's useful for solving
systems of equations

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.500
or for transforming systems
of ordinary differential

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.662
equations, linear ordinary
differential equations.

00:43:19.662 --> 00:43:21.620
But we're only going to
be able to do that when

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.759
we have this complete
set of eigenvectors.

00:43:24.759 --> 00:43:26.300
When we don't have
that complete set,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.750
we're going to have to do
other sorts of transformations.

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.120
You have a problem in your
homework now, I think,

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.796
that has this sort of a
hang-up associated with it.

00:43:35.796 --> 00:43:37.670
It's the second problem
in your homework set.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.003
That's something to think about.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:46.570
For a matrix with the
complete set of eigenvectors,

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:48.800
we can write the following.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.100
A times a matrix W is equal
to W times the matrix lambda.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.030
Let me tell you what
W and lambda are.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:00.670
So W's a matrix whose
columns are made up of this--

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:04.230
all of these eigenvectors.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:08.200
And lambda's a matrix
whose diagonal values are

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.380
each of the corresponding
eigenvalues associated

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.270
with those eigenvectors.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:19.000
This is nothing more
than a restatement

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.940
of the original
eigenvalue problem.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:31.000
AW is lambda W. But
now each eigenvalue

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.650
has a corresponding
particular eigenvector.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:37.750
And we've stacked
those equations up

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.879
to make this statement about
matrix-matrix multiplication.

00:44:40.879 --> 00:44:42.670
So we've taken each of
these W's over here.

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:45.169
And we've just made them the
columns of a particular matrix.

00:44:45.169 --> 00:44:47.110
But it's nothing more
than a restatement

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:48.970
of the fundamental
eigenvalue problem

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.440
we posed at the beginning here.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:57.130
But what's nice is if I
have this complete set

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:02.620
of eigenvectors, then W has an
inverse that I can write down.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.740
So another way to state this
same equation is that lambda--

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:11.620
the eigenvalues can be found
from this matrix product, W

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:14.996
inverse times A times W.

00:45:14.996 --> 00:45:16.370
And under these
circumstances, we

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:18.310
say the matrix can
be diagonalized.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:23.890
There's a transformation
from A to a diagonal form.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.030
That's good for us, right?

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:28.000
We know diagonal systems of
equations are easy to solve,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.500
right?

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.950
So if I knew what the
eigenvectors were,

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:34.380
then I can transform my
equation to this diagonal form.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.400
I could solve systems of
equations really easily.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.570
Of course, we just
saw that knowing

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.910
what those eigenvectors
are requires solving

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.380
systems of equations, anyway.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.300
So the problem of
finding the eigenvectors

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.680
is as hard as the problem of
solving a system of equations.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.270
But in principle, I can do
this sort of transformation.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:55.830
Equivalently, the matrix A can
be written as W times lambda

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.320
times W inverse.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.270
These are all equivalent
ways of writing

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:03.835
this fundamental relationship
up here when the inverse of W

00:46:03.835 --> 00:46:04.335
exists.

00:46:06.937 --> 00:46:09.520
So this means that if I know the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors,

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.490
I can easily reconstruct
my equation, right?

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.290
If I know the
eigenvectors in A, then I

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:17.110
can easily diagonalize my
system of equations, right?

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:20.410
So this is a useful sort
of transformation to do.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.032
We haven't talked about how
it's done in the computer.

00:46:23.032 --> 00:46:24.990
We've talked about how
you would do it by hand.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.615
These are ways you
could do it by hand.

00:46:26.615 --> 00:46:28.570
The computer won't do
Gaussian elimination

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:32.020
for each of those eigenvectors
independently, right?

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.360
Each elimination procedure
is order N cubed, right?

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.110
And you got to do that
for N eigenvectors.

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:39.550
So that's N to the
fourth operations.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:40.757
That's pretty slow.

00:46:40.757 --> 00:46:42.340
There's an alternative
way of doing it

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.270
that's beyond the scope
of this class called--

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.810
it's called the
Lanczos algorithm.

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:52.870
And it's what's referred
to as a Krylov subspace

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:54.460
method, that sort
of iterative method

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.910
where you take products of your
matrix with certain vectors

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:00.400
and from those products,
infer what the eigenvectors

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.574
and eigenvalues are.

00:47:01.574 --> 00:47:03.490
So that's the way a
computer's going to do it.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:05.890
That's going to be an order
N cubed sort of calculation

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.380
to find all the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.925
solving a system of equations.

00:47:09.925 --> 00:47:13.030
But sometimes you
want these things.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.970
Here's an example of how
this eigendecomposition can

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.580
be useful to you if you did it.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:22.750
So we know the matrix A can
be represented as W lambda W

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.480
inverse times x equals b.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.110
This is our transformed
system of equations here.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.520
We've just substituted for A.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.520
If I multiply both sides of
this equation by W inverse,

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.720
then I've got lambda times
the quantity W inverse x

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.505
is equal to W inverse b.

00:47:39.505 --> 00:47:42.640
And if I call this
quantity in parentheses y,

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.500
then I have an easy-to-solve
system of equations for y.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.530
y is equal to lambda
inverse times c.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.260
But lambda inverse
is just 1 over each

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.140
of the diagonal
components of lambda.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.270
Lambda's a diagonal matrix.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.950
Then all I need
to do-- ooh, typo.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.450
There's an equal
sign missing here.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:02.660
Sorry for that.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.800
Now all I need to do is
substitute for what I called y

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.090
and what I called c.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.880
So y was W inverse times x.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.860
That's equal to lambda inverse
times W inverse times b.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.690
And so I multiply both sides of
this equation by W. And I get x

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.240
is W lambda inverse W inverse b.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.450
So if I knew the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors,

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.920
I can really easily solve
the system of equations.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.160
If I did this decomposition,
I could solve many systems

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.830
of equations, right?

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:30.370
They're simple to
solve with just

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:33.190
matrix-matrix multiplication.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.785
Now, how is W inverse computed?

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:42.530
Well, W inverse transpose
are actually the eigenvectors

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:43.880
of A transpose.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.000
You may have to compute
this matrix explicitly.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.541
But there are times
when we deal with

00:48:50.541 --> 00:48:53.530
so-called symmetric
matrices, ones for which they

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:57.250
are equal to their transpose.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.020
And if that's the
case, and if you

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.080
take all of your eigenvectors
and you normalize them

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.990
so they're of length 1--

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.340
the Euclidean norm is 1--

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:10.680
then it'll turn out that
W inverse is precisely

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.720
equal to W transpose, right?

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.170
And so the eigenvalue
matrix will be unitary.

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:19.400
It'll have this property where
its transposes is its inverse,

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.260
right?

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.090
So this becomes
trivial to do then,

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:23.490
this process of W inverse.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.350
It's not always true that
this is the case, right?

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.470
It is true when we
deal with problems

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.950
that have symmetric matrices
associated with them.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.910
That pops up in a lot of cases.

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:37.800
You can prove--

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.630
I might ask you to
show this some time--

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:41.940
that the eigenvectors
of a symmetric matrix

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:47.050
are orthogonal, that they
satisfy this property that--

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:50.370
I take the dot product between
two different eigenvectors

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:54.982
and it'll be equal to 0 unless
those are the same eigenvector.

00:49:54.982 --> 00:49:57.190
That's a property associated
with symmetric matrices.

00:50:02.204 --> 00:50:03.620
They're also useful
when analyzing

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.910
systems of ordinary
differential equations.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:10.160
So here, I've got a differential
equation, a vector x dot.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.960
So the time derivative of
x is equal to A times x.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:19.720
And if I substitute my
eigendecomposition--

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.650
so W lambda W inverse--

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:26.430
and I define a new
unknown y instead of x,

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:28.990
then I can diagonalize
that system of equations.

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:32.850
So you see y dot is
equal to lambda times y

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:35.130
where each component
of y is decoupled

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:36.220
from all of the others.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:40.590
Each of them satisfies their own
ordinary differential equation

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.050
that's not coupled to
any of the others, right?

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:45.610
And it has a simple
first-order rate constant,

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.180
which is the
eigenvalue associated

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.940
with that particular
eigendirection.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.870
So this system of
ODEs is decoupled.

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:54.930
And it's easy to solve.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.340
You know the solution, right?

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.390
It's an exponential.

00:50:59.957 --> 00:51:01.540
And that can be quite
handy when we're

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.850
looking at different sorts
of chemical rate processes

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:06.820
that correspond to linear
differential equations.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.100
We'll talk about nonlinear,
systems of nonlinear,

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:13.125
differential equations
later in this term.

00:51:13.125 --> 00:51:15.250
And you'll find out that
this same sort of analysis

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:17.200
can be quite useful there.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.930
So we'll linearize
those equations.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:22.282
And we'll ask is their linear--
in their linearized form, what

00:51:22.282 --> 00:51:23.740
are these different
rate constants?

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:24.760
How big are they?

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.260
They might determine
what we need

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.935
to do in order to integrate
those equations numerically

00:51:30.935 --> 00:51:32.810
because there are many
times when there's not

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.010
a complete set of eigenvectors.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:36.380
That happens.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.300
And then the matrix can't
be diagonalized in this way.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.830
There are some
components that can't

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:45.736
be decoupled from each other.

00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:47.610
That's what this
diagonalization does, right?

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:50.124
It splits up these different
stretching directions

00:51:50.124 --> 00:51:50.790
from each other.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:52.560
But there's some directions
that can't be decoupled

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.880
from each other anymore.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.230
And then there are other
transformations one can do.

00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:58.800
So there's an
almost diagonal form

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.610
that you can transform into
called the Jordan normal form.

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:06.640
There are other transformations
that one can do, like called,

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.440
for example, Schur
decomposition, which

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.960
is a transformation
into an upper triangular

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.160
form for this matrix.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.129
We'll talk next time about the
singular value decomposition,

00:52:16.129 --> 00:52:17.920
which is another sort
of transformation one

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.030
can do when we don't have these
complete sets of eigenvectors.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.980
But this concludes our
discussion of eigenvalues

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:32.720
and eigenvectors.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.819
You'll get a chance to practice
these things on your next two

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.110
homework assignments, actually.

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:40.230
So it'll come up in a couple
of different circumstances.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.100
I would really
encourage you to try

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.080
to solve some of these example
problems that were in here.

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.414
Solving by hand can be useful.

00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:49.080
Make sure you can
work through the steps

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:53.520
and understand where these
different concepts come

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.960
into play in terms
of determining

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.221
what the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors are.

00:52:57.221 --> 00:52:57.720
All right.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.780
Have a great weekend.

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.630
See you on Monday.

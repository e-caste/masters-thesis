CATHERINE DRENNAN: If you
haven't clicked in yet,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.759
please pay attention to
the clicker question,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.180
and I'll give you a little

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.990
And I'll give you a
10-second warning.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.760
All right.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.562
Let's just go ahead and
take 10 more seconds.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.800
All right.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.066
Does someone want to say
how they got this one right?

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.410
Anyone willing to say
how they got it right?

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.400
We have a American
Chemical Society,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.010
whatever these are called that
hang around your neck and clip

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.120
things to them.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.800
Yes.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.900
There's the word.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.530
No?

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.430
Oh, there we go.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.610
So this molecule
is the phosphorus

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.630
has five valence electrons and
then each hydrogen has three

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.570
so it's per total of eight.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.110
So it has three bonding
and then one lone pair,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.790
which makes it a tetrahedral,
but then the lone pair

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.775
pushed the other bond, so
it's less than 109.5 degrees.

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:13.450
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Excellent.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.860
Yeah.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.880
So I see that some people
just decided that there

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.370
were three things bound to it.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.730
And so then they decided
either 120 or less than 120,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.010
but you really need to
do the Lewis structure

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.470
and see how many loan
pairs there are first.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.320
So once you do the
Lewis structure,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.680
then you figure out
the parent geometry,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.440
Sn forces sum of
tetrahedral system.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.940
All right.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.071
So more practice
on these coming up.

00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:45.570
All right.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.940
So we're continuing on now
with molecular orbital theory,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.080
and we started the course
talking about atomic structure

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.460
and then we talked about atomic
orbitals or wave functions.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.440
And then we moved on to bonding,
that atoms can come together

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.150
and bond and talked about
the structure of molecules,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.820
and now we're going
to molecular orbitals.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.570
And then we'll also talk
more about the structure

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.870
of molecules based on
those molecular orbitals

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.240
on Wednesday.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.290
So we're really coming
all the way around,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.170
we're using a lot of the
ideas that you've seen before,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.580
but now we're applying
them to molecules.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.020
And then, to me, this is
really an exciting part.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.510
I love getting up
to the molecules

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.900
and talking about
structures and molecules

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.920
and how orbitals really play a
role in those properties that

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.260
molecules have.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.530
And then, to me, the really
exciting-- I like reactions.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.800
So after we finish
with the structures,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.312
we're going to talk more
about how molecules react.

00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:47.770
And so on Friday,
we're going to be

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.960
starting that,
reactions of molecules,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.540
and getting into thermodynamics.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.350
So we're sort of winding our way
away from orbitals for a while.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.897
We will come back to d orbitals
around Thanksgiving time,

00:03:59.897 --> 00:04:01.730
but we'll have a long
time before that where

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.500
we're talking about reactions.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.320
So we're about to
do a transition

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.800
in the type of material.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.610
But before we do
that, more orbitals.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.790
But these are super cool because
these are molecular orbitals.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.920
So we're going to talk
today about MO theory, MO

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.750
for molecular orbitals.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.690
So molecular orbital
theory presents the idea

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.210
that these valence
electrons are really

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.540
going to be delocalized
around these molecules

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.280
and not just sitting
on individual atoms.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.470
So to think about this
electron do localization,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.410
we need to think about
molecular orbitals.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.380
Molecular orbitals,
as we've learned,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.710
another word for orbital
is also wave functions.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.960
Wave functions are orbitals.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.700
Orbitals are wave functions.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.570
You need to consider
the wavelike properties

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.320
of electrons to think about
where the electrons are going

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.830
to be, what is their
probability density,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.540
how are they going
to be arranged

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.900
with respect to the nucleus.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.130
And so when we take
atomic orbitals

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.130
and we bring them together
as atoms come together

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.640
to form bonds, atomic
orbitals come together

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.510
to form molecular orbitals.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.430
So we're going to be adding
superimposing, atomic orbitals

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.400
to form these
molecular orbitals.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.480
And this is called a linear
combination of atomic orbitals,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.380
or LCAO.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.370
And so we're going to bring
those atomic orbitals together

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.240
and create molecular orbitals.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.770
And we're going to create two
types of molecular orbitals.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.380
We're going to create
bonding and antibonding.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.220
And some basic math
principles apply here,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.480
and that is that you can
create N molecular orbitals

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.821
from N atomic orbitals.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:55.320
All right.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.810
So that's really the basis
of molecular orbital theory,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.650
and now let's apply it to
our friends, the s orbitals.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.150
All right.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.400
So we're going to think about
really simple molecules,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.720
bringing together two atoms that
are identical with each other

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.790
and what happens to their s
orbitals when this happens.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.410
So first we'll talk
about bonding orbitals.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.700
So bonding orbitals,
again, arise

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.930
from this linear combination
of atomic orbitals, the LCAO.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.750
And if it's a
bonding orbital, it's

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.970
going to arise from
constructive interference.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.520
So we talked before about the
properties of waves, and one

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.720
of the great
properties of waves is

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.550
that they can constructively
interfere, destructively

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.710
interfere.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.120
And orbitals are wave functions
so they can constructively

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.000
interfere and
destructively interfere.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.100
Bonding orbitals
are generated by

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.550
the constructive interference.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.510
So let's look at
two atomic orbitals.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.850
And so here we have an orbital.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.360
The nucleus is in the middle.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.120
It's a little dot.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.310
It's a nucleus.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.070
And these two atomic orbitals
are going to come together.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.060
There's going to
be a bonding event.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.280
And so we have a 1s
orbital from atom a

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.440
and a 1s orbital from
atom b, and they're

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.280
going to come
together, and they're

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.380
going to form a
molecular orbital,

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:23.430
an ab molecular orbital,
and this is called sigma 1s.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:30.110
So a sigma orbital is
symmetric around the bond axis,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.800
so the bond axis here would
be just a vertical, a line

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.660
between these two nuclei here.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.620
And so this molecular orbital
is symmetric around that bond

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.600
axis.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.250
There are no nodal planes for
something that is symmetric.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.870
There are no nodal planes
for our s orbitals,

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.500
and so there's none for the
molecular orbital either.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:02.000
And we can also write
this as 1sa plus 1sb.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.830
So the atomic orbital from 1sa,
the atomic orbital 1sb coming

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.150
together to form
sigma orbital 1s.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.830
That is a bonding
orbital because it's

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.900
constructive interference.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.610
It's a bonding MO,
or molecular orbital.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.830
So now let's consider
the wavelike properties

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.930
and think about these atomic
orbitals coming together

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.590
as waves in what is happening.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.090
So here we have the
same equation up here.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.600
We're bringing
together 1sa and 1sb,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.530
but now let's think about
this as a wave function.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.830
So there is an
amplitude associated

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.370
with the wave function
for 1sa, and there

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.760
is an amplitude associated
with the wave function for 1sb.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.630
These wave functions
come together.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.130
Here is one nuclei,
here's the other nuclei.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.700
And for a bonding
orbital, it will

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.270
be constructive interference,
and so the amplitude

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.630
where these atomic
wave functions overlap

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.120
will be increased when you
have constructive interference.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.600
So our sigma 1s
now has increased

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.980
amplitude between
these two nuclei

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.180
due to that constructive
interference.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.270
So an increased amplitude
between these two nuclei,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.800
again, this is the bonding
axis-- here is one nuclei, here

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.060
is another-- so an
increased amplitude here

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.720
corresponds to an increased or
enhanced probability density.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.360
Remember our wave function
squared is probability density.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.270
It suggests the
likelihood of finding

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.660
an electron in a
certain region of volume

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.970
and if it's enhanced by this
constructive interference.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.500
So if that probability
density is enhanced,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.380
you have a greater
chance of finding

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.350
an electron between these
two nuclei, which will

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.000
be attracted by both nuclei.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.160
So now why don't
you tell me what

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.150
you think is going to
happen to an electron that

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.360
is in this region of
constructive interference,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.568
this increased area of
probability density.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.045
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.440
Interesting.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.080
OK.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:02.240
So we should have probably
not put up the answer there

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.915
and re-pole.

00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:05.900
Yes.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.700
So here, if we have
an electron that's

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.480
attracted to both
nuclei, then we

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.560
want to think about
whether that's

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.950
going to be lower
or higher in energy

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.940
than something in
an atomic orbital.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.940
So if it's attracted
to both, it's

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.580
going to be more
stably bound to those,

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.600
It will be harder to remove
that electron, which means

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.030
that it's lower down in energy.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.450
And so we should look at
that, and we're going to.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:40.530
So the answer is it should
be lower energy, more stable,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.960
harder to remove that electron.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.520
It's in a sweet spot.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.890
It has two
positively-charged nuclei,

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.140
and it's hanging out
right in the middle.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.310
It's very happy.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:56.090
It's going to be more stable,
and that means lower in energy.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.810
All right.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.040
So let's take a look at that.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.910
So the electron is
lower in energy,

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.480
and the bonding
orbital energy is also

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.660
going to be decreased compared
to the atomic orbitals,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.790
and that has to be true if
that's where the electron is.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.030
So let's look at
the atomic orbital

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.040
from a and the atomic
orbital from b.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.310
And now, I'm going to put the
bonding orbital at a lower

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.850
energy level.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.920
First, I was going to
put the electrons on,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.380
and now, I'm going to put the
orbital at a lower energy.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.970
So remember, this is
increasing energy here,

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.000
so the atomic orbitals
would be up here,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.845
whereas the molecular
orbital is down here.

00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:44.220
The molecular bonding orbital
will be lower in energy.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.150
And now we'll put
our electrons there.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.800
So we have one electron
up here and one here,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.720
and so when they
come together, we're

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.780
going to have two electrons
in this molecular orbital.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.930
So when you have
these two electrons

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.370
and they both occupy
the bonding orbital,

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.730
and this is the case
for H2, each H atom

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:10.290
is bringing one electron,
H2 has these two electrons,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.090
and that's going to
make H2 more stable.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:18.090
And we saw that before that
to associate the H2 bonds,

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.450
you have to add energy
into the system.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:26.070
H2 is more stable
than free H plus H.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.340
So when you bring
atomic orbitals together

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.890
and you have constructive
interference, an increased

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.410
probability of electrons
between those two nuclei,

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.200
that's a sweet spot.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.970
Those electrons are going
to be very happy there,

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.200
and that will result in a more
stable, lower energy structure.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.090
That's bonding.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:55.394
But whenever there is a
positive event like this,

00:13:55.394 --> 00:13:57.310
there's always a negative
event because that's

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.890
just how life works.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.450
So we have bonding
orbitals, but we also

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:06.350
have antibonding orbitals.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.690
So antibonding arise from
the linear combination

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:14.740
of atomic orbitals,
LCAO, through

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.430
destructive interference.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.960
So here these are going to
be destructively interfering,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.140
and that will generate
a molecular orbital

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.280
that is an antibonding orbital.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.820
So here are our
little nuclei again,

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.140
and this antibonding orbital
is called sigma 1s star.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.080
So we can write an
equation for this

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.300
as 1sa minus 1sb
equals sigma 1s star.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.440
That is an antibonding
molecular orbital.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.900
And let's just think about
how this kind of shape

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.100
arises considering the
wavelike properties

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.850
of these atomic orbitals.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.440
So I'm going to now move
this equation up to the top.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:10.360
And now, I have my
1sa here, my 1sb here,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.940
and now it's destructive
interference.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.710
So we have opposite phase
of the wave function.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.340
And we'll put up a
wave function there.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.790
Now, the next one has
the opposite phase,

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.940
so they're going to
destructively interfere.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.770
There is overlap
over here, but when

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.430
you have destructive
interference,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.420
then the amplitude
is going to decrease.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.600
So now, when we consider
this destructive interference

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.710
between these two
orbitals, you see that you

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.530
have what arises between them.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.480
Instead of enhanced probability
of finding an electron,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.160
you actually get a node.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.220
So you have decreased
amplitude translates

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:06.240
to decreased probability density
between these two nuclei-- one

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.580
here, one here-- and
that results in a node

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.500
between the two nuclei.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.090
So in the antibonding
orbital, there

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.640
is a much lower
probability that it

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.520
will be in this sweet spot
between the two nuclei

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.860
that have this nice,
positive charge for it's

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.220
little negative
charge, so there's

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.380
pretty much no shot at being
in that nice, sweet spot.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.790
And so what that
ends up meaning is

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.770
that an electron and
an antibonding orbital

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.410
is pretty much excluded
from that internuclear

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.180
region, that region
between those two nuclei,

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.110
and that results in
a molecular orbital

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.310
that has higher energy
than the atomic orbital.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.650
There's just no chance of
being in that wonderful spot.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.610
It's really very sad
for the poor electron

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.140
that has to occupy an
antibonding orbital.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.970
So now, let's put this
on our energy scale.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.780
So we'll go back to
our energy scale.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.940
And we saw before that
when we had 1sa and 1sb

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.869
and you had a sigma
1s, a bonding orbital,

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.020
that was lower in energy.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.500
Electrons that occupy it
are more stable compared

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.329
to their positions in the
atomic orbital, but we also

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:30.150
now have an antibonding orbital
from destructive interference

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.720
between the wave functions
of the atomic orbitals,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.900
and that's higher in energy.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.470
And so that's up here.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.610
So this is what our
diagram is going

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.190
to look like that brings
two atomic orbitals together

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.430
to create two
molecular orbitals.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.670
So the antibonding
orbital up here

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.860
is raised in energy
by the same amount

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.660
that the bonding
energy is lowered.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.900
And so that gives
rise to this diagram.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.370
And importantly,
as I mentioned, we

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.070
have N atomic orbitals
forming N molecular orbitals.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.280
So if we have two
atomic orbitals,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.290
we generate two
molecular orbitals,

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.250
one is bonding, lower in energy,
and one is antibonding, higher

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.151
in energy.

00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:22.650
All right.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.500
So let's take a look
at some examples.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.390
So always start with hydrogen.
So hydrogen has how many

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.262
electrons?

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.160
One hydrogen, hydrogen atom.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.966
AUDIENCE: One.

00:18:39.966 --> 00:18:41.140
CATHERINE DRENNAN: One.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.080
So we have two hydrogen
atoms, and so we

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.430
have two 1s orbitals, 1sa, 1sb.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:53.840
And now where do we want
to put our electrons?

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.160
In the highest energy
possible, lower energy?

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.370
Where do we want to put them?

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.240
AUDIENCE: Lower.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.980
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Always
start with lower energy.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.190
So we're going to
put them down here.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:10.220
And so this is now
the MO diagram for H2.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.180
And we can write the
electron configuration

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.870
for the MO diagram, which you'll
note is a different electron

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.260
configuration than you were
writing when you were looking

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.170
at the periodic table because
now we're not writing it

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.830
in terms of 1s 2, 2s
2, we're writing it

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.750
in terms of molecular orbitals.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.990
And there are some of
these on the problem set,

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.440
and I tried to indicate
example to make

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.300
sure you know what kind
of electron configurations

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.420
we're talking about.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.860
So for MO diagrams, when it
says electron configuration

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.720
we're talking about where the
electrons are with respect

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.470
to the molecular orbitals.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.910
So the answer to this
would be sigma 1s 2.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.120
There are two electrons in the
molecular orbital, sigma 1s.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.630
Good.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:05.704
So that means that you can do
the same thing for dihelium,

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:06.953
and that's a clicker question.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.110
So let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.050
OK, you can vote.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.555
All right.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:21:03.090
So does someone want to
tell me-- that is correct--

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.034
what's number two for?

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:13.702
For hydrogen. What about number
three, what was wrong there?

00:21:13.702 --> 00:21:15.074
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:17.240
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK,
everyone's doing really well.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.740
Yeah.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:24.650
So all of the electrons
were parallel in there,

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.730
and what does that violate?

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.676
What would be true in that case?

00:21:28.676 --> 00:21:30.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.650
And so they'd have the same
four principle quantum numbers.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.120
This is not allowed.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.600
So that one's not good.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.212
And what's wrong with four?

00:21:41.212 --> 00:21:42.821
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:44.820
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah,
star was on the bottom.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.100
So they were flipped around.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.770
Antibonding was lower in energy.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.810
Great.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.950
So we'll just put
those in over here,

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.450
and so we had two electrons.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.050
Helium brings two.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.300
So two went into
the bonding, and two

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.030
went into the antibonding
with opposite spins.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.330
And we have the
bonding, lower energy;

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.191
antibonding, higher energy.

00:22:11.191 --> 00:22:11.690
All right.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:16.980
So then we can put in the
electron configuration here,

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:23.600
and we have sigma 1s
2, sigma 1s star 2,

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.250
so that's the electron
configuration.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.750
Now interestingly,
you see, you have two

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.790
at lower energy and
two at higher energy,

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.630
so there's no net loss
or gain in energy of H2

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.080
compared to just
two helium atoms.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.190
And so that raises the
question, does helium 2 exist?

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.210
So what would molecular
orbital theory

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.900
tell you about whether it
exists, and it would actually

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.650
predict that it does not exist.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.710
And the way that molecular
orbital theory gives you

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.970
these predictions is through
the calculation of something

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.910
called bond order.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.300
So bond order is
half of the number

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.510
of bonding electrons minus
the number of antibonding

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.690
electrons.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:19.730
So let's just write out what the
bond order for helium would be.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.800
So helium 2, our
dihelium molecule.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.670
So we have a bond
order equals 1/2.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.280
There's always 1/2.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.820
And now, the number of
bonding electrons, so

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.060
how many bonding electrons
do we have for helium?

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.066
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:23:42.066 --> 00:23:44.010
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Two.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.555
How many antibonding electrons
do we have for dihelium?

00:23:47.555 --> 00:23:48.355
AUDIENCE: Two

00:23:48.355 --> 00:23:50.280
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Two.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.005
And can someone do
this math for me?

00:23:53.005 --> 00:23:53.761
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:23:53.761 --> 00:23:54.760
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Zero.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.550
Right.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.770
So that would
suggest a bond order

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:02.970
of 0, which means no bond.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:08.430
And let's just compare
that to hydrogen, H2,

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:13.080
which should have a
bond order equal to 1/2.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.620
It's always a 1/2.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.634
In the hydrogen, how many
bonding electrons did we have?

00:24:18.634 --> 00:24:19.238
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:24:19.238 --> 00:24:20.488
CATHERINE DRENNAN: We had two.

00:24:20.488 --> 00:24:23.030
How many antibonding
electrons did we have?

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:23.750
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.770
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Zero.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.120
And the math?

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.995
Bond order is?

00:24:26.995 --> 00:24:27.505
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:24:27.505 --> 00:24:29.280
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 1.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.450
So that means 1 bond
or a single bond.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:42.920
So MO theory would predict that
dihelium, has no bond, i.e.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.690
it's not really a
molecule without a bond,

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.450
but H2 should exist.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.810
So let's take a look at
what experiment tells us,

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:02.340
and it does exist, but
only really not that much.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:08.360
So it was not discovered until
1993, which for some of you

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.570
might seem like quite
a long time ago,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.200
but since we've
been mostly talking

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.120
about discoveries that
were made in the 1800s,

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.100
it took a long time
before someone could

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.030
prove that dihelium existed.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:25.460
And if we look at the bond
association energy for H2,

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:32.502
0.01, and compare
that to H2, 432,

00:25:32.502 --> 00:25:34.840
dihelium really doesn't
exist very much.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:40.670
0 is a much better approximation
of its bond than 1 would be.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.390
It really is not a
very good molecule.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.420
So I would call this a win
for molecular orbital theory.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:53.326
It correctly predicts
that our helium 2 is not

00:25:53.326 --> 00:25:54.700
going to be a very
good molecule,

00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.220
but H2 will be a good
molecule, and that works.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.015
All right.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.860
Now, let's consider 2s.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.740
So 2s orbitals are
analogous to 1s

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.090
except that you have to
remember that they're bigger.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:19.200
So we have our 1s and our 2s,
but for the purposes of this,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.070
it doesn't really matter.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:28.190
So let's look at a diagram
now that has 1s and 2s.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.870
So we have lithium.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.640
So how many electrons
does lithium have?

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.500
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.820
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.410
So we'll put on
lithium, dilithium.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.840
We'll put on lithiums has
two in 1s and one in 2s,

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:50.110
and so we have one lithium
here and one lithium over here.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.600
And our 1s orbitals are
going to be lower energy,

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.930
so they're down here.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.770
Our 2s orbitals are
higher in energy.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.830
So that goes for both the atomic
and the molecular orbitals

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.400
that are generated.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:09.280
So bringing together 1s with
1s, we get sigma 1s and also

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.290
sigma star 1s.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.180
And so we can start
putting our electrons in.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.210
We're going to start with the
lowest energy and move on up.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.470
So we have four electrons
that we need to put in,

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.040
so we fill up everything here.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.720
And now we go up to our 2s.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.510
The 2s orbitals will generate
signal 2s and sigma 2s star.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:36.020
We have two electrons, so
they both can go down here.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.230
So here is what our
MO diagram looks like.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.500
We can write out the
electron configuration again,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.840
based on this diagram.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.970
So we have two electrons in
sigma 1s, so we have a 2 there.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:54.460
We have two electrons in
sigma 1s star, our antibonding

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:59.540
orbital, and we have two
electrons in sigma 2s.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.420
And now we can calculate
the bond order, which

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.847
is another clicker question.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.490
OK, just 10 more seconds.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.760
Excellent.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.780
84%.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:48.320
So if we do out the math
here, we always have our 1/2.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.510
We have four bonding electrons.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.990
We have two down
here and two up here.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:58.450
We have two antibonding
electrons in our sigma 1s star,

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.250
and so that gives us
a bond order of 1.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.790
And in fact, the
dissociation energy

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.410
does suggest there is a bond.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.350
It's not a great bond.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.860
It's 105 kilojoules per mole,
not necessarily enough to power

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:18.290
a starship, but still
this molecule does exist.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.040
All right.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.690
So let's look at beryllium
now, do another example.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:31.180
So how many electrons is
beryllium going to have?

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.230
It will have four.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.300
So we'll put those up.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.670
Now, we're going to start with
our lowest energy orbital,

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.020
and we're going to put some
in the antibonding as well.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.740
And then we'll do this,
and then we'll do that.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.520
And we filled up everything.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.460
And so we can write
out our configuration.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:57.050
We have two in our
sigma 1s orbital.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.140
We have two in
our sigma 1s star.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:05.430
We have two in our sigma 2s,
and two in our sigma 2s star

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.060
antibonding orbital there.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.130
And now there are
two different ways

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.850
that I can calculate
the bond order here,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.470
and we'll do both of them and
show you that they come out

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.230
the same way.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.430
One way that we
can calculate this

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.580
is to consider all electrons.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.190
So if we consider all
electrons, our bond order,

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:36.380
and that's often just said
B.O., is 1/2 of our bonding.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.690
And now we can count up
both the 1s and the 2s.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:43.430
So how many bonding
electrons do we have?

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:53.920
We should have four, so we have
two here, two here, so four.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.430
How many antibonding?

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:03.370
Also four, so that
suggest a bond order of 0.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:08.170
Or we could just consider
our valence electrons,

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.630
so that would be
the electrons in 2s,

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.550
and if we do that,
bond order equals 1/2.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.930
It's always a 1/2, so how
many valence electrons

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.490
do we have in bonding orbitals?

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.370
Two.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.980
How many in
antibonding orbitals?

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.620
Two.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.530
And that gives the answer of 0.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:32.860
So it should always work unless
you do something very strange.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.250
You should be able to do it both
ways and get the same answer.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.290
So if this is a
complicated problem,

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.200
you might want to only
consider the valence electrons.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.230
In fact, on a test,
you may only be

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.090
asked to draw the
molecular orbital diagrams

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.020
for the valence
electrons, and you don't

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.740
have to do the other ones.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.010
So that should work both ways.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.940
And we get a bond order
of 0, and in fact,

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.980
the dissociation energy is
only 9 kilojoules per mole.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.020
It's a little stronger
than dihelium,

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.970
but this is an
exceedingly weak molecule.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.310
So when you have the same
number of electrons and bonding

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:18.186
as antibonding, it doesn't
lead to a very strong molecule.

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.400
All right.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.610
That's the orbitals.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:27.150
Now, it's time for molecules
that have p orbitals as well.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:37.610
So in this case, now I have my
p orbital and another p orbital.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:42.064
And we have our
nuclei in the middle,

00:32:42.064 --> 00:32:43.730
and we're going to
bring these together,

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.370
and we will have
constructive interference.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.940
And so here we're
bringing together

00:32:50.940 --> 00:33:00.740
2p x of a and 2p xb
or 2p ya and 2p yb.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.660
So just x and y we're
considering right now.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:11.100
And if we bring those together
with constructive interference,

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.150
then we're going to form
a bonding orbital that

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:19.390
has enhanced probability
density in both cases

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.920
and nodal plane
along the bond axis

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.100
because we had nodal planes
along there to begin with.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.540
So if we think about this
and we have both of these,

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.660
we're bringing them
together and they're

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.270
going to interfere
constructively, enhance

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.720
probability density here,
enhance probability density

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.750
down here, but we still have
our nodal plane because we

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.510
started out with one.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:52.440
And so if we have a nodal plane,
this cannot be a sigma orbital.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.630
It has to be a pi orbital,
because sigma orbitals are not

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.340
going to have a nodal plane
along the bonding access.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:01.840
All right.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:09.699
So we could generate pi
2px or pi 2py this way.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.429
So a pi orbital is
a molecular orbital

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.900
that has a nodal plane through
the bond axis or maybe I

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.429
should say along the bond axis,
so here is our nodal plane

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.263
right through the bond axis.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:30.909
We can also have
antibonding, which

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.690
means destructive interference.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.650
So now, I'm going
to be subtracting

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:38.760
one of these from
one of these, and I'm

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.130
going to get something
that looks like this,

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:51.780
and it will be pi 2px
star or pi 2py star,

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.179
and it will have
two nodal planes.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:57.355
So let's look at this.

00:34:57.355 --> 00:34:59.430
So this is destructive
interference.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.780
I'm subtracting one of
these from one of these,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.910
so the phase has to change.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.230
So I'm going to change
the phase on one of them

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.060
and then bring them together.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.760
Now, we're not going to have
that awesome, constructive

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.760
interference increased
probability density.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.820
These are negatively
interacting with each other.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:23.510
And this generates a nodal
plane between the molecules.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.990
They really look much
more like this now,

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.400
so we have still our nodal
plane through the bond.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.390
We had that before.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:31.780
We're always going to have that.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.780
But now we have an additional
nodal plane between the nuclei.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.950
So in one case, we have enhanced
density, probability density

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:41.450
again.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.950
And the other case,
in antibonding,

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.600
we have another nodal plane.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.160
All right.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.660
So now, let's look
at what happens

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:55.170
to the energies of
these pi orbitals.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.360
And the diagrams that
I'm about to show you,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.750
we're only talking
about px and py now.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.320
We have for the
moment forgotten 2pz.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.850
So these diagrams are
rated I for incomplete.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.140
Warning to the viewer,
people come to me

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.790
and go where are the 2pz?

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.740
Yes, they're not
in these diagrams,

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.450
but when you're asked
for a complete diagram,

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.085
you will always have to
put those orbitals in.

00:36:22.085 --> 00:36:24.600
And in fact, completing
these diagrams

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.220
could be a question
you get later.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.710
But for now, we're
going to have 2pz here,

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.880
but it's not forming a molecular
orbital in this diagram.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.170
This diagram is,
thus, incomplete,

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.980
but we're going to start simple
and build more complicated.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.280
So only 2p orbitals first, and
then we'll add the third one.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.230
Because this compound doesn't
actually need that orbital,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.450
so we're good for now.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:51.950
All right.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.680
So we have moved on to
the first element that has

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.000
a p electron in a p orbital.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.280
We have boron, and
we have two of them.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:08.430
So now I dropped off
1s to simplify this.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.990
Now, we just have our
valence electrons,

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.900
so it's a good thing we can
calculate bond order just using

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.360
our valence electrons.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:15.860
All right.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:21.390
So we have two in 2s
and one in 2px or 2py.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.210
I could have put
it in either place.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:26.690
So let's put in
where they would go.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.250
So we have 2s orbitals.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.120
They'll go into bonding
sigma 2s first, then

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:43.400
into antibonding, sigma 2s star,
and now we have p electrons,

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.490
and we're going to put
them into our pi orbitals,

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.960
our molecular orbitals.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.170
I'll put one in, and where am
I going to put the other one?

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.235
Am I going to put it
next to it or over here?

00:37:54.235 --> 00:37:55.370
What do you think?

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:56.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.840
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.820
So we're going to do that
because, again, when you're

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.890
going to sit on a bus, you want
to have if they're degenerate

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.340
in energy levels
as they are here,

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.070
you're always going to put
one electron in each orbital

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.190
of the same energy first
before you pair them up,

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.970
and they'll have parallel spins.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:18.140
So we're reviewing
things we learned before.

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.720
I love doing that.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.210
So now, let's see what our
electron configuration is,

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:29.260
and this is just the valence
electron configuration.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.130
We're simplifying.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.730
We're not going to
consider the 1s orbital,

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:35.000
and we can write this down.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.660
So we have two
electrons in sigma 2s,

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.880
and we have two electrons in
sigma 2s star, our antibonding

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:50.250
orbital, and we have one in
pi 2px and one in pi 2py.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.940
And I can put a
1 or not put a 1.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:57.890
If I don't put anything,
for a 1, 1 is assumed.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:02.080
And we can calculate
our bond order as well.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.380
So we have 1/2, and
again, we're just

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.170
using our valence
electrons, but that's OK.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:11.580
We have four now who are
bonding, two down here, two

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.960
up here, these are
bonding orbitals,

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.580
and we have two that
are antibonding.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.960
And notice for our
pi orbitals, this

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.200
is what we saw before
bonding are lower in energy,

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.500
antibonding are
higher in energy.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.810
With the bonding orbitals, we
had constructive interference,

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:31.590
enhanced probability of the
electrons near the nuclei,

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.650
and so that's lower in energy.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.710
But in our antibonding
ones, we have a nodal plane

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.230
in between our nuclei.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.860
So we don't have any
probability that electrons

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.740
are right in between there
because there's a nodal plane,

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.600
so those are higher in energy.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.670
So here is our B2 diagram.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:55.410
So now let's try the same
thing for carbon, C2,

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.000
and that is a clicker question.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.040
All right.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.756
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.270
So let's take a look
at that over here.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.490
The easiest thing to do
to answer this question

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:50.600
was to fill in the
diagram in your handout.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.910
And so if you did that, you
would have put two down here

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:58.760
and you would have
put two up here.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:04.070
Then you would have put
one here, one there,

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.880
another one there,
and another one there.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:15.710
So now we have used these
up, and so our configuration

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:27.270
is sigma 2s 2, sigma star
2, pi 2px 2, pi 2py 2.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.270
And the bond order is 1/2.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:35.540
There are six bonding
electrons-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.790
and two antibonding
electrons, and so that adds up

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.660
to a bond order of 2.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.750
And so sometimes
on a test, they'll

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.760
be a simple question what is
the bond order, but to get there

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:53.260
you have to draw your whole
molecular orbital diagram

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.430
and figure out how many bonding
and how many antibonding,

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.507
so these are not really
that fast questions.

00:41:59.507 --> 00:42:00.090
And it's nice.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:01.839
Sometimes we give you
like a little space,

00:42:01.839 --> 00:42:04.800
and you see this whole little
molecular orbital diagram

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.590
fit in there to
answer the question.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.090
All right.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.450
So let's just compare these
two diagrams for a minute.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:18.470
So in both cases, we had 2s
orbitals, two atomic orbitals

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:23.610
for 2s, and they both generated
two molecular orbitals,

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.050
a bonding and an antibonding.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.810
The bonding is lower in
energy, and the antibonding

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:30.520
is higher in energy.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.590
We also had two 2px
atomic orbitals.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:41.320
They generated 2
pi 2 px orbitals,

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.450
one bonding, one antibonding.

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:49.130
And the same for our two
atomic orbitals for 2 py.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.270
We had two of those, and they
generated one lower energy

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:58.500
bonding, pi, bonding and
one pi star antibonding.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.220
So you always have N
atomic orbitals generating

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.390
N molecular orbitals.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:09.150
So the stability of
the resulting molecules

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.440
in these cases depend on
how many of the electrons

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.540
are bonding, how many
are in energy lower

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.070
as a result of formation
of the molecule,

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:22.370
and how many are at higher
energy as a result of formation

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:23.570
of the molecule.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:27.410
And if the net result are more
electrons in lower energy, more

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.620
electrons in bonding
orbitals, then that molecule

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.820
is more stable.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.920
If there's a very
slight or no difference,

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.600
then that's not a
very stable molecule.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.820
So now let's just
compare these two

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:44.640
and think about which of these
is going to be more stable.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.000
So we have our
configurations again.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.020
So in the case of B2,
how many electrons

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.470
are in lower energy
or bonding orbitals?

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:55.745
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:55.745 --> 00:43:58.590
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah,
we have four-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.010
How many in higher?

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:00.892
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:44:00.892 --> 00:44:01.850
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Two.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.370
Up here.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:10.720
For carbon, we had six-- 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6-- two in higher.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:16.080
And so the bond order here was
1, the bond order here was 2.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.000
Which is more stable?

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.496
Higher dissociation energy,
which one do you think?

00:44:22.496 --> 00:44:23.412
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:23.412 --> 00:44:24.680
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Carbon.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.310
Right.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.100
Has a bond order of two.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.150
It has more electrons in
lower energy orbitals.

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:35.000
So it cannot really well
out of this bonding deal,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:43.350
and the dissociation energy for
B2, 289, whereas, for C2, 599.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:49.000
So when molecules come together
such that more of the electrons

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.270
are in lower energy
or bonding orbitals,

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.630
you form a nice,
stable molecule.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.950
When molecules come
together such that more

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.750
of their electrons are an
antibonding or higher energy,

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.660
that's not a happy molecule.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.840
So I'll just and with one
way to think about this.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.990
In this cartoon
molecular, break up lines,

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.950
sometimes two atoms just
have an incompatible number

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.880
of valence electrons.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.960
And there are just too many--
just here this molecule saying,

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.830
I'm sorry.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.560
Too many of your electrons
are in my antibonding regions.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.050
I don't know how many
times we've all heard that,

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:32.610
but it's time to dissociate, but
our atomic orbitals, well, they

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:34.360
can still be friends.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:34.870
OK.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.960
See you on Wednesday.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.550
Take a look at the
clicker question.

00:45:59.350 --> 00:45:59.850
All right.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.130
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:23.920
All right.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.410
Let's just go through this one.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.683
So this is a review of
where we were last time.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:35.600
So the correct answer is 1.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:43.250
So sigma orbitals are
cylindrically symmetrical.

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:45.190
Let's quiet down a minute.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.610
You can hear the answer.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.240
So this one is true.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.300
The second one is not true.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.140
A bond order of zero
doesn't mean that you just

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.810
have antibonding orbitals.

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.640
Whenever you bring together
two atomic orbitals,

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.190
you have to make two
molecular orbitals.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.990
So it isn't that sometimes
you make bonding orbitals

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.360
and sometimes you make
antibonding orbitals.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.140
Every time you bring
together two atomic orbitals,

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.346
you make two molecular orbitals,
one that's lower in energy,

00:47:14.346 --> 00:47:15.970
and that's the bonding
orbital, and one

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:20.300
that's higher in energy, and
that's the antibonding orbital.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.790
So that is not what that means.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.590
A bond order of
zero means that you

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.260
have equal numbers of electrons
in your bonding and antibonding

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.360
orbitals.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:32.400
So there's no net stabilization
due to the formation

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.210
of these bonds.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.340
So here bonding occurs
when you bring together

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.690
two atomic orbitals to make
two molecular orbitals that

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:43.120
are both of lower energy.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:43.720
No.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.630
Every time you make the two
orbitals, one is lower energy,

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:48.790
one is higher that energy.

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.370
You can't make two that
are both lower in energy.

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.000
And bond order of 1 means
constructive interference

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.370
is generated at one
bonding orbital.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.460
That's not what a
bond order of 1 is.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.740
And again, every time you
generate a bonding orbital,

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.780
you generate an
antibonding orbital.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:10.360
And 1 means that you have
twice as many electrons

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.790
in your bonding orbitals
as antibonding orbitals

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.700
because the formula is
1/2 the number of bonding

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.620
minus antibonding.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.360
But that's good, and it's
important to remember

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:25.640
that sigma orbitals are
symmetric around the bond axis.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.140
All right.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.830
So we had these diagrams
for boron and carbon,

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:37.400
just talking about the
interactions of the px and py,

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.350
and so we had
forgotten about our pz.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.810
And you can't do that on a test.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.350
You get into trouble,
so I'm always

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.240
telling people for
these two handouts,

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.360
you must include the
molecular orbitals that

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.640
are derived from p to z.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.120
So on a test, you need to put
them even if they're empty.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.160
Even if they don't
have anything in them,

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.659
they need to be part of your
molecular orbital diagram.

00:48:58.659 --> 00:49:00.075
We didn't have
them in the diagram

00:49:00.075 --> 00:49:01.900
because we hadn't
talked about them yet,

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.100
so now we're going
to talk about them.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.690
So two pz orbitals, again,
this is on Monday's handout.

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:14.270
You have this linear
combination of atomic orbitals.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.850
And all are p orbitals.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:17.760
They all look the
same as each other,

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.470
they're just different
in orientation.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.860
You have one along x,
one along y, one along z,

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.200
but they're the same.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:30.150
So now we're going to bring
our two pz orbitals together,

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.320
and we're going to do it
along the bonding axis.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.790
So we've defined this as the
bonding axis in the class,

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:38.620
so we'll bring them
together, and they'll

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.675
be constructive interference
with our bonding orbitals.

00:49:42.675 --> 00:49:44.550
There's always constructive
interference that

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.650
generates bonding orbitals.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:53.730
And so we're going to create a
enhanced amplitude as the wave

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.730
functions come
together, and it's

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:59.120
going to be
cylindrically symmetric.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.190
So what type of orbital do
you think this is going to be,

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:03.175
sigma or pi?

00:50:03.175 --> 00:50:04.030
AUDIENCE: Sigma.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.530
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
It'll be sigma

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:09.380
because it's
cylindrically symmetric.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:14.440
So we do not have any bonding
plane along the bond axis,

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.730
and it's symmetric around.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:20.530
And we have enhanced
probability density,

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.590
and we have the wave
function squared

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.590
enhanced probability of having
an electron between the two

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.700
nuclei.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:31.730
And so this is a sigma 2pz.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:37.100
So p orbitals can form
sigma molecular orbitals.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.120
So we do have nodes
passing through our nuclei.

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.680
Here are our nuclei again.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.520
We do have them.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.900
They were here before
in our p orbitals.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:51.240
There's the nodal plane in our
p orbitals, but we do not have,

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.220
in this case, a node
along the bond axis.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.910
So that is our bonding.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:02.720
So whenever you generate
a bonding orbital, which

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.520
is going to be
lower energy, we're

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.780
going to have our increased
amplitude between the nuclei,

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.430
again, our increased probability
density and therefore,

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.100
lower energy.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.310
So whenever you have
constructive interference

00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:21.180
generating a molecular
orbital of lower energy,

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.260
you got to create
something of higher energy.

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.140
That's just how life works.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.520
So we also are going
to have antibonding

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.814
orbitals, which are generated
by destructive interference.

00:51:31.814 --> 00:51:33.480
And again, these
orbitals can be thought

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.890
about as wave functions,
and a property of waves

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:39.370
is that they constructively
interfere and destructively

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:40.330
interfere.

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:45.040
So now we can subtract
our two orbitals,

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.010
which we're going
to switch the sign

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:50.410
and they're going
to be out of phase.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.780
So they'll
destructively interfere,

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.560
and that's going
to look like this.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.460
So now, you're going to generate
a nodal plane between the two

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.890
nuclei, but it's still
symmetric around the bond axis.

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:12.270
So this is a sigma 2pz star,
so it's an antibonding orbital.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.960
So again, it's
sigma, so it's still

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:19.750
cylindrically symmetrical with
no nodal plane along that bond

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:25.210
axis, but you do have a new
nodal plane that's generated.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:28.400
So nodes pass, again,
through the nuclei,

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.970
but also now between
these two orbitals.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:33.600
So we have a new
nodal plane that's

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.490
generated that's
between these nuclei,

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:41.160
and that's a result of
destructive interference.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.980
Generates that nodal plane.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:46.310
You have decreased
probability density

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:50.040
for an electron
being found there.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.880
And so that poor electron is
shut out of that sweet spot.

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.800
The electrons like to be
between those two nuclei

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.800
where they have the two positive
charges of the nuclei and then

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.600
their little negative charge,
and they can sit right there

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.530
and be very happy in
a low-energy state.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.940
But here there's really
lower probability density,

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.840
lower likelihood the
electron will be found here,

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.730
and that generates
a molecular orbital

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:18.370
that's antibonding
or higher in energy.

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:18.870
All right.

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:21.400
So now, we have to go
back to our MO diagrams

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.050
and figure out where to put
these new molecular orbitals

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:27.550
onto our nice diagrams.

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:32.440
And it's not as simple as
it was before because where

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:37.630
we put these new sigma 2pz
molecular orbitals depends

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:40.100
on what z is.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.800
So it depends on the value of z.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.840
So if z is less than
the magic number of 8,

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:57.570
then we have our pi 2px and 2py
orbitals are lower in energy

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:02.980
than our sigma 2pz
molecular orbital.

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:09.250
But if we are equal
to or greater than 8,

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:14.810
then the sigma 2pz
orbital is lower energy

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:19.080
than the pi 2px and 2py.

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.780
So less than 8, pi is first.

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:27.560
It's lower in energy as you
go up your energy scale.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:32.710
And if z is equal to or
greater than 8, pi is second

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:35.530
and sigma is first.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:37.390
So how are you going
to remember this?

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.730
There could be many different
ways one can remember it,

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:41.770
but I'll tell you
how I remember it.

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:47.780
And my life revolves around
my daughter and my dog.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.260
And so at Thanksgiving, we
always have the question,

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:53.980
can I eat pie first?

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:58.430
So if you are
under the age of 8,

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:02.530
you always want your pie first.

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:08.120
So if z is less than
8, pi comes first.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.920
Pi is lower in energy
and sigma is higher.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.670
However, when you mature
to the grand age of 9,

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:19.280
say, or 10, if
you were a kid, 10

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.090
is like the oldest
you can possibly

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:23.480
imagine being, very mature.

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.230
And you can eat your
Thanksgiving dinner

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:26.700
and wait for pie.

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.920
So that is how I
would remember it,

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:34.230
under 8 pi is first,
equal to 8 or greater,

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.650
you can wait till after
dinner to have your pie,

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:38.710
pi comes second.

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:42.010
Note that the ordering of
the antibonding orbitals

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:45.440
is the same, so all
you have to remember

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:53.420
is down here depends on z,
is pi first or is pi second?

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.020
So let's take a
look at an example.

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:59.090
Let's look at our friend
molecular oxygen that has a z

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:00.650
equal to 8.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:05.310
So oxygen is at the
old, mature age of 8,

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:08.710
and so it's going to
have its sigma 2pz first.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:12.520
It can wait for its pi
orbitals until later.

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.130
So let's start putting
in our electrons.

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:20.830
So we have each oxygen making
up molecular oxygen, or O2.

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:26.570
Brings two 2s orbitals to the
Thanksgiving dinner table,

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.350
and two of them
go down in energy

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:33.280
into the bonding sigma
2s orbital and two

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:38.750
go into our antibonding,
sigma star 2s orbital.

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:44.940
Now, we have four
electrons in our atomic pz

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.450
orbitals, four
from each molecule,

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:50.010
so we need to put
all of those in.

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:53.080
So we always start with
the lowest energy orbital.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.980
So we'll put two in
there, then we'll go up.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.590
We have two more
here, two more here.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:02.050
We'll put them in singly
with their spins parallel,

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.240
and then we'll pair them up
in the lowest energy orbitals.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.080
And then we have two
more left, so we're

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:11.200
going to have to put those up
in our antibonding orbitals.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:18.570
So they go into pi 2px and
pi 2py star orbitals up here.

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:19.090
All right.

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:23.260
So now we can calculate
the bond order for oxygen,

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:24.530
and that's a clicker question.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.420
All right.

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.070
Let's just take 10 more seconds.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.360
All right.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.000
So let's take a look over here.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.120
So bond order, again,
is 1/2 the number

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.480
of bonding electrons minus
the number of antibonding

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.250
electrons.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:30.280
And we have eight bonding--
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.870
And we have four
antibonding-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.830
So that gives us
a bond order of 2.

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:38.452
And the bond order
equation is one

00:58:38.452 --> 00:58:39.660
that you do have to memorize.

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.890
That will not be given
to you on an exam.

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:47.670
And with a bond order of 2,
we have a pretty big number

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:49.390
for dissociation energy.

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:52.350
Again, that's energy you have
to put into a bond to break it,

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:56.160
to dissociate it, and that
means it's a pretty strong bond

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.290
if it's a big number.

00:58:57.290 --> 00:59:00.580
If you need a lot of energy,
that's a strong bond.

00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:03.880
Another thing that you
can see from this diagram

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.080
is that O2 is a biradical.

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:15.390
It has two lone pair electrons,
so two unpaired electrons,

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:18.770
which also makes
it paramagnetic,

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:21.240
or attracted to
a magnetic field.

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:23.640
So whenever you have
unpaired electrons,

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.050
you will have a
paramagnetic species,

00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:28.230
and diamagnetic means
they're all paired.

00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:31.200
And so there are some questions
on problem sets and on exams,

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.490
so you need to know the
definitions of those.

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:34.270
All right.

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:37.050
So we talked about this when
we were doing Lewis structures,

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:38.630
if you recall.

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:42.700
And we drew a beautiful Lewis
structure of molecular oxygen

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.950
that had two lone pairs on
each oxygen and a double bond.

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.330
But I told you that
that was not really

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:53.410
a complete description
of molecular oxygen,

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:56.810
that molecular oxygen
was actually a biradical,

00:59:56.810 --> 01:00:00.360
but you would not get a hint of
that from the Lewis structure.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:05.030
So if you draw the Lewis
structure as a biradical,

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.940
then you have a
single electron here

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.830
and a single electron
there and a single bond.

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:13.300
But we also see
the bond orders 2,

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.930
so this one describes
the biradical nature,

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:19.300
but doesn't really
describe that double bond

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.860
character that it has.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.100
So neither of these Lewis
structures really completely

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:28.460
describe molecular
oxygen. And we

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.020
need our molecular orbital
diagram to really help

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:36.080
us understand the properties
of molecular oxygen,

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.330
that it's pretty
strong bond between it,

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:42.920
it has double bond character,
but it also is very reactive.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.270
It's a biradical.

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:46.710
So this is just a
bizarre molecule.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:51.000
And really that is why this
diagram right here really tells

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.120
us why our life, our
planet is what it is,

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.720
right here, that describes it.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.230
It's because of
oxygen that we have

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.920
the life forms that we did.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.960
Life was very different
on this planet

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.300
before molecular
oxygen came about.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:12.010
You did have microbes that lived
anaerobically without oxygen.

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:15.040
But when oxygen came,
everything changed.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.900
And so if I say, can
you explain life to me?

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.670
You can draw this,
and there it is.

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:25.680
This explains life as
we know it because life

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.980
as we know it exists because of
this crazy molecule that is O2,

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.680
nothing else really like it.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.760
It is an amazing molecule
that allows us to live.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.805
So there you go.

01:01:37.805 --> 01:01:40.180
I was going to say you don't
learn anything in chemistry.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.510
This diagram I
just explains life

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:45.160
as we know it to
you, right there.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.450
All right.

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:50.060
It's not just oxygen, there's a
few other elements that, yeah,

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.601
are pretty important,
and one of them

01:01:51.601 --> 01:01:54.400
is nitrogen. We wouldn't
really be much anywhere

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.960
without nitrogen either.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.920
Oxygen is, no, nitrogen
is pretty special too.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.120
This also helps.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.870
Maybe these two
molecular orbital

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:05.450
diagrams really sum
up life as we know it.

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.950
All right.

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:10.280
So let's look at
molecular nitrogen, N2.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.750
So we have two electrons
in our 2s orbitals,

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.610
so we're going to
bring them together.

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:20.050
We're going to put two in the
lower energy orbital, our sigma

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:23.820
2s, and two in our
antibonding orbital.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.580
And then we have three
in our p orbitals

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.660
from this nitrogen, three
electrons from this nitrogen,

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.890
and so we'll put them down here.

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:36.510
We'll put in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:40.040
So we didn't need to use any
of these antibonding orbitals,

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.190
and this is a z
less than 8 case.

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:45.900
So here we have our
pi orbitals first

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:50.520
because it is z less than 8.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.760
So let's look at
the bond order here.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:59.735
And the bond order is 1/2
of 8-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:03.720
8-- eight bonding
electrons and just

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.930
these two antibonding electrons,
so 1/2 of 8 minus 2 is 3.

01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:13.740
And you have a really big number
for your dissociation energy,

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.680
941.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.300
This is a very stable
molecule, and you

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.900
can draw the Lewis structure of
this without much difficulty.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.330
This one works quite well,
and you get a triple bond

01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:28.530
and two lone pairs.

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:30.780
So this would be a
diamagnetic molecule,

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:35.300
no unpaired electrons,
no radicals here.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.740
But this is a
crazy, strong bond.

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:42.530
It's really hard
to split nitrogen

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.500
because of this triple bond.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.190
And molecular orbital
theory tells you

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.770
it should be its triple bond.

01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:52.440
It should be really,
really strong interactions

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.816
between these nitrogens.

01:03:53.816 --> 01:03:55.190
And so this is a
very hard thing.

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:56.856
We want to do is
industrially, and we'll

01:03:56.856 --> 01:03:59.480
talk more about this when we
get a chemical equilibrium.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.110
How do you split
the nitrogen bond.

01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:06.060
This is actually, currently,
a big area of research,

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.036
how you break that bond because
we need nitrogen for life.

01:04:09.036 --> 01:04:10.160
And so how do you split it?

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.840
There's lots of nitrogen
N2 in the atmosphere,

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.010
but we need it here,
and we need it usable,

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:18.580
so we need to break
that bond to use it.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.670
So we'll come back to this
in chemical equilibrium

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:23.920
and how people are able to
split the nitrogen bond.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.420
So forget man of steel.

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.020
We should have man of
nitrogen. That's strong.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.170
Nitrogen is strong.

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:30.560
Forget steel.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.450
Man of nitrogen.

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:39.600
One more thing to do before
we move on to today's handout

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.350
and this is really
fast, you can also

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:45.380
be asked to draw molecular
orbital diagrams where

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.650
both atoms are not the same.

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:51.600
So if you were asked
to do that, you

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.450
can use the following rules.

01:04:54.450 --> 01:05:01.230
If z is less than 8 for
both atoms, pi is first.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:07.840
If z is not less than
8 for both atoms,

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.770
it's hard to know
what to do, so you

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.000
don't need to know what to do.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.230
And that's it.

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.240
So we might tell you
something about it

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.340
and then you can do
it, but otherwise, just

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.240
worry about things
when z is less than 8.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.150
So that's molecular
orbital theory.

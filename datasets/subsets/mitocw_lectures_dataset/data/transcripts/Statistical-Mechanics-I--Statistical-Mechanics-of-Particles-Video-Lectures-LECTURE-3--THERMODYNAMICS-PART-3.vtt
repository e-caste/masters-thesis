00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.070
PROFESSOR: So what
we've been trying

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.730
to do is to develop a
description of properties

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.700
of some system,
could be something

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.080
like a gas, that includes
both mechanical as well

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.880
as thermal properties.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.620
So the first thing
that we decided to do

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.090
was to wait until
this system has

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.940
properties that do not change.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.340
Further, with the
observation time

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.440
that we are assigning
to this system,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.160
and then if it is
a gas we can say,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.000
OK the gas has some
pressure and volume.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.190
In general, we said that we
can characterize the system

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.810
through a set of displacements
and the conjugate forces which

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.610
are used when we describe
systems that are mechanical.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.790
Work on them is done.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.790
We can say that the work
is Jdx, for example.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.420
OK?

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.310
Then we decided that this
mechanical description

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.210
was not enough because
systems could exchange heat

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.780
and gradually started to build
a more general prescription that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.540
included the exchange of heat.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.350
We saw that, for example,
from the zeroth law,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.310
we could define temperature as
a function of these quantities.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.920
And that we could also, from
the first law define energy.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.740
And in particular that
the change in energy,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.070
which is a function of where
you are in equilibrium.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.440
So once you say that you
have a system in equilibrium

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.060
you can say what the values
of the x's and J's are.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.720
You know somehow what
the value of temperature

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.650
is, what the value of energy is.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.390
And if you were to
make a change in energy

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.350
by some external means
the amount of change

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.470
would either come
from mechanical work

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.657
that you did on the
system, or the heat

00:02:23.657 --> 00:02:24.990
that you supplied to the system.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.390
Now this expression
is the one that you

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.790
would like to elevate somehow
and be able to compute energy

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.660
as a function of state.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.760
Kind of keeping in
mind what we would

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.930
do if there was no heat around.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.640
And we could do things
mechanically, then mechanically

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.570
we could in principle build up
the energy function by changing

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.770
displacements lightly and
calculating the amount of work

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.451
by this formula.

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.770
And basically we
emphasized that you

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.040
would be able to use
a formula such as this

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.800
if you were to make
things sufficiently slowly

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.960
so that at each
stage in the process

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.430
you can calculate
what Ji is, which

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.340
means that at each
stage in the process

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.941
you should be in some kind
of an equilibrium state.

00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:26.440
OK?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.790
If that was the case, if
you didn't have dQ then

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.840
this would be your
energy function

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.430
and actually once you had the
energy function you could,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.280
for example, calculate J
as a derivative of energy

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.050
with respect to x.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.980
So then you also start
thinking about how many

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.750
independent degrees
of freedom do I have.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.710
Do I really need all of the
set of x's and J's to describe

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.340
my system in equilibrium.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.740
If additionally once I know the
e, I can derive all of the J's.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.480
So we have to also
come eventually

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.030
to grips with how many
independent degrees of freedom

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.990
will describe our system.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.360
Now the first step towards
completing this expression

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.250
was to find what dQ is.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.329
So we needed another
law of thermodynamics

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.190
beyond zeroth law and first
law that somehow related

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.890
heat and temperature
to each other.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.780
As we expect that
somehow this expression

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.330
will leave you temperature.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.930
And what we used was some
version of the second law.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.260
That was there how heat would
flow from, say, a hot air body

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.160
to a cold air body.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.970
And Clausius's theorem would say
that you have only heat flowing

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.494
in one particular direction.

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:57.100
Well, we sort of
introduced the idea

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.490
of engines, which
are machines that

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:10.690
are used to do work by taking
heat from the heart air body

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.830
to the cold air body.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.210
And we could define
an efficiency,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.810
which is work divided by heat
input, which since work is

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.180
the difference between these
two we could write as 1 minus Qc

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.680
over Qh.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.900
And then we introduced
this special class

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.030
of engines, which were
these Carnot engines.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.200
And the idea of this class
was that you could run them

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.390
forward and backward.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.450
They were kind of reversible.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.830
The were kind of a analogue
of the frictionless type

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.200
of processes that you would use
to construct mechanical energy.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.650
And we found that these engines
were the most efficient.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.310
And so the efficiency
of these engines

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.980
was marked only by
the two temperatures.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.520
So we had the functional form
potentially of efficiency

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.520
as a function of the two
temperatures involved.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.430
And what we also showed
was that the efficiency

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.330
of any random engine
was going to be

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.670
less than the efficiency
of the Carnot engine

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.360
that is marked by
these two temperatures.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.290
And by putting some
Carnot engines in series,

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.740
we saw that the good
way to write this

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.930
was something of this form.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.110
I can in principle
remove the one

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.540
from the two sides
of this equation

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.640
and rearrange it a
little bit into the form

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:03.330
Qh over Th plus minus Qc over
Tc because of this inequality

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.811
writing it as less
than or equal to 0.

00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:09.090
OK?

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.510
What does that tell us?

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.620
As it stands, not much.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.660
But then I promised you
at the end of last lecture

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.090
then this is an example of
a much more powerful result,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.380
which is the Clausius Theorem.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.900
So let's start with writing
what that theorem is

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.985
and how it relates to
a simple expression.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:50.970
And the theory is that
for any cyclic process

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.800
I can, cyclic,
what does it mean?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.600
Is that in the set of
coordinates in principle

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.980
that is used to
describe the system,

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.810
I will start with the
position that is equilibrium,

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.680
so I can put that
point in this state,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.280
but then I make
a transformation.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.440
And ultimately
return to that point.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.420
So the cycle is the
return to that point.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.160
So I carry out a set of steps.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.550
And I haven't indicated
the set of steps

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.100
through a connected
continuous curve

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.600
in this multi-dimensional
coordinate space

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.860
because I don't want
to restrict myself

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.760
to processes that are
even in equilibrium.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.929
So I may take a gas
that I have over there,

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:47.640
expand it rapidly, close it
rapidly as long as I wait when

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.720
I come back to the
same point that I

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.790
have reached my
equilibrium again.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.200
I have done a cyclic process.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.550
Now at each stage of this
cyclic process presumably

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.990
the system takes in a
certain amount of heat.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.910
So let's say that
there is a dQ that

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.860
goes at this stage
of the process.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.030
So I use s to indicate, say,
stage 0, one, two, three,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.110
four all the way coming back.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.890
So this is just a
numbering process.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.570
The statement of
Clausius's theorem

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:29.220
is that for any cyclic process
if I go out around the cycle,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.030
add up these elements of
heat that are delivered

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.660
to this system and I allow
the possibility therefore

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.520
that some of the times
these elements dQ

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.400
will be negative just as I
did over here by writing this

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.650
as minus Qc so
that what the dQ is

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.050
what has gone into
whatever this black box is.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.020
So Qh went into this black box.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.460
Qc went out, which means
that minus Qc went in

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.550
so I arranged it
in this fashion.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.140
You can see that
the elements of heat

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.530
are divided by some temperature.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:10.430
I generalize that expression
over here by writing it T of S

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.170
here.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.710
And the statement of
Clausius's theorem

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:23.270
is that this quantity has the
same sign constraint as here

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:32.190
where I told you that
dQ is heat delivered

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:49.880
to system at
temperature T sub s.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.350
Now this particular thing
requires a certain amount

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.080
of thinking about.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.920
Because I told you that your
system is not in equilibrium.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.250
So what is this T
sub S if you have

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.020
a system that is
not in equilibrium?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.480
You can't define
its temperature.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.110
However, you can imagine
that whatever machine

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:20.400
was delivering it had sump
particular temperature.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.580
And so that's the
temperature of the device

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.290
or whatever is delivering
this heat to the system.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.760
And you would be
justified to say, well,

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.570
why is that even useful?

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.990
Because certainly if I were to
have exactly the same cycle,

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.370
but deliver the heat elements
through a different process

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.830
this Ts would be different.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.140
So this is really
also a function

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.160
of the method through which I
want to carry out this cycle.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.390
So given that it doesn't sound
like a particularly useful

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:58.890
theorem.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.990
It seems very arbitrary.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.420
So let's first prove it.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.630
The proof is simple.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.700
And then see whether
it's useful or not.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.490
Any questions at this point?

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.990
OK.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.150
So how do we go proving it?

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.080
We are going to use
these Carnot engines.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:24.340
So what I will imagine is
that I have some big vat that

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.860
is at some, let's
say, for purposes

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:34.560
of, use a high temperature,
a vat of hot water.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.710
And I use this
vat as the process

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.560
that provides heat
to this entity.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.790
Exactly what do I mean by that?

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:53.340
I will use a Carnot
engine to take heat.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.620
Let's call it Qh, although its
sign is not that particularly

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.730
important.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:07.530
And convert this
into the heat element

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.050
dQs that is delivered here.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:16.460
So since I'm using s, an
infinitesimal element here,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.890
let me call this dQ.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.200
And let's call it dQ0
because I'm picking it

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.080
up from the temperature of T0.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.040
So I have as a result
of this process

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.340
a certain amount of work.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.420
All of this corresponds
to the s-th element

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.300
through this particular cycle.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.210
So I divide my cycle
to lots of elements.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.420
Each element takes in
this amount of heat

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:54.900
and I use a Carnot engine to
deliver that heat and always

00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:01.620
taking the Carnot engine
from the input from T0,

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:07.080
but what it delivers is where
this randomness in temperature

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.210
T of S comes about.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.360
Why did I use a Carnot engine?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.320
Because I said that
sometimes this cycle

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.930
is going to take in heat.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.590
Sometimes it is going
to give out heat.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.790
So I want to be able to run
this both forward and backwards.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:23.472
Yes?

00:14:23.472 --> 00:14:26.670
AUDIENCE: Are you delivering
the work to the cycle too?

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.329
PROFESSOR: No.

00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:27.870
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.933
PROFESSOR: The work
goes whenever it goes.

00:14:29.933 --> 00:14:30.474
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:30.474 --> 00:14:31.250
PROFESSOR: OK?

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.900
And indeed that's the next
step of the argument, which

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.310
is what happened to the work?

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.240
OK?

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.240
So we do this.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.724
At the end of this story I
am back to where I started.

00:14:44.724 --> 00:14:45.650
AUDIENCE: Maybe I'm--

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.960
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.668
AUDIENCE: Maybe I
missed something basic,

00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:50.580
but I don't understand
why you can't just

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:57.060
define the function dQ not of
s and ignore the Carnot engine.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.886
Just deliver it the key.

00:14:58.886 --> 00:15:01.980
What was wrong with
just the blue arrow?

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.770
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.720
Why can't I just take
heat from here to here?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.650
Because in principle
where I put it

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.710
is at a different
temperature when I eventually

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.180
go to equilibrium.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.960
And then I would run into
problems of second law,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.030
as to the ability
to transfer heat

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.060
from a hotter to colder engine.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.860
So if you like this
intermediate stage,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.290
allows me ultimately two
vary this temperature Ts.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:32.825
What you say is correct as long
as the T of S is uniformly T0.

00:15:32.825 --> 00:15:33.950
It kind of becomes useless.

00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:37.070
OK?

00:15:39.661 --> 00:15:40.160
All right.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:47.360
So we enclose our cycle, the
Carnot engine, everything

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.540
into a box.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.450
And we see what
this box is doing.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.670
So there is the box.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:16:07.330
The box takes in elements of
heat, dQ from the reservoir.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:12.490
And does elements of work,
dW at different stages.

00:16:15.105 --> 00:16:18.780
Now once the cycle
has been completed,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:27.020
the net result is that I have
extracted an amount of heat,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.510
so this is the net,
extracted heat is

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:37.620
the integral over the
cycle of dQ0 of s.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.640
And converted it to work.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.810
Oh, one other step.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.870
Once I'm using
the Carnot engine,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.290
and I think I
emphasized this, there

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.570
is a relationship between
heat and temperature.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.920
It is this
proportionally-- Qh is

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.610
proportional to h for
the Carnot engine.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.050
Qc is proportional to Tc.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.740
So there is a proportionality
between the heat that I take

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.819
and the heat that I deliver that
is related to the temperatures.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:21.880
So dQ0 is in fact T0 dQ that
goes into the engine divided

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.168
by the temperature at which
it is delivered to the engine.

00:17:27.168 --> 00:17:29.460
OK?

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.120
Now I know also
something about this

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.180
because the second
law of thermodynamics

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.180
says that no process is
possible whose soul result

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.250
is the conversion
of heat to work.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.370
I can do the opposite.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.040
I can convert work
to heat, but that

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.884
means that the integral
here has to be negative.

00:17:50.884 --> 00:17:53.140
OK?

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.870
Now T0 is just a
positive constant.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.310
So once I divide
through by that I

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:05.251
have gotten the proof of
the statement [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:05.750
OK?

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.180
Questions?

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:19.984
Yes?

00:18:19.984 --> 00:18:21.400
AUDIENCE: So how
is this is really

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.330
going to help with the
definition of T of s

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:31.510
because get theoretically
even your extraction of heat

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:36.470
and your doing the work in
that black box or the opposite

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.900
could happen
irreversibly, right?

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.400
So you--

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.316
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:18:40.316 --> 00:18:41.690
AUDIENCE: --still
have a problem.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:42.356
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:45.490
So as I have written
it here I would agree.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.720
It looks completely useless.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.420
So let's make it useful.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.420
How am I going to
make it useful?

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:58.300
So let's start some set of
corollaries to this theorem.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.830
For the first thing is we
get rid of this definition

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.320
by considering a
reversible transformation.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.800
OK?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.560
So same picture that I was
drawing before with multiple

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.880
coordinates.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.830
Start some point and come back.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:30.010
But now I will draw is
solid curve in this space,

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.410
meaning that at each
stage of the process

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.890
I will do it sufficiently
slowly so that my system comes

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.440
to thermal equilibrium
and I can identify it

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.500
as a point in this
generalized phase space.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.550
OK?

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.960
So now I have points in this
generalized phase space.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.320
To each point I can therefore
assign the equilibrium

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.060
temperature.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.702
That I am at that
stage of the cycle.

00:19:57.702 --> 00:19:59.130
OK?

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.180
So now I can request
my Carnot engines

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:08.750
to deliver the heat at the
temperature of the system

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.690
to be maintaining the whole
system plus the Carnot engines

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.960
at thermal equilibrium as
I switch from one cycle

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.540
to another cycle.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.790
OK?

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:23.120
So now I have a
relationship that

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.670
is pertaining to things
that are in equilibrium.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.530
As long as I follow the
equilibrium temperature

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:35.700
of the system and do
reversible transformations

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.585
I have the result that
dQ reversible over Ts

00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:41.817
is less than 0.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:47.649
But the things about-- yes?

00:20:47.649 --> 00:20:49.098
AUDIENCE: Could
you explain again

00:20:49.098 --> 00:20:54.894
why the path integral
of dQ not over s

00:20:54.894 --> 00:20:56.360
is smaller than [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.130
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:03.450
Clausius's theorem says that
if I took heat from a vat

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:09.560
and converted it to useful work
I have violated the second law.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.680
So the sign of the
net amount of heat

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.370
that I extracted better
be negative, right?

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.870
OK.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.200
So you are not going to
be able to have a vat

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.250
and extract energy out of
the lake and run your engine.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.370
It's not allowed.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.030
OK?

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:37.240
Now my path is reversible, which
means that I could go this way,

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.660
or I could go the opposite way.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.270
And if I go the
opposite way, what

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.840
was the definition
of reversible?

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.910
I reverse all of a heat
exchanges inputs and outputs.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.980
OK?

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.340
Which means that what I
was calling previously

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.060
dQ becomes minus dQ.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:02.510
So the inequality holds
for both minus or plus,

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:07.340
which means that as long as I
do reversible transformations

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.721
I must have the integral
to be equal to 0.

00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:14.530
OK?

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.490
Good.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.660
So we constructed
in a sense analog

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.340
of doing frictionless
ways of doing work

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.650
and increasing the
energy of the system.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.980
We have an idea
about reversible ways

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.450
and their relationship
to T, well,

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.200
one step further I need to go.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:43.800
Which is that I go
from some point A

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.024
to some point B in
my coordinate space.

00:22:49.024 --> 00:22:49.910
OK?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.560
I can do it multiple ways.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.640
I can go this way
and then come back.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.150
Reversibly, I can go
this way and come back

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.280
one way or the other.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.060
So every way I have
a number of choices.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.830
Essentially what it says
is that I can go from say A

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:13.790
to B, dQ, reversible
over T, over some path,

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:19.362
and the answer is going to
be the same for doing it

00:23:19.362 --> 00:23:20.320
along a different path.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.390
Because if I went
along this path

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.250
I can close the reversible cycle
either by returning that way

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.410
or by going the other way.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.780
So going this way
or going that way,

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.480
the result of the integration
along reversible path

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.920
should be the same.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.300
And it should be the same
also for any other path

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.140
that I take between
these two points.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:57.850
So it kind of again reminds
us of pushing a particle

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.780
up a hill.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.510
And as long as you are
doing things frictionlessly

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.410
the amount of work that
you do in this process

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.210
does not depend on
how you go there.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.010
It's just the potential
energy difference

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.090
between the two points.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:15.020
So this entity being
independent of the path

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.185
implies immediately
that there is

00:24:18.185 --> 00:24:21.950
some function like a potential
energy that only depends

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.330
on the two end
points and this is

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.367
how you would
decline the entropy.

00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:39.110
OK?

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:44.200
So what we have
essentially said is

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.000
that if I take an
infinitesimal step there's

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.510
an infinitesimal amount of heat
that I can do reversibly, that

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.130
is related to the change
of the state function

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:04.750
through let's say dS is
dQ reversible over T.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.975
Or vice versa, dQ
[INAUDIBLE] TdS.

00:25:08.975 --> 00:25:09.475
OK?

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.630
We've done it finally.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.700
We can get our
expression because we

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.430
have now the possibility
to go from this point

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:26.300
to this point reversibly using
a reversible transformation.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:38.780
And calculate the
change in energy.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.500
Now quite generally the change
in energy conservation lay,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.390
it's dW plus dQ.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.527
If I do this reversible
change so that each element

00:25:50.527 --> 00:25:51.360
I am in equilibrium.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.140
I know what J is.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.490
The dW is sum over iJidxi.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.440
And I have established
that as long

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.860
as I do the reversible
transformations dQ is TdS.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.568
And so we have this formula.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.620
OK?

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.090
So I will write that
again because really this

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.780
is the most important
relationship

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.640
that you need to know
from thermal dynamics.

00:26:28.508 --> 00:26:32.310
And we have to put all
kinds of colorful things

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.074
around it so you remember.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.810
OK?

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:44.330
Now in particular there is
a very common misconception

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:50.300
which is that results are
relevant to transformations.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.600
And you derive this result for
a reversible transformation.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.380
So this formula is only valid
for reversible transformation.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:58.930
No.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:00.340
That's not the case.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.890
It is like saying, I
calculated the potential energy

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:08.230
of pushing something up the hill
through a frictionless process.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.330
Therefore, the
potential energy is

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.310
only relevant for
frictionless transformations.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.220
No.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.910
Potential energy exists.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.580
It's a function of states.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.410
Energy is a function of state.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:23.540
And we have been able to relate
energy as a function of state

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.940
to all the other equilibrium
quantities that we

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.026
have over here.

00:27:29.026 --> 00:27:29.797
OK?

00:27:29.797 --> 00:27:30.380
Any questions?

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.240
OK.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.360
So now we can answer
another side question

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.250
that I raised at
the beginning, which

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:49.760
is I started with xi
and Ji, as describing

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.760
the system in equilibrium.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.480
Then I gradually
added T. I added E,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.720
now I've added S.
How many things

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.920
do I need to describe the
system in equilibrium?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.100
A lot of these are
dependent on each other.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.490
And in particular
saw that mechanically

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:11.250
if there was the only thing
that was happening in the story,

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.440
J's could be obtained from
the derivatives of energy

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.390
with respect to x.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:20.550
So J's, in some sense, once
you had E were given to you.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.290
You didn't have to
list all of the J's.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.650
You just needed to add
E as a function of x's.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.120
But when you have thermal
transformations around,

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.540
that's not enough.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.030
This equation says that if
there are n ways of doing work

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:40.130
on the system, there is
one of the doing heat.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:44.590
You have n plus 1 independent
degrees of freedom..

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:54.320
So n ways of sum over i,
Ji, dxi, one way of SdT,

00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:04.420
you have n plus one
independent variables

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.580
to describe your system.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.000
And once you realize
that you have

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.160
a certain amount of freedom
in choosing precisely

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.060
which n plus one
you want to select.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:31.810
So I could select all of
the x's and one temperature.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:35.270
I could select all of
the J's and one energy.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.870
So I have a number of choices.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:42.140
And once I have made my
choice I can rearrange things

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.000
accordingly.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.750
So suppose I had chosen
the energy in xi,

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:54.870
then I could write dS to
be dE over T minus sum

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:59.200
over i Ji over T xi.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.166
So I just rearrange this
expression and solve for dS.

00:30:04.166 --> 00:30:07.650
So this amounts to
my having chosen

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:13.710
x's and E's as independent
variables and prescribed

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:20.820
through this important law s
as a function of E and x's.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.540
What about everything else?

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.970
Well, everything else you
can calculate by derivatives.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:31.740
So 1 over T would be
dS by dE at constant x.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:44.000
While Ji over T would be minus
dS by dxi at constant E and xJ

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.362
that is not equal to i.

00:30:53.298 --> 00:30:55.290
OK?

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:55.920
Fine.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.810
So that's sort of
kind of extract

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:06.690
the mathematical content that
we can get out of the second law

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.020
through this Clausius's theorem.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.730
There is one important
corollary that

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.210
has to do be irreversible
transformations.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.180
After all, in setting up
the Clausius's theorem

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.080
I did not say anything
about the necessity

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.140
of being in equilibrium in
order to achieve the inequality.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.340
Reversibility allowed me
to get it as an equality.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.010
So what can I do?

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.950
I can take any
complicated space.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:54.340
I can pick a point
A and in principle,

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.690
make an irreversible
transformation to some point B.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.860
And maybe in that
process I will get

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.940
some heat inputted
through the system dQ.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:18.310
And what I would have is that
the integral going from A to B,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:28.550
dQ divided by T along the path
that I have described here

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.830
which is irreversible.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.960
But I can't say anything
about it at this point.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.560
Clausius's theorem
has to do with cycles.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:45.470
So I can, in principle connect
back from B to A reversibly.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:55.920
So I go integral from B to
A, dQ reversible over T.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.310
And having completed the
cycle I know for this cycle

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.020
that this is negative.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:10.470
If I were to take this to the
other side of the equation

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:15.240
it becomes essentially the
difference of the entropies,

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.850
or here it's also the
difference of entropies.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.530
But I prefer it to
be on the other side.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.470
And then to make
these two points very

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.310
close to each other,
in which case,

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:33.747
I can write that dQ is
less than or equal to TdS.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:46.230
This is the change in entropy
in going from A to B. OK?

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:51.530
Again, there's some question
here as to what this T is.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.170
So let's get rid
of that uncertainty

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.470
by looking at processes
that are adiabatic.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.800
So I make sure that
there is no heat

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.639
exchange in going from A to
B. What do I conclude then?

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.560
Is that for these processes
the change in entropy

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.380
has to be positive.

00:34:18.121 --> 00:34:18.620
OK?

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.900
Because T's are generally
positive quantities.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.370
OK?

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.280
So a consequence of
Clausius's theorem

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.730
is that entropy can only
increase in any transformation.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.080
Its change in entropy would
be 0 for these adiabatic

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:44.360
transformations if you
have reversible processes.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.630
So this is actually another
one of those statements

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.480
that you have to
think a little bit

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.480
to see whether it
has any use or not.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.250
Because we all say that
entropy has to increase,

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.670
but is that what we
have proven here?

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.080
Not quite.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.900
Because what we've proven is
that if you have a system that

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:16.090
is isolated, so there is
a system that is isolated

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.790
because I want dQ to be 0.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:24.060
And I want entropy to increase.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.290
OK?

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:30.160
So let's say we start with
some initial condition

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.850
and we wait and go to
some final condition

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.650
of whatever is inside the box.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.470
I should be able to
calculate entropy

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:46.160
before and after in order to see
that this change is positive.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:46.660
OK?

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.320
But we say entropy is
a function of state.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:57.780
And what have I done here
to change this state?

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.810
I cannot calculate entropy
if the system is not

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.520
in equilibrium.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.890
If the system is in
equilibrium it presumably

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.470
does not change as
a function of time.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.440
So what is this
expression relevant to?

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.390
The expression is
relevant to when

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:16.100
you have some kind of a
constraint that you remove.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.730
So imagine that
let's say there is

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:23.930
a gas in this room and some
kind of piston that is initially

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.910
clamped to some position.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.120
Then I can calculate
the entropy of what's

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.450
on the left side, what's
on the right hand side,

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:33.930
and that would be
my initial entropy.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.720
I remove the clamp.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.940
I remove the constraint so
this can slide back and forth.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.370
And eventually it comes
to another position.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:46.510
So then I can again
calculate the final entropy

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.380
from the sum of what's
on the left side

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.100
and what's on the
right hand side.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.800
And I can see that
entropy is increased.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.410
So basically this
statement really

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:01.200
is useful when there is
some internal constraint

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.400
that you can remove.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.910
And as you remove the
internal constraint,

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.270
the entropy increases.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.810
So I guess that image
that we all have

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.410
is that if I give you two
pictures of a room, one

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:17.120
with books nicely arranged
on a shelf and one

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.680
with books randomly
distributed you

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.740
would have no problem
to time order them.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.210
And actually presumably
there was some constraint

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:27.730
from the shelf that
was removed and then

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.800
these things fell down.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.410
So that's the kind
of process for which

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:36.037
this statement of the
second law is appropriate.

00:37:36.037 --> 00:37:36.620
Any questions?

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.320
OK.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.350
So that statement is something
about approach to equilibrium.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.500
But as I said that there was
some initial configuration

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.750
with some constraint and
as a function of removing

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.680
that constraint
the system would go

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.960
from one sort of equilibrium,
constrained equilibrium

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.410
to an unconstrained equilibrium
and this increase of entropy

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.080
tells us in which
direction it would go.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.470
You can time order
the various processes.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:23.050
Now sometimes this adiabatic
way of doing things

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.180
is not the best way.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:30.400
And so depending on what it
is that you are looking at,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.840
rather than looking
at entropy you

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.540
will be looking at
different functions.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.690
And so the next step is to
construct different types

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.310
of functions that are
useful for telling us

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.820
something about equilibrium.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.040
Now I'll start doing that by
some function with which you

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.290
are very familiar.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:57.170
And has practically
nothing to do

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.300
with entropy and temperature.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.970
So we are going to look
at mechanical equilibrium.

00:39:07.327 --> 00:39:08.790
OK.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.720
And so the kind of
prototype of this,

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.980
since we've been thinking in
terms of springs or wires,

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.690
is let's imagine that
I have a wire that

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:23.490
has some natural lent.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.970
And it is sitting there
happily in equilibrium.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:32.090
And then I attach, let's
say a mast to it and because

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:36.030
of that I'm pulling
it with a force

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.690
that I will indicate by J.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:39.740
So J, if you are
in gravity, would

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.780
be mass of this times J. OK?

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.480
Now if you were doing
things in vacuum,

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.890
what would happen
to your x, which

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.740
is the distortion
that you would have

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.440
from the equilibrium
as a function of time?

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.240
What would happen is
presumably the thing

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.930
would start to oscillate and you
would get something like this.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:11.210
But certainly not
equilibrium, but in real world

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.380
there is always friction
that is operating.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.420
And so if there is
a lot of friction

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.950
what is going to
happen is that your x

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:24.220
will come to some final value.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.460
So again, this is a constraint,
which I allowed this to move.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.700
And because of that
constraint I went

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.530
from the initial equilibrium
that corresponded to x

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:38.460
equals to 0 to some
final equilibrium.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.350
And you say, well, if
I want to calculate

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:42.820
that final equilibrium,
what I need

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.950
to do is to remove all
of the kinetic energy

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.350
so that the thing
does not move anymore,

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:52.020
which means that I have to
minimize the potential energy.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.070
I'll give it the
symbol H for reasons

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.790
to become apparent shortly.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.980
And that is the
sum of the energy

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.990
that I have in the spring.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.180
Let's imagine that it
is a hook end spring.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.920
We would have a formula such as
this, plus the potential energy

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.580
that I have in my
mass, which is related

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.780
to how far I go up and down.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:18.140
And say an appropriate
description is minus Jx.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:18.640
OK?

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.990
So this is the net potential
energy of the spring plus

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.840
whatever is supplying
the mass that

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.290
is applying in the
external force.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:31.280
And so in this case, what
you have is that minimizing

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.590
H with respect to
the constraint x

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:41.600
will give you that the x
equilibrium is J over K. OK?

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.460
So basically it comes
down to J over K.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.350
And that the value of this
function, potential energy

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:55.310
function in equilibrium
substituting this over here

00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:01.796
is minus J squared over K. 2K.

00:42:01.796 --> 00:42:02.296
OK?

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:14.170
So in many processes that
involve thermodynamics

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:17.490
we are going to do
essentially the same thing.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:21.470
And we are going to call this
net potential central energy,

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.954
in fact, an enthalpy.

00:42:23.954 --> 00:42:25.360
OK?

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.090
And the generalized version
of what I wrote down for you

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:35.880
is the following, in the
process that I described

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.630
which was related to
the increase in entropy

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.085
we were dealing with a
system that was isolated.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:49.220
dQ was 0 and there was no work
because the coordinates were

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.040
not changing. dW was 0.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.890
Whereas here, I am
looking at a process

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.820
where there is a
certain amount of work

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:04.020
because this external
J that I am putting

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.010
is doing work on the spring.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:10.020
It is adding energy
to the spring.

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:15.080
And the thing is that
because of the friction

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.540
it doesn't continue
to oscillate.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:24.410
So some of the energy that I
would have put in the system,

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:32.670
if I really were using the
formula Jidxi is lost somehow.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:37.460
We can see those
oscillations have gone away.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:45.310
Now I'm always doing this
process at constant J. Right?

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:55.134
So if I prescribe for you some
path of x as a function of T,

00:43:55.134 --> 00:44:01.760
Jdx is the same thing as d of
Jx because J does not change.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.596
x changes.

00:44:03.596 --> 00:44:06.560
OK?

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.830
I'm going to also
imagine processes

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:20.760
where mechanical equilibrium,
but with no heat so that dQ

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.370
is 0.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.590
If I were to add
these two together,

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:34.265
then I will get an
inequality involving

00:44:34.265 --> 00:44:44.110
dE, which is less than or equal
to d of Jixi, which I can write

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:54.250
as the change in e minus
Jixi has to be negative.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.330
So appropriate to
processes, which

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.310
are conducted so that
there is mechanical work

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:04.410
at constant force,
is this function

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:08.960
that is usually
called H for enthalpy.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:14.310
And what we find is that the
dH is going to be negative.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.140
And again, if you
think about it this

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.410
is precisely this
enthalpy is none other

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.095
than the potential
energy that is

00:45:21.095 --> 00:45:23.270
in the mechanical
degrees of freedom.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:27.110
And there's always
loss in the universe.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:32.050
And so the direction naturally
is for this potential energy

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.700
to decrease.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:42.390
One thing to note
is that dH is dE.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:52.860
Thinking of it not now as a
process going on at constant J,

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.620
but as a change in
a function of state

00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.320
because we said that
once I prescribe where

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:04.590
I am in the coordinate
space I know what, say e is.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:05.830
I know what J is.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:11.130
I can certainly construct a
function, which is e minus Jx.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.950
It's another function of state.

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:18.670
And I can ask what happens
if I make a change from one

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.800
point in space to another point.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.250
Along the path that potentially
allows variations in J dE

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.370
I know, is Jidxi.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.760
And then, actually I'm
using summation conversion.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:39.320
So let's remove that,
plus TdS and here

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.470
it becomes minus
Jidxi minus xidJi.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:51.040
Jidxi is cancelled.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:59.570
And we that if I construct
the function H as e minus Jx,

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:04.420
the natural variations
of it are TdS, just

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:11.215
like dE but rather than
Jdx I have minus xdJ.

00:47:13.965 --> 00:47:16.760
OK?

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.970
So H is naturally expressed as
a function of variables that are

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:25.720
s and the Ji's.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.750
And remember that we said we
are doing things at constant J.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.460
So it's nice that
it happens that way.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:36.550
And in particular if I
do partial derivatives

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:48.610
I find that my xi is minus
dH by dJi at constant s.

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:50.890
So that in the same
way before I said

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:55.160
that if you have the energy
function dE by dx will give J,

00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:00.212
if you have the H functions,
dH by dJ would give you x.

00:48:00.212 --> 00:48:00.920
Let's check.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.310
Here we had an H function.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:11.020
If I do a dH by dJ with a
minus sign, what do I get?

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.810
I will get J over K. What
was my equilibrium x?

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:18.415
It was J over K. OK?

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.030
Now both of these functions
that we have encountered so far

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:41.670
were expressing
the system energy

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:47.535
or enthalpy have as
their argument entropy.

00:48:47.535 --> 00:48:52.190
Now if I give you a box you will
have a hard time potentially

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:57.110
figuring out what entropy
is, but varying temperature

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.580
is something that
we do all the time.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.930
So it would be great if we
could start expressing things

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:05.930
not in terms of entropy,
in terms of anything else.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:09.020
Well, what's the natural
thing if not entropy?

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:11.840
Here we went from x to
the conjugate variable

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:17.670
J. I can make a transformation
that goes from s

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:22.780
to the conjugate variable,
which is temperature.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.760
And that would be
relevant, therefore,

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.000
when I'm thinking about
isothermal processes.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.720
And so what I'm going to do is
to reverse the role of the two

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:41.420
elements of energy
that I had previously

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.340
for mechanical processes.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:48.710
So what we had there
was that dQ was 0,

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:50.480
but I want dQ to be non-0.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:56.720
What we had there was
that dW was non-0.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.880
So let's figure out
processes where dW is 0,

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.230
but dQ, the same way that
previously we were doing dW

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:13.780
at constant J, let's do dQ
not equals to 0 at constant T.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:18.570
And constant T is where the
isothermal expression comes

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:19.900
into play.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.920
OK?

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:32.760
So if dW is 0, I have a natural
inequality that involves dQ.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.680
I just erased it, I think.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.180
Yeah.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.190
It's not here.

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:40.226
dQ is less than or equal to TdS.

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:46.800
And if T is a constant
throughout the process,

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.356
I can write this as d of TS.

00:50:50.356 --> 00:50:55.890
Add these two together
to get that dE less than

00:50:55.890 --> 00:51:03.820
or equal to d of TS, or
taking it to the other side,

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.895
I can define a function which
is the Helmholtz free energy.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.070
F, which is E minus TS.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.270
And what we have is that
the natural direction

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:24.590
of flow for free
energy when we remove

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.810
some kind of a constraint
at constant temperature

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:33.540
is that we will tend to
minimize the free energy.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:38.860
And then again doing
the manipulation of dF

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:47.760
is dE minus d of TS in general
will have minus TdS minus SdT.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.720
The TdS part of the E will
vanish and what I will have

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:59.410
is Jidxi minus SdT.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:02.560
So now we can see that
finally for the free energy,

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.490
the Helmholtz free energy,
and natural variable

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:12.540
rather than being entropy
is the temperature and all

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.857
set of displacements.

00:52:14.857 --> 00:52:17.190
And then if you ask, well,
what happened to the entropy?

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:21.560
You say, well, I can get
the entropy as minus dF

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.805
by dT at constant x.

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:52.740
If I take this
picture of the gas

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:57.740
that I had put at the beginning,
which was just erased,

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.980
picture of a piston
that can slide.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.770
And I think of that
as a box that I

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:06.070
bring into this room, well,
then if you'll quickly

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:09.560
adjust to the
temperature of the room,

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.220
as well as the
pressure of the room.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:16.120
So this is going to be a
general transformation in which

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:20.500
both heat and the
work are exchanged.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:25.410
If is at external temperature
and pressure that is fixed.

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:33.801
So it's a transformation that
is isothermal and constant J.

00:53:33.801 --> 00:53:35.550
In pressure you would
call it [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:40.610
OK?

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:42.300
And then quite
generally you would

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.940
say extending what
we had before,

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:53.660
in this case dQ is, again, less
than TdS because of Clausius.

00:53:53.660 --> 00:54:00.490
dW is less than Jdx
because you always

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:07.300
lose something to friction.

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.670
You always lose
something to friction.

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:12.100
You add the two things
together, and you

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:18.630
get that dE is less than or
equal to TdS, plus Jidxi.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.940
For the transformations
that we are considering

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:29.100
that are at constant
t and J I can

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:33.860
take these expressions to
mean the same thing as d

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:43.450
of ts plus Jixi, which
means that more generally,

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:53.060
I can define a function which
is the Gibbs free energy, G,

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:57.270
which is the energy minus ts.

00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:02.890
This part is the Helmholtz
free energy, minus Jixi.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:16.010
And that if I regard this as
a function of state, which

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:21.445
certainly will be minimized
under conditions of constant J

00:55:21.445 --> 00:55:25.280
and T for some constraint
that is removed.

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.130
Quite generally as
a state function

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.420
depending on all
of these variables,

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:35.000
it's variations
would be able to be

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.188
expressed as minus
SdT minus Jidxi.

00:55:44.394 --> 00:55:50.162
ie, our G is naturally a
function of temperature

00:55:50.162 --> 00:55:51.370
and the set of displacements.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:00.110
OK.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:02.520
I don't think music was
appropriate at this point.

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:06.090
I would have put it
earlier, but such is life.

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:11.930
OK.

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:15.550
Now there is something
that I kind of

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:19.087
did not pay sufficient-- yes?

00:56:19.087 --> 00:56:19.753
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:56:19.753 --> 00:56:24.500
Didn't you get it backwards
between the J's and the x's?

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.400
PROFESSOR: I did.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:26.990
I did.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:28.690
I wrote it wrong here.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:34.027
So maybe that's what
the music was for.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.790
OK.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:42.082
Is it fine?

00:56:42.082 --> 00:56:42.930
Anything else?

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:49.340
OK.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:53.140
The thing that I wasn't
sufficiently careful with

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:57.470
was the list of things that
goes into mechanical work.

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:08.210
And one additional care
that what needs to have,

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:13.460
which is that suppose
I were to tell you,

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:17.710
let's say, the pressure
and temperature as my two

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:21.070
variables, and I guess this
is what I would have here

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:25.800
if I go and look at
pressure as my force.

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.600
Then have I told you
everything that I

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.016
need to know about the system?

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:37.670
So I have a box, let's
say, in this room

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:39.450
that is at the
pressure of this room

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:41.320
and at the temperature
of this room.

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:45.810
Have I completely
specified the box?

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:47.807
What have I left?

00:57:47.807 --> 00:57:49.140
AUDIENCE: The size. [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.956
PROFESSOR: How big is it, yes.

00:57:51.956 --> 00:57:57.150
So what I have left,
previously maybe I had volume,

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:58.970
but I sort of
discarded the volume

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:02.020
in terms of the pressure.

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.510
So what I'd really need is to
have the number of particles.

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:07.065
I have to specify something.

00:58:07.065 --> 00:58:09.190
Maybe the mass,
something that has

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.640
still is going to
distinguish these boxes

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.630
in terms of their size.

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:18.140
Now it is most useful
to think in terms

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.350
of the number of particles.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:24.170
So I give you a box and I
can say that within this box

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:26.790
I have so many molecules
of oxygen and nitrogen,

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:32.870
or whatever is the composition,
but then we sort of start

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:35.140
to get into the realm of
chemistry and the fact

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:38.000
that the different chemical
components can start

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.040
to react with each
other, maybe even

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.840
if you have a box
that is one component,

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:48.720
some of the molecules are going
to get absorbed on the surface.

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:52.460
So precisely what the
number is is potentially

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.590
something that is a variable.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:59.850
And in order to specify
exactly what the energy

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:03.210
content of a system
is you have to specify

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:05.750
how many particles
and the energy

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.010
carried by those particles.

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:12.540
So the list of things
that appears here,

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:16.970
especially when you think in
terms of chemical systems,

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:20.045
has an additional
element that is typically

00:59:20.045 --> 00:59:20.920
called chemical work.

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:31.470
And so let's separate mechanical
work from the chemical work.

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:38.090
So mechanical work
was sum over iJidxi

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.750
where these were
real displacements

00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:44.100
and we can actually
write an expression that

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:49.880
is very similar here where
the displacements are

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.520
the number of particles
of different species,

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:56.740
allowing potentially there
going to other species

00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.550
through chemical reactions
provided we multiply these

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:04.300
by some appropriate
chemical potential.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.220
So these mu's are a
chemical potential.

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:18.180
So for the reason
that I stated before

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:28.670
that if I were to
just-- this ambiguity

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.410
that I had about
the size of the box

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:35.770
tells me that I should
have at least one thing

01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:40.270
left in my system
describing the variables

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.290
that is proportional to
the size of the system.

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:45.660
So typically what you
do when you construct

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:50.630
a Gibbs free energy is that you
subtract the mechanical work,

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:53.460
but you don't subtract
the chemical work.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:57.460
So the ends will
remain and can tell you

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.490
how big your system is.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.380
OK?

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:06.610
Now there is a conjugate way I
can certainly do the other way.

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:13.500
So here I constructed something
in which mechanical work was

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.340
removed, but chemical
work remained.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.840
I could do it the
other way around.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:23.230
I can define a function
that is obtained

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:31.150
by subtracting from the
energy the chemical work,

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:38.720
but leaving the mechanical
component aside.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:45.940
So this function dG, OK, I
should go one step before.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:52.310
So once we separate out
the contributions of Jidxi

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:55.790
into mechanical and
chemical components,

01:01:55.790 --> 01:02:02.800
I would write dE as TdS
plus sum over iJidxi,

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.159
plus sum over alpha
mu alpha dN alpha.

01:02:07.159 --> 01:02:08.550
OK?

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:13.900
I just explicitly separating
out those two sources of work.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:18.840
Now when I constructed G,
which subtracts from e, the mu,

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.870
but not the J, what happens?

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:24.160
I will get a minus TdS.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.595
This will remain unchanged.

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:33.230
This will get transformed
to N alpha, d mu alpha.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.430
Just hold on a second.

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:43.870
So this entity that is called
the grand potential actually

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:47.340
completes the list of
these functions of state

01:02:47.340 --> 01:03:00.820
that I wanted to
tell you is naturally

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:06.050
a function of T, the
chemical potentials

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.900
as well as the displacement.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.230
For example, if it's a
gas the displacements

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:12.470
will include the
volume which tell you

01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:14.000
how much material you have.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.882
Yes?

01:03:14.882 --> 01:03:16.340
AUDIENCE: In that
case, do you need

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:23.635
to subtract an additional
TS from E and [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:23.635 --> 01:03:24.510
PROFESSOR: Very good.

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.340
These are all examples
of the energies

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.610
so that you define them as
a function of temperature

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.210
rather than entropy.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:38.310
The only things
that really remain,

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.730
the one function
that you sort of keep

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:43.630
as a function of entropy
is energy itself.

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.040
Enthalpy, too.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.815
Yes, it has its uses.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.260
Yes?

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:58.610
AUDIENCE: So I have many
questions about [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:58.610 --> 01:03:59.500
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.416
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:07.790
Right now I wanted to ask you
say that so a particle is added

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:11.126
to the system, a
particle of some species.

01:04:11.126 --> 01:04:15.305
And this is going to change
the energy of the system.

01:04:15.305 --> 01:04:18.470
So my question is while this
particle can bring energy

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:21.620
in several ways,
like kinetic energy,

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.413
or maybe it's this chemical
bound that's been broken--

01:04:25.413 --> 01:04:26.038
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:04:26.038 --> 01:04:27.010
AUDIENCE: between
energy from there.

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:27.660
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.060
AUDIENCE: Or also
it's rest energy

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:29.670
from special [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:30.410
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:32.526
AUDIENCE: So which
ones are we counting?

01:04:32.526 --> 01:04:34.200
Which ones are we not counting?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.220
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:40.600
So what you see is that when
we do all of these calculations

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.290
we definitely need
to include when

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:46.130
we are talking about a gas,
the kinetic energy component.

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:52.120
The change in the covalent
bond energy definitely

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.860
has to be there if I
take an oxygen molecule

01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.240
and separate it to
two oxygen atoms.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.080
There is that change
in the energy that

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:06.780
has to be included
corresponding kinetic energies.

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.850
Typically the rest
mass is not included.

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:15.280
And so if I were to include that
it will be a shift of chemical

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.040
potential by an amount
that is mc squared.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.220
Why do people not bother?

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:23.940
Because typically what we
will be trying to look at

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.640
is the change when
something happens.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.500
And you have to bring
those particles presumably

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.250
from somewhere.

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:35.430
So as long as you bring in
particles from somewhere then

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:37.650
there's the difference
between the rest mass

01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:39.510
that you had outside
and rest mass

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:41.250
that you have here, that's 0.

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:44.560
It's really all of
the other things that

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.580
contribute to useful quantities
that you would be involved

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:52.870
with like temperature, pressure.

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.570
The rest mass is irrelevant.

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:57.400
Now I can't rule out
that you will come up it

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.670
some process that is going on
in [INAUDIBLE] for whatever

01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:06.040
where the rest mass is an
important contribution.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:11.600
So it may, to some extent,
depend on the circumstance

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.330
that you are looking at.

01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:16.170
But if you are asking
truly what should I

01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:18.940
include in the
chemical potential,

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.095
it will include the rest mass.

01:06:22.095 --> 01:06:26.700
AUDIENCE: So for example in--
I don't know, in cosmology

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:29.665
they often talk of
the chemical potential

01:06:29.665 --> 01:06:32.516
of the different species,
like elementary particles

01:06:32.516 --> 01:06:33.462
in the cosmos.

01:06:33.462 --> 01:06:34.170
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:36.480
AUDIENCE: They say that the
chemical potential of photons

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:36.880
is 0.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.505
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:06:37.505 --> 01:06:41.057
AUDIENCE: So here they have
fixed some kind convention?

01:06:41.057 --> 01:06:41.640
PROFESSOR: No.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.200
You see there is a
difference between photons

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.470
and other particles such as
electrons or whatever, which

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:52.810
is that you have value in
number or some other number

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.340
conservation that is applicable.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:59.060
So any process that
you have will not

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:01.840
change the number
of [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.950
Whereas there are processes in
which there is something that

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.500
is heated and will give
you whatever number of

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.180
photons that you wish.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.720
So there is a distinction
between things

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.830
that are conserved and things
that are not conserved.

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:19.830
So We will get to
that maybe later on as

01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:24.510
to why it is appropriate to
set chemical potential to 0

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:26.110
for non-conserved things.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.310
OK?

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:35.290
Yeah, but it's
certainly something

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:40.370
that we have immediately a
feel for what the pressure is

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:45.390
for what the
temperature is, so we

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:49.000
have our senses seem
to sort of tell you

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.870
the reality of
temperature and pressure,

01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:59.530
but maybe not so much
the chemical potential.

01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:04.220
So I tried to see whether we
have a sense that actually

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.080
is sensitive to
chemical potential

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.680
and we do to some extent.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.830
As you drink
something and you say

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.545
it's too salty, or
whatever, so somehow you

01:08:13.545 --> 01:08:15.960
are measuring the chemical
potential of sort.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.534
So if you like that, that would
be your sensual equivalent

01:08:19.534 --> 01:08:20.450
of chemical potential.

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:25.270
OK?

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:26.068
Yes?

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:27.568
AUDIENCE: Is there
a potential where

01:08:27.568 --> 01:08:30.519
you have both chemical
and mechanical work?

01:08:30.519 --> 01:08:31.717
[INAUDIBLE]

01:08:31.717 --> 01:08:32.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.000
So that will run
into the problem

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.740
of if I do that,
then my parameter is

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:43.210
going to be T, J, and mu.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:48.260
And then I can ask you,
how much do I have?

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.330
Because all of these
quantities are intensive.

01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:52.250
Right?

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:55.680
So it could be a box this
is one cubic centimeters

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.569
or miles long.

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:00.724
So I am not allowed to do that.

01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:03.569
And there is a mathematical
reason for that

01:09:03.569 --> 01:09:05.319
that I was going
to come to shortly.

01:09:08.043 --> 01:09:08.709
Other questions?

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.939
OK.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:19.220
So We are going to
take an interlude.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.569
Actually, the last question
is quite relevant to what

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:26.380
we are going to do next,
which is that we have

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:30.429
these functions defined,
many coordinates,

01:09:30.429 --> 01:09:34.220
and one of the things that
thermodynamics allows you to do

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:38.620
is to relate measurements
of one set of quantities,

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.520
another set of quantities.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.200
And it does so
through developing

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.399
mathematical
relationships that you

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:49.790
can have between these
different functions of state.

01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:56.900
So the next segment has to
do with mathematical results,

01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:02.430
which I will subdivide into
two sets of statements.

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:06.020
One set of statement
follow from the discussion

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.095
that we have had so far, which
has to do with extensivity.

01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:15.570
What do I mean?

01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:21.060
Let's take a look at our most
fundamental expression, which

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:30.150
is dE is TdS plus
sum over iJdxi,

01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:34.517
plus sum over alpha
mu alpha dN alpha.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:46.420
Now you recognize that certainly
as the amount of material

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:50.020
gets increased, the number
of particles increases.

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.400
The typical sizes and
displacements get bigger.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.750
The energy content gets bigger.

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:58.915
The entropy content is
related to the heat content

01:10:58.915 --> 01:11:00.910
and so that gets bigger.

01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:06.490
So these differential forms
that I have on this expression,

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:10.430
they're all proportional
to the size of the system.

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.060
What does that mean?

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.700
It means that e, the
way that I have it

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:22.480
here has as its natural
variables S, x, N.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.790
And extensivity means that if I
were to make my system twice as

01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:31.710
large, so that all
of these quantities

01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:34.460
would get multiplied
by a factor of two,

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:38.187
the energy content would get
multiplied by a factor of two.

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:46.420
OK?

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:53.592
Now it is important to state
that this is not a requirement.

01:11:53.592 --> 01:11:54.092
OK?

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.900
This is a statement
about most things

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:05.550
that we encounter around
us, but once you go,

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:08.890
let's say, to the cosmos,
and you have a star,

01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:12.050
the gravitational
energy of the star

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:14.280
is not proportional
to its volume.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.260
It goes the size to
some fractional power.

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:22.910
So that is an example of a
system because of the way

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:25.620
gravity works as a
long range force, that

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.300
is not extensive system.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:31.510
Typically this
would work as long

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:34.110
as you have interactions
among your elements

01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:36.200
that are sufficiently
short-ranged

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.720
so that you don't
get non-extensivity.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.130
If that's the case then
I can take a derivative

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:48.860
of this expression with respect
to lambda, evaluated at lambda

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:51.900
equals 2, 1.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.440
If I take a derivative
with respect to lambda

01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:02.960
here I will have dE by
dS, times S. I mean,

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.800
the argument here
is lambda S. I am

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.090
taking a derivative with
respect to the first argument.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:12.810
So I bring out a factor of
S. dE by dS at constant x

01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:18.885
and N. And then the next
term is xi dE with respect

01:13:18.885 --> 01:13:23.000
to all the different
xi's at constant S and N.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.380
Next one is going to be
N alpha, dE by dN alpha

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:36.480
at constant x and S. And
there's only one lambda

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:40.350
on this side, which is
going to give me E of Sx.

01:13:43.154 --> 01:13:43.654
OK?

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:52.110
Now if I look at my
initial expression

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:56.000
I can immediately see that
dE by dS at constant x

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.830
and N is none other
than T. So this

01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:05.010
is the same thing as T.
dE by dxi at constant s

01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:07.970
and n is none other than Ji.

01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:15.120
dE by dN alpha at constant x and
Js is none other than mu alpha.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.130
So once I set the argument to be
1, so that all of these things

01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:22.850
are evaluated at
lambda equals to 1,

01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:30.450
I have the result that e is
equal to TS plus Jixi, plus mu

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:33.010
alpha N alpha.

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:41.430
So in some sense all I did was
I took the more fundamental

01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:45.070
expression and removed
all of the d's.

01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:48.440
So some places, this is called
the fundamental relation,

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:54.455
but I don't like that because it
is only valued for systems that

01:14:54.455 --> 01:14:57.020
are extensive, whereas
the initial formula

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.300
is valued irrespective of that.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.800
OK?

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.610
Now once I have
this what I can do

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:09.230
is I can think of
this as a relationship

01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:12.550
among different
functions of state.

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:18.540
Take a derivative and
write it as dE is d of TS.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:26.530
D of TS is TdS plus SdT, plus
d of Jixi, which gives me

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:34.340
Jidxi plus xidJi,
plus d of mu alpha.

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:37.340
And alpha will give
me mu alpha dn alpha,

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:40.895
plus N alpha d mu alpha.

01:15:40.895 --> 01:15:41.870
OK?

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:45.140
This is just a rewriting
of this expression

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.290
in differential form.

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:54.430
But I know that dE is the
same thing as TdS plus Jdx

01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:55.590
plus mu n alpha.

01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:05.820
So immediately what it tells me
is that the intensive variables

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:23.580
T, J, and mu our constrained
to satisfy this relation, which

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:33.261
is called a
Gibbs-Duhem relation.

01:16:33.261 --> 01:16:33.760
OK?

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:43.530
So this is, if you like,
the mathematical reason

01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:46.700
for my answer before.

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:56.040
That I cannot choose this set of
variables to describe my system

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.040
because this set of variables
are not independent.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.790
If I vary two of them the
variation of the other one

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:05.090
is fixed.

01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:09.880
And I said I need N plus 1
independent degrees of freedom.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.070
If I choose all of
the intensive ones

01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:20.110
I'm really using one additional
relationship that relates them,

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:21.660
makes them dependent.

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:23.580
And of course this
also goes to the fact

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:27.640
that I won't know what the size
of the system is, both of them

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.900
reflections of extensivity.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:37.620
Just as an example, let's see.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:43.840
Chemical potential
along isotherm.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:57.610
So for a gas, what would I have?

01:17:57.610 --> 01:18:05.310
I would write SdT minus Vdp.

01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:10.310
That is my contribution from
the work here remembering

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:14.150
that hydrostatic work
at the wrong side.

01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:20.670
And then I have N
d mu equals to 0.

01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:26.170
I said how do these
vary along an isotherm?

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:30.700
Isotherm means that I have
to set dT equals to 0.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:35.040
If I'm along an isotherm
then I have that d mu

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.070
is rearranging
things a little bit.

01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:40.530
Mu over NdP.

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:45.010
So this is the formula
that I will have to use.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:48.660
Now let's specialize to
the case of an ideal gas.

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:52.870
So I'm going to use
here an ideal gas.

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:56.640
For the case of the ideal
gas we had the relationship

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.700
that PV was NKT.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:03.580
So v over n is the same
thing as kT over p.

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.660
Remember that we are
dealing with an isotherm,

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.540
so T is constant.

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:15.040
dp over pi can
integrate, and therefore

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.930
conclude that mu at a
constant along an isotherm,

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:26.930
as a function of the other two
intensive variables T and P,

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:33.060
is some reference that comes
from a constant of integration.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:37.170
And then I have KT,
integral of dP over P

01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:41.530
is log of P divided by sum.

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:43.945
Actually, I already
put the constant.

01:19:47.276 --> 01:19:47.776
OK?

01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:11.520
Very briefly to be
expanded upon next lecture,

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.420
the other set of
mathematical relations

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:18.150
go under the name of
Maxwell relations.

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:29.123
And they follow from the
following observation.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.450
If I have a function of
more than one variable,

01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:44.840
let's say, f of x and y, two
variables, then the natural way

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.240
to write this
consistent with what

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:54.860
we had before is that df is df
by dx partial at constant ydx,

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:58.900
plus dfy, the y
at constant x dy.

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.190
But one thing that
we know from calculus

01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:08.920
is that these are
first derivatives,

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.430
and there are a bunch
of second derivatives.

01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:18.100
In particular, the second
derivative d2 f, dx, dy

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:24.660
is independent of the order
of taking the derivatives.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.630
Which means that if I take
a derivative of this object

01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:30.200
with respect to y, I
will get the same thing

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.570
if I were to take a derivative
of the second object

01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:36.310
with respect to x.

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:42.200
So in particular if I go back
to my fundamental equation,

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.290
dE, let's forget about
the chemical potential

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:52.630
because time is running
short, Jidxi plus TdS.

01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:57.810
I identify T and Ji as
the first derivatives.

01:21:57.810 --> 01:22:02.070
That is, Ji is the
first derivative of e

01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:05.895
with respect to xi
at constant S. T

01:22:05.895 --> 01:22:08.560
is the first derivative
of E, with respect

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:11.420
to S at constant x.

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:16.760
Then if I were to take a second
derivative to construct d2E

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:26.270
with respect to x and T, and
S, I could do it two ways.

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:31.060
I already have a derivative with
respect to x that gave me Ji,

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:33.590
so I take another
derivative of J

01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:38.020
with respect to S,
now at constant x.

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:40.820
Or I can take a
derivative here, which

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:52.240
is dT by dxi at constant
S. And depending

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:58.990
on which one of the many
functions of state that we

01:22:58.990 --> 01:23:04.250
introduced, E, F, G,
H, you can certainly

01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:08.500
make corresponding second
derivative inequalities.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:13.040
And the key to sort of
understanding all of them

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.020
is this equality of
second derivatives.

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.850
So what I will start
next time around

01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:23.270
is to just give you a set
of things on the left hand

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:24.680
side, the analog of this.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:29.860
So for example, I could
choose dS by dxi at constant T

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:33.070
and show that just by
looking at the form of this

01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:37.840
how we will be able to construct
what this thing is related

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.300
through a Maxwell construction.

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:41.900
OK?

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.346
Thank you.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.680
PROFESSOR: Welcome.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.140
One quick announcement--
if you have not yet

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.680
picked up your graded
exams, you can do so

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.338
by seeing the TAs
after the hour.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.170
OK?

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.650
So today I want to
continue to think

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.660
about what we started last week,
thinking about Fourier series.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.780
The idea is to
develop a theory that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.610
lets us look at signals on the
basis of frequency content,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.820
much as we looked at
frequency responses

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.850
as a characterization
of systems,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.610
according to the way
they process frequencies.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.850
And we saw last time that
there were a number of kinds

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.360
of signals, for example,
musical signals,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.520
where that kind of
an on approach--

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.940
thinking about the signal
according to the frequencies

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.870
that are in it--

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.290
makes a lot of sense
and can lead to insight.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.600
We also developed
some formalism.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.310
We figured out how you can
break a signal into components

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.090
and then assemble the components
to generate the signal.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.810
And what I want to mention at
the beginning of the hour today

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.870
is just how to think
about this operation

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.810
in a more familiar way.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.430
We do this kind of a
thing, breaking something

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.826
into components all the time.

00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:55.200
One of the more
familiar examples

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380
might be thinking
about 3-space, right?

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.220
The Cartesian analysis of
3-space is based on the idea

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.070
that you can think about a
vector location in 3-space

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.090
as having components.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.965
There's a component in
the x direction, the y

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.180
direction, the z direction.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.919
That's completely
analogous to the way

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.330
we're thinking about Fourier
representations for signals.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.070
So just like we would
think about synthesizing

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.570
the location of a point by
adding together three pieces,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.290
and we would think about
analyzing a point to figure out

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.930
how big the components are
in each of those directions,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.770
it's exactly the same when we
think about Fourier series.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.860
We think about representing
a signal as a sum of things.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.970
So the sum is
precisely the same.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.750
This one happens to have an
infinite number of terms,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.680
[? eh. ?] The top one has
three terms, [? eh. ?]

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.230
The principles are very similar.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.830
So we think about representing
a signal as a sum of components.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.380
We think about representing
a point in 3-space

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.180
as a sum of components,
and we think

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.470
about analyzing the signal
or the vector in 3-space,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.040
so that we figure out what
each of those components are.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.980
And we do it in an operation
where it's actually

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.240
very convenient to think
about the decomposition

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.270
of the Fourier components using
precisely the same language

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.240
that we would use for
thinking about vector spaces.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.701
So we would think about--

00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:28.200
in the case of the
Fourier, we think

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.112
about integrating over the
period sifts out a component.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:33.570
The analogous
operation for 3-space

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.700
is to think about a dot product.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.606
The way you take a
vector and figure out

00:03:37.606 --> 00:03:39.480
the component in the x
direction is to dot it

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.720
with it, the dot product.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.670
In the Fourier case,
we think about it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.810
as being an inner product.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.880
The idea is
completely analogous.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.720
So we think about having the
inner product of two things--

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.880
the reference direction
and the vector.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.460
So reference
direction and vector--

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.830
we think about it exactly
the same way, except now it's

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.316
an inner product, which means
that after we've multiplied,

00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:08.190
we have to integrate.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.070
That's the only difference
between inner product.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.830
Inner product implies some are
[? integrated ?] after you've

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.029
done the multiplication.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.880
So we do exactly the same
thing, except that now we

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.730
think about the inner
product of a and b.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.530
That's just the integral, where
we take the complex conjugate

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.180
of one of the signals only
because by defining it

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.480
with a complex conjugate there,
we set up the inner product

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.320
so that the answer
is zero unless we

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.930
take the inner product of two
things in the same direction.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.360
OK?

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.300
By putting the minus sign
there, if the two reference

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.090
directions, that
is to say the one

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.180
characterized by k and m, the
ones characterized by k and m,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.800
the inner product
will be zero if we

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.180
take the complex conjugate as
long as k is not equal to m.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.050
k equals m is the only
not zero component.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.270
OK, is that all clear?

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.420
So to make sure that it's
clear, here's a question.

00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:19.340
How many of the following
pairs of functions

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.015
are orthogonal in T equals 3?

00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:26.870
Part of the goal
of the exercise is

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.020
to figure out what the little
caveat in T equals three means.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.810
So look at your neighbor,
say hello, figure out

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.636
a number between 0 and 4.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:38.624
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.780
OK, so how many signals,
how many of the pairs

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.470
are orthogonal to each other?

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.960
Raise your hand with some
number between 0 and 4,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.990
unless you're completely
bizarre and raise five, I mean.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.200
OK, come on, come on.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.760
Higher, so I can see them.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.080
Remember if you're wrong.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.710
It's your partner's fault,
it's not your fault.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.530
OK, not quite.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.230
A lot of bad partners, no, no.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.460
Let's do the first one.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.290
Is the cos of 2 pi t
orthogonal to the sine

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.910
of 2 pi t over the interval
capital T equals 3?

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.770
Yes?

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.400
No.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.049
I haven't a clue.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.695
I don't care.

00:08:38.695 --> 00:08:39.320
No, no, no, no.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.039
You all care, no.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:42.919
Are they orthogonal?

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:43.460
So what do you--

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.043
how do I formally
ask the question are

00:08:45.043 --> 00:08:46.015
they are orthogonal?

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.820
OK, so it's either the last
slide or the next slide.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.059
So go back to the last slide.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:55.600
What's it mean if
they're orthogonal?

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.191
Yeah?

00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:05.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.110
PROFESSOR: So how do I
take the dot product?

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.490
What do I do?

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.152
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] conjugate.

00:09:11.152 --> 00:09:12.110
PROFESSOR: Conjugate 1.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.693
So I want to--

00:09:12.693 --> 00:09:18.300
I'm thinking about 1 over T, the
integral over T, a star of T,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.260
b of t, dt.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.990
Right?

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.480
So the t comes in
here, right, I'm

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.640
integrating over a period t.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.180
So I take the two functions
and I multiply them together.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.370
So I have this function,
and I have that function.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.010
I multiply them together.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.700
If you multiply two sinusoids
of the same frequency

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.470
but different phase,
what do you get?

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.206
Another sinusoid, right?

00:09:47.206 --> 00:09:49.580
So you all know all these
complicated trig relationships,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.079
right?

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:50.920
Here's one of them.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.230
If you multiply cos of 2
pi T times the sine of pi T

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.940
you get half the sign
of double the frequency.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.480
OK?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.813
You don't need to memorize that.

00:09:59.813 --> 00:10:03.130
You just look at this picture,
you look at that picture.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.490
This one over the
interval 3 has 3 periods.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.620
Right?

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.640
There are 3 periods
of that waveform

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.340
over the period of
capital T. There's

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.920
an integer number 3, same here.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.190
Here-- how many periods?

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.630
Twice that.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.960
But it's exactly six.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.840
So you get a pure sinusoid.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.490
You get an integer
number of periods.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.670
You integrate over an integer
number of periods, you get 0.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.440
They're orthogonal.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.414
Had I chosen the
period differently,

00:10:37.414 --> 00:10:38.830
they may not have
been orthogonal.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.611
It depends on the period.

00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:41.110
OK?

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.790
So the inner product
depends on the period,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.415
because the inner
product has something

00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:45.520
to do with integrator sum.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.550
And so the range over which
you sum or integrate matters.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.570
How about cos 2 pi T cos 4 pi T?

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.320
Orthogonal?

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.640
Yeah?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.080
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.558
PROFESSOR: And the reason is?

00:11:03.558 --> 00:11:07.446
AUDIENCE: So think if you
wrapped [INAUDIBLE] together,

00:11:07.446 --> 00:11:10.119
then there's a lot
of symmetry that

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:14.260
goes on [INAUDIBLE]
is going to be 0.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.260
PROFESSOR: So now we've got
two different frequencies.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.651
But we still get these
funny cosine relationships

00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:22.400
that have to do with
sums and differences.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.810
And the sums and
differences both

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.840
happen to be periodic over
3, over the interval capital

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.690
T equals 3, right?

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.390
So we still get the property
that the average value here,

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.470
which is what the interval was
pulling out, the average is 0.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.500
So they're also orthogonal.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.390
How about cos 2 pi T sine pi T?

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.735
OK, I've asked two questions,
and they were both yes.

00:11:46.735 --> 00:11:48.340
So I'm getting
bored at this point,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.336
so by the theory of questions
in lecture, the answer is?

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.779
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:55.570
Now, wait a minute.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.100
I'm not that boring.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.730
Well, maybe.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.200
So is this periodic over
a capital T equals 3?

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.676
Ah, excuse me.

00:12:08.676 --> 00:12:10.300
I didn't say the
right question, sorry.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:16.540
Is this function have an integer
number of periods in the time

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.319
interval capital T equals 3?

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:21.360
What's the period-- what's
the fundamental period

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.800
of this waveform?

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.580
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.710
PROFESSOR: 1.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.037
So it has 3 periods over
the interval cap T equals 3.

00:12:29.037 --> 00:12:29.870
What about this one?

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:34.410
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.610
PROFESSOR: Period is 2.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.290
How many periods are there in
the time interval capital T

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.297
equals 3?

00:12:40.297 --> 00:12:43.159
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:44.430
PROFESSOR: A period is 2.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.290
How many periods are there--

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.290
1 and 1/2, not an integer.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.760
Bad news, right?

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.080
So integer number three,
not integer number.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.170
If you were to integrate
this over the period t

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.440
equals 3, if I
didn't multiply them

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.170
if I just did that, if I just
thought about that integral,

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.600
I wouldn't get 0, right?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.600
There's more positives
than there are negatives.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.720
And when I multiply them, the
same sort of thing happens.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.340
I get two big peaks down
and only one big peak up.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.980
It's because the resulting
waveform no longer

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.570
has an integer number of periods
in the interval capital T

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.270
equals 3.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:23.770
OK?

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.900
Last one-- cos 2 pi T e to the--

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.735
whoops.

00:13:33.735 --> 00:13:37.410
Is that what I actually said?

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.600
Good, I forgot the j.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.240
Because without the j,
they would obviously not

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.290
be orthogonal.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.550
Obviously, right?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.450
OK.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.400
I didn't mean to ask
something quite that obvious.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.720
So what about cos 2 pi
T and e to the j 2 pi T?

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.870
Orthogonal.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:09.731
Not, I'm as clueless as I was
on Part A. No, no, no, no,

00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:10.230
you're not.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.855
No, you're not.

00:14:10.855 --> 00:14:12.230
No, you're not.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.790
So how do you think about that?

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.370
You can use Euler's expression.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.990
And if there had
been a j there, this

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.350
would have been a
correct expression.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.050
OK?

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.580
It's not quite a
correct expression

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.477
because I forgot
to put the j there.

00:14:25.477 --> 00:14:27.060
But had there been
a j there, it would

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.600
have been cos 2 pi T
plus j sine 2 pi T.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.330
And the awkward thing is
that the cos and the cos

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.820
are obviously not
orthogonal with each other.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.650
A signal is not orthogonal
with itself, OK?

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.150
So because part of this
signal is that signal,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.650
those two signals
are not orthogonal.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.580
OK?

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.940
Yes?

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.620
OK, so that's kind
of-- so that's

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.180
the idea of orthogonality.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.810
It's a very good way to
think about decompositions.

00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:04.640
And even though we only spent
about half an hour last time,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.380
and only about 15
minutes this time,

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.660
that is the whole theory
of Fourier series.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.736
That doesn't mean we
can't ask hard questions.

00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:13.110
There were a couple
of questions.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.200
Yes, you were first.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.540
AUDIENCE: Is there a way to
think about orthogonality

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.260
using the Fourier [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.610
PROFESSOR: Well, the
Fourier coefficients

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.947
are the result of orthogonality.

00:15:25.947 --> 00:15:27.530
I don't think you
can tell-- if I just

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.060
told you a bunch of
Fourier coefficients,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.920
I don't know if you
can tell me something

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.070
about the orthogonality of
the underlying signals or not.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.975
AUDIENCE: What if [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:37.850
PROFESSOR: Excuse me?

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.433
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? the period ?]

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:41.570
and the Fourier [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.529
PROFESSOR: Let's see,
so I'm not completely

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:47.820
sure I know what you're asking.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.410
Certainly if you tell me that
the Fourier's coefficients are

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.030
blah, blah, blah,
3, 2 7, and 16.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.050
And if you tell me that you're
working with a simple Fourier

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:03.594
series periodic in 3, then
you've told me everything.

00:16:03.594 --> 00:16:05.260
And so there's a way
for me to backtrack

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.760
that it was orthogonal.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.610
I am not sure if I'm connecting
with you, so if I'm not,

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.320
ask me after lecture
to make sure that--

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.234
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:12.234 --> 00:16:12.900
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.399
AUDIENCE: I think
he's saying if you

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:17.337
have two signals [INAUDIBLE]
coefficients [INAUDIBLE] two

00:16:17.337 --> 00:16:21.281
signals, can I tell if those
two signals are orthogonal

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:27.220
[INAUDIBLE] the coefficients
are orthogonal [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.150
PROFESSOR: If they have
components in common,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.060
they couldn't possibly
be orthogonal.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.750
So I would answer
yes to that question.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.560
So if that's what you were-- so
I think that's probably right.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.140
Does that sound right?

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.430
Yeah, OK.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.630
Yes?

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.130
AUDIENCE: I'm awfully confused
by the complex conjugate,

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.130
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.762
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes, yes.

00:16:50.762 --> 00:16:52.928
AUDIENCE: So does that mean
we're taking the complex

00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:55.835
conjugate [? of a ?] and
we're [? applying it ?] to b?

00:16:55.835 --> 00:16:57.710
PROFESSOR: We're taking
the complex conjugate

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.570
of the entire function.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.200
At every point in time, we take
the complex conjugate of it.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.230
And it's especially
useful to think about

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.099
if you're doing
something of the form--

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:17.480
if a of t were e to the
j 2 pi mt and if b of t

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.940
were e to the j 2 pi lt.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.190
The only thing
we're trying to do--

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.030
but this comes up
quite frequently--

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.490
the only thing
we're trying to do

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.420
is when you conjugate
one of these,

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.850
you rig it so that when
you add the exponents,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.920
the result goes to 0 by
putting the minus up there.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.653
That's all.

00:17:40.653 --> 00:17:42.028
AUDIENCE: It
doesn't seem like we

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:44.944
had to do any of that for the
example we just worked on.

00:17:44.944 --> 00:17:47.860
It seems like there were just
like [? signals ?] [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.290
PROFESSOR: Oh, interesting.

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:53.340
That's a very good point.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.590
That's interesting.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.530
So I didn't intend to
throw you a ringer.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.590
These were signals, all
of these except that one,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:04.160
are real functions of time.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.980
That's why the complex
conjugate didn't come up.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.790
So I apologize.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.970
I wasn't trying to
make it seem tricky.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.480
OK, so it's because
this function of time

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.280
is everywhere real that we
didn't need to rehearse this.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.920
We did have to do
it in that one.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:23.800
OK?

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.940
OK, so the point is that
we've already covered,

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.450
even though we've only done a
little bit of work in lecture,

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.150
we've already covered
all of the theory.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.310
What remains though is
to do some practice.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.760
And also what remains is to
understand how this is useful.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.180
So it's not just music.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.800
The example that I want to
talk about today is speech.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.350
The same sort of thing that we
could do with music last time,

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.610
we can do with speech.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.192
And here are some utterances.

00:18:53.192 --> 00:18:53.858
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:18:53.858 --> 00:19:00.797
- Bat, bait, bet, beet, bit,
bite, bought, boat, but, boot.

00:19:00.797 --> 00:19:01.380
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.755
PROFESSOR: All
right, it was just

00:19:02.755 --> 00:19:05.650
intended to be a bunch of
sounds that we can analyze

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.890
with Fourier analysis to
get some insight into how

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:14.050
to think about, in particular,
speech recognition and speech

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.970
synthesis.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.580
So we can take those
utterances, and all

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.340
I did was write a little Python
program to do the decomposition

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.490
that I showed on
the previous slides,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.850
so that I could break
these time waveforms.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.670
Here I'm illustrating one, two,
three, four, five, six periods.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:37.090
So I took one
period of that sound

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.680
and ran it through that
kind of an integral

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.910
to break it into Fourier
components, which

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.400
are showed here.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.500
And what I want
you to see is just

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.770
like you could have
recognized a pattern here,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.060
and you might try to
recognize which vowel is which

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.780
by the signature in time.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.570
An alternative, and
far more useful way

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.150
of thinking about it,
is to try to recognize

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.480
the pattern in frequency.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.030
So there are characteristic
differences in the sounds,

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.701
and we'll look at the
basis for why there are.

00:20:12.701 --> 00:20:14.200
There are characteristic
differences

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.520
in the sound that can help
us to identify automatically,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.610
by a machine, what
was being said.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.730
And so what we
want to do is learn

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.410
to think about a pattern
that characterizes ah,

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.151
ee, oo in the frequency domain,
as opposed to the time domain.

00:20:34.151 --> 00:20:34.817
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:36.397
- Bat beet, boot.

00:20:36.397 --> 00:20:36.980
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.480
PROFESSOR: So there's something
different about those sounds

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.870
that manifests a difference
in this Fourier signature.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.350
So that's one of the useful
applications of this.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.060
And we'd like to
understand that better.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.440
There's a really good physical
reason why that happens.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.860
And it has to do with the
way we produce speech.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:03.080
So you can think about speech as
being generated by some source.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.180
Ultimately, the
source of my speech

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:10.070
is somewhere down here,
which always amuses me

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.270
when I see the cut off heads
talking, like at Halloween

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.310
and like on some cartoon shows.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.980
Because you can't
do that, right?

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.510
Because the source has to
do with down here someplace,

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.080
right?

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.060
My lungs push in.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.800
That pushes air
through something

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.860
and starts making noise somehow.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:33.230
I'm going to focus today on
things that we call voiced--

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.560
in a voiced sound.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.800
Ah, in a voiced sound,
it's caused by vibrations

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.715
of the vocal chords.

00:21:40.715 --> 00:21:44.910
So if you were to stick a
camera down someone's throat,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.060
this is the sort of
thing that you would see.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:52.100
It's an enormously
complex structure

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.020
whose mechanics are extremely
difficult to understand.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:03.050
Because what happens is when
you want to make a high sound,

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.210
you tense the structure.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.970
You pull on some muscles
that pull the cords.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:13.170
The cords are normally
rattling pretty fast.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.170
And what you do is,
you pull on a muscle

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.507
that tenses them to
make it go higher.

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.590
But your intuition should
say, now wait a minute--

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.290
you're making it longer
to make it higher?

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.140
And your intuition
would be right.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:33.670
Normally, long organ pipes are
higher or lower in frequency?

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.640
AUDIENCE: Lower.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.300
PROFESSOR: Lower.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.720
So you have to do a lot
of mental calculations

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.090
in order to move these
muscles correctly.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.570
So that the resulting
frequency of the vibration

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.590
comes out right.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.780
It's not obvious,
because two things

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.510
happen as you tense the muscle.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.750
The folds-- the vocal cords get
longer which you would think

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.930
would make the frequency
lower, but they

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:03.480
get tighter, which, of course,
goes the other direction,

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:03.980
right?

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.310
So it's a very
complicated thing.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.851
And in fact, it's
something that goes

00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:08.270
bad with professional speakers.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.720
But even more,
professional singers

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.230
often have a lot of trouble
with the enormous stress

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:19.040
that happens on this structure
with repeated use and repeated

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.860
overuse.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.870
Anyway, this takes
a real beating.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:27.764
But that's ultimately
the source of speech.

00:23:27.764 --> 00:23:29.930
But if that were all you
had, it wouldn't sound much

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.790
like speech.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.960
A lot of the interesting stuff
comes from these cavities

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.760
that you intentionally
manipulate

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.000
as you're speaking to make
the different characteristic

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.880
sounds.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:51.020
So the idea then is that you
have a source that contains

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.030
information like frequency.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.320
What's the pitch
of the utterance?

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.240
But you have this other thing,
which is acting like a filter.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.940
If you think about the
whole thing as a system,

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.620
we have a block which
represents a filter, which

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.039
is the thing that has
a frequency response.

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:13.580
The frequency response
depends on how

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.460
I've put my tongue in my mouth
and how I've opened my lips

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.356
and stuff like that.

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:18.480
We'll see that in a minute.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.410
But it also depends on
how the vocal folds--

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.710
it has an input, which
is the vocal folds.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.330
So the idea then is the same
kind of a source filter idea

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:34.320
that we motivated last time by
way of the RC filter example.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.070
If you put a resistor
and a capacitor

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.130
together with a source,
a convenient way

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.830
to think about that is
as a low pass filter.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.170
We think about it having
a frequency response.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:50.330
So the system, just the RC
part, has a frequency response

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.480
which we can characterize
by a Bode diagram.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.860
So we can think about--

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.510
we did this last time--

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.270
so we can think about the
low frequencies go through

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.410
without attenuation.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.190
The gain is 1, and
the phase is 0.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.820
So basically low frequencies
go through the filter

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.310
without any change.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.684
High frequencies are attenuated.

00:25:11.684 --> 00:25:13.100
The higher the
frequency, the more

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:20.030
the attenuation, and phase
shifted by lagging pi over 2.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.090
So that's a way of thinking
about the RC circuit

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.980
as a low pass filter.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.510
And it gives us
insight in the kinds

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.790
of signals that go through
and don't go through.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:33.710
So that, if we think about
a signal like a square wave

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.380
having a Fourier
series decomposition,

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.550
it only has odd components and
the odd components fall with k.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.690
The magnitude of the
component is inverse with k.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:49.640
So we get components that,
if I plot on a log scale,

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.625
the reciprocal relationship of
the weight of the components,

00:25:53.625 --> 00:25:56.000
the magnitude of the components,
makes it a straight line

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.756
with a slope of minus 1.

00:25:58.756 --> 00:26:02.450
And now we can think about
putting this signal into the RC

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:07.040
filter and thinking about what
the output should look like.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.080
If the frequency
of the square wave,

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.440
if the fundamental
frequency, 2 pi

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.250
over the period, if
2 pi over capital T,

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.650
if 2 pi over capital T is some
frequency that's low compared

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.370
to the corner frequency
of the low pass filter,

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.440
basically the output
of the filter, which

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.390
is showed in green, overlaps the
input, which is showed in red.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.780
You can't tell the difference
because all the components

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.750
have the same magnitude
and phase as the input.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.420
But if you change the
frequency of the square wave

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.630
so that the
fundamental is higher,

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.870
some of the higher
frequencies are attenuated

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.700
and phase shifted.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.280
The shape of the
waveform, showed in green,

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.267
starts to deviate.

00:26:56.267 --> 00:26:57.850
If you go to still
higher frequencies,

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.080
the deviation's even greater.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.690
And if you go to high
enough frequencies,

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.810
they're all in the region
where the magnitude is

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:09.070
being attenuated by
whatever frequency.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.730
So my dependence of 1 over
k becomes 1 over k squared,

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.560
and it goes from being a
square wave to a triangle wave.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.430
So that's a way of thinking
about the signal transformation

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.450
in terms of a filter.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.590
We did that last time.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.880
What's going on with speech
is exactly the same thing.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.510
What we want to do
is think about--

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:32.310
the glottis makes some kind of
a sound that goes into a filter.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.860
The filter is this
thing that is controlled

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.830
by my tongue's
position and my jaw

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.210
position and my lip position
and stuff like that.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.790
And what comes out is speech.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.000
To demonstrate
that, here's a film

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.350
that was made by Ken Stevens.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.308
Ken Stevens was a professor
in this department.

00:27:48.308 --> 00:27:50.790
He just recently retired.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.370
This was done when he
was a graduate student.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.630
It's very hard to see because
the contrast is not great.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.310
But you have to take
into consideration

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.050
this was made with X-rays.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.030
OK, we probably
wouldn't do this today.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.530
It was a relatively
large exposure

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.620
to x-rays, which we sort
of frown on these days.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.340
Just so you're not too worried,
Ken Stevens, when he retired,

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.140
had the longest teaching
career in our history.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.380
He was a lecturer who actively
lectured for 50 years.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.800
So he seemed to have done OK.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.910
He survived.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.280
So you don't need to worry
about what happened to him.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.340
But we probably
wouldn't repeat this.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.100
It's a little hard to see.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.400
The bone is easy, right,
because x-rays don't

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.500
go through bones very well.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.560
What you can just
barely see is his lips.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.180
And it's important to
watch the lips, too.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.250
It's also important that
his chin is on a chin rest

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.880
to simplify analysis.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.580
The idea of this was to get
quantitative measurements

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.450
to fit the source filter idea.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:06.074
OK, so now I'm going to play
a film, a recording of him.

[LAUGHTER]

00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:11.050
PROFESSOR: OK, so what
you were supposed to see

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.680
is that the thing that
we associate with speech

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.390
is only a small part of it.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.890
His lips were obviously moving.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.350
That's what we see.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.880
But if you were
paying attention,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.389
his tongue was going up and down
not a little bit, but a lot.

00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:29.680
So the gap between his tongue
and the roof of his mouth

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.385
was going from 0
to about that far.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:40.360
The velum back here was opening
very broadly on occasion.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.580
So there was a
significant variation

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:48.860
in the shape of the structure
through which the glottis wave

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.470
form was passing.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:55.090
And that's the basis of the
filtering that gives rise

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.740
to the different speech sounds.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.030
So to convince you
of that, here I

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.936
have a carefully machined item.

00:31:04.936 --> 00:31:06.084
Let's see.

00:31:06.084 --> 00:31:07.000
I don't want this one.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
I want this one.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.930
So this is a Japanese oo.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.570
OK, now I don't know Japanese,
so I have to just sort of trust

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.153
the guy who made
this that it actually

00:31:15.153 --> 00:31:17.110
sounds like a Japanese oo.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:20.380
The second one I'll show is
a Japanese ee, which actually

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.220
sounds more like an ee to me.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:26.260
But anyway, this model was made
from measurements of the type

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.300
that I just showed with Ken.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.420
So the idea was to estimate
the size of those cavities

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.520
through which the
air was passing,

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.020
and then make, by
machining in Plexiglas,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.520
a structure that has that shape.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.670
So this was an early test
of whether the source filter

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:44.750
idea works.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.500
So if that is the explanation
for how speech is generated,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.021
then I ought to be able
to take a boring sound

00:31:51.021 --> 00:31:52.895
of the type that's
generated by the glottis--

00:31:52.895 --> 00:31:54.650
[BUZZING SOUND]

00:31:57.545 --> 00:32:00.500
And put it through this, and it
should sound more like a vowel.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.730
OK?

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:02.290
Got it?

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.200
Know what I'm talking about?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.952
So this is a Japanese oo.

00:32:08.952 --> 00:32:11.850
[BUZZING SOUND]

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.605
[COMBINES BUZZING SOUND WITH
 'OO' SOUND]

00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:16.230
I don't know if
anybody knows Japanese.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.856
I don't know if that
sounds like an oo.

00:32:17.856 --> 00:32:19.563
Does anybody know
Japanese, and does that

00:32:19.563 --> 00:32:20.580
sound like an oo or not?

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.696
OK, I'll pass.

00:32:24.696 --> 00:32:28.590
[BUZZING SOUND]

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.115
This is an ee.

00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:33.390
OK, now notice that the
ee looks very different.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.770
Right?

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.470
The question is whether
that's a big enough difference

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:44.130
to make the difference
between an oo and an ee.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.270
I'm pressing the same button,
nothing up my sleeve, nothing--

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.048
OK, so same button.

00:32:50.048 --> 00:32:53.520
[COMBINES BUZZING SOUND WITH
 'EE' SOUND]

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.570
OK, so what you're
supposed to be convinced of

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:07.780
is there is enough
information in the shape

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:12.440
of the vocal
structures to account

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.755
for the difference
in the sounds.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:23.650
Now of course, we don't really
care about the acoustics

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:28.600
if we're trying to, for example,
synthesize or analyze speech.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.670
We don't particularly
care about that.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.650
We do like to know that there
is a theory that underlies it,

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.149
right?

00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:36.070
And there's a very
sound physical basis

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.610
for why we should think
about the source filter idea.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.690
When I say source
filter, source filter--

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:47.350
so everybody calls it the
source filter model of speech.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.850
So is there any
good physical reason

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.980
for why that should be true?

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:56.740
Of course, what we care about
is the frequency response.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.920
So here what's showed
is measurements

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.860
of frequency responses
taken from speakers.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.780
So now we don't do
the x-ray thing.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:09.179
All we do is record somebody
saying heed, had, hood,

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:12.380
haw'd, who'd.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.070
And we look at men,
women, and children,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:22.100
and we characterize how their
frequency responses change

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.210
when they make those
different sounds.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:30.889
So what's showed here is that
you get a relatively good fit

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:36.409
by thinking about the frequency
response having three formants.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:39.770
The formants are the
peak frequencies.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.886
There's a theory,
which I won't go into,

00:34:42.886 --> 00:34:44.510
for how you take this
shape and turn it

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.540
into a formant frequency.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.949
And given just the formant
frequencies, or given

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.650
the frequency response
measured at uniform spacing

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:57.260
across frequencies,
there is a theory

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:02.470
for how you can generate the
smooth line, which is really--

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.050
this is an 11th order
[? fit, ?] which

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:09.550
means that there are
11 poles and no zeros.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.310
So what you do to
get this shape then

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.970
is take the locations
and amplitudes

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:20.020
of the formant frequencies
and do a fit using poles.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.270
And so here's a table showing
measured formant frequencies,

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:29.440
F1, F2, and F3, for
whatever, six different

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.720
sounds for three different
categories of speakers.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.980
OK?

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.070
And that's kind of a complete
analysis then in terms

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.560
of the source filter idea.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.610
So this figure
summarizes the idea.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.280
We think about source filters.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.450
So the source is the glottis.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:55.290
The filter is the formants
created by the throat.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.900
And speech is the thing that
comes out of the source filter.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.140
The source is some
periodic waveform

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:07.330
caused by the banging
together of the vocal folds.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:15.430
The filter is the frequency
response of the throat.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.310
And the result, then, is just
passing this glottis wave

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.160
form-- so this is a measured--

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.660
by sticking a microphone
in somebody's throat,

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.740
this is a measurement of what
the glottis acoustics looks

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.300
like.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:33.910
This is a Fourier decomposition
of that periodic waveform.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.360
Then this is the frequency
response of that thing.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.560
And this is the
Fourier coefficients

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.400
of the output for
different sounds.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.510
So here is the frequency.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:50.230
So the same glottis signal
underlies and ee sound and ah

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:54.670
sound and generates
two different spectra.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.100
We call that combination
of magnitudes and angles.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.505
We call that the
Fourier spectrum.

00:36:59.505 --> 00:37:00.880
So you get two
different spectra,

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.550
depending on the filter shape.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:07.140
OK?

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.330
And that's the basis--

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.490
this theory, this
source filter idea--

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.320
is the basis of the
current technology

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.690
for speech recognition
and speech production.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.300
So I actually cheated.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.860
Those sounds that
I played earlier--

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.410
bit, bat, bought, beat,
all those things--

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.090
those were actually
synthetic speech.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.510
OK, all I did is I ran
a speech synthesizer,

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.180
and I said, synthesize bit.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.850
So that was really
a synthesized thing.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.920
That was not a real person.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:41.250
And so the synthesizer
used this theory

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.710
in order to generate
this synthetic speech.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.650
We also use this theory in
order to recognize speech.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.650
And you'll do a homework
problem in Homework 10,

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.700
I think it is, in which you'll
build the primitive front

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:59.360
end of a speech recognizer
using this theory.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.940
And I'll give you a couple of
utterances of different vowels

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.180
and you'll have to classify
which vowel is being said,

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.000
according to some
automatic speech recognizer

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.310
based on this theory.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.430
The theory is also just
fun, because a theory

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.132
lets us figure out anomalies.

00:38:16.132 --> 00:38:17.840
So when somebody has
a speech impediment,

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.131
for example, when I did, when
I was a little kid I did.

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.560
And I was sent to speech school.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.310
Now they do a much
better job because they

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:27.320
do analysis to figure
out what I'm doing wrong,

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.120
using this sort of
source filter idea.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.250
We can also use the
source filter idea

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.390
to understand paradoxes.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:38.990
So for example, I've told you
before I work on hearing aids.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.820
I tried to make
hearing aids hear.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:45.410
And so people with hearing
deficiencies like mine,

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.480
where I have sort of
progressive age-related

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.120
because I'm old, right,
that's what happens.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.940
I have age-related
hearing loss, which

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.220
means that I'm losing
high frequencies.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.900
I'm less sensitive
to high frequencies.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.770
People like me, which is
the vast majority of people

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.620
my age--

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.580
it's easier to understand male
speech than female speech.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.080
Why?

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.080
Higher frequencies.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.480
So those higher
frequencies shift

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.066
some of the important
stuff that I

00:39:18.066 --> 00:39:19.690
should be listening
to into frequencies

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.640
I don't hear anymore.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.630
Right?

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.640
So that's a way of
using this theory

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.640
to try to understand
what's wrong with me.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.310
But there's also things--
it's not just me.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.700
Normal people have trouble
distinguishing female speech,

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.621
especially in taxing
environments, and one of those

00:39:36.621 --> 00:39:37.120
is singing.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.030
So if you consider
altos and sopranos,

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.350
sopranos are like,
the worst, right?

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.230
Because they are not only
female, but they're at the high

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.490
end the females.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.180
And there are those
who complain about not

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.360
being able to understand
female singers.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.640
OK, so here's a
demo that will help

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.120
us to understand whether that's
a valid kind of a criticism

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:04.620
or not.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:10.110
So what I've got is
a professional singer

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.080
singing, la, la, la, la--

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.210
on a scale.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.430
So from low frequency
to high frequency,

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.180
then a different sound,
a different sound,

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.877
a different sound,
a different sound.

00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:22.460
So the first thing
that I want to do--

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.376
I want you to listen to
those different sounds

00:40:24.376 --> 00:40:27.439
as she goes across the scale.

00:40:27.439 --> 00:40:29.480
Then I'm going to play
just the low ones and just

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.990
the high ones, just the
low frequency ones and just

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.990
the high frequency ones.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.770
PROFESSOR: OK, so
now what I've done

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:37.420
is I've sliced out the lowest
frequency, the very first

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.810
of the scale from
each of the sounds

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:45.490
and pasted them together to
get the low frequency run.

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:51.470
And then I took out the high
ones and pasted them together.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:52.110
OK?

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:56.990
Exactly the same sounds, just
played in a different order.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.540
So first the low frequency ones.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.022
SINGER: La.

00:42:01.022 --> 00:42:02.998
Lore.

00:42:02.998 --> 00:42:04.974
Loo.

00:42:04.974 --> 00:42:06.950

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.914
Lee.

00:42:09.914 --> 00:42:13.026
And the high frequency ones.

00:42:13.026 --> 00:42:15.022
La.

00:42:15.022 --> 00:42:16.519
Lore.

00:42:16.519 --> 00:42:18.515
Loo.

00:42:18.515 --> 00:42:20.511
Ler.

00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:21.509

00:42:21.509 --> 00:42:26.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.570
PROFESSOR: It's not her fault.
She's doing everything right.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.030
And you can see that.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:40.010
Here is, again, a Python program
analyzing those same segments.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:46.040
So what's shown here is the ee,
the filter derived from the ee,

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.360
by thinking about the lee,
lee, lee, lee, lee, lee--

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.990
by looking at that
sequence, and averaging

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:57.620
across the frequencies.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.890
So here's the filter.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:08.180
Here's the filtered glottis
spectrum for a low frequency

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.880
and intermediate frequency
and high frequency.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.340
What's the difference between
the low, middle, and high?

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.870
What's characteristically
different at low and high?

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:31.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
frequency, like high amplitude.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:37.230
PROFESSOR: So if you look at the
low frequency, the low pitch,

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:42.560
there are more frequency
components in a given range.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.400
So if I say analyze the
frequencies between 0

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.110
and 1,000 hertz, 1,000
cycles per second,

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:55.210
there are more lines when
you have a low frequency.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.760
And so you get the
density of the lines

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.340
is greater for the low
frequency utterance

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:04.200
than it is for the high
frequency utterance.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:09.450
The low frequency utterance
is spaced close enough

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:17.240
that you can clearly figure out
this pattern from that spacing,

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.660
because there are
multiple lines per peak.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.430
The problem is that
the speech waveforms

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:26.870
have very sharp resonances.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:29.510
The peaks are narrow.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:32.720
So that as you go to
a higher frequency,

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.380
now it's very hard to see.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.140
So where there was two lines
characterizing this guy,

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.860
now there's one.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.460
And at the highest frequency,
there's nothing there.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.340
Similarly with these
peaks, again, several lines

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.450
representing each peak.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:56.950
One line representing-- nothing
representing this peak, nothing

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.630
representing that peak.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:05.270
There is nothing about
ee in that signal.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:08.520
And if you do the
same analysis for ah,

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.030
you get the same result.
There's nothing about ee,

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.740
and there's nothing about ah.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.940
There's just nothing there.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.470
There's no way anybody is going
to tell those two sounds apart.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:24.840
So if the singer put her
voice, her vocal tract,

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.750
in precisely the
right location, there

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:32.330
would be no difference
between those sounds,

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.330
OK, regardless of what
the director said.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.620
OK, so that's the problem.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.950
So that's a way of
using the Fourier

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:44.570
analysis to gain some insight
into some anomalous situations.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.319
Yeah?

00:45:45.319 --> 00:45:46.777
AUDIENCE: Does this
have more to do

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:51.070
with the rate at
which you're sampling?

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.600
PROFESSOR: No.

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.620
It has to do only with
the frequency content

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.800
of the glottis waveform.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.450
You can think about
it as sampling.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:09.460
And that's a good insight,
because the Fourier series only

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.990
has components at integer
multiples of a base frequency.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:18.680
So that means we're sampling
in frequency, not in time.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.860
So we have this potentially
continuous frequency response,

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.230
which is characterizing this.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.250
That is continuous.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.680
I could excite this at any
frequency that I want to.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.920
But the glottis
waveform of the singer

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.150
is only sampling that at
particular frequencies--

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:45.010
C, C prime, C double prime, B,
B prime, B double prime, right?

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.410
So there's only certain
frequencies at which

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:51.625
the singer is sampling this.

00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:53.750
So there is a way of thinking
about it as sampling.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:55.904
But it's not sampling
due to my ADD converter

00:46:55.904 --> 00:46:56.820
or anything like that.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.450
It's sampling in frequency.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:03.790
So the point is that this
kind of a source filter idea,

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.830
and more generally,
the filter idea,

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:08.770
is such a powerful
representation

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.270
that next time we'll
think about how

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:15.020
to do the same sort of thing
for non-periodic [? stimuli. ?]

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.860
See you then.

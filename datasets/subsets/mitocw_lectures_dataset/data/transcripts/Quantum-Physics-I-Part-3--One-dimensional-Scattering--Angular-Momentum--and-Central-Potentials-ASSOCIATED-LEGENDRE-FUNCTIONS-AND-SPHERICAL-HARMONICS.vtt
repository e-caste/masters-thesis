00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.729
PROFESSOR: We're talking
about angular momentum.

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:08.766
We've motivated angular
momentum as a set of operators

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:12.690
that provided observables,
things we can measure.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.250
Therefore, they are important.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.980
But they're particularly
important for systems in which

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.440
you have central potentials.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.230
Potentials that depend
just on the magnitude

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.230
of the radial variable.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.160
A v of r that depends just on
the magnitude of the vector

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.340
r relevant to cases where you
have two bodies interacting

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.740
through a potential
that just depends

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.100
on the distance
between the particles.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.840
So what did we develop?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.720
Well, we discussed the
definition of the angular

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.070
momentum operator.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.380
You saw they were permission.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.120
We found that they satisfy
a series of commutators

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.320
in which lx with
ly gave ih bar lz,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.700
and cyclical versions
of that equation, which

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.860
ensure that actually you
can measure simultaneously

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.070
the three components
of angular momentum.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.440
You can measure,
in fact, just one.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.470
Happily we found there
was another object

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.900
we could measure, which was
the square of the total angular

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.070
momentum.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.550
Now, you should
understand this symbol.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.380
It's not a vector.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.260
It is just a single
operator. l squared

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.870
is, by definition, lx
times lx, plus ly times ly,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.400
plus lz times lz.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.120
This is this operator.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.980
And we showed that any
component of angular momentum,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.540
be it lx, ly, or lz,
commutes with l squared.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.150
Given that they commute,
it's a general theorem

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.039
that two permission
operators that commute,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.060
you can find simultaneous
eigenstates of those two

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.730
operators.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.310
And therefore, we set up for the
search of those wave functions

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.120
that are simultaneous
eigenstates of one of the three

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.380
components of angular momentum.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.830
Everybody chooses
lz and l squared.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.300
lz being proportional to
angular momentum has an h bar m.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.410
We figured out by looking at
this differential equation

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.720
that if we wanted single
valued wave functions--

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.360
wave functions would
be the same at phi,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.730
and at phi plus 2 pi,
which is the same point.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.380
You must choose m
to be an integer.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.020
For the l squared
operator we also

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.770
explained that the
eigenvalue of this operator

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.610
should be positive.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.870
That is achieved when
l, whatever it is,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.132
is greater than 0,
greater or equal than 0.

00:03:13.132 --> 00:03:19.410
And the discussion that led
to the quantization of l

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.730
was a little longer,
took a bit more work.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.310
Happily we have this
operator, and operator

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.150
we can diagonalize, or we
can find eigenstates for it.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Because the Laplacian,
as was written

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.720
in the previous
lecture, Laplacian

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.230
entering in the
Schrodinger equation

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.110
has a radial part
and an angular part,

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.460
where you have dd
thetas, and sine thetas,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.930
and the second defies square.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.530
All these things were
taken care of by l squared.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.680
And that's very useful.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.000
Well, the differential
equation for l

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.160
squared-- this can be though as
a differential equation-- ended

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.510
up being of this form,
which is of an equation

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.000
for the so-called Associate
Legendre functions.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.460
For the case of m equals 0
it simplifies very much so

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.570
that it becomes an equation
for what were eventually

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.250
called Legenre polynomials.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.440
We looked at that differential
equation with m equals 0.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.471
We called it pl 0.

00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:45.700
So we don't write the zeros.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.520
Everybody writes pl
for those polynomials.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.070
And looking at the
differential equation one

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.740
finds that they have
divergences at theta

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.840
equals 0, and a theta
equal pi, north and south

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.850
pole of this spherical
coordinate system.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.690
There aren't divergences unless
these differential equations

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.700
has a polynomial solution that
this is serious the recursion

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.410
relations terminate.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.060
And that gave for us
the quantization of l.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.210
And that's where we stopped.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.070
These are the
Legendre polynomials.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.980
Solve this equation
for m equals 0.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.745
Are there any questions?

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:39.100
Anything about the
definitions or?

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.090
Yes?

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.730
AUDIENCE: Why do we care about
simultaneous eigenstates?

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.330
PROFESSOR: Well, the
question is why do we care

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.480
about simultaneous eigenstates.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.330
The answer is that
if you have a system

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.690
you want to figure out what are
the properties of the states.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.650
And you could begin by saying
the only thing I can know

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.060
about this state is its energy.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.340
OK, well, I know
the energy at least.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.420
But maybe thinking harder
you can figure out, oh, you

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.720
can also know the momentum.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.206
That's progress.

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:33.190
If you can also know
the angular momentum

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.130
you learn more about the
physics of this state.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.116
So in general, you will be
led in any physical problem

00:06:42.116 --> 00:06:47.636
to look for the maximal
set of commuting operators.

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:51.989
The most number of operators
that you could possibly

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:52.488
measure.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.830
You know you have success
at the very least,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:07.140
if you can uniquely characterize
that states of the system

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.660
by observables.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.170
Let's assume you have
a particle in a circle.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.250
Remember that the free
particle in a circle

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.160
has degenerate
energy eigenstates.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.315
So you have two
energy eigenstates

00:07:24.315 --> 00:07:28.220
for every allowed energy,
except for 0 energy,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.030
but two energy eigenstates.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.040
And you would be baffled.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.300
You'd say, why do I have two?

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.950
There must be some difference
between these two states.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.660
If there are two states,
there must be some property

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.880
that distinguishes them.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.620
If there is no property
that distinguishes them,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.330
they should be the same state.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.070
So you're left to search
for another thing.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.260
And in that case the
answer was simple.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.730
It was the momentum.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.090
You have a particle with some
momentum in one direction,

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.350
or in the reverse direction.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:05.465
So in general, it's a
most important question

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:11.590
to try to enlarge the set
of commuting observables.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.470
Leading finally to
what is initially

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.045
called a complete set of
commuting observables.

00:08:19.045 --> 00:08:21.400
So what do we have to do today?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.390
We want to complete
this analysis.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.890
We'll work back
to this equation.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.470
And then work back to
the Schrodinger equation

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.710
to finally obtain the
relevant differential

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.169
equation we have to
solve if you have

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.360
a spherical symmetric potential.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.410
So the equation will be
there in a little while.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.190
Then we'll look at
the hydrogen atom.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.000
We'll begin the hydrogen
atom and this task why?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.510
Having a proton
and an electron we

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.050
can reduce this system to
as if we had one particle

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.500
in a central potential.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.630
So that will be also very
important physically.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.530
So let's move ahead.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:15.630
And here there is a simple
observation that one can make.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:26.919
Is that the differential
equation for p l m depends on m

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:27.419
squared.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:41.115
We expect to need values of m
that are positive and negative.

00:09:41.115 --> 00:09:46.430
You have wave functions
here, of this form.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.402
The complex conjugate
ones should be

00:09:49.402 --> 00:09:51.170
thought as having m negative.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:56.990
So we expect positive and
negative m's to be allowed.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.950
So how did people
figure this out?

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.990
They, in fact, figured out that
if you have these polynomials

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:12.950
you can create automatically
the solutions for this equation.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:18.110
There's a rule, a simple
rule that leads to solutions.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:27.110
You put p l m of x is
equal to 1 minus x squared,

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.010
to the absolute
value of m over 2.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.560
So there are square
roots here, possibly.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.880
An absolute value of m
means that this is always

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.870
in the numerator, whether
m is positive or negative.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:50.654
And d, dx acting exactly
absolute value of m times on p

00:10:50.654 --> 00:10:54.610
l x.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:03.240
The fact is that this definition
solves the differential

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.700
equation star.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.780
This takes a little
work to check.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.500
I will not check it, nor
the notes will check it.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.850
It's probably
something you can find

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.690
the calculation in some books.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.550
But it's not all that important.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.220
The important thing to
note here is the following.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.310
That this provides solutions.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:47.956
Since this polynomial is like
x to the l plus x to the l

00:11:47.956 --> 00:11:53.510
minus 2 plus
coefficients like this.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:59.140
You can think that most
m equal l derivatives--

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.540
if you take more than l
derivatives you get 0.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.680
And there's no great
honor in finding

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.010
zero solution of this equation.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.270
These are no solutions.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:18.200
So this produces solutions
for an, absolute value of m,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.390
less than l.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:30.242
So produces solutions
for absolute value

00:12:30.242 --> 00:12:35.080
of m less or equal to l.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:42.516
And therefore m in
between l and minus l.

00:12:47.446 --> 00:12:51.005
But that's not all that happens.

00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:56.090
There's a little more that
takes mathematicians some skill

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.940
to do.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.720
It's to show that there
are no more solutions.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.360
You might seem that
you were very clever

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.840
and you found some
solutions, but it's a theorem

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.460
that there are no
more solutions.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:22.836
No additional regular solutions.

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.405
I mean solutions
that don't diverge.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.710
So this is very important.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:36.030
It shows that there is one
more constraint on your quantum

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.800
numbers.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.000
This formula you may
forget, but you should never

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.246
forget this one.

00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:52.830
This one says that if you
choose some l which corresponds

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.600
to choosing the magnitude
of the angular momentum,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.880
l is the eigenvalue
that tells you

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.940
about the magnitude of
the angular momentum.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.870
You will have several
possibilities for m.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:13.140
There will be several
states that have the same l,

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.910
but m different.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.960
So for example you'll
have l equal 0, in which

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.220
case m must be equal to 0.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.841
But if you choose
state with l equals 1,

00:14:27.841 --> 00:14:31.040
or eigenfunctions
with l equal 1,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:37.150
there is the possibility of
having m equals minus 1, 0,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.660
or 1.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.810
So are three waves
functions in that case.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:51.700
Psi 1, minus 1, psi
1, 0, and psi 1, 1.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.230
So in general when we
choose a general l,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.420
if you choose an
arbitrary l, then

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:05.780
m goes from minus l, minus l
plus 1 all the way up to l.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:15.858
These are all the values
which are 2l plus 1 values.

00:15:15.858 --> 00:15:19.140
2l and the 0 value in between.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.430
So it's 2l plus 1 values.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.860
The quantization in
some sense is done now.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.080
And let me recap about
these functions now.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.270
We mentioned up there that
the y l m's are the objects.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.380
The spherical
harmonicas are going

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.786
to be those wave functions.

00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:50.230
And they have a normalization,
n l m, an exponention,

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.090
and all that.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.600
So let me write,
just for the record,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:00.440
what a y l m looks like
with all the constants.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.230
Well, the normalization
constant is complicated.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.925
And it's kind of a thing you
can never remember by heart.

00:16:10.925 --> 00:16:12.750
It would be pointless.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:16.830
OK.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.930
All of that.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:22.806
Then a minus 1 to
the m seems useful.

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:32.720
e to the i m phi, p
l m of cosine theta.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:41.120
And this is all valid for
0 less 0 m positive m.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.950
When you have negative m you
must do a little variation

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:55.140
for m less than 0 y l m of
theta and phi is minus 1

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:07.359
to the m y l minus m of theta
and phi complex conjugated.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:12.569
Well, if m is negative,
minus m is positive.

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.150
So you know what that is.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.750
So you could plug
this whole mess here.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.504
I don't advise it.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.750
It's just for the record.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.260
These polynomials
are complicated,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.369
but they are normalized nicely.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:30.070
And we just need to
understand what it

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.580
means to be normalized nicely.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.370
That is important for us.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:42.040
The specific forms of these
polynomials we can find them.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:50.680
The only one I really remember
is that y 0 0 is a constant.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.490
It's 1 over 4 pi.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.230
That's simple enough.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.230
No dependents. l
equals 0, m equals 0.

00:18:01.541 --> 00:18:03.600
Here is another one.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:11.954
y1 plus minus 1 is minus plus
square root of 3 over 8 pi

00:18:11.954 --> 00:18:20.690
e to the plus minus
i phi sine theta.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:26.170
And the last one,
so we're giving

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:30.300
all the spherical
harmonics with l equals 1.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.230
So with l equals 1
remember we mentioned

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.670
that you would have
three values of m.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.760
Here they are.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.496
Plus or minus 1 and 0.

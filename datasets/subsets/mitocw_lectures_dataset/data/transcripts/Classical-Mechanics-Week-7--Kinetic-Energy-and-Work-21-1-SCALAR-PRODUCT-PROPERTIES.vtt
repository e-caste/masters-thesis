00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.920
We now would like to
generalize our concept of work

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.650
to the motion of
an object that goes

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.600
in more than one dimension.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.970
And so, if we have
our object here.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.160
And we're applying a force.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.110
And the object is moving.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.800
And let's say the path is a
little bit more complicated.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.150
So our object, a little
bit later, has moved.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.030
And we're going to
call that displacement.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.800
We now want to
generalize our concept

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.980
to work to handle
this type of motion

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.900
in more than one dimension.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.720
In order to do that, we'll need
a new mathematical operation,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.940
which we're going to
call the scalar product.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.890
So what I'd like to
do first, is define

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.870
this in terms of
vectors and then

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.300
we'll apply it to
the concept of work.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.900
So suppose I have two vectors,
a, and another vector, b.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.200
And they're separated
by an angle, theta.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.260
And in this case,
our theta, we're

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.400
going to just take
it between 0 and pi.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.600
Now, I'd like to talk about
how much one vector projects

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.240
in the direction of the other.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.010
So if I call this the
parallel component of b.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.060
Then I want to define a quantity
which we're going to call

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.580
the scalar product of a dot b.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.729
Which is the
magnitude of a times

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.940
the amount of b that is in
the direction parallel to a.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.490
From our geometric
diagram, you can

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.830
see that b parallel is
equal to the magnitude of b

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.979
times the cosine of theta.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.530
Remember, theta's
going from 0 to pi.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.470
So this quantity,
b parallel, can

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.180
both be positive or negative.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:10.478
If theta is between 0 and
pi/2, then in that range,

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:13.540
the cosine goes from 1 to 0.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.030
And this quantity, b, will
be greater or equal to 0.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.310
b parallel.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.490
If theta is going from
pi/2, theta to pi,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:37.120
then we have that b parallel
is less than or equal to 0.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.960
And, in particular,
at the value pi/2,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.880
b parallel is 0 because
when theta is pi/2,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.466
the b vector is completely
perpendicular to a.

00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:50.320
And this is what
we're going to define

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.090
to be the scalar product.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.160
But geometrically, we can
also look at-- let's draw

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.670
our pictures again-- a and b.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.610
Let's consider how much
of the a is parallel to b.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.950
So that's a parallel.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.460
And if this is the
angle theta, we

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.380
see that a parallel--
and I'll write it

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.290
as a parallel-- is the magnitude
of a times cosine of theta.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.520
And so, I can also
define a dot b

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.310
as equal to how much of
how much of a is parallel

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.480
to b times the magnitude of b.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.150
In both of these
instances, because b

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.110
parallel is the magnitude
of b cosine theta,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.500
and a parallel is a magnitude
of a cosine theta, what we're

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.820
writing is that a dot b is the
magnitude of a cosine theta

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.890
magnitude of b.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.860
And now you can see that
this quantity is a parallel.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.270
And this quantity is b parallel.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.630
And this is our geometric
definition of a dot product.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.390
One thing that we
want to consider

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.620
are two important
rules for dot products.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.270
And they're the following.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.650
That if we take a vector and
multiply a by a quantity-- c,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.310
here, is a scalar
quantity-- then

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.720
this is equal to
c times a dot b.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.540
Geometrically, this
is very easy to see.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.960
Because if we draw
a and we draw b.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.350
And if I multiply a by a
scalar, and let's make,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.540
in this particular
picture, our scalar

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.940
bigger than 1, then the
new vector a is multiplied

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.510
by c and it's c times a.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:16.500
The scalar product is just ca
dot b, is the magnitude of ca

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.760
times how much of b is parallel.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.380
And when you multiply
this together,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.324
you get c times a
times to b parallel.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:37.070
c of a dot b is equal to c
times the magnitude of a times

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.010
b parallel.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.730
And you can see that these
two expressions are equal.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.370
If you multiply a dot
product by a scalar,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.740
it satisfies this rule.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.110
And there's one
other crucial rule

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.780
that we'll need when
we look at vectors.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:03.670
That if you take a vector a
and you add to it, a vector b,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.160
and you dotted in
a vector c, then

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.520
this is vector addition
and multiplication.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.200
This vector addition distributes
over vector multiplication

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.040
by a dot c plus b dot c.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:33.310
So these two facts are crucial
to our development of vectors.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.560
One thing that we
can say is-- we'll

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.920
leave this as a little exercise
for you to prove this result.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.920
It's a pretty straightforward
vector construction.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.380
And to just give you a
little bit of a hint.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.800
If we have a vector a
and another vector b

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:00.070
and we have a similar
vector c, then

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:07.960
if I draw the vector a
dot b plus b and I want

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.980
to take a dot c.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.460
So I have how much of
a is parallel to c.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.560
And if I look at how much
of b is parallel to c, then

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.830
as part of the exercise,
make sure that you

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.060
can see that how much of
a plus b parallel to c

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.980
agrees to this
distributive rule.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.540
So these are our definition
of scalar product.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.070
And the two key facts that
we'll need when we apply it

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.199
in our example of work.

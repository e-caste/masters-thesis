00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:16.830
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.910
Let's resume.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.600
I cut things off at a time when
we had the final answer.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.180
And I left you hanging because
we don't know what the final

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.050
answer is telling us.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.920
This says that as we change the
orientation of the normal

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.710
to the plate, relative to x3
and, secondarily, as we change

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.340
the angle between the threefold
axis and x2, we get

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.270
this strange third-rank
trigonometric function.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.020
Let's convert these cosines into
the appropriate angles.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.180
This was the twofold axis.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.320
And this was x1.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.610
This was the direction of
the threefold axis.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.290
This was x3.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.290
And this is the direction x2.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.630
And that comes out in between
a pair of twofold axes.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.380
And we may want to look at this
from up above, relative

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.450
to these twofold axes
that occur.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.270
This thing here looks like
a trigonometric identity,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.840
doesn't it?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.420
Let's let this angle
here be theta.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.600
And l1, then, is cosine
of theta.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.790
And so our geometry is that this
is l1 cosine of theta.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.730
This is l2, which is the cosine
of the angle between

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.640
our direction and x2.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:10.070
And that is the cosine of
pi over 2, minus theta.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.500
And that, then, is equal
to sine of theta.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.790
So this identity, as
you all know--

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.210
I'm not telling you anything
that you don't already know--

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.770
this is d is equal to
d1,1 1, times the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.180
cosine of 3 theta, right?

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.380
You knew that.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.220
Believe it or not, it is.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.090
It's one of these obscure
trigonometric identities,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.400
which wouldn't occur to you in
a million years unless you go

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.110
digging through some
handbooks.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.460
So this is rather astonishingly
simple.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.420
It's simply a cosine function.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.330
But the interesting thing
is it goes as a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.040
function of 3 theta.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.640
So this goes through one cycle
between a pair of adjacent

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.660
twofold axes.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.260
So it starts out as d1,1.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.090
And it finishes up at d1,1.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.420
And in between it
is minus d1,1.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.150
And so it goes down.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.220
And now we come to something
that I do differently than

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.200
most people do.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.710
Most people will say it
goes as minus d1,1.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:34.760
But minus d1,1 I like to show
as a lobe going off in this

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.705
direction, with a minus sign.

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:42.896
AUDIENCE: How do you get
that cosine of 3 theta?

00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:43.384
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:03:43.384 --> 00:03:46.800
AUDIENCE: How do you get d
equals d1 cosine 3 theta?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.776
PROFESSOR: How do I get that?

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:48.264
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:48.264 --> 00:03:51.192
PROFESSOR: That is just a
trigonometric identify,

00:03:51.192 --> 00:03:55.430
believe it or not, a well-known

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.970
trigonometric identify.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.200
Actually, it's an exceedingly
obscure

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.590
trigonometric identity.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.350
So the way this is going to go
from x1 is it's going to be a

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.830
positive lobe around x1.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.060
There's going to be a negative
lobe along x2 and then a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.130
positive lobe again about the
twofold axis that's 120

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.300
degrees away.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.770
And then a negative lobe, and
then a positive lobe opposite

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.550
this negative lobe, and a
negative lobe opposite this

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.630
positive lobe.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.950
So it's a six-membered--

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.000
six lobes.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.120
There is always a positive lobe
opposite a negative lobe.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.820
And what this means is that the
charge is of opposite sign

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.620
on opposite ends of
the twofold axes.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.980
So the response peaks
up on twofold axes.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.700
Now the thing that I don't like
is that what Nye does is

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.540
to say, OK, this is
a negative value.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.410
So you should plot the radius
in a negative direction.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.110
And that puts it over here,
right on top of

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.560
this positive lobe.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.890
So what Nye shows is the polar
plot of this result, in the

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.680
plane of the twofold axes,
is simply this.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.550
This is x1.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.860
And he shows a lobe here.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.580
And he shows a lobe here.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.950
And he shows a lobe here.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.530
And if you interpret that as a
polar plot you say, well, I

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.210
know what the value
is in here.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.320
It's decreasing.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.550
And there's nothing
going on in here.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.220
So the response must be 0.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.180
And then it starts
coming up again.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.860
And there's a response in
different directions here.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.770
And then it goes
back down to 0.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.115
And in this range, there's
nothing going on.

00:05:52.115 --> 00:05:53.500
And that's not true.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.090
What's going on is a negative
value of the modulus.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.860
And to me, that becomes
abundantly clear if you just

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.590
put a sign that labels the sign
of the modulus within

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.840
those lobes.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.070
Now I submit, that's pretty
anisotropic, isn't it?

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.620
Yes, Steve?

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.020
AUDIENCE: Did you just
arbitrarily choose where your

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.586
positive and negatives
go, is it [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:23.586 --> 00:06:24.062
out here?

00:06:24.062 --> 00:06:24.540
PROFESSOR: No.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.530
This comes out here.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.340
When l1 is 0, that's--

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.590
excuse me.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.830
When the angle is
0, l1 is plus 1.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.340
Remember that l1 is the
cosine of this angle.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.480
When that angle is 0, then
the value is plus 1.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.500
So I was careful to put
the label x1 on this.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.850
Now the other thing that we
should examine is how these

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.840
lobes vary in a direction
perpendicular to x, in a

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.830
direction that includes x3.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:13.790
So let us look at how the
function varies in a direction

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.105
perpendicular to--

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.930
that includes x1 and x3.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.180
OK.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.190
Call this angle phi.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:40.070
And in the x1, x3 plane, d1,1,1
prime turns out to be

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.800
l1 cubed d1,1.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.960
Before you go to our
general expression.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.020
And l2 is cosine of 90.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.160
This thing drops out.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.830
We're left with simply
d1,1 prime equals

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.300
l cubed times d1,1.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:08.090
So this then goes as cosine
cubed of phi, which is a lobe

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.580
that starts out at plus 1.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.740
And then because it's cosine
cubed, this dies out very,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.920
very rapidly.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:25.090
So these lobes are very flat in
the x1, x2 plane, die out

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.610
very rapidly as the cube of phi,
where phi is the angle

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.380
between the twofold
axis and x3.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.000
So the interesting thing about
this surface is that if you

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.610
decided to pick up the random
fragment of crystal and

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.050
determine what its Piezoelectric
Modulus is.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.540
One way of doing this,
a poor man's test for

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.330
piezoelectricity is to just
clamp a fragment of crystal

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:04.570
between two electrodes and
then hook this up to a

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.700
variable frequency generator
that sweeps through a range of

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.920
frequencies, changes the
frequency of a voltage across

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.730
these plates, and then comes
back and sweeps again.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.160
Or alternatively, have
a knob one on that

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.780
lets you change frequency.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.290
Then put a pair of earphones
across the crystal.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.640
And if we would do that, by
having this variable frequency

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.960
generator, as we turned it,
when we hit a resonant

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.800
frequency that set up either
a full wavelength of a

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.710
vibrational wave in
the crystal--

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.690
or half wavelength, or one
wavelength, or 3/2

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.680
wavelength--

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.060
there'd be a resonance.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.430
And the capacitance does
something crazy.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.560
It does like this as
you go through

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.390
the resonant frequency.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.860
And then your simple
detector--

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.820
a pair of earphones--

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.870
as you tuned the frequency, you
would hear static as you

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.190
went through this discontinuity
in capacitance.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.750
Or alternatively, you could put
this on a cathode ray tube

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:13.230
and just have a sweep frequency
and put the voltage

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:18.530
across the electrodes on the
oscilloscope screen.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.660
And you would see something
like this, and then this

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.560
discontinuity, and then
maybe second harmonic.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.640
And it would work just fine.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.520
This is a poor man's way of
detecting piezoelectricity.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.440
But what if--

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.260
what if--

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.040
you happen to have your piece of
quartz with the electrodes

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.470
directly on the c-axis?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.080
The modulus would be 0, and you
wouldn't detect anything.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.830
Or if you put on the probes
such that they were in a

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.070
direction that was in between
these lobes where, again, the

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.580
Piezoelectric Modulus
has gone to 0.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.390
You wouldn't find anything.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.790
So measuring the Piezoelectric
Modulus for a random chunk of

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.160
material is dangerous, if you
just look at one direction and

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.780
say nothing's going on; it's
not piezoelectric.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.940
The other thing is the
material could have a

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.910
piezoelectric response that's
so weak you just

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.430
can't measure it.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.260
Yeah, OK?

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.670
AUDIENCE: This stuff's only for
single crystals, right?

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.315
Because if you [INAUDIBLE]
polycrystal material, you're

00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:15.490
getting [INAUDIBLE] averaging.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.380
PROFESSOR: You're averaging
over all directions.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.910
So this is for a
single crystal.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:23.770
And that's the only time you
get these exotic, very

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.020
anisotropic surfaces.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.190
Another method that I've
seen in a rather old

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.320
book is really nice.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.840
What you do is you cut your
crystal into a little plate.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:50.110
And then you drive the plate by
means of putting electrodes

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.500
on it and hook this up to
a variable frequency.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.540
And if the material is
transparent, you will set up--

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.740
depending on the velocity of
sound in the material--

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.470
you will set up standing
waves when you

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.220
hit the right frequency.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.110
And these lines that I've drawn
are places where the

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.420
displacement is always 0.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.750
And these things that I've
indicated at little squares is

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.780
a region where the displacement
goes up and down

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.630
between its maximum and
minimum extreme.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.460
Now if this crystal is
transparent and you shine a

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:35.230
light through it, these little
regions bounded by lines of

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.470
zero displacement act
like little lenses.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:43.870
So if you pass a beam of light
through it, you get a bunch of

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.950
right maxima, little focused
spots on the sheet.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.120
And you can determine for a
particular frequency if this

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.745
is the 1 and 1/2 wavelengths
along a dimension that you

00:12:54.745 --> 00:13:01.560
know, you can again find the
Piezoelectric Moduli.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.010
So there are lots of ways of
detecting this effect.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.050
But when you have a single
crystal, you've got to really

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.940
look at this as a function
of direction, to

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.190
be absolutely sure.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:24.530
One other Piezoelectric Modulus
is in the problem set.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.590
4 bar 3m, this is the structure
of sphalerite and a

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:34.800
lot of the compound
semiconductors.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.000
This is not in the notes.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.620
But if you try the problem,
what you find is, again, a

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.210
highly, highly anisotropic
behavior.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:47.340
And this is the direction of the
unit cell of the crystal.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.290
You find that the piezoelectric
response is a

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:55.070
series of very sharp lobes,
positive and negative, going

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.260
along the directions of the body
diagonal, namely the 1,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.410
1, 1 directions in
the crystal.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.420
And then there's another
lobe that goes like

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.040
this, negative, positive.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.850
Another lobe that goes up here,
positive and negative.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.630
So very sharp lobes along the
body diagonal, alternately

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.500
positive, negative, positive,
negative as you go around 0,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.750
0, 1 plane.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.330
OK.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.890
That's what the longitudinal
piezoelectric effect is like.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:36.900
You can invent single-crystal
devices for weighing fish.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.720
And then you have an interesting
question.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.930
If you hang the weight on the
crystal, and it's a flat

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:48.010
plate, how would you orient the
crystal to get the optimum

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.990
sensitivity?

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.460
So you define a scalar modulus
for the crystal in the

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.810
particular direction you're
exerting a uniaxial stress.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:01.480
And then you express this module
in terms of theta, the

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:07.020
angle of rotation, within
the crystographic plane.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.290
In the case of the sup cell if
you looked at that geometry,

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.660
that is a flat plate subject
to compression, where you

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:20.920
measure the surface charge
perpendicular to the direction

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.230
of the uniaxial stress,
not parallel to it

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.540
as we've done here.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.850
And then there's a question if
you rotate the plane of the

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:31.240
crystal about the imposed
stress, what orientation gives

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.890
you optimum, maximum response?

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.970
So there are fun things that
you could do with that.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.610
We have a quiz next time.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:48.000
There's a lame-duck period after
the quiz will be over.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.550
And I want to say a little bit
about the tensor aspects of

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.440
elastic moduli.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.640
Mechanical behavior is something
that you have or

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.020
will cover in great detail in
a graduate-level class on

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.770
mechanics, but I think very
few people who deal with

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.960
things other than cubic
materials or with

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.850
single-crystal materials where
the elastic constants are

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:25.210
functions of crystal symmetry
and direction.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.670
So let me, at least at the
time available, set up a

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:37.270
definition of stress
in terms of strain.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.980
Stress is a second-rank
tensor.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:46.080
There are six unique
components.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.230
So we could write an expression
for sigma 1,1;

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:58.780
sigma 2,2; sigma 3,3; sigma
4,4; and sigma 5,5.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:04.092
And sigma--

00:17:04.092 --> 00:17:05.750
AUDIENCE: --1,2.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:13.300
PROFESSOR: No, I want to
go down like this.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:23.940
So this would be sigma 2,3;
sigma 1,3; and sigma 1,2;

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.160
eventually to be known as sigma
1, sigma 2, sigma 3,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.420
sigma 4, sigma 5,
and sigma six.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.430
But actually, if we're writing
out a full tensor relation, we

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.450
should write down all
six elements here.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:44.080
So let me do that and
put in a 3,2.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.820
Put in all nine of them, because
before we condense to

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.080
matrix form, that is what
we're going to have.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.910
So we'll have a sigma 2,3; we'll
have a sigma 3,2; we'll

00:17:52.910 --> 00:18:00.650
have a sigma 1,3; a sigma 3,1;
a sigma 1,2; and a sigma 2,1.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.460
And we can express each of the
stresses in terms of the

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.720
elements of strain.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.110
So I'll have an epsilon 1,1;
an epsilon 1,2; an epsilon

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:18.132
2,2; an epsilon 3,3; an epsilon
2,3; an epsilon 3,2;

00:18:18.132 --> 00:18:26.190
an epsilon 1,3; an epsilon 3,1;
an epsilon 1,2; and an

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.740
epsilon 2,1.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.290
Nine terms, nine terms.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.810
And in between is going
to be a tensor

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:38.550
consisting of 9 by 9 elements.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.030
There will be 81 different
coefficients in here.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.900
If we want to derive symmetry
constraints, we're going to

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.210
have to, for every one of
those 81 elements, do a

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.700
transformation.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.050
And each transformed element is
going to be a sum of four

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.540
direction cosines times one
tensor element, repeated 81

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.690
different times.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.990
Not something to be undertaken
on a short afternoon.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.090
OK.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.640
What are the tensor
elements in here?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.170
They are represented
by the symbol c.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.840
This would be c1,1,1,1.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:30.880
This would be c1,1,2,2 times
epsilon 2,2; a c1,1,3,3; a

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.830
c1,1,2,3; and so on.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:39.030
And these c's, in one of the
great perversions of

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.960
scientific notation, are
called stiffnesses.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.010
The other thing we could
do is to write

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.870
strain in terms of stress.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.420
And really, stress
is something you

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.570
can do to the crystal.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.380
So stress is an independent
variable.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.010
And this is something that
I feel more at home with.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:14.190
So I'll have an epsilon 1,1;
2,2; 3,3; epsilon 3,2; 2,3;

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:21.010
epsilon 1,3; epsilon
3,1; epsilon 2,1;

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.160
and an epsilon 1,2.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.260
Again, nine elements
of strain.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.120
And these will be given by
coefficients times each of the

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:37.440
nine elements of stress, sigma
1,1; sigma 2,2; sigma 3,3;

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.940
sigma 2,3; sigma 3,2; and
so on for nine different

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.790
components.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:51.020
Andy the coefficients here are
designated with the symbol s.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.800
These are the tensor elements.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.020
So this is s1,1,1.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.890
This is s1,1,2,2.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.900
And the s's stand
for compliances.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.410
Now English is a very
strange language.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:19.350
But to call compliance s and to
call stiffness c is surely

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:24.510
a perversion that can be
designed for no other purpose

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.830
than to confuse the introductory
student and give

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.210
the instructor some feeling
of superiority.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.800
I don't feel superior, I feel
embarrassed that I have to

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.510
explain this.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:42.110
Stiffness, c; compliance, s.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.300
It's got be one of
the atrocities

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.630
of scientific notation.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.920
To remember which goes with
which, I'll tell you what

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.630
works for me.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.620
If it doesn't work for
you, forget it.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.380
The s goes with sigma.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.530
And the little c goes
with the epsilon.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.920
That's a c with a bar in it.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.850
That works for me.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.160
If it doesn't work for you, use
your own mnemonic device.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:22.010
English does a lot of things
strangely, but nothing is as

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.260
perverse as this.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.750
Now what's some examples?

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.090
Consider this.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:34.120
You park your car in your
driveway, but you drive your

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.370
car on a parkway.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.970
Why don't you drive your car
on a driveway and park your

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.110
car in a parkway?

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.160
No, it's the other way around.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.560
It's almost as bad as this.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.810
What are some other ones?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.490
In my basement, I have something
that's called a hot

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.260
water heater.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.890
You don't heat hot water,
you heat cold water.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:02.210
Why isn't it called a
cold water heater?

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.900
Even better, I once worked
for a year and a half in

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.600
Switzerland.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.490
And in the kitchen of my home
I had, in German, an

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.740
elektrowarmwasse
rsheissungsapparat.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:20.440
That's one word that's
11 syllables.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.380
The Germans have a knack with
the language that we have

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.090
never approached in English.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.666
But there's another one
you've probably heard.

00:23:29.666 --> 00:23:31.950
You know what the prefix
"pro" means.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.905
That means for, and "con"
means against.

00:23:34.905 --> 00:23:38.760
And so progress is moving
forward, and I leave it to you

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.360
to decide what Congress means.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.080
OK.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.520
So I could go on and on.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.130
I probably shouldn't, unless
you egg me on.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:53.730
No, I won't.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.440
But anyway, there are--

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.740
OK, I'll give another one.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.025
Why is what a doctor does
called "practice"?

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.590
This is not reassuring at all.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:11.540
Let me invite you over
to my practice.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:17.170
And why is it when you take an
airplane your flight ends with

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.880
a terminal?

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.600
That's doesn't sound very
encouraging either.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.845
So anyway, language is silly.

00:24:23.845 --> 00:24:27.400
And I guess if you want to
call c stiffnesses and s

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.640
compliances, it's OK.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.360
The verbal description of these
terms means something.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:39.180
Because if the stiffness is very
high, that says that a

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.850
little bit of strain requires
that you haven't posed a very

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.970
large stress.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.080
So stiff is when the material
is resistant to stress.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.630
So you have to have a very,
very large strain to get

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.910
yourself a given level
of stress.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:58.290
Conversely, if the material is
very compliant, a very small

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.750
stress for a compliant
material should

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.960
give you a big strain.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.890
And that's exactly what a large
value of s will do.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.080
It will give you a large
strain for a

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.850
relatively small stress.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.730
So the words describe
what's going on.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.550
OK.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:23.620
There is great utility in
reducing these equations to a

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:34.160
matrix form, which is going to
cut us down from a 9 by 9, or

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:41.590
a tensor with 81 elements, to a
smaller number of subscripts

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:48.160
and a smaller number of matrix
elements, so if we let sigma 1

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:55.460
be sigma 1,1; if we let sigma
2 be equal to sigma 2,2 and

00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.330
sigma 3 be equal to sigma 3.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:05.080
And then if we write the
inequalities we've had before,

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:12.420
and we let epsilon 1,1 to be
replaced by epsilon 1, then we

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:18.550
would have out in front here a
term simply c1,1, a 1 for the

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.130
sigma and a 1 for the epsilon.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:26.620
The next term would be c1,2
times epsilon 2, where

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.930
obviously epsilon 2 has replaced
epsilon 2,2, and 1

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.370
stands for the two
indices, 1,1.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.300
So this will go c1,3;
epsilon 3.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.140
And then you hit these
messy factors of two.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.750
You'll have a pair of terms.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.950
You'll have c1,4.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:58.300
And that will stand for
a term c1,1,2,3.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:04.300
And then there'll be another
term c1,1,3,2.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.760
And if you want to write this
as a matrix, c1,4 has to be

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.140
equal to the sum of these two
things, times epsilon 4.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.570
That's the only way you can
write it as a matrix.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:20.950
And if you think it was bad
worrying about a factor of 2

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.490
in front of half of the terms on
the right-hand side of the

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:29.520
equation, we're going to be
dealing with factors of 2 for

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.000
terms in the upper
3 by 3 array.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.730
We're going to be worrying about
a factor of 4, somehow

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.010
or other, down in the
lower 3 by 3 array.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.360
So the way you handle the
factor of 2 really is a

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.260
nightmare for relations
in elasticity.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:28:02.260
But continuing on with the first
line, c1,5 times epsilon

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:11.710
5 would be a combination of
c1,1,3,1 plus 1,1,1,3.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:17.860
And then finally, when you get
to c1,6 times epsilon 6, that

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:28.520
would represent a combination
of c1,1,2,1 plus c1,1,1,2.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.400
You have to make a decision
where to swallow the 2.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.790
And probably the best thing
I can do is to give you

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.270
conventions for relabeling
stress, strain, stiffness, and

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:43.870
compliance, which I'll
pass around to you.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:49.700
No big deal, except that this
is a case where you can eat

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.690
the 2's early on, but you
can't even break even.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:05.150
So very, very briefly, what
you do is you convert the

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.510
tensor elements of stress to
matrix elements in exactly the

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.930
same way we did with
piezoelectricity.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:21.230
For strains, we do exactly the
same thing that we did with

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.950
the converse piezoelectric
effect.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:27.810
The factor of 2 that you
swallowed in definition of

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.350
stress pops up to haunt
you when you

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.560
deal with the strains.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:39.160
And you cannot write a nice
matrix relation unless you

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.500
divide the off-diagonal elements
of strain by 1/2.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.770
And that was exactly the same
thing we encountered with the

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:50.110
converse piezoelectric effect,
which related strain to an

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.640
applied electric field.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:59.790
In defining the matrix
stiffnesses, the c's, you

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:04.460
forge straight ahead, and you
let ci,j,k,l, which is

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.780
identical to ci,j,l,k--

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:13.180
that's the term that relates the
two equal shear stresses--

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.760
and you define that as a
matrix term with two

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.810
subscripts.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.580
No factors of 2 or
4 are involved.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:28.150
Then when you hit the s's,
there's a nightmare.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:35.810
si,j,k,l is sm,n if m and n
are 1, 2, or 3; that is to

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.720
say, not 4, 5, or 6.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:44.640
si,j,k,l, which is the same as
s,i,j,l,k, has to be defined

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:52.560
as one half of sm,n, where
m or n is 4, 5, or 6.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.250
And then finally, you have to
throw in a factor of 4 when

00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:00.900
both m and n are 4, 5, or six
or, in other words, m and n

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.640
are not 1, 2, or 3.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.680
So it is a mess.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.750
And these are rules that you
have to bear in mind if you're

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:15.030
ever going to go from matrix
form, which works absolutely

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.620
lovely in a fixed coordinate
system.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.775
But if you have a single crystal
and you want to refer

00:31:20.775 --> 00:31:25.520
it to different axes, you have
to be prepared to resurrect

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.320
the full tensor form.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:33.490
And then and only then can you
work symmetry transformations.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:37.380
I don't want to go through the
simple algebra of expanding

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.150
and contracting these terms.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:43.330
So the next two sheets show
you how you condense from

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:48.050
tensor to matrix notation, and
then go back from matrix

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.940
notation to tensor notation.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.700
This is for the compliances
si,j,k.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.280
And the next page does the same
thing, if you care to

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.190
write stress in terms
of strain.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.570
And there are a lot
more factors of

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.130
2 that appear there.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.490
But again, it shows you how you
go from tensor notation,

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.160
for subscripts on the c's, down
to matrix notation with 2

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.080
subscripts, and then go back up
again to tensor notation.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.860
So it's a tedious business.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.010
And you've got to keep careful
tracks of your factors of 2

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.260
and your factors of 4.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.470
How about symmetry
restrictions?

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.550
Holy mackerel.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.570
Transformation of 81
different elements.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.480
Well, in order to do the tensor
transformations, you

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.940
have to go to the full-force
subscript notation.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.450
Only then is a law of
transformation defined.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:48.230
Fourth-rank properties
are even tensors.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.370
So mercifully, there are
not as many different

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.370
possibilities.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.070
All point groups that differ
by presence or absence of

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.020
inversion have exactly the
same form of the tensor.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.430
So symmetry 2, m, and
2/m look alike.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:07.250
Symmetry 2, 2mm, and 2/m,
2/m, 2/m look alike.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.550
So there's only one orthorhombic
tensor, only one

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:15.160
kind of monoclinic tensor, only
one kind of triclinic

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.500
tensor, and so on.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.540
And the only place that you have
more than one form of the

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:26.710
tensor for a particular set of
point groups is looking at the

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:31.780
point groups that are based
on single-rotation axes,

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.870
something like 4, 4 bar 4m, and
those that are based on

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.940
the axial arrangements
4, 2, 2.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.850
So they're different, just as
they were for second-rank

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.790
tensor properties.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:46.980
For cubic, a rather
remarkable result.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:53.540
There are three independent
compliances.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.920
But cubic crystals are not
elastically isotropic.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.190
They are anisotropic.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.830
And it's just the nature of the
tensor that requires that.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:06.060
So rather than letting you hang
by your thumbs wondering

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.900
what's on these pages, let me
pass around the summary of

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.270
symmetry constraints.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:15.060
If you understood what we did
for third-rank tensors or even

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.900
second-rank tensors,
you how to do this.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.310
And fortunately, the
terms almost over.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.920
So I can't make you do it, which
is probably an enormous

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.170
relief to you.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.350
Some additional bits
of information.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.850
The transformations for
hexagonal crystals are

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:46.630
complicated because threefold
and sixfold axes do not change

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.980
the reference axes x1, x2,
x3 into one another.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:59.330
And the equations that relate
the individual tensor elements

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.230
are more complex.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:08.400
For the threefold axis, for
example, 2 s1,1 minus 2 s1,2

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.420
is equal to s4,4.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.890
So they're not simple relations
between them.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.160
And that's simply because
you're not changing one

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.920
reference access into another.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.120
You're changing x1, for
example, into a linear

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.980
combination of x1 and x2.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.860
Two things down here
of interest.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.300
I said that cubic crystals
are not isotropic.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.780
What would have to be
the case if the

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:42.630
material were to be isotropic?

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.120
Well, it turns out that if you
do this for the compliances,

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:53.100
s, if 1/2 of s4,4 is equal to
s1,1 minus s1,2, then the

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.680
material is elastically
isotropic.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.325
If you do this in terms
stiffnesses, the c's, then 2

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:06.780
c4,4 is equal to c1,1 minus
c1,2 if the material is

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.065
supposed to be isotropic or
going to be isotropic.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:18.330
Then there is one
other inequality

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.620
that depends on structure.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:25.200
And this is something known
as the Cauchy relation.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.610
And it depends on the
interatomic forces.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.500
The first condition that has to
be met is that the forces

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.970
between the atoms should
be central forces.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.150
What is a central force?

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:43.890
Well, this is a case where the
attractive force between the

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.610
atoms is directly along the line
joining their centers.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:51.170
Isn't that always the case?

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:54.100
Don't crystals hold together
because there's an attractive

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.722
force between atoms?

00:36:57.722 --> 00:37:03.660
Well actually, for metallic
crystals and ionic crystals,

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.270
maybe that's not a bad
assumption, particularly for

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.460
ionic crystals.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:11.670
But if you had a covalent
material, where the bonding

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:16.730
was due to overlap of orbitals
like this, then the thing that

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.580
holds the crystal together
is overlap

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.240
between these orbitals.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.080
And the force holding the atoms
together is a force that

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.580
goes through this shared
electron pair.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.530
And that's not a
central force.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.780
And so the Cauchy relation
generally fails rather badly

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.230
for covalently bonded
materials.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:42.080
Second assumption is
that each atom is

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.970
at a center of symmetry.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.580
And the reason for that is so
the force in the plus-x

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.120
direction is the same
as the force

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.260
in the minus-x direction.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.780
And that is not true for any
material that has tetrahedral

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.580
coordination.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.830
So it's not true for any
of the forms of SiO2.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.480
It's not true for any of the
compound semiconductors that

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.520
are based on tetrahedral
units.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.010
So there, the atom inside of
these tetrahedra is decidedly

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.740
not at an inversion center.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.760
And finally, you assume that the
crystal is under no state

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.250
of initial stress.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.950
Because if it is under initial
stress, you've squished it,

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.700
you've stretched the bonds.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.330
And the forces--

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.720
not to a major degree, to be
sure, but-- the forces will

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.460
not truly be perfect
central forces.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:38.100
So if all three of these
assumptions are satisfied,

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.120
then you have an additional
equality

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.980
c1,2 is equal to c4,4.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.650
What I'll do next time is I'll
bring in some examples of data

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:52.720
for stiffnesses and compliances
and, in

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:58.620
particular, show you how some
of these elastic tensor

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.430
elements change with
temperature.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.040
And we can examine them to see
how well the Cauchy equality

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.050
or the isotropy condition
is satisfied.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.070
All right.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:13.300
That's about all that we'll
do about the definition of

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.070
fourth-rank tensor properties.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.680
On next Tuesday to wrap the
term up, we'll look at the

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.720
variation of some elastic
moduli, such as Young's

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.400
Modulus or the shear modulus,
for different symmetries as a

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.260
function of direction
in the crystal, OK?

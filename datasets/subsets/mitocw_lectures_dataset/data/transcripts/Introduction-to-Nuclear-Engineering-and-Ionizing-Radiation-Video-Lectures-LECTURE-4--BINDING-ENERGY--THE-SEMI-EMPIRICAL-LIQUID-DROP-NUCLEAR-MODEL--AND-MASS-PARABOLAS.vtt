MICHAEL SHORT: Want
to give a quick review

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.030
so that we can launch into some
more technical stuff today.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.840
We started talking about this
reaction for boron neutron

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.430
capture therapy was the
focus of today's lecture.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.180
And I want to get this
one up on the board

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.170
since I'm going to move
to different slides later.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.650
We had boron 10
captures a neutron

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.980
and becomes lithium 7, helium 4.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.360
There's a gamma ray.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.560
And there's going to be
some q value, or energy

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.470
either released or consumed,
in this case, released

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.010
in the form of the kinetic
energy of the recoil products

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.410
as well as the gamma ray energy.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.710
So let's also give a quick
review of the Q equation

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010
since I think we
covered that last week.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.770
If you remember, if you have a
general system of, let's say,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.100
a small initial nucleus i firing
into a larger nucleus capital

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.650
I, after the reaction, off
comes some small final nucleus

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.480
and some large final nucleus.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.210
If I were to draw
these arrows to scale,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.220
the little one would
probably be moving faster.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.370
Then we can figure out how
much mass and kinetic energy

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.310
each of these nuclei are by
just conserving everything.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.400
So we can write, let's
say, the mass of nucleus i,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.820
c squared plus the
kinetic energy of i

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.000
plus the mass of
big I c squared.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.850
Plus the kinetic energy of big I
has to equal the mass of little

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.920
f c squared plus the
kinetic energy of little f

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.160
plus the mass of big F c
squared plus its kinetic energy.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.250
And what this tells us is
if the total amount of mass,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.500
or the total kinetic
energy change,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.900
they've got to exchange
energy kind of equally.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.780
So we can write the difference
in mass or energy by just,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.760
let's say, taking
all of the mass terms

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.620
and putting them on one side.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.670
So we can say that--

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.360
let's just say everything here
is multiplied by c squared.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.730
We have M i plus M I minus
M little f minus M big F

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.210
has got to equal the sum of
the final kinetic energies

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:53.390
minus the initial ones, which
we also call this Q value.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.300
And so by getting the
difference in the masses

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.400
or the kinetic
energies at the end,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.080
you can figure out
whether this reaction

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.360
is exothermic or endothermic.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.010
If you remember, we said
if Q is greater than 0,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.370
it's exothermic.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.660
If Q is less than
zero, it's endothermic.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.390
In a nuclear reaction
like a chemical reaction,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.000
you've got to input extra
energy into the system

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.700
beyond just the rest
masses of the particles

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.880
to make an endothermic
reaction happen.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.340
For example, since we found
out that this BNCT reaction is

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.510
endothermic, you can
make it go the other way,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.570
but you have to impart
kinetic energy to one

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.000
or both of those nuclei to
overcome the Q value that--

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.170
let's see-- yeah, to overcome
the Q value that you'd get.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.720
And I want to put up a
couple of other terms just

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.470
to quickly review.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.120
We started looking at
the table of nuclides.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.430
We learned how to read it
specifically to find things

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.950
like excess mass
and binding energy,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.080
the definitions for which I want
to leave up here on the board.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.230
So we had the excess mass,
which, again, doesn't

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.910
have a physical significance.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.210
It's the difference between
the actual mass of a nucleotide

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.790
and the integer
approximation of its mass

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.640
just from the number of
protons and neutrons,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.440
and the binding energy.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.230
Since some of you asked
for a nucleus uniquely

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.060
defined by its total mass number
a and number of protons z.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.340
So let's say this is
a functional quantity

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.590
because you can have any
nucleus with a certain number

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.220
of protons and a certain
number of protons plus neutrons

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.740
would be the sum--

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:43.970
let's see-- the sum of
its individual nucleons

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.590
minus its actual
mass, which also

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.650
is a function of z
and a, or its proton

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.210
number and its total
atomic mass number.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.710
So let's leave these
things up on the board

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.400
while we move into
some new stuff.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.750
So back to where
we were on Tuesday.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.640
We wanted to figure
out, well, how do we

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.140
calculate this Q value?

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.430
You can do it any of three ways.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.880
You can use the masses,
like we have over here.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.080
So the masses in amu, or atomic
mass units, times c squared

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.360
gives you the Q value in MeV.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.490
Or the difference
in kinetic energies

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.890
gives you the Q value in MeV,
although you don't usually

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.350
just know these off
the bat, especially

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.970
for the final products.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.040
Or you can use the
binding energies.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.710
Because the binding
energy is directly related

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.580
to the mass additively, you can
substitute in binding energies

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.040
here and you'll
get the same thing.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.620
And so if we have the
table of nuclides,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.860
you can either use
the atomic mass

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.570
of any nucleus or
its binding energy

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.130
and just look it up directly.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.780
The thing with the
fewest steps is just

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.988
to use the binding energies
because those are already

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.590
given in MeV or keV.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.010
And then it's just an
addition subtraction problem.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.000
If you use the
masses, don't forget

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.540
to multiply by c squared.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.160
And remember our
conversion formula,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:17.940
which should not be rounded,
which is this right here.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.330
Again, 931.49, not 931,
not even 931.5, or else

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.545
you're off by 10
kiloelectron volts.

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:26.170
And so then the
question is, all right,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.320
let's try to calculate the
Q value from this reaction.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.860
I have the individual energies
and kinetic energies up here.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.990
But just so we have
a worked out example,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.950
let's actually do this.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.210
So the Q value of
this reaction should

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:48.550
be the binding energy of lithium
7 plus the binding energy of--

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.060
what do we have-- helium 4 minus
the binding energy of boron 10

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.620
minus the binding
energy of a neutron.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.920
Now first of all, the easy one.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.670
What's the binding
energy of a low neutron?

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.860
Let's call it out.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.260
0, yeah.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.630
A lone nucleon is not bound
to anything, so that's easy.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.472
That's 0.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.180
And we can just use
the table of nuclides

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.590
to look up the other three.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.650
Luckily I've got
it live over here.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.980
So let's just punch these in.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.450
We'll have boron 10.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:36.880
And our binding energy
right here is 64.75 MeV.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.385
Let's look up helium 4.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.730
Good.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.230
That's showing up on the screen.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.540
I think I'll make it bigger
so it's easier for everyone

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.010
to see.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:57.680
The binding energy
is 28.296 MeV.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.310
And notice everything's
already in MeV,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.250
so this is nice and
easy to deal with.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.740
And lithium 7.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:22.340
39.245 plus minus minus 0 MeV.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.060
Let's see.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:29.790
Actually, I think my sines for
exo and endo are backwards.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.960
Let me fix that right
now because the idea is

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.140
if you release energy--

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.442
there we go.

00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:39.150
Sorry about that.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.210
No, wait a minute.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.240
Let's calculate this
out, figure what we get.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.280
And again, I can't do
six digits in my head,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.430
but I will do it as
fast as I can here.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:59.432
245 plus 28.296 minus 0.75.

00:08:59.432 --> 00:09:01.550
Ah, indeed.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.340
2.79 MeV.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.860
I had it right the first time.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.300
So good.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.550
Shouldn't second guess myself.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.490
Cool.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.120
So now we know the total
Q value of this reaction.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.325
And I'll bring the
reaction back up here.

00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:29.450
We also know, which you
can find from measurements,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:38.630
that the gamma ray comes off
with an energy of 0.48 MeV,

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.310
leaving--

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.290
let's see how much--

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:48.770
leaving 2.13 MeV for the
sum of the kinetic energies

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.410
of the lithium and
the helium nucleus.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:58.460
So let's say Tli 7
plus t for helium.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.960
Now the question
is how did I get

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.890
to those numbers for the split
between the kinetic energies

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.045
of those two?

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:06.920
Anyone have any idea?

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.582
Yeah.

00:10:11.582 --> 00:10:12.947
AUDIENCE: Related to their mass?

00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:13.780
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.690
So it's definitely related
to their relative masses.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.910
More specifically, we
have this conservation

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.340
of energy equation,
but we've still

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.320
got two variables
and one equation.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.670
We need a second equation.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.170
That certainly does
relate the mass.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:26.670
Yep.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.003
AUDIENCE: Conservation momentum.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.080
MICHAEL SHORT: You can
relate their momentum.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.870
So we can say that if this
initial kinetic energy of boron

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.870
and of the neutron was
approximately 0, then

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.150
it's like these two
nuclei, lithium and helium,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.520
were kind of standing
still and all of a sudden

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.710
moved off in opposite
directions, which

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.260
means they've got to have
equal and opposite momenta.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.150
So let's say the absolute value
of the momentum of lithium

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.890
has got to equal
the absolute value

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.580
of the momentum of helium.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.350
This is our second
equation, where

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.390
we'll use the first one
to figure out what are

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.550
the relative kinetic energies.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.010
And so we're going to use a
quick trick to say if momentum

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.060
equals mass times
velocity, we can also

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.470
say it equals the
kinetic energy, which

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.490
is 1/2 mv squared, and then
multiply by things in order

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.990
to make it mv.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.690
So we can multiply by 2.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.590
Let's make a little
bit of space here.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:32.020
If we take the kinetic energy,
multiply by 2, multiply by m,

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.800
and take the square
root, we have t.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.210
Let's see, that
would give us 2 m

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.170
squared v squared inside
the square root gives us mv.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.730
So now we can take
these expressions

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:49.390
and we can say that the root
2 mass lithium, t lithium,

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:56.000
equals root 2 mass
helium t helium.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.600
And they both have
a square root of 2.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.050
We can square both
sides of both equations.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:08.240
And we end up with mass
of lithium t lithium

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.060
equals mass of helium t helium.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.360
Now we take this equation,
rearrange it a little bit.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.830
Let's just call that Q to
keep things in variable space.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:31.270
And we can say that t helium
equals Q minus t lithium.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:36.960
We can take this t
helium, stick it in here.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.920
We end up with m
lithium t lithium

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:49.000
equals the mass of helium
times Q minus t lithium.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.700
There's a missing h right there.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.960
There we go.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.040
And then from here--

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.540
oh good.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.950
We've got some blank
space right here.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:56.450
Let's see.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.200
So we'd have-- I'll
do out all the steps--

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:08.600
equals mass of helium times
Q minus mass of helium times

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.160
t lithium.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.860
And we're solving for t lithium,
so we can put this term over

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.640
on the other side.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.610
So let's say t lithium
times the mass of lithium

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:31.610
plus the mass of helium equals
Q times the mass of helium.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.710
Then we can just
divide both sides

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:45.510
by the sum of those masses

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.640
Those two terms
cancel, and we're

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.120
left with the expression for
the kinetic energy of lithium,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.060
which is the mass of helium
over the sum of the masses

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.750
times the total Q value.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.500
Looks like the two of
those might actually

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.390
be backwards, huh?

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.340
Because the lithium
one should be smaller.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.070
I'll correct that for the
notes when I put them up online

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:14.180
because this ratio should
be smaller than 0.5 Q.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.880
But at any rate, this is
how you actually get them.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.590
And I want to
point out something

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.860
a little flash forward
to some of the decay

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.800
that you're going to be looking
at in terms of nuclear decays.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.440
Let's talk for a second
about alpha decay.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.890
In alpha decay, you have a
low nucleus sitting around.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.890
And then all of a sudden it
emits a helium nucleus as well

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.540
as a recoil nucleus.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.240
And one of the questions
that came up a lot last year

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.420
is why isn't the Q
value of an alpha decay

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.070
reaction-- let's just write one
up on the board, possibly one

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.780
that you'll be dealing
with very soon, hands on.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:58.390
Uranium 235 can spontaneously
go to a helium nucleus.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:06.490
That's 92 plus
looks like 90 to 31.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.200
What comes before uranium?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.050
I think that is thorium,
although I wouldn't-- yeah,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.423
I think that's thorium.

00:15:12.423 --> 00:15:13.840
And the idea here
is that there is

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.780
some Q value associated with
the kinetic energy of both

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.260
of these.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.380
But it's not the
alpha kinetic energy

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.190
because the thorium nucleus
would have to take away

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.630
some of that kinetic energy.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.520
And I want to show you
this on the diagrams.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.040
So let's look at U 235.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.880
And we can see that it has an
alpha decay to thorium 231.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.380
Awesome.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.040
Got the symbol right.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.170
And it has a decay
energy of 4.679 MeV.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.610
Let's take a look
at the diagram,

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.910
which actually lists all of the
possible alpha decay energies,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.220
of which there are many.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.584
Had to zoom out a
little bit there.

00:15:56.584 --> 00:15:57.970
Yeah?

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.590
Anyone have a question?

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.010
OK.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:06.680
So notice that the difference
in energy levels is 4.676 MeV.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.730
And if we look at the
highest energy alpha ray,

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.422
it's less than that.

00:16:11.422 --> 00:16:13.380
And that's because just
like we showed up here,

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.180
the thorium nucleus
has to take away

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.970
some of that kinetic energy
to conserve both energy

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.630
and momentum.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.430
So this is a question that came
up quite a few times last year,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.180
and I want to make sure you guys
don't get tripped up like this.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.610
So again, I think I've
said it every single day,

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.027
and I'll say it
again because it's

00:16:28.027 --> 00:16:30.360
the next day, is make sure
to conserve mass energy

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:30.930
and momentum.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.910
That's the whole
theme of this class.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.972
Yes.

00:16:37.972 --> 00:16:39.430
AUDIENCE: How do
you get that value

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.710
for [INAUDIBLE]
mega electron volts?

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.750
MICHAEL SHORT: Should
have been 2.79 minus-- oh,

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.180
did I do a little
mental math mistake?

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.070
That should be-- oh.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:49.590
Yeah, no.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.010
A little dyslexia thing.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.520
3, 1.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.350
Yeah.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.080
There we go.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.580
Thank you.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.240
Cool.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.930
OK.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.290
Is everyone clear on how
to calculate Q values

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.859
from nuclear reactions using
either kinetic energies, which

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.040
you won't typically know, or
masses or binding energies,

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.109
which you can look up directly
from the table of nuclides?

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:15.730
Yeah.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.849
AUDIENCE: So what did you do
down there in the bottom right

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.145
corner of the chalkboard?

00:17:20.145 --> 00:17:21.270
MICHAEL SHORT: Of this one?

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.047
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:22.047 --> 00:17:22.839
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.950
So I took this expression
right here, which

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.720
is to say the Q
value has got to be

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.940
the sum of the kinetic
energies of the lithium

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.760
and helium nuclei, rearranged
it thusly to isolate--

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.490
ah, there we go--

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.240
yep, to isolate the
helium kinetic energy,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.230
and then substituted
that expression in here

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.760
to get this one right there.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.697
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:47.697 --> 00:17:48.530
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.883
So this way, we have--

00:17:49.883 --> 00:17:51.800
in this case, we had,
let's say, two variables

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.592
and three unknowns.

00:17:52.592 --> 00:17:54.948
But because we have this
equation relating them,

00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:56.990
we're left down with two
variables, two unknowns,

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.250
and we can actually
solve this thing.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.771
Yep.

00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:04.260
Yeah, good question.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.420
Yes.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.110
AUDIENCE: The energy of the
gamma, is that just a known?

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.097
Like the .48 MeV?

00:18:09.097 --> 00:18:10.680
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
something either

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.500
I tell you or you would
measure, let's say.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.640
That's just for completeness
to say all right,

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.680
this reaction actually
gives off a gamma,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.570
and I want to give the right
value for the kinetic energies.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.230
And we'll get into what
gamma transitions are allowed

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.960
and then how you measure them
in the next couple of weeks,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.430
actually.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.810
Yes.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.110
AUDIENCE: So do we refer to Q as
the Q you calculated up there,

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.110
or that 2.31?

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.732
MICHAEL SHORT: They're
the same one, actually.

00:18:38.732 --> 00:18:39.440
AUDIENCE: The 2.7

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.190
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, I see.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.270
That's a good point.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.210
So this wouldn't
really be Q, would it?

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.300
But it is the sum of
the kinetic energies.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.380
This is like Q minus
the gamma ray energy.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.520
Let me stick that in there.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.980
L, i.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.580
Yep.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.080
Yeah.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:03.580
Good point.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.500
OK.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.250
Any other questions
before I move on?

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.040
We're going to get into
a universal formula

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.940
to predict in a so-so way what
the binding energy of any given

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.490
nucleus will be and start
looking at stability trends

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.885
so you can predict, just
from the number of protons

00:19:24.885 --> 00:19:27.490
and the number of neutrons,
how stable a nucleus will

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.840
be with a few exceptions,
which we will go over.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.270
And this is what's referred
to as the semi-empirical mass

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.510
formula.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.590
So I'm going to
erase some stuff.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:43.510
Has everyone got the notes on
this bottom board right here?

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.170
OK.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.350
Let me know when you're
ready, and let's see.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.290
Yeah.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.870
I want to make sure I
move at your guys' pace.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:13.400
Let's say going to have a graph
of binding energy per nucleon

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.027
on versus nucleons.

00:20:17.027 --> 00:20:18.610
Well, anyway, I'll
leave that up there

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.650
and I'll do the work on
this board right here.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.890
So let's say we wanted to
figure out a weighted graph

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.340
or to predict the binding
energy per nucleon.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.170
So I have this
binding energy term

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.380
over a, where a is the
total number of nucleons,

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.050
as a function of the
number of nucleons--

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.100
in a generalized way.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.420
Not accounting for magic numbers
or anything else that we'll

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.530
get into pretty soon.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.720
And I don't like the
term magic numbers,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.390
but that is the parlance
that's used in this field

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.170
so I'm going to stick with it.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.520
Let's try and think about
if you imagine the nucleus

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.290
as a kind of drop
of liquid-- and one

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.660
of the other words for the
semi-empirical mass formula

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.650
is called the liquid drop
formula or the liquid drop

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.420
model.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.030
It assumes that the
nucleus takes the shape

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.980
roughly of a liquid
drop, and you can kind of

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.147
treat some of the energy
terms accordingly.

00:21:11.147 --> 00:21:13.480
This is why I have all the
different colors of chalk out

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.660
for this.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.210
Makes it a little
visually easier to see.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.660
So let's start writing
a general expression

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.268
for the binding energy
as a function of a and z,

00:21:24.268 --> 00:21:26.060
and start thinking
about what sort of terms

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.940
would add to or
decrease the stability

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.540
of a given liquid drop nucleus,
where all the nucleons are just

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.660
kind of there in some sort of
floating, crazy, coulombic,

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.000
strong nuclear force soup.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.430
First of all, as
you add nucleons

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.620
to a given nucleus,
what tends to happen

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.600
to the binding
energy, in general?

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.030
Without knowing anything else.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.390
Assemble more nucleons, you
convert more mass to energy.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.870
And you end up increasing
the binding energy.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.240
So let's call this
the volume term.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.310
As you increase the volume
of this liquid drop,

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.700
its total binding energies
start to increase.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.550
So let's say there's
some term that's

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:13.190
going to be proportional to A,
the number of nucleons that's

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.027
in this liquid drop.

00:22:15.027 --> 00:22:15.860
And we'll draw this.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.970
Let's see if I can
do the trick right.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:18.920
Yes.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.700
I love doing that.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.990
If we were to graph
binding energy per nucleon

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.620
as a function of number of
nucleotides for this term,

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.230
it would just be a flat line
because it's related to A.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:35.820
And there's going to be
some constant, which we're

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.335
going to call the volume
constant, that says, well,

00:22:39.335 --> 00:22:40.710
there's going to
be some relation

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.690
between the actual amount
of stability gained

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.100
and the number of nucleons.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.840
We don't know what
it is yet, but what

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.090
we're really concerned
with is the functional

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.040
form of this thing.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.720
It's proportional to A.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.410
Next up, what also
happens to a liquid drop

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.917
as you increase its volume?

00:22:57.917 --> 00:22:59.500
What other parameters
do you increase?

00:23:02.755 --> 00:23:03.880
AUDIENCE: The surface area?

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.838
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:23:04.838 --> 00:23:05.740
The surface area.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.440
The idea here is that
if this liquid drop

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.810
is made of all sorts
of different nucleons--

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.920
and let's pretend that they're
like atoms in a crystal

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.460
and they're all
binding to each other--

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.860
the ones on the outside aren't
bound to as many nucleons

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.990
as the ones on the inside.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.870
And so the more nuclei
there are near the surface

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.380
as opposed to inside the
liquid droplets, say,

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.020
inside some little radius
where all it sees around

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.470
it are other nucleons, then
they're not quite as bound.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.020
And how does the surface
area of a liquid drop

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.833
scale with its volume?

00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:46.375
To what function or
to what exponent?

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.780
2/3.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.800
I mean, let's take a quick
look at the volume of a sphere

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.050
is 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.070
And the surface area of a
sphere is 4 pi r squared.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.160
So if you want to get
some expression for how

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.080
does area scale as
volume, I said cube,

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.720
then I wrote squared.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.460
It's going to end up
looking like something times

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.220
r to the 2-- let's see.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:18.790
Oh, yeah.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.998
I'm sorry, that's not the
expression I want to write.

00:24:20.998 --> 00:24:24.680
But the idea here is it's going
to scale with r to the 2/3.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.300
So let's pick a
different color and say

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:33.940
we're going to have some surface
term times number of nucleons

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.830
to the 2/3.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.670
And if we then adjust
this formula to also take

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.220
into account this
surface area term--

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.930
which is to say for
very small nuclei,

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.070
there's a lot of nucleotides
near the surface,

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.040
and as the nucleus
gets bigger and bigger,

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.540
more and more of them are in
the juicy center and don't know

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.130
they're near the surface--

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:59.710
we'd have some modification
that looks like that.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.960
Now I'm going to erase the
stuff over here because I'm

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.793
running out of room.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.460
Now these nucleons aren't just
untagged, anonymous nucleons.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.440
They're either
protons or neutrons.

00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:17.910
And what happens when you
try and cram a lot of protons

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.413
into one space?

00:25:19.413 --> 00:25:21.080
AUDIENCE: They want
to repel each other.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.872
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:25:21.872 --> 00:25:24.390
They want to repel each
other by coulombic forces.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.220
And so every proton--

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.800
let's pick a different color
for the coulombic forces--

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.550
and that should be
a minus if I want

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.950
to stick with all the notation.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.650
There's going to be some other
term to account for the fact

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.560
that the nuclei,
specifically the protons,

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.668
are trying to repel each other.

00:25:42.668 --> 00:25:45.210
So in this case, it's going to
be proportional to, let's say,

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.450
the number of
protons that we have.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.300
And every proton should
feel a repulsive force

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.325
from every other proton.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.260
So let's say it's times
z times z minus 1,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.220
so that every proton feels the
force of every other proton

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.290
except for itself.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.310
And that's going to be
mediated by the total number

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.040
of nucleons.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.160
So if there are more
neutrons in the way,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.280
it won't be quite as bad.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.850
And there's going
to be some other--

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.430
we'll call it a C for
the coulombic term--

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.040
and that will say that as
you make a bigger and bigger

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.200
nucleus, you start to get
more and more coulombic

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.060
repulsion trying
to rip it apart.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.350
So if we were to then
modify the purple curve--

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.100
oops.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:35.700
Trying to get it to go the same
as the nucleus gets bigger.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.590
I want to make sure it's
really to scale-ish.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.080
As the nuclei get
bigger and bigger,

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.485
it's going to be a
little less stable.

00:26:46.485 --> 00:26:47.860
And already we're
starting to get

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.822
a curve that is getting close to
looking like the binding energy

00:26:51.822 --> 00:26:52.780
curve from the reading.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.570
But there are a couple
more terms to reckon with.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.623
So let's pick a fourth color.

00:26:58.623 --> 00:27:00.040
What other sort
of trends that you

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.623
notice in the reading about the
stability of different nuclei?

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.060
Let's say you were to take a
common nucleus like carbon-12.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.850
It's got six protons
and six neutrons,

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.830
and it's exceptionally stable.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.600
What about carbon 6?

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.930
A nucleus of just 6 protons?

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.620
Doesn't exist.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.600
Exceptionally unstable.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.560
What about carbon 24?

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.500
18 neutrons, six protons.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.120
Sound stable or not?

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.050
Not at all.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.140
So there's some sort of
asymmetry term going on.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.030
When the number of
protons and neutrons

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.480
is roughly in balance,
especially for light nuclei,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.580
the nucleus tends
to be more stable.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.410
So we can write
some sort of term--

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:48.340
let's call it an
asymmetry term--

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.970
that relates to the
number of neutrons

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.840
minus the number of protons.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.780
And in this case, for reasons
I'm not going to get into,

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.050
but are derived in a
reference in your reading,

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.050
there's a squared on it.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.930
But suffice to say if the
number of neutrons and number

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.630
of protons are equal,
then the nucleus is

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.490
predicted to be pretty stable.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.560
And this works out quite
well for light nuclei.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:16.090
It starts to break down a
little bit for heavier nuclei.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:21.070
And then divide by the number
of nuclei that there are.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:25.230
I also see a missing
1/3 because let's say

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.230
this nucleus has a volume
that scales with roughly

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.880
the number of nucleons.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.920
Then the distance of
that coulombic force

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.890
is going to be like A
to the 1/3 or the radius

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.810
of this nuclear drop.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.100
So let's take the
asymmetry term.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.630
That's going to give us a
further modification slightly

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.690
downward.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.030
And finally, there's what's
called the pairing term.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.800
What's the last
color I haven't used?

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.210
This pairing term delta.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.710
And this is not a
smooth function.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.140
It's a piecewise
function that depends on

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.260
whether you have an
odd or an even number

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.513
of each type of nucleon,
protons or neutrons.

00:29:07.513 --> 00:29:08.930
And so what this
means, it's going

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.370
to add a little
bit of jaggedness

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:16.630
to the beginning of the curve
and equal out in the end

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.730
because this delta
term can be something

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:23.320
like plus, let's
call it an A pairing.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:30.220
And it scales with the square
root of A, or minus, or 0,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.860
depending on if the
nuclei are odd odd,

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.680
like odd number of protons,
odd number of neutrons,

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.460
even even, or odd even.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.160
Now I know that the derivation
is a little hand wavy.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.380
That's why we call
it semi-empirical.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.450
We're taking each of
these additive terms

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.920
and saying it kind of comes
from a fairly OK, a little poor

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.630
approximation of the nucleus.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.570
But what we end up
with is a formula

00:29:55.570 --> 00:30:00.580
whose constants are fit, whose
terms, the actual variables,

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.360
are derived somewhat
from physical intuition.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.772
These constants were then fit
later by some other folks,

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:09.730
and the references for
this are in the reading.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.630
They're all in MeV, and this
gives you a binding energy

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.210
in MeV for a given nucleus.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.820
Now it works some places and it
doesn't work in other places.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.320
Yeah.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.054
AUDIENCE: So the lower
case a [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:24.054 --> 00:30:26.030
no matter what the
nucleus looks like?

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.260
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.340
So this is the universal,
semi-empirical, usually works

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.480
formula for the binding
energy of a nucleus.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.390
So the constants don't change
because the variables here

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.840
are z, [INAUDIBLE] a, and n.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.520
And don't forget--
because you'll

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.260
need to remember this
on the homework--

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.830
that A equals z plus n.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.790
So for example, if
you want to express

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.700
what is the most
stable nucleus, you

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.040
could take the derivative
of this formula with respect

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.450
to A or z.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.520
And don't forget that you can
substitute this expression

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.020
into there.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.190
That's giving you guys
a hint for the homework.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:10.940
And let's look at what
this actually looks

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.480
like as far as theory
compared to experiment.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.240
So the red points are
theoretical predictions.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.940
The black points are
experimental predictions.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.770
And all of the different
nuclei are shown here.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.460
First of all, the curve looks
quite a bit like the one

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.100
that we just hand wavy made
on the board right here.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.010
And second of all, there
aren't too many exceptions.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.810
It's hard to see what
the exceptions are,

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.300
so it's a little
easier to draw them

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.590
in terms of relative error.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.780
So you can see where
does this formula work

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.910
and where does this formula not?

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.430
So if you notice,
for the small nuclei,

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.320
approximating it
as a liquid drop

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.690
is not a very good
approximation because you

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.570
can't treat this
as a homogenized,

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:51.800
smeared liquid drop.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.630
It's much more--
well, there's either

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:57.320
two or three nucleons, and
very few protons and neutrons

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.340
in each.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.650
But then as you get to
larger and larger nuclei,

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:05.435
it starts to hit very
close with a few exceptions

00:32:05.435 --> 00:32:08.980
that I want to
point out right now.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.870
If you zoom in on that
part, you can actually

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.350
see that at certain neutron
numbers, or certain proton

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.560
numbers, there is an
exceptionally high stability

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.700
of a lot of those nuclei.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.010
And that's as you
start to approach

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.510
these what's called
magic numbers,

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.110
or numbers of nucleons
which, say, fill all energy

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.880
levels at a certain level.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.850
And again, it's not for
every nucleus as a function

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:31.700
of neutron number.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.370
But even drawing an
envelope around this curve,

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.060
you can see that the
nuclei around 82,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:41.110
around 50, around 28, are
a whole lot more stable

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.190
than the ones in between.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.700
And this pattern kind of
repeats with larger and larger

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.200
periodicity.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.790
And it kind of looks
like right here,

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.400
at the edge of our
knowledge of nuclei,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.935
we haven't quite gotten
to the next peak yet.

00:32:53.935 --> 00:32:56.560
This is something we're going to
talk about Friday on the quest

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.110
for super heavy
elements, or SHE's,

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.640
as you'll see in the reading.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.190
Yeah.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:05.680
AUDIENCE: So the most stable
nuclei peaks were closest to 0.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Closest to
0 is the closest agreement

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.290
between experiment and theory.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.470
So the ones that are
exceptionally stable,

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:17.040
which are not predicted by
this very simple formula,

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.680
are up here at the peaks
of these magic numbers.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.410
And actually, I want you to
take a look right here at some

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.190
of these very small nuclei.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.390
Like helium 4 is probably
way up here somewhere, all

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.680
the way over on the right.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.990
It's an exceptionally
stable nucleus

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.390
that is not very well
approximated by liquid drop

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.460
model because it's
got four nucleons.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.750
They're all on the surface.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:41.100
There's nothing on the inside
of a helium nucleus, let's say.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.210
And then if you look at
stability trends in terms

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.990
of are the nuclei more stable
if they have odd numbers

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.050
or even numbers, you can
graph the two separately

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.690
and look at the number
of stable nuclei

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.020
that have an odd total mass
number or an even total mass

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:56.890
number.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.880
And there's a few
things to note here.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.480
One of them is the even
numbers tend to have

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.310
a lot more stable nuclei.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.050
This is something I mentioned
on the second day of class.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:10.030
If you look at the [INAUDIBLE]
table of nuclides--

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.370
let's go to their home page--

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:17.210
and just look at it
sort of in a color way.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.550
The blue colors
are stable nuclei,

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.770
and you notice that
every other row of pixels

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.219
here has a whole lot
more stable ones.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.190
And that's the same thing
that we're seeing right here,

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:32.480
is that there's a lot more even
nuclei that are more stable.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.540
If I jump back to our
semi-empirical maths formula,

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:40.162
notice that this binding energy
goes up for even, even nuclei.

00:34:40.162 --> 00:34:41.870
So when there's an
even number of protons

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:45.380
and an even number of neutrons,
the semi-empirical mass formula

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.710
does predict an
increase in stability,

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:53.909
which you can actually see
on the table of nuclides,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.630
and on this sort
of stability trend.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.020
And so let's look
a little closer

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:03.150
and see how many nuclei for each
proton number or each neutron

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.860
number are actually stable.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.622
And we graphed the odd and
the even ones separately.

00:35:07.622 --> 00:35:09.330
And what's important
to note here is one,

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.550
the odd is way
lower than the even.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:16.590
There's usually either 2 1 or
0 stable nuclei at that number.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:19.800
And what other sort of features
do you guys notice about this?

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.603
It's not smooth, first of all.

00:35:26.603 --> 00:35:27.520
Where are those peaks?

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.603
Where do you tend to find
that most stable nuclei?

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:33.710
4?

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.367
Where do you tend
to find the least?

00:35:37.367 --> 00:35:38.700
What about these two right here?

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.530
No stable nuclei at
these proton numbers.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.340
And remember, proton number
uniquely defines an element.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.643
Anyone know what
these two might be?

00:35:47.643 --> 00:35:48.560
What sort of elements?

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.268
Look to the back of
the room if you want.

00:35:50.268 --> 00:35:52.940
There's a periodic
table in the back wall.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.280
And you can see, except
for the super heavy things

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.840
down at the bottom,
there's a couple

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.150
of elements that have
no stable isotopes.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.920
These are technetium
and promethium, which

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.750
are relatively light isotopes--

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.570
I say relatively light compared
to things like uranium--

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.490
with no stable isotopes.

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:13.460
They're also fairly far away
from these so-called magic

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.480
numbers or other regions,
where you tend to have a spike

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.360
in the number of
stable nuclei due to--

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.700
well, things that
you'll learn in 22.02,

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.540
in terms of nuclear shell
occupancy and stability.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.700
But you see the same thing when
you graph the neutron number.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.290
You can see a couple
of sudden spikes

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:38.693
right here at 20,
28, 50, 82, and 126.

00:36:38.693 --> 00:36:41.110
When everything gets really
stable, all of a sudden you've

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:45.010
got one last gasp
of a stable isotope

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.600
before you go off
into nowhere land.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.540
So let's start looking at
relative stabilities of nuclei,

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.510
let's say, for a given mass
number or a given proton

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.340
number.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.840
Anyone mind if I
cover this board

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.210
because you can't roll it up.

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.581
You all got the notes from here?

00:37:01.581 --> 00:37:04.510
Cool.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.840
That one has less to erase.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.590
And I want to keep these
formulas up for our reference.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.075
Let's say I pose this problem.

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:26.700
I want to find out, make sure I
solve the right one-- actually,

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.780
I'm going to check
my notes real quick--

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:33.250
that what is the-- for a given
A, or for a given mass number--

00:37:38.295 --> 00:37:40.045
what is the most stable
number of protons?

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.890
for A, given A.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.350
This is the question that
I like to answer here.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.940
How would you
approach this question

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.700
using the semi-empirical
mass formula

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.830
that-- well, you can't see
here, so I will bring it

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.384
up back on the screen.

00:38:02.384 --> 00:38:02.884
Here.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.707
How would you find this out?

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.170
Well, let's say for
a given mass number

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:24.000
A, for a given poor
approximation of the total mass

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.110
of a nucleus, the more binding
energy it has, the more stable

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.220
it is.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:37.500
Therefore, if you want to
find the minimum of a mass

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:43.540
for A and Z, given
a fixed A, that

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.310
will give you the
most stable nucleus

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.760
because it will tell
you which value of Z

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.530
gives you the
smallest m, or rather,

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.810
the most tightly
bound nucleus that

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:55.387
has the most binding energy.

00:38:55.387 --> 00:38:56.720
So let's start writing this out.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.690
First of all, we can use
one of the two equations

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.660
we already have up here, a
relation between the mass

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.200
and the binding energy.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.040
The second one, well,
we have it right here.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.510
So let's substitute in our
binding energy equation

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:15.590
and express it in terms of mass.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:25.970
So let's say our mass of a
nucleus A and Z is equal to Z

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:34.360
times the mass of hydrogen
plus A minus Z times the mass

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.222
of a neutron minus
the binding energy

00:39:39.222 --> 00:39:41.180
because in this case,
what I've done right here

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.510
is I've added mass to each side
of the equation, subtracted

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.690
binding energy from each
side of the equation,

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.770
and we can just take
negative that expression

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.610
and write it all out together.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:40:04.510
So we have minus AVA plus A
surface A to the 2/3 plus AC z

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:09.670
times z minus 1
over A to the 1/3,

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:22.690
and plus AA symmetry and minus z
squared over A and minus delta.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.220
So we've got one expression
for the total mass.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.200
We've fixed the value
of A because we're

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.580
going to take some fixed--

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.620
we're going to choose
some fixed value of A.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.945
Let's say A equals 93.

00:40:33.945 --> 00:40:36.570
And that's the example that I've
kind of worked out in my head.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:40.680
It so happens that niobium has a
stable isotope that a mass of A

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.745
equals 93.

00:40:41.745 --> 00:40:43.620
And we just found out
in some of our research

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.700
that niobium doesn't stick
to chromium very well.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.200
That's why I've got
it on the brain.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.710
So this is what I was
thinking about this morning.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.770
So for a fixed A
equals 93, we want

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.280
to find what is the most
stable A. How do we do that?

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.160
Anyone have an idea?

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.050
Yeah.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.050
AUDIENCE: Differentiate?

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.280
MICHAEL SHORT: Differentiate.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.580
Sure.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:16.418
Let's take, we'll just say
the derivative of-- oh, no,

00:41:16.418 --> 00:41:17.960
it is a partial
derivative because we

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.080
have two variables here.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:25.670
Take the derivative
as a function of z,

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.140
set it equal to 0.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.960
This will give us the
z number that gives us

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.690
the minimum mass for a
fixed A. So let's actually

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.850
do this right now.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:36.140
So let's see.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.870
This gives us mh.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:46.880
And this term expanded
out is AMN minus ZMN.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.240
So we have a minus MN.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.410
I'm going to make one quick
correction right here.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.140
I want to make sure
everything's in the same units.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.570
All of these semi-empirical
mass terms are in MeV.

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.960
These right here are in
AMU, atomic mass units.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:07.344
What do we have to add in
order to get these all in MeV?

00:42:07.344 --> 00:42:11.405
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the conversion factor.

00:42:11.405 --> 00:42:13.030
MICHAEL SHORT:
Conversion factor, yeah.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.640
Or in this case, we'll
just stick a C squared.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.390
I'll make a little
bit of room so I can

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.510
stick the C squared in there.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:22.660
C squared.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.120
Now everything's in MeV.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.140
We're all in the same units.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:31.140
So let's say we
have mh minus mn.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.240
These are in C squared.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:48.750
And minus VC plus 2/3 AS times
A to the negative 1/3 plus--

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:54.240
I'm going to expand this out
to call it z squared minus z.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:00.270
I'm also going to stick
in n equals A minus Z

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:06.420
so that this expands out
to A minus 2Z squared.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.980
Is everyone with me here?

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.630
Yeah.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.673
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't the A
terms, like the AVA and the AS,

00:43:11.673 --> 00:43:12.400
stay at 2/3?

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.798
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh.

00:43:13.798 --> 00:43:14.340
You're right.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:18.000
I'm deriving with respect
to the wrong variable.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.270
Thank you.

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.770
Yep.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.840
So we want to do this
as a function of z.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.260
So that term disappears.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.630
That term disappears.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.752
Thank you.

00:43:28.752 --> 00:43:30.210
Let's work on these
ones right now.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:34.590
So we have AC time z
squared over A to the 1/3.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:43.260
So that will give us A plus
AC over A to the 1/3 times 2z.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.090
And then we have--

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:54.960
let's see- minus AC
over A to the 1/3.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.270
That's it, actually.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:03.600
Oh, times plus 1, OK?

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.943
And then we have the A minus 2z.

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:08.610
So let's expand this out just so
we can see it all on the board.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:15.750
So we have AA over A
times A minus 4z squared

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:24.810
plus 4 minus 4 AZ
plus 4z squared.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:28.170
So let's take the derivative
with respect to z of that.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.900
That term goes away.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.840
That becomes 4A.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:39.720
So we have plus AA
over A times 4A.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.830
And there's a minus sign there.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.580
And that becomes 8z.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:56.070
So we have plus AA
symmetry over A times 8z.

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.470
And the delta term goes
away because there's

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.090
no z dependence.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:03.690
And what we end up here is the
solution for what is the most

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.120
stable z as a function of A?

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.040
This is a linear equation.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.840
There's only one
solution for it.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.640
If we actually want to graph
this m as a function of A

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:23.700
and Z, we end up with what's
called a mass parabola, which

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.700
is to say you can graph the
binding energy per nucleon,

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.500
or the mass, or pretty much
similar things, of a nucleus,

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.640
of all nuclei with A
given as a function of z.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.670
Think I can do this on the
remaining space right here.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:44.940
So let's say 4A
equals 93 if this is Z

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.170
and this is m as a function
of A and Z. Let's actually

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.100
look at a concrete example.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.450
So let's go live to
the chart of nuclides

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:57.735
and start looking at things
with a mass number of 93.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.070
Looks like I clicked
a little too high.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.780
There it is.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.610
Let's see.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.620
Moly 93 I was
looking at, and that

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.790
becomes niobium 93, which is the
stable isotope I was thinking.

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:20.050
So let's put niobium right here.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.000
I haven't given an
actual scale to this

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.800
because I just want to show
you in sort of relative terms.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.710
So let's say niobium
is the stable one.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:30.370
So it's going to have the lowest
actual mass, even though it's

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.650
got an A number of 93.

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:35.650
If you look here on
the chart of nuclides,

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.080
you can see it could
have come from a couple

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.110
of different places,
either from zirconium 93

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:43.120
or from molybdenum 93.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.950
And now is a good time
to start introducing

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:49.190
these different modes of decay
so you can figure out, well,

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:52.810
how would a nucleus decay to
get to the most stable place?

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:58.240
Let's say it came from
zirconium 93 and--

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.580
let's see, miobium has
a proton number of 41.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.670
So if we go to
zirconium, it beta

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:11.310
decays to niobium 93 with
an energy of .091 MeV.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:13.560
Very, very close.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.710
So we'll draw it
slightly higher.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.560
That's about 91 keV.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:24.300
Zirconium 93 could have come
from the beta decay of yttrium

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.250
93 you can see right here.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.840
So let's go up the mass
parabola and keep exploring.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:37.590
And now we see that yttrium can
decay by beta decay with 3 MeV.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:43.860
So if we put yttrium on this
graph, it would be way higher.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.960
Yttrium itself could
have come from--

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.410
well, let's see, strontium
93 with the decay

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.720
energy of 4.1 MeV.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.930
So let's put strontium here.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.190
And I think 4 MEV would
be, like, off the chart.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.880
But whatever.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.170
That's the way we drew it.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.140
Already we've got the
makings of a parabola.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:10.010
And each one of these
can decay by beta decay,

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:11.950
or does decay by
beta decay, in order

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.640
to get to the most
stable nucleus.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.350
So let's write the
nuclear reaction

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:20.470
for beta decay of one of these,
let's say, from zirconium

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.970
to niobium.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:27.610
So we'd have 9340
zirconium spontaneously

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:36.730
goes to 9341 niobium
plus a beta and

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.332
plus an electron anti-neutrino.

00:48:39.332 --> 00:48:41.290
That's the part I don't
expect you to know yet.

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:44.590
But that's the whole
energy conservation thing.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.330
A little bit of a flash forward.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:49.012
The beta decay energy
is not necessarily

00:48:49.012 --> 00:48:50.470
the energy of the
electron that you

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.137
will measure because
some of that energy

00:48:52.137 --> 00:48:54.700
is taken away by
the anti-neutrino.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.640
But we'll get into how those
relate probably next week.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.090
So let's now look on the
other side of the parabola

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.790
and confirm that the
semi-empirical mass

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.680
formula, which
predicts something

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.920
parabolic here and
here with respect to z,

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.750
actually checks out.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:16.640
So let's back up to
niobium 93 and notice

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.370
that it could also have
come from electron capture

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:22.650
from molybdenum 93.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:26.160
So let's put
molybdenum right here.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:33.420
And it decays with
an energy of 0.4 MeV

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:38.650
into niobium, which let's
say it's around here.

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.270
Let's keep going
through the chain.

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:43.950
Anyone have any questions
so far while we keep going?

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:44.930
Cool.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.160
Let's trace it
back up the chain.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.060
Technetium 93 can
beget molybdenum 93

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:55.917
by electron capture with a
much higher energy, 3.201.

00:49:55.917 --> 00:49:58.250
I'm going to extend our graph
because we need the space.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:05.280
Technetium, another 3 MeV.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.630
And let's go one more back.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:11.950
Technetium can be made by
electron capture from rubidium

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:16.293
93 with an even
higher energy, which

00:50:16.293 --> 00:50:18.460
means a higher difference
in mass between these two.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:24.820
So so far-- let's see, what's
6 MeV for rubidium here?

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.670
It would be like there, I guess.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.492
There's our mass parabola,
right from the data.

00:50:33.492 --> 00:50:35.950
So I like doing this better
than just showing you a diagram

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:38.200
because you can actually
try it for yourself.

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.470
Pick a fixed A, change
A, and construct

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.540
the mass parabolas yourself.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.800
Now the question is how could
these decay into niobium 93,

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.730
which is the stable isotope?

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.340
I have negative
one minutes left,

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:55.150
so I'm very quickly going
to tell you for large energy

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.760
changes, it can either be
positron decay or electron

00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.260
capture.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.770
And we'll go over what these
modes of decay are next week.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:08.440
This can be, again, positron
or electron capture.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.800
And for small amounts
of decay energy,

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:17.740
it can only be electron capture
because in order for positron

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:22.060
decay to happen, you have to
be able to create the positron.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.460
And the positron plus
the extra electron

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:32.040
ejected to balance charge
has got to be 1.022 MeV,

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.490
or same thing as what's
known as two times the rest

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:38.700
mass of the electron.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.500
I'm going to stop
there, and we'll

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.920
pick up with lots of examples
and questions tomorrow.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.500
The last thing-- well, I'll
go over the next problem

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.167
set tomorrow.

00:51:47.167 --> 00:51:48.750
I want to make sure
everyone's seen it

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.460
seven days before it's due.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.540
And the best way to do that
is to show it on the board.

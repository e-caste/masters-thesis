00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.670
PROFESSOR STRANG: Finally we get
to positive definite matrices.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.180
I've used the word and now
it's time to pin it down.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.620
And so this would be my
thank you for staying with it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.490
while we do this important
preliminary stuff

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.780
about linear algebra.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.850
So starting the
next lecture we'll

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.660
really make a big start on
engineering applications.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.250
But these matrices are going
to be the key to everything.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.290
And I'll call these matrices
K. And positive definite,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.200
I will only use that word
about a symmetric matrix.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.130
So the matrix is
already symmetric

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.730
and that means it
has real eigenvalues

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.820
and many other
important properties,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.930
orthogonal eigenvectors.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.960
And now we're asking for more.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.630
And it's that extra
bit that is terrific

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.260
in all kinds of applications.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.090
So if I can do this
bit of linear algebra.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.880
So what's coming then, my review
session this afternoon at four,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.460
I'm very happy that
we've got, I think,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.150
the best MATLAB problem ever
invented, in 18.085 anyway.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.410
So that should get onto the
website probably by tomorrow.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.670
And Peter Buchak is
like the MATLAB person.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.590
So his review sessions
are Friday at noon.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.890
And I just saw him and
suggested Friday at noon

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.750
he might as well
just stay in here.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.740
And knowing that
that isn't maybe

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.050
a good hour for everybody.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.390
So you could see him also
outside of that hour.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.670
But that's the hour
he will be ready

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.520
for all kinds of questions about
MATLAB or about the homeworks.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.720
Actually you'll be probably
thinking more about, also

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.680
about the homework
questions on this topic.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.910
Ready for positive definite?

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.750
You said yes, right?

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.180
And you have a hint
about these things.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.880
So we have a symmetric
matrix and the beauty

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.190
is that it brings together
all of linear algebra.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.670
Including elimination,
that's when we see pivots.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.930
Including determinants which are
closely related to the pivots.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.180
And what do I mean
by upper left?

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.310
I mean that if I have a three
by three symmetric matrix

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.350
and I want to test it
for positive definite,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.690
and I guess actually
this would be the easiest

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.140
test if I had a tiny
matrix, three by three,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.120
and I had numbers, then
this would be a good test.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.413
The determinants-- By upper left
determinants I mean that one

00:03:31.413 --> 00:03:33.170
by one determinant.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.220
So just that first number
has to be positive.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.900
Then the two by two determinant,
that times that minus that

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.230
times that has to be positive.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.420
Oh I've already
been saying that.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.290
Let me just put in some letters.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.100
So a has to be positive.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.620
This is symmetric,
so a times c has

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.310
to be bigger than b squared.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.340
So that will tell us.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.230
And then for two
by two we finish.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.256
For three by three we would
also require the three

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:05.880
by three determinant
to be positive.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.440
But already here
you're seeing one point

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.470
about a positive
definite matrix.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.430
Its diagonal will
have to be positive.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.020
And somehow its diagonal has
to be not just above zero,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.140
but somehow it has
to defeat b squared.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.690
So the diagonal has to
be somehow more positive

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.890
than whatever
negative stuff might

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.780
come from off the diagonal.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.250
That's why I would need
a*c &gt; b squared.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.120
So both of those
will be positive

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.600
and their product has to be
bigger than the other guy.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.650
And then finally, a third test
is that all the eigenvalues

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.970
are positive.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.500
And of course if I give you
a three by three matrix,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.340
that's probably not
the easiest test

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.670
since you'd have to
find the eigenvalues.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.490
Much easier to find the
determinants or the pivots.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.400
Actually, just while I'm at it,
so the first pivot of course

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.170
is a itself.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.140
No difficulty there.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.580
The second pivot turns out
to be the ratio of a*c -

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.140
b squared to a.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.840
So the connection between
pivots and determinants

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.210
is just really close.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.320
Pivots are ratios
of determinants,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.250
if you work it out.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.930
The second pivot, maybe
I would call that d_2,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.110
is the ratio of a*c
- b squared over a.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.040
In other words it's
c minus b^2 / a.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.790
Determinants are
positive and vice versa.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.130
Then it's fantastic
that the eigenvalues

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.740
come into the picture.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.510
So those are three ways,
three important properties

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.870
of a positive definite matrix.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.770
But I'd like to make the
definition something different.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.200
Now I'm coming to the meaning.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.420
If I think of those as
the tests, that's done.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:24.370
Now the meaning of
positive definite.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.230
The meaning of positive
definite and the applications

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.540
are closely related to
looking for a minimum.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:39.900
And so what I'm going to bring
in here-- So it's symmetric.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:47.610
Now for a symmetric matrix I
want to introduce the energy.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.580
So this is the reason why
it has so many applications

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.750
and such important
physical meaning is

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.910
that what I'm
about to introduce,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.600
which is a function
of x, and here

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.940
it is, it's x transpose
times A, not A,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:16.770
I'm sticking with K
for my matrix, times x.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.870
I think of that as some f(x).

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.430
And let's just see what it
would be if the matrix was

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.510
two by two, [a, b; b, c].

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.330
Suppose that's my matrix.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.770
We want to get a handle on
what, this is the first time

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:42.040
I've ever written something
that has x's times x's.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.190
So it's going to be quadratic.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.330
They're going to
be x's times x's.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.190
And x is a general
vector of the right size

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.100
so it's got components x_1, x_2.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.850
And there it's
transposed, so it's a row.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.920
And now I put in
the [a, b; b,  c].

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.680
And then I put in x again.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.090
This is going to give me a
very nice, simple, important

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.830
expression.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.470
Depending on x_1 and x_2.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.090
Now what is, can we do
that multiplication?

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:25.210
Maybe above I'll do the
multiplication of this pair

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.370
and then I have the
other guy to bring in.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.230
So here, that
would be ax_1+bx_2.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.850
And this would be bx_1+cx_2.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.722
So that's the first,
that's this times this.

00:08:44.722 --> 00:08:45.680
What am I going to get?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.910
What shape, what size is
this result going to be?

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:56.140
This K is n by n. x is a column
vector. n by one. x transpose,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.800
what's the shape of x transpose?

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.070
One by n?

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.400
So what's the total result?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.100
One by one.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.270
Just a number.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.070
Just a function.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.560
It's a number.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.450
But it depends on the x's
and the matrix inside.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.830
Can we do it now?

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.280
So I've got this to
multiply by this.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.900
Do you see an x_1
squared showing up?

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.590
Yes, from there times there.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.770
And what's it multiplied by?

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.260
The a.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.830
The first term is this times
the ax_1 is a x_1 squared.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.480
So that's our first quadratic.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.360
Now there'd be an x_1, x_2.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.820
Let me leave that for a minute
and find the x_2 squared

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.350
because it's easy.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.440
So where am I going
to get x_2 squared?

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.650
I'm going to get that
from x_2, second guy

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.150
here times second guy here.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:54.830
There's a c x_2 squared.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.630
So you're seeing already
where the diagonal shows up.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.330
The diagonal a, c,
whatever, is multiplying

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.600
the perfect squares.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.820
And it'll be the off-diagonal
that multiplies the x_1 x_2.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.210
We might call those
the cross terms.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.160
And what do we
get for that then?

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.180
We have x_1 times this guy.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.200
So that's a cross
term. bx_1*x_2, right?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.270
And here's another one coming
from x_2 times this guy.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.780
And what's that one?

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.080
It's also bx_1*x_2.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.750
So x_1, multiply that,
x_2 multiply that,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.210
and so what do we have
for this cross term here?

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.600
Two of them.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.670
2bx_1*x_2.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:48.160
In other words, that b
and that b came together

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.490
in the 2bx_1*x_2.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.280
So here's my energy.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.400
Can I just loosely
call it energy?

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.960
And then as we get to
applications we'll see why.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.400
So I'm interested
in that because it

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.390
has important meaning.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.770
Well, so now I'm ready to define
positive definite matrices.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.690
So I'll call that number four.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.860
But I'm going to
give it a big star.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:29.670
Even more because
it's the sort of key.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.010
So the test will be, you
can probably guess it,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:41.630
I look at this expression,
that x transpose Ax.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.250
And if it's a positive
definite matrix

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.340
and this represents
energy, the key

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.750
will be that this
should be positive.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:57.120
This one should be
positive for all x's.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.700
Well, with one
exception, of course.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:07.530
All x's except, which vector
is it? x=0 would just give me--

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:17.390
See, I put K. My default for a
matrix, but should be, it's K.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:22.340
Except x=0, except
the zero vector.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.730
Of course.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:29.940
If x_1 and x_2 are both zero.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.720
Now that looks a little
maybe less straightforward,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.760
I would say, because it's
a statement about this

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.940
is true for all x_1 and x_2.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.760
And we better do some
examples and draw a picture.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:51.670
Let me draw a
picture right away.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.750
So here's x_1 direction.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.420
Here's x_2 direction.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:05.960
And here is the x
transpose Ax, my function.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.160
So this depends
on two variables.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.370
So it's going to be a sort
of a surface if I draw it.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.650
Now, what point do
we absolutely know?

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.050
And I put A again.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:29.560
I am so sorry.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.840
Well, we know one point.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.660
It's there whatever
that matrix might be.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.680
It's there.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.240
Zero, right?

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.300
You just told me that if
both x's are zero then

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.760
we automatically get zero.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.100
Now what do you think
the shape of this curve,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.280
the shape of this graph
is going to look like?

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.920
The point is, if we're
positive definite now.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.980
So I'm drawing the picture
for positive definite.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.610
So my definition is
that the energy goes up.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.650
It's positive, right?

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.320
When I leave, when I move away
from that point I go upwards.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.540
That point will be a minimum.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.740
Let me just draw it roughly.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:23.500
So it sort of goes up like this.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:30.670
These cheap 2-D boards and I've
got a three-dimensional picture

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.370
here.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.780
But you see it somehow?

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.300
What word or what's
your visualization?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.100
It has a minimum there.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.840
That's why minimization,
which was like,

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.140
the core problem in
calculus, is here now.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:54.870
But for functions
of two x's or n x's.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.930
We're up the dimension over
the basic minimum problem

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.730
of calculus.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.260
It's sort of like a parabola.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.960
Its cross-sections cutting
down through the thing

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.550
would be just parabolas
because of the x squared.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.890
I'm going to call this a bowl.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.050
It's a short word.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:16.840
Do you see it?

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.280
It opens up.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.870
That's the key point,
that it opens upward.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.920
And let's do some examples.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.000
Tell me some positive definite.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.170
So positive definite
and then let

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:35.910
me here put some not
positive definite cases.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.360
Tell me a matrix.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.050
Well, what's the
easiest, first matrix

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.710
that occurs to you as a
positive definite matrix?

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.230
The identity.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.090
That passes all our tests,
its eigenvalues are one,

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.890
its pivots are one, the
determinants are one.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.830
And the function is
x_1 squared plus x_2

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:05.520
squared with no b in it.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.590
It's just a perfect bowl,
perfectly symmetric,

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.190
the way it would come
off a potter's wheel.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.190
Now let me take one
that's maybe not so,

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.410
let me put a nine there.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.310
So I'm off to a
reasonable start.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.090
I have an x_1 squared
and a nine x_2 squared.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.890
And now I want to
ask you, what could I

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:30.410
put in there that would
leave it positive definite?

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.430
Well, give me a couple
of possibilities.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.800
What's a nice, not too
big now, that's the thing.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.550
Two.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.850
Two would be fine.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.540
So if I had a two there and
a two there I would have

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.000
a 4x_1*x_2 and it
would, like, this,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.720
instead of being a circle,
which it was for the identity,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.230
the plane there would cut
out a ellipse instead.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.750
But it would be a good ellipse.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.730
Because we're doing
squares, we're really,

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.960
the Greeks understood
these second degree things

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:18.540
and they would have known this
would have been an ellipse.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.070
How high can I go with that
two or where do I have to stop?

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.660
Where would I have to, if
I wanted to change the two,

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.080
let me just focus on that one,
suppose I wanted to change it.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.510
First of all, give
me one that's,

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.900
how about the borderline.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.610
Three would be the borderline.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.410
Why's that?

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:48.100
Because at three we have nine
minus nine for the determinant.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.500
So the determinant is zero.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.350
Of course it passed
the first test.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.920
One by one was okay.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:03.840
But two by two was not,
was at the borderline.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.850
What else should I think?

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.230
Oh, that's a very
interesting case.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.320
The borderline.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.660
You know, it almost makes it.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:21.860
But can you tell me the
eigenvalues of that matrix?

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.100
Don't do any
quadratic equations.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.220
How do I know, what's one
eigenvalue of a matrix?

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.330
You made it singular, right?

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.770
You made that matrix singular.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.730
Determinant zero.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.030
So one of its
eigenvalues is zero.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:40.180
And the other one is visible
by looking at the trace.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.090
I just quickly mentioned
that if I add the diagonal,

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.850
I get the same answer as if
I add the two eigenvalues.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.180
So that other
eigenvalue must be ten.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.940
And this is entirely
typical, that ten and zero,

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.640
the extreme eigenvalues,
lambda_max and lambda_min,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.300
are bigger than-- these
diagonal guys are inside.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.180
They're inside,
between zero and ten

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.580
and it's these terms that
enter somehow and gave us

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.880
an eigenvalue of ten and
an eigenvalue of zero.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.320
I guess I'm tempted to
try to draw that figure.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.560
Just to get a feeling
of what's with that one.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.140
It always helps to get
the borderline case.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.320
So what's with this one?

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.630
Let me see what my
quadratic would be.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.760
Can I just change it up here?

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.970
Rather than rewriting it.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.000
So I'm going to,
I'll put it up here.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.240
So I have to change
that four to what?

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.810
Now that I'm looking
at this matrix.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.960
That four is now a six.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.900
Six.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.880
This is my guy for this one.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.862
Which is not positive definite.

00:19:58.862 --> 00:20:00.320
Let me tell you
right away the word

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.260
that I would use for this one.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.820
I would call it positive
semi-definite because it's

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.500
almost there, but not quite.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:15.300
So semi-definite allows
the matrix to be singular.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.180
So semi-definite,
maybe I'll do it

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.350
in green what
semi-definite would be.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:31.700
Semi-def would be eigenvalues
greater than or equal zero.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.160
Determinants greater
than or equal zero.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.440
Pivots greater than zero
if they're there or then

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.410
we run out of pivots.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.490
You could say greater than
or equal to zero then.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.740
And energy, greater
than or equal to zero

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.110
for semi-definite.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:58.380
And when would the energy, what
x's, what would be the like,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.090
you could say the ground
states or something,

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.420
what x's-- So greater
than or equal to zero,

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.080
emphasize that possibility
of equal in the semi-definite

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.100
case.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:17.300
Suppose I have a semi-definite
matrix, yeah, I've got one.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.690
But it's singular.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:26.160
So that means a singular matrix
takes some vector x to zero.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.700
Right?

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.080
If my matrix is
actually singular,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.990
then there'll be an
x where Kx is zero.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.000
And then, of course,
multiplying by x transpose,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.350
I'm still at zero.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:41.900
So the x's, the zero energy
guys, this is straightforward,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:49.180
the zero energy guys, the ones
where x transpose Kx is zero,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:56.730
will happen when Kx is zero.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:03.210
If Kx is zero, and we'll
see it in that example.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.140
Let's see it in that example.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:12.300
What's the x for
which, I could say

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.170
in the null space,
what's the vector x

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.830
that that matrix kills?

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.146
[3, -1], right?

00:22:23.146 --> 00:22:24.770
The vector [3, -1].

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:30.600
[3, -1] gives me [0, 0].

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.360
That's the vector that-- So
I get 3-3, the zero, 9-9,

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.710
the zero.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.700
So I believe that
this thing will

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.750
be-- Is it zero at [3, -1]?

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.530
I think that it
has to be, right?

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:52.040
If I take x_1 to be three
and x_2 to be minus one,

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.400
I think I've got
zero energy here.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.630
Do I? x_1 squared will be
nine and nine x_2 squared

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.210
will be nine more.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.160
And what will be this 6x_1*x_2?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.250
What will that come out
for this x_1 and x_2?

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.530
Minus 18.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.950
Had to, right?

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.620
So I'd get nine from there,
nine from there, minus 18, zero.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.660
So the graph for this
positive semi-definite

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.050
will look a bit like this.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:26.060
There'll be a direction
in which it doesn't climb.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.560
It doesn't go below
the base, right?

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.340
It's never negative.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.190
This is now the
semi-definite picture.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.260
But it can run along the base.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.390
And it will for the
vector x_1=3, x_2=-1,

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.520
I don't know where that
is, one, two, three,

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.910
and then maybe minus one.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:51.520
Along some line here
the graph doesn't go up.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.940
It's sitting, can you imagine
that sitting in the base?

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:05.870
I'm not Rembrandt here, but in
the other direction it goes up.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.240
Oh, the hell with that one.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.650
Do you see, sort of?

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.270
It's like a trough,
would you say?

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.740
I mean, it's like
a, you know, a bit

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.720
of a drainpipe or something.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:27.300
It's running along the ground,
along this [3, -1] direction

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.180
and in the other
directions it does go up.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:35.480
So it's shaped like this
with the base not climbing.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.020
Whereas here, there's
no bad direction.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.900
Climbs every way you go.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.440
So that's positive definite and
that's positive semi-definite.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.770
Well suppose I push
it a little further.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:56.510
Let me make a place here
for a matrix that isn't

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.350
even positive semi-definite.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:05.180
Now it's just going
to go down somewhere.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.010
I'll start again
with one and nine

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.850
and tell me what to put in now.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.480
So this is going to be a case
where the off-diagonal is

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.740
too big, it wins.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.160
And prevents positive definite.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.410
So what number
would you like here?

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.770
Five?

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:27.960
Five is certainly plenty.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.600
So now I have [1, 5; 5, 9].

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:37.440
Let me take a little space
on a board just to show you.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.190
Sorry about that.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.450
So I'm going to do
the [1, 5; 5,  9]

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.800
just because they're
all important,

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.480
but then we're coming
back to positive definite.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:57.510
So if it's [1, 5; 5, 9] and
I do that usual x transpose

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:03.890
Kx and I do the multiplication
out, I see the one x_1 squared

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.750
and I see the nine x_2 squareds.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:11.690
And how many x_1*x_2's do I see?

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.480
Five from there,
five from there, ten.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.800
And I believe that
can be negative.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.220
The fact of having
all nice plus signs

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.970
is not going to help it
because we can choose,

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:30.030
as we already did, x_1 to be
like a negative number and x_2

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.350
to be a positive.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.180
And we can get this guy to
be negative and make it,

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:41.040
in this case we can make it
defeat these positive parts.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.590
What choice would do it?

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.560
Let me take x_1 to be
minus one and tell me

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:53.760
an x_2 that's good enough to
show that this thing is not

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.520
positive definite or
even semi-definite,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.360
it goes downhill.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.570
Take x_2 equal?

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:04.030
What do you say?

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.460
1/2?

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.250
Yeah, I don't want
too big an x_2

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.910
because if I have too big an
x_2, then this'll be important.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.550
Does 1/2 do it?

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:18.040
So I've got 1/4, that's
positive, but not very.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:23.610
9/4, so I'm up to 10/4,
but this guy is what?

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.531
Ten and the minus is minus five.

00:27:26.531 --> 00:27:27.030
Yeah.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:35.370
So that absolutely goes, at this
one I come out less than zero.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.170
And I might as well complete.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:43.890
So this is the case where
I would call it indefinite.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.190
Indefinite.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:49.240
It goes up, like if
x_2 is zero, then

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.170
it's just got x_1
squared, that's up.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.750
If x_1 is zero, it's only
got x_2 squared, that's up.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.890
But there are other directions
where it goes downhill.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.100
So it goes either up-- it
goes both up in some ways

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.160
and down in others.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.760
And what kind of a graph,
what kind of a surface

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.160
would I now have for x
transpose for this x transpose,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.690
this indefinite guy?

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:26.400
So up in some ways
and down in others.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:35.150
This gets really hard to draw.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.890
I believe that if
you ride horses

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.090
you have an edge on
visualizing this.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.760
So it's called, what kind
of a point's it called?

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.260
Saddle point, it's
called a saddle point.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.890
So what's a saddle point?

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.460
That's not bad, right?

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.650
So this is a direction
where it went up.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:02.210
This is a direction
where it went down.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:09.440
And so it sort of
fills in somehow.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:18.330
Or maybe, if you don't, I
mean, who rides horses now?

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:25.190
Actually maybe something we
do do is drive over mountains.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:35.380
So the path, if the road
is sort of well-chosen,

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.250
the road will go,
it'll look for the,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.540
this would be-- Yeah,
here's our road.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.310
We would do as little
climbing as possible.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.860
The mountain would go
like this, sort of.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.320
So this would be
like, the bottom part

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.630
looking along the
peaks of the mountains.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.410
But it's the top part looking
along the driving direction.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:05.590
So driving, it's a maximum, but
in the mountain range direction

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.320
it's a minimum.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.500
So it's a saddle point.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.810
So that's what you get from
a typical symmetric matrix.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.010
And if it was minus five it
would still be the same saddle

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:23.480
point, would still be
9-25, it would still

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.130
be negative and a saddle.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.200
Positive guys are our thing.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.000
Alright.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.230
So now back to
positive definite.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:40.650
With these four tests
and then the discussion

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.680
of semi-definite.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.150
Very key, that energy.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.970
Let me just look ahead a moment.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:58.650
Most physical problems,
many, many physical problems,

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.010
you have an option.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:04.810
Either you solve some equations,
either you find the solution

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:10.040
from our equations,
Ku=f, typically.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.670
Matrix equation or
differential equation.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:20.940
Or there's another option
of minimizing some function.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.640
Some energy.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.850
And it gives the same equations.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.680
So this minimizing energy
will be a second way

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:36.720
to describe the applications.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.760
Now can I get a number five?

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.660
There's an important
number five and then

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:48.130
you know really all you need to
know about symmetric matrices.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.630
This gives me, about
positive definite matrices,

00:31:51.630 --> 00:32:01.750
this gives me a chance to recap.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:06.400
So I'm going to put
down a number five.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:16.540
Because this is where
the matrices come from.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.480
Really important.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.390
And it's where they'll come
from in all these applications

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.230
that chapter two is going
to be all about, that we're

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.600
going to start.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.500
So they come, these
positive definite matrices,

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:34.290
so this is another
way to, it's a test

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:39.180
for positive definite matrices
and it's, actually, it's

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.930
where they come from.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.340
So here's a positive
definite matrix.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:54.270
They come from A transpose
A. A fundamental message is

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:57.090
that if I have just
an average matrix,

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:01.840
possibly rectangular, could
be a square but not symmetric,

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:07.220
then sooner or later,
in fact usually sooner,

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.430
you end up looking
at A transpose A.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.940
We've seen that already.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.390
And we already know that
A transpose A is square,

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.950
we already know it's
symmetric and now

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.980
we're going to know that
it's positive definite.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.140
So matrices like A transpose
A are positive definite

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.140
or possibly semi-definite.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.660
There's that possibility.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.920
If A was the zero
matrix, of course,

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.820
we would just get
the zero matrix which

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.460
would be only
semi-definite, or other ways

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:42.120
to get a semi-definite.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.720
So I'm saying that if K, if
I have a matrix, any matrix,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.770
and I form A transpose A, I
get a positive definite matrix

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:56.780
or maybe just semi-definite,
but not indefinite.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:01.850
Can we see why?

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:11.900
Why is this positive
definite or semi-?

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.740
So that's my question.

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.490
And the answer is
really worth-- it's

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:19.070
just neat and worth seeing.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.970
So do I want to look at the
pivots of A transpose A?

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:25.970
No.

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:27.910
They're something,
but whatever they are,

00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:30.460
I can't really
follow those well.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.870
Or the eigenvalues very
well, or the determinants.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.790
None of those come out nicely.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:41.690
But the real guy
works perfectly.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:46.060
So look at x transpose Kx.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:57.190
So I'm just doing--
following my instinct here.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.590
So if K is A
transpose A, my claim

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:07.050
is, what am I saying
then about this energy?

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:13.090
What is it that I want to
discover and understand?

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:15.630
Why it's positive.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.820
Why does taking any
matrix, multiplying

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:27.670
by its transpose produce
something that's positive?

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.520
Can you see any reason
why that quantity,

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.930
which looks kind
of messy, I just

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.530
want to look at it
the right way to see

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:41.510
why that should be positive,
that should come out positive.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.820
So I'm not going to
get into numbers,

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.640
I'm not going to get into
diagonals and off-diagonals.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.260
I'm just going to do
one thing to understand

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.990
that particular combination,
x transpose A transpose Ax.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:59.870
What shall I do?

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:06.130
Anybody see what I might do?

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:10.190
Yeah, you're seeing here
if you look at it again,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.210
what are you seeing here?

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.220
Tell me again.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:20.500
If I take Ax together,
then what's the other half?

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.090
It's the transpose of Ax.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.900
So I just want to write
that as, I just want

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.000
to think of it that way, as Ax.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.270
And here's the transpose of Ax.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.040
Right?

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.050
Because transposes
of Ax, so transpose

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.890
guys in the opposite order,
and the multiplication--

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.230
This is the great.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.380
I call these proof
by parenthesis

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.150
because I'm just putting
parentheses in the right place,

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:53.940
but the key law of
matrix multiplication

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.920
is that, that I can put
(AB)C is the same as A(BC).

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.170
That rule, which is
just multiply it out

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.150
and you see that
parentheses are not

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.430
needed because if you keep
them in the right order

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:12.300
you can do this first,
or you can do this first.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.720
Same answer.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.480
What do I learn from that?

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.020
What was the point?

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.510
This is some vector, I don't
know especially what it is,

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:21.900
times its transpose.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.910
So that's the length squared.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.210
What's the key fact about that?

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:30.000
That it is never negative.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:41.070
It's always greater than
zero or possibly equal.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.280
When does that
quantity equal zero?

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.580
When Ax is zero.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.060
When Ax is zero.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.050
Because this is a vector.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.830
That's the same
vector transposed.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.500
And everybody's
got that picture.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.970
When I take any y
transpose y, I get

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.440
y_1 squared plus y_2
squared through y_n squared.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.450
And I get a positive answer
except if the vector is zero.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:11.720
So it's zero when Ax is zero.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.990
So that's going to be the key.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.680
If I pick any matrix
A, and I can just

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.670
take an example, but
chapter-- the applications

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.730
are just going to
be full of examples.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:29.110
Where the problem begins
with a matrix A and then

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:34.960
A transpose shows up and it's
the combination A transpose A

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.100
that we work with.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.150
And we're just learning
that it's positive definite.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:46.440
Unless, shall I just hang
on since I've got here,

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:53.470
I have to say when is it, have
to get these two possibilities.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.950
Positive definite or
only semi-definite.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:05.820
So what's the key to
that borderline question?

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.680
This thing will be
only semi-definite

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.270
if there's a solution to Ax=0.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:23.560
If there is an x, well,
there's always the zero vector.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.730
Zero vector I can't
expect to be positive.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:31.300
So I'm looking for
if there's an x so

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:42.130
that Ax is zero
but x is not zero,

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:48.420
then I'll only be semi-definite.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.320
That's the test.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.730
If there is a solution to Ax=0.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.320
When we see applications
that'll mean

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.110
there's a displacement
with no stretching.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:09.580
We might have a line
of springs and when

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:16.570
could the line of springs
displace with no stretching?

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:18.390
When it's free-free, right?

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:24.010
If I have a line of springs
and no supports at the ends,

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.860
then that would be the case
where it could shift over

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.350
by the [1, 1, 1] vector.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:33.230
So that would be the case where
the matrix is only singular.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.410
We know that.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.440
The matrix is now
positive semi-definite.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.880
We just learned that.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.330
So the free-free
matrix, like B, both

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:48.690
ends free, or C.
So our answer is

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:56.170
going to be that K and
T are positive definite.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.470
And our other two guys, the
singular ones, of course,

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:00.590
just don't make it.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:04.000
B at both ends, the
free-free line of springs,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.040
it can shift without stretching.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.810
Since Ax will measure the
stretching when it just

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.630
shifts rigid motion,
the Ax is zero

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.110
and we see only
positive definite.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:19.030
And also C, the circular one.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:21.460
There it can displace
with no stretching

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.360
because it can just
turn in the circle.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:45.220
So these guys will be only
positive semi-definite.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.340
Maybe I better say
this another way.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.790
When is this positive definite?

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.930
Can I use just a
different sentence

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:57.270
to describe this possibility?

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:03.830
This is positive
definite provided,

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.270
so what I'm going to write now
is to remove this possibility

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.140
and get positive definite.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:16.010
This is positive
definite provided, now,

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.490
I could say it this way.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:25.130
The A has independent columns.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:29.080
So I just needed to give you
another way of looking at this

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.400
Ax=0 question.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.220
If A has independent
columns, what does that mean?

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.920
That means that the only
solution to Ax=0 is the zero

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.800
solution.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.640
In other words, it means that
this thing works perfectly

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.520
and gives me positive.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.080
When A has independent columns.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:43:05.470
Let's just remember our K,
T, B, C. So here's a matrix,

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:11.150
so let me take the T matrix,
that's this one, this guy.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:15.600
And then the third
column is [0,  -1, 2].

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.960
Those three columns
are independent.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.250
They point off.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.110
They don't lie in a plane.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:27.140
They point off in three
different directions.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:34.820
And then there are no solutions
to, no x's that go Kx=0.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.840
So that would be a case
of independent columns.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.000
Let me make a case
of dependent columns.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.730
So, and I'm going
to make it B now.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.750
Now the columns of that
matrix are dependent.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:54.280
There's a combination
of them that give zero.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.530
They all lie in the same plane.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:00.210
There's a solution to that
matrix times x equal zero.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.440
What combination
of those columns

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.850
shows me that they
are dependent?

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.000
That some combination
of those three columns,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.880
some amount of this
plus some amount

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.630
of this plus some
amount of that column

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.350
gives me the zero vector.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.600
You see the combination.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.550
What should I take?
[1, 1, 1] again.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:22.300
No surprise.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.050
That's the vector
[1, 1, 1] that we

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.840
know is in the-- everything
shifting the same amount,

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:36.680
nothing stretching.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:40.430
Talking fast here about
positive definite matrices.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.360
This is the key.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.980
Let's just ask a few questions
about positive definite

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:49.510
matrices as a way to practice.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:50.940
Suppose I had one.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.560
Positive definite.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:57.390
What about its inverse?

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:02.340
Is that positive
definite or not?

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.160
So I've got a positive definite
one, it's not singular,

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.990
it's got positive
eigenvalues, everything else.

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.240
It's inverse will
be symmetric, so I'm

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.330
allowed to think about it.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:20.530
Will it be positive definite?

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.670
What do you think?

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:27.000
Well, you've got a
whole bunch of tests

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.090
to sort of mentally run through.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:35.580
Pivots of the inverse, you
don't want to touch that stuff.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.690
Determinants, no.

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.230
What about eigenvalues?

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:41.090
What would be the
eigenvalues if I

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.640
have this positive
definite symmetric matrix,

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.800
its eigenvalues are
one, four, five.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.700
What can you tell me
about the eigenvalues

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.030
of the inverse matrix?

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.080
They're the inverses.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.690
So those three eigenvalues are?

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:00.890
1, 1/4, 1/5, what's
the conclusion here?

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:02.080
It is positive definite.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.430
Those are all positive,
it is positive definite.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.940
So if I invert a
positive definite matrix,

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.350
I'm still positive definite.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.660
All the tests
would have to pass.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.720
It's just I'm looking each
time for the easiest test.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.380
Let me look now, for the
easiest test on K_1+K_2.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.980
Suppose that's positive definite
and that's positive definite.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.670
What if I add them?

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.940
What do you think?

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.680
Well, we hope so.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.840
But we have to say which of
my one, two, three, four, five

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.660
would be a good way to see it.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.300
Would be a good way to see it.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.830
Good question.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.560
Four?

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.280
We certainly don't
want to touch pivots

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.860
and now we don't want to
touch eigenvalues either.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:03.400
Of course, if number four
works, others will also work.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.650
The eigenvalues will
come out positive.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.170
But not too easy to
say what they are.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:14.450
Let's try test number four.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:15.060
So K_1.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.020
What's the test?

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.430
So test number four
tells us that this part,

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:28.670
x transpose K_1*x, that that
part is positive, right?

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.900
That that part is positive.

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.040
If we know that's
positive definite.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.030
Now, about K_2 we also know
that for every x, you see it's

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.720
for every x, that helps.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.900
Don't let me put x_2 there.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:47.670
For every x, this
will be positive.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:52.670
And now what's the
step I want to take?

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:57.030
To get some information
on the matrix K_1+K_2.

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:01.280
I should add.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:06.330
If I add these guys, you
see that it just, then I

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:14.160
can write that as, I
can write that this way.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.650
And what have I learned?

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:19.890
I've learned that that's
positive, even greater than,

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.680
except for the zero vector.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.930
Because this was greater
than, this is greater than.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.170
If I add two positive numbers,
the energies are positive

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.380
and the energies just add.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:34.660
The energies just add.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:40.170
So that definition four was the
good way, just nice, easy way

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:44.960
to see that if I have a couple
of positive definite matrices,

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.020
a couple of positive
energies, I'm really

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.570
coupling the two systems.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:53.030
This is associated somehow.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.190
I've got two systems,
I'm putting them together

00:48:55.190 --> 00:49:00.260
and the energy is just
even more positive.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.860
It's more positive either of
these guys because I'm adding.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.070
As I'm speaking
here, will you allow

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:14.870
me to try test number five,
this A transpose A business?

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:21.271
Suppose K_1 was A transpose
A. If it's positive definite,

00:49:21.271 --> 00:49:21.770
it will.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:31.190
Be And suppose K_2
is B transpose B.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:33.280
If it's positive
definite, it will be.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:41.390
Now I would like to
write the sum somehow as,

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:43.990
in this something
transpose something.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.220
And I just do it
now because I think

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:50.020
it's like, you won't perhaps
have thought of this way

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.000
to do it.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.070
Watch.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:50:01.830
Suppose I create
the matrix [A;  B].

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:03.210
That'll be my new matrix.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:11.100
Say, call it C. Am I
allowed to do that?

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.210
I mean, that creates a matrix?

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:18.110
These A and B, they had the
same number of columns, n.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.300
So I can put one over
the other and I still

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.370
have something with n columns.

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:26.800
So that's my new matrix C.
And now I want C transpose.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.490
By the way, I'd call
that a block matrix.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:35.990
You know, instead of numbers,
it's got two blocks in there.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.980
Block matrices are really handy.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:43.310
Now what's the transpose
of that block matrix?

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.490
You just have faith, just
have faith with blocks.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:48.880
It's just like numbers.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:55.970
If I had a matrix [1; 5]
then I'd get a row one, five.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:57.810
But what do you think?

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:01.270
This is worth thinking
about even after class.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:05.470
What would be, if this C
matrix is this block A above B,

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.870
what do you think
for C transpose?

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:11.510
A transpose, B
transpose side by side.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:15.720
Just put in numbers
and you'd see it.

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.990
And now I'm going
to take C transpose

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:23.880
times C. I'm calling
it C now instead of A

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.360
because I've used the
A in the first guy

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:31.780
and I've used B in the second
one and now I'm ready for C.

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.490
How do you multiply
block matrices?

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.980
Again, you just have faith.

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.750
What do you think?

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:41.820
Tell me the answer.

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:43.880
A transpose, I
multiply that by that

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.180
just as if they were numbers.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:52.020
And I add that times that
just as if they were numbers.

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.072
And what do I have?

00:51:55.072 --> 00:51:55.780
I've got K_1+K_2.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:05.000
So I've written K_1, this is
K_1+K_2 and this is in my form

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.080
C transpose C that I was looking
for, that number five was

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.860
looking for.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.920
So it's done it.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.660
It's done it.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:19.310
The fact of getting A-- K_1 in
this form, K_2 in this form.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.720
And I just made a block
matrix and I got K_1+K_2.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.730
That's not a big deal in
itself, but block matrices

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.060
are really handy.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.260
It's good to take that
step with matrices.

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.930
Think of, possibly, the
entries as coming in blocks

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:42.600
and not just one at a time.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.330
Well, thank you, okay.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:50.700
I swear Friday we'll
start applications

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.000
in all kinds of
engineering problems

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.277
and you'll have
new applications.

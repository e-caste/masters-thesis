00:00:20.717 --> 00:00:22.800
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
Matt was putting a question

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.178
on the table for us.

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:25.720
So why don't you go
and lay that out.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.010
And we'll get to the next--

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.725
AUDIENCE: This idea of how
you distribute your talents

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:32.510
across R&D sectors.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.850
The economic model
that stands now

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.437
is treat technology as
[INAUDIBLE] a box and say this.

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:41.020
Put this much capital
into technology,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.478
and you'll get this
kind of growth,

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:44.980
where it doesn't consider
how you distribute

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.392
your capital within that.

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:50.580
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I'll just give you

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.390
an example because you're right
in identifying the problem.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.300
About seven or eight
years ago, there

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.540
were a whole series of
major studies of climate

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.803
and how are we going to
develop the necessary energy

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:06.720
and related technologies
that were going to be

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.550
needed to tackle the problem.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.710
And interestingly, all of those
studies got to this moment

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.560
where they were going to
talk about the technologies.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.970
And they all basically
read the same way.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.900
They all said, yes, we're going
to need a lot of technologies.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.690
And then we'll spend a
lot of money on them.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.360
We'll spend a lot of money
doing research and development,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.322
was their conclusion.

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:34.030
And then we need to
spend this much money

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.930
on research and development.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.100
Then we need to spend this much.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.558
But we'll spend a lot of money
on research and development.

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:43.660
There was never an attempt
to get inside that black box,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.830
as you well put it, Matt,
of how that innovation

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.900
system is actually organized
to optimize the results.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.940
That is our problem.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.380
That is the problem
of this class,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.590
getting inside that black
box and figuring out

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.390
how these innovation
systems actually work

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.657
and how you can optimize
the organization of them.

00:02:07.657 --> 00:02:09.490
And we're going to look
at a bunch of models

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.080
and a bunch of problems,
exactly along those lines.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.380
But if we do
nothing else, you're

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.332
going to get deep inside
that black box and, I think,

00:02:17.332 --> 00:02:19.290
start to understand some
of the elements you've

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.350
got to think about when you
design your way out of it.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.230
Does that help?

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.270
Because you're right.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.680
It's been a classic problem
in science and tech policy

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.620
that it hasn't really faced
the innovation organization

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.120
problems.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.230
It hasn't understood
how important they are.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.522
But I think they're really key.

00:02:37.522 --> 00:02:39.985
And we really jump into
that in the next class.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.020
All right.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.070
So we're now at our third
great growth economist,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.880
Dale Jorgenson, who teaches
up the street at Harvard.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.450
And Jorgenson I put
in here basically

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.390
because he improves the model.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:07.120
He takes a look at the
1990s IT boom, that period

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.450
of rapid growth,
and shows that that

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.560
is driven by technological
and related innovation.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.240
And the resurgence
in the US economy

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.450
in that '93 to 2001 period
really outran all expectations.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.460
And his view is that
there is the rapid decline

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.380
in IT prices for a technology
that inherently increases

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.060
productivity in important
ways and costs ever less.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.110
That's a huge driver
and was key to the surge

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.650
in the 1990s growth.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.670
And he argues that the core
technology in the IT wave

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.480
was semiconductors.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.090
So let me just
walk through this.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.620
You all probably
know a fair amount

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.530
of the semiconductor history.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.060
Bell Labs in 1947 with Bardeen,
Brattain, and Shockley,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.350
they developed the transistor
from semiconductor materials.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.560
And it's an electrical
switching device.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.170
It enables essentially the whole
follow on of digital technology

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.680
innovation.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.110
It's that digital
form that's key.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.960
And then following on that
comes the integrated circuit.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.390
And that really evolves in 1958.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.640
And it's developed in
two different sites, two

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.980
different great groups frankly.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.860
Jack Kilby was the leader of
a team at Texas Instruments.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.585
Robert Noyce is the
leader of a team

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:38.710
at Fairchild Semiconductor.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.855
And Fairchild later
morphs into Intel.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.820
And they develop the
integrated circuit.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.170
Gordon Moore, who's working
with Noyce at Fairchild

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.290
Semiconductor, watching
what's going on,

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.750
he develops Moore's law, which
is a good way of describing

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.960
what Jorgenson is onto.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.590
The integrated circuit,
every two years,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.230
is going to double the number
of transistors per chip.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.610
And the cost per transistor
is going to decline by half

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.820
in that same two years-- and
sometimes, it's 18 months--

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.800
kind of time period.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.790
So in other words, you have
much greater capability

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.490
at ever lower cost.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.950
That's the phenomena that's
at the core of this innovation

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.450
wave.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.020
And that is often
what's happening.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.070
You'll have a core technology
with a declining cost base

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.210
that gets evermore
capable at a lower cost.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.600
So you introduce, in effect,
a deflationary factor

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.740
into your technology
advanced process.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.150
So in '68, Noyce, Moore,
and Andy Grove found Intel.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.690
And they move over to
microprocessors or logic chips,

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:03.220
microchips, which is a bundle
of transistors playing out

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.320
this Moore's law theory.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.780
So Jorgenson looks
at semiconductors

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.700
as the core technology advance.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.760
And under Moore's law, it's
coming down by half every two

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.520
years in cost.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.470
Communications equipment cost
is also coming down driven by,

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.640
in large part, cheaper
semiconductors.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.080
So all kinds of
transmission technologies

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.640
are occurring at
this time period.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.240
I've listed some of them there
that are coming down in price.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.600
And the result is
a technology that's

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.680
creating major new productivity
gains in the economy.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.690
In other words,
you're producing more

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.990
for less with less labor input.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.800
Therefore, you're
creating a real gain,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.860
which amounts to a new real
wealth in the society, which

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.760
you can distribute.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.650
That's the pattern here.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.260
And the result is a
growth resurgence.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.030
So there's price declines in
computing and communications

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.310
equipment, computing equipment.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.900
Between '90 and 1995, Jorgenson
traces a 15%-a-year price

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:15.430
decline, between '95 and
2000, a 32% decline per year.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.060
In other words, this
thing is costing evermore

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.500
capable and costing a lot
less in relatively short time

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.970
periods.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.030
Now, the outlier
here is software.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.970
And this is how
Bill Gates gets rich

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.480
because the decline in price
in software is only 1.6%

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.060
between '90 and '95 and only
2.4% between '95 and 2000.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.820
So in other words, you
can still charge a premium

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.130
for your software even if
the hard technology cost

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.500
is coming down significantly.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.270
So that's why Gates and
Microsoft get bigger than IBM

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:57.880
because IBM bet on
the wrong category.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.393
And we still haven't tackled
this cost of software problem.

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:02.185
It's still too much of
an art form frankly.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.700
But there's big growth
in the '90s in this area,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.850
much higher than any other
kind of capital good.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.920
And it becomes pervasive
in the economy.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.760
It's in homes.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.050
And it's in every business.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.950
And it's in government.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.885
And the productivity numbers.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.030
From 1945 to 1973, the
productivity growth rate

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.650
in the US is in the 2% range.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:43.750
And then from '73 to
'93, productivity rate

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.910
falls much lower
into the 1% range.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:53.020
And then from '95 to 2000,
productivity rate is 3.5%.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.680
And economic growth,
in turn, is 4.2%.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.780
These are astonishing numbers.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.620
Historical US growth rate is 3%.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.810
In that '73 to '93 period,
it falls down to 2%.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.590
Productivity falls
down to the 1% range.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.270
That's a grim period.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.460
That is a grim period in the US.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.270
And getting out of
that grim period really

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.370
felt pretty amazing.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.900
Guess what?

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.020
Our current growth rate
is in the 2% range.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.895
And our current productivity
rate is in the 1% range.

00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:35.860
It doesn't feel
robust and dynamic.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.430
A lot of people are
getting left behind.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.750
What we need?

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.150
New innovation-based
growth wave.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.130
That's what Jorgenson
is writing about.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:50.572
That's what turned these
numbers around in the 1990s.

00:09:50.572 --> 00:09:52.030
And again, I want
you to understand

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:56.300
the relationship between
growth and productivity gains.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.210
Again, productivity
gains are what

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.180
create that real gain in
society that you can distribute.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.400
And they get driven by
technological advance.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.470
Productivity gains get
driven predominantly

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.670
by technological advance.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.190
So that's Jorgenson's picture.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.020
He essentially proves the model.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.900
He basically shows, by looking
at a period of a big innovation

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.470
wave, that Solow
has got it right.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.000
It's technological-based
innovation

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.720
that's driving that amazing
period of economic growth

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.610
in the 1990s.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.515
So questions about this.

00:10:37.515 --> 00:10:40.510
AUDIENCE: For that dip
in the '70s to '90s,

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:45.396
is that mostly attributed to
policy or demographic change?

00:10:45.396 --> 00:10:51.497
What was going on there that was
resulting in lower innovation?

00:10:51.497 --> 00:10:53.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: There's
a number of things going on.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.720
It's not so much demographics
change in that period of time.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.930
Now, we've got much more
significant demographics

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.460
issues.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.730
And the cost of an aging
demographic because you're

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.180
going to have to pay for me.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.430
And I'm going to take a
lot of your real wealth.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.140
It's an intergenerational
transfer now.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.932
We didn't really have
much of that going on

00:11:12.932 --> 00:11:14.830
in that time period.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.500
It was the ascendancy of a
baby boom, which in some ways

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.570
is the opposite.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.005
But in that period, that's
when the competition with Japan

00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:24.505
hits.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.500
And we'll talk more about this.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.770
But in the post
World War II period,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.810
the US organizes its
innovation system.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.280
And it organizes its
innovation system

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:46.270
around leading these
innovation waves.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.230
And it ends up leading
almost all of them in that

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.310
late-20th-century,
second-half-of-the-20th-century

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.180
period.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.180
And it gets very
rich because it's

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.820
getting the first mover
advantage of these innovation

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.080
waves.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.150
So we create the
richest nation on Earth.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.200
And then it misses one.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.470
And we'll talk more
about this in class 3.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:22.070
But Japan figures out
quality manufacturing.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.570
It's an innovation wave.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.700
It's a whole new way
of doing production.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.180
And out of that, Japan is able
to capture very large parts

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.640
of consumer electronics
and the auto sector,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.790
which had been core
sectors in the US economy.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:39.290
So a fair amount of what's
going on between '73 and '93

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.720
is that the US misses
an innovation wave.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.880
Now, interestingly,
then what happens?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.210
Then we have this boom time.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.870
What did we do?

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.430
We brought on another
innovation wave.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.430
This is the IT wave.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.860
That's what Jorgenson
is telling us.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.610
And fascinatingly,
Japan missed it.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.977
So there's a lot of
lessons here that we'll

00:13:03.977 --> 00:13:06.060
talk about when we get to
the manufacturing class.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.340
But go ahead, Max.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.007
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I
mean, if you've got companies

00:13:11.007 --> 00:13:13.550
like Sony that did very well.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.300
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I'll describe for you,

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.630
Matt-- let me interrupt
since you mentioned Sony.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.020
So I'm in Japan
in January of 2006

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.710
speaking at a big conference
organized by the US National

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:30.510
Academies and similar
organizations in Japan.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:35.550
And the meeting is on
innovation systems actually.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:45.270
And the headline in the
major Japanese newspaper--

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.560
and there's a major Japanese
English language newspaper.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.830
The headline is-- bold
headline across the front--

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:04.040
Apple Sells 14 Million iPods,
semicolon, where is Sony,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.360
question mark, question mark.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:15.800
Apple took back a large part of
that consumer innovation wave.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.070
Snatched it because of defeat
at the hands of great companies

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.330
like Sony.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.890
So the US was--

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.820
US quote because Apple
doesn't make anything here--

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.990
was able to take
back leadership of

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.320
an important because of its
leadership of a computing

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.880
revolution.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.590
In effect, it adds a
computing revolution

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.650
onto what that had been
consumer electronics

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.320
and then leads in
that territory.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.740
And that's what's
playing out in this time

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.440
period of the innovation wave.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.230
But we'll dive into this when we
get to the manufacturing class.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.710
So anything else on Jorgenson?

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.460
What do you think?

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.010
Is he right?

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.100
Is this the right picture?

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.740
I think the economic
evidence is pretty

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.360
overwhelming on this one.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.500
It looks really pretty
clear what happened.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:21.810
And to this model of a core
invention, apps pile on it,

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:27.000
semiconductors, apps pile
around it like the internet.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.180
And then it becomes innovation.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.600
And then it becomes
an innovation wave.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.510
And then it spreads
throughout the economy.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.120
And then it creates
big productivity gains.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.720
And then you can translate
those productivity gains

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.820
into a real gain in
your society, which

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.710
means a real new
wealth in your society

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.752
which you can distribute.

00:15:47.752 --> 00:15:51.270
That looks very clear
that that happens.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:56.370
So a major issue in the class is
how do you how do you do these?

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.020
Can we do these?

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.130
Can we speed the pace?

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.160
I mean, typically, they happen
about every 40 or 50 years.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.232
Could you reduce
the interim period?

00:16:04.232 --> 00:16:05.940
One way of looking at
what's going on now

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.550
is we're just
waiting for a wave.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.330
It's like we're surfers paddling
around waiting for that wave

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.730
to kind of take us.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.700
And I don't know what
that wave is going to be.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.967
But it could be very
interesting because we

00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:22.800
seem to do these about
every 40 or 50 years.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.730
But then the question is,
are we going to lead it?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.100
So if the next big wave
worldwide is energy,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.650
and there's certainly a
case that it might be,

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.630
are we going to have a
first-mover advantage

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.500
in a lot of these technologies
and get some of the gains?

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.947
Or not?

00:16:38.947 --> 00:16:40.530
I think that's a
pretty open question.

00:16:46.086 --> 00:16:47.358
AUDIENCE: Chime in.

00:16:47.358 --> 00:16:48.900
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Martin, go ahead.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
in general, that's

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.220
the classic thing of, if we
miss the next wave, your economy

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.090
will plummet too.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.210
And that's probably
what happened in Japan.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.430
The big concern, though, is
like most like Schwinger,

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.190
who's the nuclear scientist
in the 50's, 60's, talked

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.900
about how, if we do nuclear, it
wouldn't be possible in the US,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.319
It would probably have
to be somewhere in Asia

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.329
because we're just kind
of close-minded to it.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.079
And then if you look
into recent examples,

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:14.013
like Bill Gates funded
a fission company that's

00:17:14.013 --> 00:17:15.180
doing a new kind of reactor.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.638
But the policy just so hard
here that they're just doing it

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:19.950
in China because it's faster.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.151
And I think Romer also
talks about charter cities

00:17:22.151 --> 00:17:23.234
where you have less rules.

00:17:23.234 --> 00:17:26.040
So it's easier to
innovate quickly.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.470
So that's another thing.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.150
There's like this saying where,
if you outlaw innovation,

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.545
only outlaws will evolve.

00:17:31.545 --> 00:17:33.660
If you make it really
hard to innovate,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.415
people are just going
to go somewhere else.

00:17:36.415 --> 00:17:37.790
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I think those

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.998
are important points, Martin.

00:17:38.998 --> 00:17:45.810
And this is a legacy
sector problem.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:46.860
In other words, the US--

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.210
and we'll talk about this a
lot when we get to energy.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.370
And we'll read about it.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.170
But the US is pretty
good at creating

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.830
these kind of new
frontier territories,

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.560
standing up these new areas.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.160
We're not good at
bringing innovation back

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.330
into established sectors.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.100
We'd just rather do
the next big thing.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.920
And that's not bad.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.920
But when a lot of
your social problems

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.280
are tied to the legacy
sectors, then it

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.560
becomes a big disadvantage.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.900
Now, that's not to say
that countries in general

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.720
are good at innovating
in legacy sectors.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.220
They're not.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.670
There's a problem for everybody.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.580
But I think we're
particularly bad at it.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.750
And think of what the big
societal problems are.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.410
Energy efficiency and
moving to a new generation

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.370
of energy technologies.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.550
We've got to figure
out how to do that.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.008
But that means learning how to
innovate in a legacy sector.

00:18:42.008 --> 00:18:44.820
We've got a terrible problem
with health care delivery,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.040
terrible.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.420
We do the new thing.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.240
We'll do biotech.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.490
We'll create the new frontier.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.070
We just don't go back and fix
the health care delivery system

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.940
because it's tough.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.450
We'd rather do biotech.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.630
So a lot of our
societal problems

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.980
are tied up in this stuff.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.663
And as we'll talk about
in a couple of weeks,

00:19:04.663 --> 00:19:06.330
manufacturing has
played a critical role

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.990
in creating a very deep
inequality problem in society,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.790
the failure of that sector.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.870
And again, we're not good
at going back and bringing

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.700
innovation, i.e.
the next generation

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.580
of advanced manufacturing, into
an established legacy sector.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.640
So this legacy sector
problem actually

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.750
turns out to be a big one.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.230
And that'll be one of
the themes of the class.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.980
I'm stealing my own thunder
for a few weeks now.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.810
But you get an advance snapshot.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.380
Chloe?

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.480
AUDIENCE: Are we at a new point
in our history of innovation

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.881
because we have too many
next big things that we're

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:45.214
having problems following
through creating an innovation

00:19:45.214 --> 00:19:46.188
wave?

00:19:46.188 --> 00:19:48.848
We have health care and
space and energy and nuclear.

00:19:48.848 --> 00:19:49.890
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.780
I don't think it's bad to have
a big menu to get waves out of.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.640
I think that's fine.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.060
And the other thing I should say
is not all waves are big waves.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.110
In other words, waves are
of different size here.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.840
Biotech is not a big a
wave as an IT sector.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.360
But it sure is an
important wave.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.130
And you don't want to miss it.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.830
So we're going to have different
waves of different sizes.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.560
So having a lot of candidates
for waves, I think,

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.740
is actually a pretty
important thing.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.180
Because it's hard
to predict where

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.536
the big innovation
waves will actually go.

00:20:24.536 --> 00:20:25.670
Does that answer that?

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.340
Any other thoughts?

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:39.840
All right, let's do this
Merrill Lynch piece.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.350
So here's the question that
this-- this is a little Merrill

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:53.690
Lynch report that is
sent just before 9/11,

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.860
interestingly, when
the markets went bust.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.200
This was done on
September 4, 2001.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.950
And disaster is only days ahead.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:10.700
But this is that they're
riding the IT innovation wave.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:16.430
And they're trying to assess
what innovation waves are

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.930
and how their investors
can get rich off of them.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.800
And in a capitalist economy,
that's not an unimportant task.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:30.620
So how do investors look
at potential technology

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.640
breakthroughs?

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:36.000
Do they believe that
they drive growth?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.050
So what does the Merrill
report out to its investors,

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:40.910
tell its investors?

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.880
Well, they say, yes.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.550
Innovation drives growth
so you want to get on this.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.430
You really want to get on
these innovation waves.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.490
And then Norman
Piore, who I think

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.620
is related to MIT's
Michael Piore, who's

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:59.720
a wonderful professor of
entrepreneurship and technology

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.647
advances at Sloan, has
done important work

00:22:03.647 --> 00:22:05.105
on a lot of things,
including DARPA

00:22:05.105 --> 00:22:08.670
and including manufacturing.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.080
So I think Norman and
Michael are related.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.730
But I haven't asked him.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.790
But Norman Piore, who's
the chief economist

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.500
for Merrill Lynch
at the time, he

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.680
said, yes, innovation-based
growth drives the economy.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.590
And by the way, it
drives the stock market.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.840
And then he goes on to say--

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.640
and where he gets
this, I don't know.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.440
But he says, it takes 28 years
for widespread acceptance

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.410
of a new technology.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.780
That's-- is it always 28 years?

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.310
Maybe it's 27.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.190
I don't know.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:49.210
Then it takes 56 years for
rapid growth to evolve.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.840
And then it takes
112 years measured

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:58.840
from here for technological
maturity to occur.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.880
And then after that,
growth in that sector

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.240
is going to resemble
growth in population rates.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.610
Well, I don't know
where he gets the 28

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.350
years, 56 years, 112 years.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.880
I don't know where
that comes from.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.630
But this is the chief economist
of Merrill Lynch saying,

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.110
yes, this is how it works.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.290
This is how it happens.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.440
That's interesting.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.720
It's not just an obscure
economist conjury

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.660
of growth wave.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.560
This is advice going
out from, then,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.690
the largest stock, broad-based
investment company in the US.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.560
Then they hit on, what's
the wave we're going to hit?

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.600
So they think nano.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.440
That's the one, nanotechnology.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.732
So they describe an
interesting pattern here,

00:23:45.732 --> 00:23:47.440
which I think is
actually very important.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.020
It's really, I think,
very perceptive.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.900
I don't know where the 28 year
comes from although the time

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.970
frames are roughly right.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.040
But this, I think,
is really intriguing.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.070
And I want you to
think about this.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.420
So they say, let's
look at nanotechnology.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.860
And as you know,
that's fabrication

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.960
of the mark of the scale.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.910
And first, for a technology
to evolve and get

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:20.830
into range of being innovation
and maybe an innovation wave,

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.930
first, there's got
to be a vision.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:27.580
Somebody has to present a vision
of what this technology could

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.170
accomplish.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.950
And they argued that the first
vision about nanotechnology

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.840
was from physicist Richard
Feynman, a famous physicist who

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.750
went to school here, of course,
and was in the Manhattan

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.230
Project and then unfortunately
taught at an obscure California

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.200
school called Caltech.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.450
But Feynman, in a
1959 piece, argued,

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.370
in the physics
community, there's

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.630
plenty of room at the bottom.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.720
In other words, at the
really small scales

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.860
were quantum effects can occur,
some really interesting things

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.160
can happen.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.290
And that's the nano scale.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.570
So he gives a
vision that we could

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.280
do some really
interesting stuff when

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.840
you're operating outside
of Newtonian physics

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.200
at a smaller scale.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:21.030
So the second piece
that has to occur they

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.610
refer to as enablers.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:28.290
So there's got to be, in effect,
tool sets and instruments

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:32.970
that enable this vision
to get played out.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.050
And the key tool set
in that time period

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:43.320
was when IBM did the scanning
tunneling electron microscope.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.150
And you probably
don't remember this.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:50.730
But there was a moment
when IBM, before there

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.010
was much of an internet,
distributed photographs

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:59.260
of stacks of molecules
spelling out the IBM logo

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.600
and to civilians like me, I
said, oh, that looks very nice.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.580
But to scientists
seeing an ability

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.220
to structure molecules
in that kind of way

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.500
was just absolutely amazing.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.280
So the scanning tunneling
electron microscope

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.740
is not only an observing system.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:26.250
It's a device by which you
can move molecules around.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:30.540
So it becomes a huge
capability in allowing

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.110
measurement and manipulation
in nanoscale systems.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.420
So that's when this
article was written.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.460
That was 20 years before.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.990
The third piece that this
Merrill Lynch piece talks

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.560
about, which I also think
is really important,

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.290
is this is straight
out of Romer.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.050
You've got to create
research mass.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.940
In other words, you got to
put talent on the problem.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.630
This is human capital
engaged in research.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:04.320
So Eric Drexler, from MIT,
in a 1981 journal article,

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.480
begins to describe the kind
of physics and possibilities

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.320
in nanotechnology.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.910
That's the first one.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:18.900
By 2000, there are 1,800
journal articles on nano.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.493
And by the way, that's
a similar phenomena

00:27:22.493 --> 00:27:23.910
to the number of
articles starting

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.930
to write about the
internet in the 1990s.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.900
In other words, this
journal article total

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.640
signals research mass.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.080
It signals prospectors.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.010
It signals human capital
engaged in research.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.520
So these are, I think, really
interesting conceptual points

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.750
here.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.720
And you have to go through these
to get to your innovation slash

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.000
innovation wave.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.550
You need the vision.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.260
You need the enabling tools.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.930
And then you need talent on
the task, this research mass.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.930
And you've got to go through
all three steps to get there.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.360
That's interesting.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.360
And then they come
to, how are we

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.730
going to tell our investors
to get rich off this?

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.650
Because we've gone through
the three stages for nano.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:16.110
We've got 1,800 journal
articles the previous year.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.330
We've got research mass.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.730
How are we going to get rich?

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.620
And then they
issue this warning.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.040
Although the futuristic
market is fascinating,

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.720
it is not inevitable.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.780
So just because you're
approaching the future,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.780
it doesn't mean you're
always going to get rich.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.200
So how are you
going to get rich?

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.810
They acknowledge that
nanotechnology in 2001

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.200
is starting to get close
to commercial markets.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.440
And then they
review key markets,

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.620
which we would view as
hilariously short term.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.500
So zero to two
years, short term,

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.740
zero to five years, mid-term.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.790
Five-plus years is long term.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:59.235
Now, remember Norman Piore?

00:28:59.235 --> 00:29:02.730
It takes 28 years to do this
and takes 56 years to do this.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.190
It takes 112 years to do this.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.072
Those are long periods of time.

00:29:09.072 --> 00:29:10.530
These guys are
talking about trying

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.100
to get rich in what we
would view as extremely

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.420
short-term periods.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.220
And they give you
a good perspective

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.560
as to how far out investors
are even willing to look.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.360
And they argued that the
keys to nanotechnology

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.890
are manufacturing
and communication.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.500
If you can't build it
in volume, then there's

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.850
not much you can do with it.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.350
So they look at a series of
opportunities with that idea

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.790
behind.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.280
They look at
opportunity number 1--

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.360
instrumentation.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.260
And they note that, as a new
technology is advancing along,

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.310
the first class of winners
are the tool makers.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:57.410
So we'll go back to our
California Gold Rush in 1849.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.320
The first people to get
really rich in California

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.230
are those that are supplying
those miners that are

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.150
headed off to the gold fields.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.540
The tool makers tend
to be an early class.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.480
So for heaven's sakes, let's
invest in the tool makers

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.060
because they're critical
to everybody else.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.010
Everybody is going
to need their stuff.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.440
Let's invest in that stuff.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.750
Then they look at
semiconductors.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.810
And they note that,
within 10 years, if you're

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.310
going to stay on
Moore's law, you're

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.600
going to have to get
deep into nanotechnology,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.350
which, of course, turns
out to be the case.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:35.180
But that could take 10 years.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.622
So forget that.

00:30:36.622 --> 00:30:38.330
They're not going to
advise any investors

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.910
to get into that business.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.100
Instead, they
really want to focus

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.370
on stuff that can evolve
in two years or less.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:54.710
So if Norman is right and
technology development takes

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:59.300
a really long time
measured in decades

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.750
and Merrill is only willing
to invest for what it refers

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.810
to as the short-term
zero to two years,

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.350
there is a big
disconnect in our ability

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:13.290
to stand up technologies.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:16.950
We're just not operating
at a plausible frame.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.500
And who is going to
fund the rest of it?

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.350
I don't think Norman's 28
years is necessarily right.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.440
But it's a long time.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.760
And who is going to fund that?

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.210
Who's going to carry this
stuff for that extended period

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.820
if Merrill and the boys
are only willing to do

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.320
a two-year timetable?

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.590
This is a big gap in
the innovation system.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.840
And when we were talking a few
minutes ago about the problems

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.810
we've got in standing
up hard technologies,

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.950
investment at scale, if
it's only going to focus

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.700
on a two-year time
frame-- in other words,

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:08.800
you've got to get to production
in the short term to really

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.427
have this investable, to
work as an investment,

00:32:12.427 --> 00:32:15.010
so you're not going to want to
invest in technologies that are

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:19.510
more than two years
out from production--

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.510
then you're taking an enormous
amount of interesting things

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.290
off the table here.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:26.960
So it's a really big
structural problem.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.613
The answer that the US has
come up with historically

00:32:29.613 --> 00:32:32.030
is that the federal government
will play a long-term role.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.940
The federal government will
provide the long-term patient

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.440
capital.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.080
But that's not a perfect
model either because of what

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.990
we'll talk about next week,
this valley of death problem.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.660
So you following me?

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.150
So this is a classic kind of
innovation system problem.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.060
So when you're thinking
about innovation systems,

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.580
you're going to have to
think about the actors

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.740
in that system, the
handoffs between the actors,

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.250
and then the time
frames that the actor is

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.140
going to need support.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.090
So this is another
way of helping

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.560
us think about how to look
at innovation systems.

00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:31.300
Any questions flow from this?

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.970
Because this is a
big challenge here.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.270
The venture capital time
frame is basically organized

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.595
for everything
except biotech when

00:33:42.595 --> 00:33:45.220
looking at technologies that are
no more than a couple of years

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.970
out from production.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:52.120
So the US created this amazing
venture capital system,

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.730
which, in many ways, is
the envy of the world.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.135
And it works very nicely for IT.

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:58.760
And it works for very
different reasons

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.300
that we'll talk
about for biotech.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.030
But it's not working in
these hard technology sectors

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.070
because the timetables
are just too long

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.440
and the risks are too
high and the uncertainties

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.030
are too great.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:14.889
So this is a big gap in
the innovation system.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.889
Merrill Lynch doesn't look at
it as a gap in the innovation

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:18.429
system.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:21.363
But that's really what
they're showing us exists.

00:34:21.363 --> 00:34:22.780
And then the other
important thing

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:27.550
to remember about what
they present us with

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:32.230
is I think this very perceptive
notion that you need to go

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.760
through these three stages.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.350
You need to move a technology
from invention and discovery

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.770
to innovation--

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.330
vision, the enabling
technologies, and then

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:46.590
the research mass, the human
capital engaged in research,

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:47.380
the talent base.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.469
AUDIENCE: So are
innovation systems,

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.730
like Bell Labs,
just unsustainable?

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:01.350
Or why haven't we seen
anything like that?

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.180
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, I mean, we'll

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.570
deal with this a bit next week.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.940
And you should, Beth, bring
me back to this next week

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.735
for sure.

00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:13.110
The short story--
and we'll spend

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.810
a little more time on this.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.750
Bell Labs was tied
and was able to have

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:23.640
very patient long-term
supportive technology

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.760
because it was tied to a
government-guaranteed monopoly

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.930
model.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:32.490
And when we broke up AT&T
and the segments that

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:38.730
survived were placed in a highly
competitive situation with one

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.540
another plus an IT revolution,
which created an entirely

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.120
different communication
system around the internet,

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.650
was descending, then
Bell Labs' ability

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.070
to sustain a model
of long-term patient

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.390
investment in breakthrough
technology advance, it's gone.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:04.210
And by and large,
with some exceptions,

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:10.690
the model of the large
industry-supported, basic and

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:15.880
applied research laboratory
has largely gone.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.330
There's still some pieces left.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.190
IBM, although that's under
a lot of economic pressure

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.640
as it tries to shift to
a service-based business

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.610
and wonders why it's doing
hard technology research.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.670
That's a remaining piece.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.890
But it's not what it was
a decade ago in terms

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.150
of its basic research support.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.410
So there's few of these left.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:40.100
And the model of incredible
global competition

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.550
has really eroded the
ability of a company

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:50.690
to take a long-term risk over
highly hypothetical research

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.330
advances that are
very high risk.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.950
It's just really eroded this.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.650
So what's been happening?

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:02.480
So universities are
increasingly being

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.600
asked to take this job on.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.940
So universities have gone from a
19th-century model of education

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:16.190
as their dominant driver
to a mid-20th-century model

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:21.620
of adding research to
education and merging those to,

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:27.350
in recent decades, playing an
economic role, which they never

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.260
played before, and
trying to figure out

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.000
how to play that role.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.620
Because, in effect,
they're the surrogate piece

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:40.240
to substitute for
the Bell Labs model

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.290
to sustaining longer-term,
higher-risk technology

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.880
development.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.220
And they're just beginning
to figure out how to do this.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.920
So the engine at MIT is a
really interesting model,

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.890
which we'll talk about.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.750
And if anybody has any
ties over the engine,

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.910
we probably ought to go
over there and take a look

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.202
at what they're up to,
wander down the street,

00:38:04.202 --> 00:38:07.635
and talk to them.

00:38:07.635 --> 00:38:09.600
AUDIENCE: Just to clarify--

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Go ahead, Max.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:11.490
Go ahead.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:12.698
AUDIENCE: What is the engine?

00:38:15.383 --> 00:38:17.050
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
We'll talk about it.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:23.670
But MIT is attempting to
create a place for startups

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.280
that are right up against this
wall of not getting venture

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.650
support doing primarily hard
technologies where they can

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:40.700
live and have access to
advanced equipment, advanced

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.340
technologies, and
a lot of know-how.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:47.720
So in effect, it's substituting
a place for the kind of stuff

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.392
that they had to carry out
with venture funding before.

00:38:50.392 --> 00:38:52.100
So if you throw a
group of them together,

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.232
they have shared assets--

00:38:53.232 --> 00:38:54.440
in effect, Creative Commons--

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.750
rely on this campus but also
secondary nodes like Lincoln

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.190
Labs, like some
companies that are

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:08.680
interested in this model
to help them scale up

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.830
their technologies.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:12.250
So there's a lot of incubators
in this neighborhood.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.822
We have eight incubators
very close to MIT.

00:39:14.822 --> 00:39:16.030
And they're very interesting.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.280
And some of them are terrific.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.840
The incubator tends to focus
on getting your business

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.780
plan together and
kind of perfecting

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.970
your initial prototype.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.950
This is an attempt
to do something

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.980
that goes to much
later stages to help

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:41.140
you do the advanced prototype,
late-stage development,

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.870
demonstration, test
bed, and maybe even

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.910
pilot production,
which is typically what

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.890
you get venture funding for.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.530
But the timetables don't
work for venture funding.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.468
Maybe by substituting
space for venture capital,

00:39:55.468 --> 00:39:57.260
you could create a
different kind of model.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.890
So MIT is busy taking
this amazing adventure

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:01.790
trying to do this.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.403
And that's just
a classic example

00:40:03.403 --> 00:40:04.820
of how university
is going to have

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.800
to wrestle with their
new economic role

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.970
to get around this Merrill
Lynch-identified problem

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.800
for us.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.380
AUDIENCE: Also, there's
sufficient capital--

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.460
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.420
Right.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.920
And part of this--

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.322
pure space doesn't
always solve the problem.

00:40:24.322 --> 00:40:26.030
You're going to need
some bridge funding.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.610
So part of this is
raising some money.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:29.585
And could you raise--

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.940
the return on venture capital
is designed to be high.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.387
And it is designed to
be pretty short term

00:40:37.387 --> 00:40:39.470
to get your money back in
a pretty reasonable time

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:43.730
period in these venture funds.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:47.120
This is not going to happen
with these hard technologies,

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.940
a number of which will be coming
out of Martha's world of energy

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.402
technology development.

00:40:53.708 --> 00:40:55.250
Is there a community
out there that's

00:40:55.250 --> 00:41:01.280
prepared to tolerate a
much lower-level-return,

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:08.240
higher-risk, and long-term focus
just for societal well-being.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.190
Stefania?

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.040
AUDIENCE: Estefania.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:10.860
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Estefania.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.660
AUDIENCE: There you go.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.050
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.480
You're going to get
me to do this right.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.210
I promise.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.280
AUDIENCE: I think that's
precisely why it's

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.620
so interesting to study the
nonprofit development model

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.120
and why it's important
to understand

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.970
how to rebrand science and
technology innovation processes

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.430
and systems in particular
because nonprofits,

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.930
for a very long
time, and especially

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:28.820
community-led and
local nonprofits,

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.370
have understood exactly the
consequences of resource

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.040
scarcity no matter how
good their ideas are.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.210
And that's why precisely
I appreciate it

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.810
on her articulation
of the ways in which--

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:42.907
was it the Manhattan Project in
Kansas, the great teams model?

00:41:42.907 --> 00:41:44.490
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Great groups, yes.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.650
AUDIENCE: This model that
we'll talk about later.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:49.330
But I do think it's
important to have

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.010
a sort of critical literacy of
funding models in the way that

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.850
does impact the kind of
research that you can pursue

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:58.400
and also how that
funding model will impact

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.822
the ways in which
you'll have to construct

00:42:01.822 --> 00:42:03.530
your narrative of
success, whether that's

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.140
through a publication
or the product

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.950
that you actually
end up producing.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.450
Because it turns
out that there's

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.220
different kinds
of venture models.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.120
And I'm sure that MIT is very
cognizant of the ways in which

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.620
donor-specified funding plays
a role in shaping what you can

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.037
and cannot pursue
as a researcher.

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:21.078
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:42:21.078 --> 00:42:22.970
And interestingly,
exactly as you say,

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:26.330
we're starting to play around
with different mechanisms

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.000
including a number of
nonprofit mechanisms, that

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.780
would help us to kind of fill
this gap in the innovation

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.760
system.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.770
And in effect, Martin,
back to your point,

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.360
enable us to have a
lot more kitchens.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:43.830
All right.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:50.100
Let me see if I can draw
some conclusions here.

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:56.010
This class has talked
about two direct innovation

00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:00.000
factors, things
that I would argue

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.470
that you can't do without.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:04.680
So if Solow, which
its growth is driven

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.150
by technological and related
innovation, is right--

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:11.020
it's responsible for 2/3 of
historic US economic growth--

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.880
then having an R&D system
is a pretty critical pillar.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.397
And you need to
invest in that system.

00:43:17.397 --> 00:43:18.480
So that's factor number 1.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.897
Let's look at some
of the numbers.

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:22.620
And this is-- one of the
readings this week was

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:23.910
from NSF indicators.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:27.690
And NSF indicators comes
out every other year.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:33.150
It is the great collection
of data on the US innovation

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:37.140
system with lots of comparative
international assessments

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.120
as well.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:45.480
And it's just a great
tool set for you

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.130
as you look at
innovation systems

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.140
and need to make
comparative analysis.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.700
So don't miss it.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.040
I don't want you to read it.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.970
Just glance at it.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.030
See the kinds of
things that they

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.700
that they can collect
data for you on

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.800
and what those plots look like.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.160
And I'm pulling a few
of my favorite charts,

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.660
sometimes innovators but almost
always from NSF-developed data.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.990
Federal research funding.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.310
So this is federal R&D
outlays as a percentage

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:18.540
of total federal government
discretionary spending

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.590
between '62 and 2008.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:28.110
And you see that
discretionary spending on R&D

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:32.910
began to approach
it's like 17% in 1965.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.880
And then it comes down
to well below 10%,

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:45.570
and actually barely
above 8% by 2010.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.600
So that's another way of
looking at that same curve.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.740
So that blue curve is a
slightly different measurement.

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.010
But that's essentially
the decline

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.950
of federal government support.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:03.630
But then you see, in the purple,
it's an interesting x curve.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:09.135
So you see an increase in
industry support for R&D

00:45:09.135 --> 00:45:10.260
over that same time period.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.927
By the way, you can
extrapolate this out

00:45:11.927 --> 00:45:13.335
and the same phenomenon occurs.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:21.330
And this x curve is
a very famous curve.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.600
So you think, oh, well,
it's too bad that government

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.960
is pulling out of
R&D. But isn't it nice

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.520
that industry is taking over.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.590
And great.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.210
Problem solved.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:38.880
Because we're essentially at
the same percentage of GDP

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.680
that goes to R&D as we
were back in the 1960s.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.200
So no problem.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.450
But then you figure out that
these two different lines

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:52.680
are measuring-- it's
apples and oranges.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.400
Government supports
predominantly research.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:01.310
Industry supports
predominantly development.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.797
Is there a relationship between
research and development?

00:46:03.797 --> 00:46:06.380
Well, yes, of course, there is
a relationship between research

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.030
and development.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.340
To a significant
extent, research

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.030
is going to drive development
over an extended period

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.020
of time.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.850
So then this picture
becomes very problematic.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:25.520
In a way, the government
investment back here

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.060
enabled this big
industry build-up

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.390
in development that
followed afterwards

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:35.160
over decades afterwards.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:41.440
But if you're bringing down
your research, over time,

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.950
that's going to affect your
ability to do development.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:50.500
So this x curve, it's a
very problematic curve

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.310
for the future of US innovation
because what you want

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:56.590
are two parallel rising lines.

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:59.470
You want rising research,
which in turn is going

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:02.260
to enable rising development.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.950
You don't want either or.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:06.730
It doesn't work.

00:47:09.135 --> 00:47:10.510
I mean, there's
a phenomena here.

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:13.630
You have to understand why was
this government level so high.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.710
Imagine that.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:17.530
2/3 of R&D is being spent
by the federal government

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:18.430
here in the 1960s.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.620
What's going on?

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:21.490
Space race.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.620
Cold War.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.540
And hot war.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.640
So we've got simultaneously
a hot war, Cold War,

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.750
and space race.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:33.610
That does wonders for
science investment.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:36.940
And obviously, fortunately,
we haven't replicated that,

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.497
to the extent anyway,
that it occurred back

00:47:39.497 --> 00:47:40.330
in that time period.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.410
That's the x curve.

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:46.471
Let me go back to this.

00:47:46.471 --> 00:47:48.640
This is investment
in development,

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.940
which, as you can look, you
can see the x curve there.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.160
And that's investment
in basic research.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.960
So government dominates
basic research.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:01.640
The blue industry
dominates development.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.490
Why percentage of GDP?

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:06.070
Is that real?

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:07.600
That's the best
measure for showing

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.290
what the societal
commitment is to research.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:15.520
How much of your society's
wealth are you spending on R&D?

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.200
That's probably the
best measure that

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.640
shows the societal commitment.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.790
This is where it goes.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.170
So health is the blue.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.670
And that's been
the big expanding

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.250
area in federal R&D funding.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:35.380
And that doubles
starting in 1988.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.450
And you can see that take
off, whereas the rest

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.970
is fairly stagnant.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.920
Here's another way
of looking at that.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.740
Federal non-defense research and
development trends as a share

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.510
of GDP--

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:50.590
health now dominates.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:56.140
Other nations are
obviously working hard

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.380
on building their
R&D capability.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:04.992
And you can see that red line
of the US kind of stagnating.

00:49:04.992 --> 00:49:06.700
A lot of other countries
aren't following

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:11.110
that model, particularly
China on the bottom.

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.820
They understand the
need for R&D investment.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:19.050
So these are some ways of
looking at that Solow thing.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:20.640
What are we doing on R&D?

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.410
These are ways of quantifying
the investment levels

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:29.040
around R&D, both on the
governmental side, which

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.890
tends to dominate research,
and the industry side, which

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.667
tends to dominate development.

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:41.750
And the pictures are not ones
that we really want to have.

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:44.780
Let's look at our second direct
innovation factor, the Romer

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.420
factor, the talent factor.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:54.080
So if Romer is right, human
capital engagement research

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.870
is the critical
input for the follow

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.000
on technological innovation.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.600
It's a prerequisite for
running your R&D system.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:10.010
And that's the prospector theory
and the talent-based theory

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.970
of growth.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:13.640
So then talent
development becomes

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.500
another key pillar for
looking at the strength

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.900
of your innovation economy
and looking at your innovation

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.400
capable.

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:30.150
So let's look at some of this.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.200
That's natural science
and engineering doctorates

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.700
in selected countries.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:44.710
And you see particularly
this incredible rise

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:47.717
in degrees coming out of
China but a lot of growth

00:50:47.717 --> 00:50:49.300
in a number of other
countries as well

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:52.930
and a fair amount of
stagnation in the US.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.570
This US innovation
depends on the presence

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.150
of foreign-born
scientists and engineers.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:02.410
That's a very important
part of our system.

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.380
And that's how this
curve has taken off.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:10.730
So this is very important input
into the US innovation system.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:15.370
That's why immigration is such
a huge concern for the 400 tech

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:19.615
companies that filed the amicus
brief for today's argument.

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:24.610
This is the annual
growth rate on numbers

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:26.080
of researchers by country.

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:32.890
I mean, the US has the
largest research pool by far.

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:34.380
But the growth
rate is much lower.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:41.240
You see the rising growth rates
in a series of Asian economies.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.410
This is world share of natural
science and engineering

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:47.050
publications.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:50.530
You actually see a decline
in world share from the US

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:53.550
and, obviously, a huge rise
in world share from China,

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:57.460
but also countries
like South Korea.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.883
Significant increases in
first university degrees

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:01.300
in natural science
and engineering

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.140
in China against the
rest of the world.

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.850
China, rest of the world, right?

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.220
They get an innovation-based
growth model.

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.720
That's what they're after.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.280
They understand its importance.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.730
They are a developing
economy that's

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:17.140
become an emerging
economy that's

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:22.140
using an innovation-based
growth model for its growth.

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:25.830
So these are ways of looking
at talent and the strength

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.030
of your innovation system.

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.010
And the NSF
indicators can tell us

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:35.220
a lot about the second
pillar, this Paul Romer

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.460
pillar, this talent pillar.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.260
Now, where did these
direct innovation

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.530
system factors come
from, these two?

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:52.890
Well, on the direct
governmental role,

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:56.100
federal government funding
of university research

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.350
is obviously key.

00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:02.790
And government dominates
research investment as we saw.

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:06.030
Things like government labs are
obviously government dominated.

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:07.740
The education and
training system, these

00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:08.940
are Romer-type factors.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.750
The federal government dominates
higher education support

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.870
for science and engineering.

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:18.282
Support for industry
R&D, that's pretty

00:53:18.282 --> 00:53:19.740
significant on the
government side,

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.858
particularly through
the Defense Department.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.150
And sometimes some
other agency missions,

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:28.360
but DoD is the big one.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.450
So this is the
government playing

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:35.730
a role in direct innovation
factors, both education and R&D

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.020
investment.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.680
But then the private sector
plays a significant role

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.130
in these two direct
innovation factors as well.

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:46.020
So industry R&D, which
as we talked about,

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.295
it's primarily development.

00:53:48.295 --> 00:53:50.670
Industry takes things through
the engineering prototyping

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.430
and production stages.

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:57.390
The training system is
dominated by industry.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:00.270
So that's a Romer-like factor.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:04.020
So you see the division
between public sector

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.930
and private sector roles around
these two innovation system

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:08.430
pillar.

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.174
Any questions about
this data stuff?

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.710
So let's do some wrap-up.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:27.350
Robert Solow, the key
to economic growth

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.510
is technology and
related innovation.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.180
And for shorthand-- although
it's not a fair summary,

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:37.280
but in shorthand, we could say
that you've got to do R&D. Then

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.530
we talked about Paul Romer.

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:43.310
Behind that technological
and related innovation

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:48.200
factor is what he calls human
capital engaged in research.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.503
It's your talent base.

00:54:49.503 --> 00:54:51.170
But again, it's got
to be in the system.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:52.340
It can't be driving cabs.

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:56.540
It's gotta be in that system.

00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:01.700
And Dale Jorgenson tells us
that the key to 1990s growth

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.430
actually was technological
and related innovation,

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:07.070
that Solow is absolute right.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.973
That's how the economy grew.

00:55:08.973 --> 00:55:10.640
And we saw the picture
that he presented

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.480
for us of a core
technology, semiconductors,

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.320
applications pile around
it, it enters the economy

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:21.560
at significant scale and
starts to affect many sectors.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.330
That enables productivity gains.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:25.653
The productivity
gains is a real gain

00:55:25.653 --> 00:55:27.320
in the society, which
can be distributed

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.360
to improve societal well-being.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.200
That's the picture he uses
to show how these innovation

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.290
waves actually operate.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:40.550
And then from the Merrill
Lynch piece that we read,

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:43.940
we learn that investors
are only prepared to tackle

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:47.840
a pretty small slice of
that long-term technology

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.570
development time
frame that's needed.

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:52.550
They acknowledge
that it's long term.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:56.270
They're going to focus on
a very short part of it.

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:58.748
So you've got automatically a
big gap in the US innovation

00:55:58.748 --> 00:56:00.790
system that's going to
have to get wrestled with.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.400
And then the last
piece we went through

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.760
were these direct innovation
factors, R&D and talent,

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.190
and the different roles that
both government and private

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:13.750
sector play in these two.

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:16.290
And we looked at
the NSF indicators

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.950
as a good source for
you for terrific data

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.480
on how to look at innovation,
the US innovation systems

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.840
but also comparative analysis
with other nations as well.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.040
MICHAEL SHORT: And to try
something out a little real,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.210
I took a detector that you all
have, as well, my cell phone.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.009
And this morning I
went down with EHS

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.400
to one of the very
radioactive cobalt-60 sources,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.290
a 10 millicurie source.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.630
If you note, the source that
we were playing around here

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.910
was one microcurie, so this is
a 10,000 times stronger source.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.780
It was actually able to show the
difference between a background

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.070
count of my phone.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.010
You shouldn't see much going
on, except for that one

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.680
malfunctioning pixel,
because not much is going on.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.420
And when I put the phone
over the source itself,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.250
things look a little different.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.300
You guys see all that digital
noise, or snow in the video?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.880
Every one of those white
flashes that you see

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.660
is a gamma interaction with the
semiconductor in the cell phone

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.160
camera, with one or
more pixels in your CCD,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.640
or charged couple device,
or your CMOS detector,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.173
whichever one it happens to be.

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:23.590
So I thought this
was pretty cool.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.605
You can actually use your cell
phone as a radiation detector.

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:28.980
We're going to understand why,
and what sort of radiation

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.980
it could detect by virtue of its
size and its composition today.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.000
Anyone ever try this before?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.677
You have?

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:38.302
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:01:38.302 --> 00:01:39.226
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:42.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.520
MICHAEL SHORT:
Probably more intense

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.020
than this if you were
making neutrons, right?

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.980
MICHAEL SHORT: Awesome.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.990
OK, cool.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.240
So let's just first
figure out, well,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.770
where is this
radiation coming from?

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.810
This is the link between
the first part of the course

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.030
and what we're going to be
doing over the next month.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.780
As we've seen from
the decay diagrams--

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.290
and I think I've harped on
potassium-40 as an example

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.590
for a reason--

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.450
it can undergo electron
capture or positron release.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.690
And if it undergoes electron
capture by this likely route

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.440
it gives off a
1.461 MeV gamma ray

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.870
as the only possible
transition here.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.663
It also undergoes
beta decay, which

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:20.830
you don't want to forget
about if you're calculating

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.390
the activity of potassium-40.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.890
But today we're
going to be focusing

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.410
on what does this
gamma ray actually

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.420
do when it encounters matter?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.480
Or what are the possible
things that can happen?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.990
I'm going to introduce
them conceptually today,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.490
and we're going to go through
the math of the cross sections

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.470
and the energetics
more tomorrow.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.010
So I'm doing a context first,
theory second kind of approach.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.560
There's three main things
that gamma rays will

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.100
do in matter depending
on their energy

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.370
and the actual matter itself.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.520
There is one called the
photoelectric effect,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.070
where a gamma ray simply ejects
an electron from the nucleus.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.810
So let's say we've got
our potassium-40 atom,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.275
have a bunch of
electron shells--

00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:04.020
I'm not going to draw
all the electrons,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.580
but I'll draw a few inner
and outer ones here.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.090
One of the things that
the gamma ray can do

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.250
is just eject that electron,
have it come firing out.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.050
And the energy balance
for that isn't that hard,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.320
because this gamma has
some energy E-gamma.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.430
This electron had some
binding energy, E-binding.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.380
And the kinetic energy, let's
call it t, of the electron

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.660
is simply the gamma ray in minus
the binding energy back out.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.460
It's just however
much energy it takes

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.520
to remove that electron,
that's what it takes.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.110
And so you end up
with, if we go back

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.630
to our banana
spectrum, what we call

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.520
a photo peak, or a photoelectric
emission peak, right here.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.610
If you trace down
this line, it's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.310
awfully close to
1,469 KeV, Or 1.46--

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.390
what was it?

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.020
1.461 MeV.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.210
It won't be exactly
at that energy,

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.580
because it does take
a little bit of energy

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.380
to remove that electron.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.797
Anyone have a guess on
what order of magnitude

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:14.380
that might be?

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.190
Yeah.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.260
KeV all the way down to eV.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.940
So this photo peak
will typically

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.120
be extremely close,
but not exactly equal,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.340
to the energy of the
gamma ray coming out.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.853
For most detectors that don't
have that good resolution,

00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:34.270
you can pretty
much assume they'll

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.943
be in the same channel,
or the same energy bin,

00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:40.360
because you're detector will
have some sort of resolution.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.440
It may have 1,024 or
2,048 channels that

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.830
span the full energy range.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.830
And you might not be able
to tell the difference

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.230
between 1,460 MeV--

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.350
or 1.46 MeV-- and
that minus a few eV.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.870
Potassium, in particular, has
quite a small work function.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.482
And we'll get into why
that is in a second.

00:05:00.482 --> 00:05:01.940
The next thing you
can do is what's

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.810
called Compton scattering, in
the general case, which means

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.580
that there is an electron here.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.630
A gamma ray comes
in with E-gamma.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.860
And then it bounces off with
some energy, E-prime-gamma.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.330
And then the electron goes off
with some other kinetic energy.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.850
Then the last one is what's
called pair production.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.370
Just like in the
Q equation, if you

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.930
have anything
related to positrons

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.820
you have to first create them.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.250
So pair production doesn't
happen below about 1.022 MeV.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.650
And it happens with
increasing probability

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.420
as the energy of
the photon goes up,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.880
kind of like in
radioactive decay.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.920
There's a lot of parallels here.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.950
Is you can make an
electron-positron pair

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.920
at 1.022 MeV.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.020
It's just not very likely.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.510
And what we're going
to find out tomorrow

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.800
is why the most likely
photon effect is shown

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.810
in these different regions.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.770
Anyone have any idea?

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.410
Why do you think the
photoelectric effect

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.882
would be most likely at
low energies and high Z?

00:06:10.882 --> 00:06:12.590
You just have to give
an intuitive guess.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.180
Yeah, Luke?

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.680
AUDIENCE: Because
the binding energy

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.010
isn't very large for the
outer electron shells.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.940
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.970
So that explains
the low energy idea.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.470
So it doesn't take very much.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.378
In fact, does anyone know
what the minimum energy

00:06:27.378 --> 00:06:29.420
you need to make the
photoelectric effect happen?

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.380
Well, what's a typical
order of magnitude

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.320
for binding energy of the
lowest, or the outermost,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.689
electron shell, or the
lowest bound electron?

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.397
AUDIENCE: Work function?

00:06:43.397 --> 00:06:44.230
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.563
That's called the work function.

00:06:45.563 --> 00:06:49.140
Anyone know an order of
magnitude, guess what it is?

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.120
It's in the single eV range.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.720
In some cases, it can
even be slightly lower.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.340
And that, we're talking
about visible light.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.740
So green light,
even yellow light,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.110
can eject electrons via
the photoelectric effect.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.575
And then the reason that
goes more likely with higher

00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:06.950
and higher Z,
we'll get into that

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.920
when we look at the different
cross sections of interaction.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.890
Pair production is much more
likely at higher energies,

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.600
because at higher
energy you're more

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.510
likely to create a positron.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.510
And in addition, pair
production happens

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.920
when a photon interacts with
either the electron cloud,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.102
or the nucleus there.

00:07:26.102 --> 00:07:27.560
And that gets more
and more likely,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.227
let's say, the denser
the electron cloud

00:07:29.227 --> 00:07:31.565
is or the higher charge
there is on the nucleus.

00:07:34.783 --> 00:07:37.200
So first, the simplest one,
the photoelectric effect, this

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.050
is actually what Einstein
won the Nobel Prize for.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.580
Not E equals mc
squared, which has

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.378
been the bane of our
existence for the last month.

00:07:44.378 --> 00:07:46.170
That's not what he got
the Nobel Prize for.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.240
It was demonstration of
the photoelectric effect,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.010
where if you start firing
photons of an energy times

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.900
Planck's constant
times its frequency--

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.900
and in the next page I'll give
you a quick photon math primer,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.360
in case you don't know
what those quantities are--

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.310
there will be no
photoelectric emission

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.420
until you hit that
work function.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.270
Yeah, like Julio was
saying, that lowest

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.860
bound electron energy.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.310
And then, emission
will simply go up.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.680
And so this was demonstrated
by applying a voltage

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.470
to two different plates,
two different metal plates,

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.870
and then sending in
light via this window

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.290
and seeing when the current
actually became non-zero.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.690
So the way you detect
photoelectric emission

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.970
is, if you've got electrons
boiling off of one surface

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.459
to the other, that's
the movement of charge,

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:34.250
and that's a current.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.980
And so you can measure a
current with an ammeter.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.780
That's-- it actually
is that simple.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:46.220
But very elegant experiment,
back for the 1910s or 1920s.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.320
And as a quick primer
on photon quantities,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.330
so you know what all of
these different symbols

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.220
mean, the photon energy we
give as Planck's constant times

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.410
its frequency.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.300
And I gave you Planck's constant
right here, for reference.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.220
I do recommend that you
guys try checking out

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.400
all the units to make
sure that they work out.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.320
Because if you ever
forget, is it h times nu,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.150
or is hc over lambda,
you can always

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.520
check the units of your
expression to make sure

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.250
they come out to an energy.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.800
Which in SI units is what?

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.703
AUDIENCE: Joules?

00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:17.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Joules.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.160
And then how about in these
sorts of things, the most

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.690
reduced SI units?

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.787
AUDIENCE: eV?

00:09:23.787 --> 00:09:24.745
MICHAEL SHORT: Is what?

00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:25.287
AUDIENCE: eV?

00:09:25.287 --> 00:09:28.090
MICHAEL SHORT: eV is
another unit of energy

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.160
similar to the joule,
like 1.6 times 10

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.900
to the minus 19 joules.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.390
But what about in meters,
kg, seconds, other SI units?

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.558
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:37.558 --> 00:09:38.350
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.740
Kilogram meters squared
per second squared.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.847
Indeed.

00:09:42.847 --> 00:09:44.430
Per meter squared,
per second squared.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.660
Yeah.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.277
So just make sure sure
you remember that,

00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:50.985
because if you're just
looking for joules

00:09:50.985 --> 00:09:52.730
and you don't remember
what a joule is,

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.960
it's going to make unit
balance kind of hard.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.870
And also, we can describe the
momentum, or p, of the photon

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.123
as Planck's constant over
lambda, its wavelength.

00:10:01.123 --> 00:10:02.790
This is going to get
real important when

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.430
I ask you guys to
do a derivation,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.875
much like the q equation one
that we were doing before.

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:10.500
But instead of me just doing it
at the board and you copying it

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.620
down, I want you guys to
try working through it.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.870
And it's going to be
another energy and momentum

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.780
conservation thing,
just like before.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.640
And this way you know
what the energy is

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.182
and you'll know what
the momentum is.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.800
So now onto this work function.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.240
What is it, actually?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.570
There's a great
paper by Michaelson--

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.960
I did not look up whether this
is the Michaelson of Michaelson

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.900
Interferometry, but I
wouldn't be surprised.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.140
I'm going to check into that.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.290
But I did dig out this
paper that actually

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.080
shows the different patterns
in the work functions

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.740
of different elements.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.067
So what do you guys notice
in terms of patterns, here?

00:10:49.067 --> 00:10:51.400
First of all, which elements
are all the way to the left

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.584
or have the lowest
work function?

00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:55.417
AUDIENCE: Group one.

00:10:55.417 --> 00:10:56.417
MICHAEL SHORT: The what?

00:10:56.417 --> 00:10:57.770
AUDIENCE: The group one metals?

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.270
MICHAEL SHORT: The
group one metals,

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.950
like sodium, lithium, potassium.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.412
Why do you think that is?

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.620
AUDIENCE: I mean, they have--

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.005
I don't know.

00:11:08.005 --> 00:11:09.630
MICHAEL SHORT: They've
got one electron

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.672
in their outermost shell.

00:11:10.672 --> 00:11:14.330
So it looks like my potassium
picture is not quite accurate.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.420
I'm going to draw another
shell, and put one lone electron

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.730
in that for accuracy.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.900
And so that electron
is extremely unbound.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.970
That's the same reason
that these elements are so

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.380
chemically reactive.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.980
They want to ditch that electron
to have a filled outer shell.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.210
So you may also expect the
work function of noble gases

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.430
to be extremely high.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.170
I don't know if any
are plotted here,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.140
but you do see the next row
over, like barium, strontium,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.650
calcium, magnesium, has a
slightly higher work function.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.050
And as you move this way
through the periodic table,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.710
to the left, until you hit the
transition metal craziness,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.973
it follows a pretty
regular pattern.

00:11:51.973 --> 00:11:53.640
And so you can have
a good guess of what

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.210
the work function of something
will be depending on it's Z,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.440
and depending on which--

00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.940
what is it?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.426
Which column it's in
in the periodic table.

00:12:02.426 --> 00:12:03.970
Now, can anyone
tell me, why do you

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:10.490
think that work functions tend
to increase with decreasing Z?

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.340
Yeah.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.370
AUDIENCE: For smaller Z,
the outermost electron

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.963
is closer to the nucleus,
so it's more tightly bound.

00:12:15.963 --> 00:12:16.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Indeed.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.930
Yep, exactly.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.250
For the smaller Z, that first or
second shell is a hell of a lot

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.660
closer to the nucleus.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.380
Even though it has a lower
total charge in the nucleus,

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.060
it's much more tightly
bound, being much closer.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.400
So, like the outermost electron
in caesium is quite far away,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.770
it does not feel as
much coulomb attraction.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.640
Yeah, good point.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.013
So now onto Compton scattering.

00:12:41.013 --> 00:12:42.430
I'd say though the
most difficult,

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.430
conceptually, to
understand the energetics.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.430
But the kinematics, or what
actually physically happens,

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.280
should look strikingly
similar to what

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.390
we've spent the last month on.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.580
Instead of two
particles colliding,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.265
it's a photon colliding
with an electron.

00:12:59.265 --> 00:13:00.640
Does anyone remember
what we read

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.970
in that first day of class,
with the Chadwick paper?

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.460
When he said, hey, maybe
this quantum of energy

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.720
is done in a process analogous
to Compton scattering.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.820
Well, this is
Compton scattering.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.220
His analogous process
was maybe an electron

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.740
hits a proton and
something happens,

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.040
which is not actually
what happens.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.400
And in this case, you have
a photon with energy h nu,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.920
and momentum h nu
over c, striking

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.700
an electron with rest
mass m of electron

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.120
c squared, or 0.511 MeV.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.410
And afterwards, the photon
leaves at sum angle theta,

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.270
and the electron leaves
at sum angle phi.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.630
So I'm going to show you guys
some of the Compton scattering

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.960
energetics relations, like
what is the wavelength shift.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.840
Which means that if
this photon comes

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.300
in with a certain
wavelength, lambda,

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.340
and it gives some of its
energy to the electron,

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.875
it comes out at a
different wavelength.

00:13:56.875 --> 00:13:58.750
Is it going to be lower
or higher wavelength,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.082
do you think?

00:14:00.082 --> 00:14:03.638
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:03.638 --> 00:14:05.180
MICHAEL SHORT: I
heard a bit of both.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.114
So who says lower?

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:08.575
AUDIENCE: Me.

00:14:08.575 --> 00:14:10.530
It can be wavelength.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.500
MICHAEL SHORT: So
lower wavelength.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.780
Let's go back to
the photon formula.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.300
Would a lower wavelength
result in a lower or a higher

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.004
photon energy?

00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:20.870
AUDIENCE: Higher.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.930
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.060
So in a Compton
scatter, you start off

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.160
with an electron
kind of at rest.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.530
They're definitely
not actually at rest.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.600
But compared to the
energy of the photon,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.100
they're at rest enough.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.100
And then you give some of
that energy to the electron.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.200
That energy has got to go down.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.110
And because these two
quantities here are constants,

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.450
the wavelength has
got to increase.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.370
And hopefully this
makes intuitive sense.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.590
The photon does what
we call a redshift.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.170
It shifts closer to the red
end of the visible spectrum

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.505
than the blue end.

00:14:51.505 --> 00:14:53.400
And as you guys know,
the high energy light

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.070
in the visible spectrum hits
towards the ultraviolet.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.650
That's what tans you, or
gives you skin cancer.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.170
Red light, or infrared light,
doesn't do much of anything

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.020
at all.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.750
And so this is that on
the extreme scale, where

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.670
when we say redshift,
we don't necessarily

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.590
mean the photon is visible.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.830
But we do mean that
it's shifting to a lower

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.300
energy, or a higher wavelength.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.580
And so this wavelength shift
is always going to be, well,

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.665
is it going to be
positive or negative?

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.535
AUDIENCE: Positive, right?

00:15:39.535 --> 00:15:40.493
MICHAEL SHORT: Is what?

00:15:40.493 --> 00:15:40.926
AUDIENCE: Positive?

00:15:40.926 --> 00:15:42.843
MICHAEL SHORT: So you
say the wavelength shift

00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:45.170
is going to be
positive, which would

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.920
mean an increase in wavelength?

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.750
There you go.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.260
Yep.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.638
Because it's got to be--
it's got to lose energy.

00:15:53.638 --> 00:15:55.930
So I'm not going to go through
the derivation of these,

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.138
because I want you guys to
go through the derivation.

00:15:58.138 --> 00:16:00.340
But we're going to do it
in the exact same way,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.620
and I'll help kind
of kick you off.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.560
Where, in this case, what
are the three quantities

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.216
we can conserve in every
physics, everywhere?

00:16:09.216 --> 00:16:11.070
AUDIENCE: Mass,
energy, and momentum?

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.820
MICHAEL SHORT: Mass,
energy, and momentum.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.903
The trick here is, what
is the mass of the photon?

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.480
Massless.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.260
So we've got energy
and momentum.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.380
And we've got, let's say, some
wavelength shift to determine,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.290
which is some change in energy.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.370
And we've got two
angles to deal with.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.940
That's three unknowns.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.640
We need three equations.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.980
So we know that our
initial energy coming

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:40.650
in is going to be h nu
plus approximately 0

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:46.860
becomes h nu bar, and the
kinetic energy of the electron.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.280
So that's our energy
conservation relation.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.030
And then what do we
do about the momentum?

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.836
What do we do last time?

00:16:59.836 --> 00:17:01.260
AUDIENCE: Split it into x and y.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.218
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:17:02.218 --> 00:17:04.200
Split it up into
x and y momentum.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.150
So the x momentum
of the photon--

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.710
so I'll just label
this as energy--

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:18.290
put the x momentum of the
photon is h nu over c.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.250
And there was no x momentum
of the electron to begin with.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.240
So then we're going to say
this has outgoing momentum h

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:33.090
nu prime over c times
cosine theta plus whatever

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:42.190
the electron momentum is, let's
say m electron v, or root 2 m

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:48.818
electron, T
electron, cosine phi.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.235
And then how about
the y momentum?

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.375
What's the y momentum of
the system at the beginning?

00:17:58.375 --> 00:17:59.000
AUDIENCE: Zero?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.060
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.330
Nothing for the photon,
nothing for the electron.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:10.520
And at the end we've got h
nu over c sine theta minus,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:16.450
because it's in the negative
y direction, momentum

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.918
of the electron sine phi.

00:18:20.918 --> 00:18:22.710
I'm going to stop my
part of the derivation

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.660
there, because I don't want to
steal away your whole homework

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.470
problem.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.170
But you're going to start it
out exactly in the same way

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.250
as we were doing kinematics
of two particle collisions.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.200
Because what is a
particle, but a wave?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.587
They're all the same thing.

00:18:35.587 --> 00:18:36.420
It's modern physics.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.700
And then-- here's an
interesting bit, here--

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.340
this maximum wavelength
shift, if you want

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.090
to figure out what is the--

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:46.590
well, look.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.230
Let's say, we call it
the Compton wavelength.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:55.580
So if you were to decide what
is the maximum wavelength shift,

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.300
where would that be?

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.030
At what angle?

00:19:07.607 --> 00:19:10.190
Did you have a question, or did
you say what was the question?

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.340
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, OK.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.587
Is what?

00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:14.420
AUDIENCE: Pi over 2.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.045
MICHAEL SHORT: Is
that angle pi over 2?

00:19:16.045 --> 00:19:20.010
Because at that point cosine
of pi over 2 equals zero.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:20.510
Yep.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.730
And so then you get
this interesting result.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.010
No matter what the incoming
energy of the photon

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:30.518
is, you get this
0.238 MeV shift.

00:19:30.518 --> 00:19:32.810
And that's actually going to
help explain, to jump back

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:38.630
to our banana spectrum, what the
distance is between our photo

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.590
peak--

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.540
which is our
photoelectric peak, which

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.900
is pretty close to the
energy of the photon--

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.160
and this part right here,
which we call the Compton edge.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.870
Which would mean the
maximum scattered energy

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.170
of that photon, in this case.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.410
Or no, I'm sorry.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:01.290
That would be the maximum
energy imparted to the electron.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.360
Almost misspoke there.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.640
And no matter what this
energy of the photon

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.610
is, that distance right there,
that's the Compton wavelength.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.130
Interesting quirk
of physics, huh?

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.630
Because in the end,
all that matters

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.088
is if the angle's all the same,
everything else cancels out

00:20:18.088 --> 00:20:20.146
and you just get a
bunch of constants.

00:20:20.146 --> 00:20:21.330
Let me jump back to there.

00:20:24.218 --> 00:20:26.510
So now we'll take another
look at our detector spectrum

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.880
and start identifying
some of these peaks.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.410
If you notice, this
0.238 MeV looks just

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.245
like what it does on the graph.

00:20:35.245 --> 00:20:37.120
This is the kind of cool
thing, like you guys

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.912
threw some bananas in
a detector last week.

00:20:38.912 --> 00:20:41.710
We got a spectrum
yesterday morning,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.270
and how well-timed it was.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.180
We're actually going to
start explaining it today.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.670
There's a whole lot more going
on in this banana spectrum.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.410
Part of what we'll be
explaining tomorrow

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:56.930
is, why do you get this kind of
bowl shape, this Compton bowl?

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.810
And it turns out that there's
a different probability

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.150
of scattering at
every different angle,

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.900
or what we call a
differential cross-section.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:12.410
A d theta over d omega.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.000
Because the probability
of that photon

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.480
scattering off in any
direction is not equal.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.890
But if you know what direction
the photon scatters off in,

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.903
you know what energy it has,
or you know what sort of energy

00:21:23.903 --> 00:21:25.570
it gives to the
electron, because that's

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.410
a one to one relation.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.530
And that's why you end
up with this very smooth,

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.390
almost cosine-ish
looking kind of curve.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.830
You guys will actually get
to derive that yourselves.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.590
So then onto the wavelength
and energy shift.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.740
By looking at the
electron recoil energy

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.690
and this wavelength
shift, from that

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.210
you can actually get some
sort of an energy shift.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:56.528
You can arrive at what is the
recoil energy of that electron.

00:21:56.528 --> 00:21:59.070
And so here's one of the topics
that's usually hard for folks

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.120
to understand, but I want
to stress it right now.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.490
When you send gamma
rays into a detector--

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.200
let's draw an
imaginary detector.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.220
In fact, let's draw the real
one that we used in our banana

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.110
counting experiment.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:24.710
So we had these copper walls,
we had our bag of bananas,

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:30.150
and we had our high
purity germanium detector.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.890
Let's say we had a
good shield on top,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.432
and then a good
shield on the bottom.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.240
That right there is
our active detector,

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.820
and this banana is sending off
gamma rays into that detector.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:48.370
The way a detector works is
not by counting the energy

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.930
of the gamma ray directly.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.910
It can't actually do that.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.870
In this germanium
detector you've

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.740
got a huge voltage
applied across it.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.200
I think what Mike
Ames actually said

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.300
was the one we used
was about 2000 volts.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.770
What happens here
is, let's say--

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.490
I'll actually need
three colors for this--

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.260
let's say a gamma ray comes in--

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.450
that's our gamma ray--

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.120
and interacts in the detector.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.265
That gamma ray will redshift--
let me get a redder color,

00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:25.790
because that'll be like
physically accurate--

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.280
that gamma ray is going
to hit an electron,

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:33.920
go off at a different angle,
and redshift, or get lower

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.300
in wavelength.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:42.530
Meanwhile, that electron that
it hit actually goes flying off

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:47.870
and in the other direction,
we're going to call it a hole.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.140
A defect missing one
electron of some sort

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.670
in this semiconductor.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.153
Normally if there was
no voltage applied here

00:23:55.153 --> 00:23:57.320
these two would just find
each other and annihilate,

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.730
and you would have nothing.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.320
So what's to count?

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.700
But by applying a
gigantic voltage,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.270
let's say this voltage
was really plus

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.430
and this voltage
was really minus,

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.400
this electron keeps on
moving and this hole

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.770
keeps on moving
to the electrode.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.240
Instead of recombining
in the detector,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:21.620
they're actually then
sent through where they're

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:27.710
counted in some sort of ammeter
or some sort of energy pulse

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:28.730
counter.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.590
And what we're
actually measuring

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.920
is the recoil spectrum
of the electrons

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.330
that the photons make.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.090
You're not directly
measuring photon energy,

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.060
you're measuring the
electron effects.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.270
Part of that is because
chances are photons

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.067
just go through everything.

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.900
This is why I wasn't
so worried this morning

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.650
standing with my face over a
10 millicurie cobalt source.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.150
Because while I was
getting billions

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.423
of gammas per second
flying through my brain,

00:24:55.423 --> 00:24:57.590
most of those billions just
flew out the other side.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.660
It's literally in one
ear, out the other.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.120
And so most of these gammas,
if they interact at all,

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.710
will escape again.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.390
The electrons, however,
because they're

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.960
charged and very low mass,
have a very low range

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.200
in the detector.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.630
So chances are
the electrons that

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.850
are made are going
to stay there,

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.760
unless you happen to make
one, like, right here

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.300
at that surface few
atoms, and it escapes.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.160
That almost never happens.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.030
So forget that.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.530
This was, last year, a
huge source of confusion

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.630
to say, why are we seeing
some of the other peaks

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.700
that I'll be explaining
in five or 10 minutes?

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:41.280
Or, why aren't we
seeing a 0.238 MeV peak?

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.110
Because what you're seeing
here is a photon losing

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.800
it's energy minus 0.238
MeV in its maximum energy

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.550
transfer, which is
given to that electron.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.860
Then what actually happens
next is this electron slams

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.360
into a bunch of
other ones, and that

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.470
slams into a bunch of other
ones until all the energy

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.780
is lost in the detector.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:11.080
And all of those electrons
get sucked into the electrode

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.000
by this very high voltage.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.870
And then, the way you count
the energy of an interaction

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.390
is by how many electrons you
get in a certain little amount

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.720
of time.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.590
And so that's why, for
example, for the photo peak,

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.560
that's the kind of
simplest reaction.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.810
A gamma goes in, a really
high electron comes out,

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:32.260
it smashes into tons of
other electrons imparting

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.840
all of its kinetic energy
in the detector, which

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.000
is all summed up
in a nanosecond,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.190
or however long we collect for.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.630
And then we say that we saw
an energy blip containing

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:47.350
about 1,460 KeV of energy.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.467
It all came from
that first gamma.

00:26:49.467 --> 00:26:51.550
And then it was all given
to that first photo peak

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:54.353
electron, which then slammed
into a whole bunch of others.

00:26:54.353 --> 00:26:56.020
And they slammed into
a bunch of others.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.410
And there's this what's called
this ionization cascade, where

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:02.080
a whole bunch of electrons
make a whole bunch more

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.200
until all of them
have too little energy

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.720
to ionize anything else.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.810
And then they're just collected.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.590
So that's what we mean
by a pulse in a detector.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.840
It's not exactly an
intuitive concept,

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.782
because it's not like
the gamma goes in

00:27:16.782 --> 00:27:17.990
and we just count its energy.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.790
There's more things that
physically happen in here.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.480
But it's important
for you guys to know,

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.030
especially when we start
to look at pair production.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.280
You guys remember some of
this stuff from the positron

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.570
annihilation spectroscopy?

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:35.380
Well, the way we actually know
that positron annihilation

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.370
spectroscopy, or PAS,
works is by measuring

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:42.630
photons, or their
eventual electron recoil,

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.710
that can only be possible
from this process.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.730
So as a quick review, let's
say you had a positron source,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:53.440
like sodium-22, which naturally
undergoes radioactive decay,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.160
and forms a positron
along with a gamma

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.790
ray from a very short
isometric transition, or IT.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:04.150
Then that positron bounces
around in the material

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.060
until it reaches an electron.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.570
And once it hits that electron,
because the positron--

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.980
let's see, the rest mass
of the positron is the same

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:22.730
as the rest mass of the
electron, which is 0.511 MeV--

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.350
once the two of
these combine, they

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:32.480
annihilate, producing two
511 KeV or 0.511 MeV photons.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.470
And it's those photons at
this exact energy all the time

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.850
that really give it away.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.680
Because there's not
many other processes

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:46.360
that produce a huge amount
of exactly that photon.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.180
Now that we've talked a little
bit about momentum and energy

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.640
conservation, does
anybody know why

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.920
you get what's called a
blueshift or a redshift

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.291
in positron annihilation
spectroscopy?

00:28:59.365 --> 00:29:00.240
I'll give you a hint.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.920
It goes down to
conserving the same thing

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.170
that we're doing all the time.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.586
Yeah, Kristen?

00:29:04.586 --> 00:29:06.558
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say, is that something

00:29:06.558 --> 00:29:08.833
to do with wavelengths?

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:10.000
MICHAEL SHORT: You're close.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.650
I mean, technically
you're close,

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.920
if you treat electrons as
waves, which you totally can.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.670
The electrons themselves
do have a non-zero momentum

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:23.390
as they're flying about in the
atom or around the nucleus.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.920
And when a electron
collides with a positron,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.710
if that electron already
has some momentum associated

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.040
with it, then the cell system
of mass is not at rest.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.740
It's moving at some small speed.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.520
So this little minus delta
energy and plus delta energy

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.580
accounts for the initial
momentum of the electron, which

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.920
means not only can you
tell from the lifetime

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.910
how many electron looking
defects there are, but you can

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.570
probe electron momentum by
looking at the slight energy

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:56.440
changes as positrons
collide with electrons.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.600
It's a really cool
and powerful technique

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.080
that uses only 22.01
concepts to probe matter

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.250
at its deepest level.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.640
So what's happening on
the atomic scale is,

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.630
let's say a photon
made a positron,

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:14.260
and the positron bounces about
what's called thermalizes,

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.510
or just slows down
via collisions,

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.570
via other types of collisions
that we'll go into soon,

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.540
and then gets trapped in a
defect, which is a relatively

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.800
electron-poor place.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.360
But it doesn't mean there's
no electrons, In every space

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.130
everywhere, there's
a probability

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:31.590
that there's an electron there.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.310
In a defect not
containing an atom

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.290
that probability is
lower, but not zero.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.170
And so by figuring out
how long they last,

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.690
and when those 511 KeV
gammas are emitted,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.890
you can tell, let's say,
what size defect that was.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.170
But now let's talk about
what happens to these 511 KeV

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.800
gammas.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.860
What evidence do we have
that positron pair production

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.152
actually exists?

00:30:56.152 --> 00:30:57.860
So before I reveal
the labels, can anyone

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.980
tell me what on
this graph suggests

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.150
that positrons are happening?

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.280
And there's actually two things.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.030
What do you think?

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.366
Yeah.

00:31:13.366 --> 00:31:14.793
AUDIENCE: There's
a peak 511 KeV.

00:31:14.793 --> 00:31:15.960
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.835
That's exactly right.

00:31:16.835 --> 00:31:24.980
There's a peak at 511 KeV
that if I trace that up,

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.680
I went one over.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.740
Yeah, right there.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.370
511 KeV.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.210
Is it exactly 511 KeV?

00:31:33.862 --> 00:31:34.820
What do you guys think?

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.210
So forget the fact that
it came from a positron,

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:47.570
let's say a 511 KeV
gamma came in somewhere.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:52.300
How would it then release
electrons to be counted?

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.180
It then undergoes
photoelectric emission.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.730
So the actual
energy of this would

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:01.518
be 511 KeV minus the work
function of the material.

00:32:01.518 --> 00:32:03.060
This is one of those
tricky questions

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.950
that you might not even
see it on the spectrum,

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.920
but I want you to physically
understand what happens here.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.600
It's not like 511 KeV
positron photons magically

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.550
get counted at 511 KeV.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:18.720
They then have to eject
an electron, somehow.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.870
And for those electrons
to be counted,

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.570
they have to interact in
exactly the same way as all

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:25.510
the other electrons.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.910
There's no difference.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:28.530
What else?

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:29.030
Oh, yeah.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.130
Luke, you have a question?

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.550
LUKE: So, from the banana.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:37.690
Is a gamma ray coming from a
banana, and then that gamma

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.120
undergoes pair production?

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.700
And then the gamma from
the pair production--

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.930
I guess, where are the
gammas coming from?

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.930
MICHAEL SHORT: That was
my next question to you.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.300
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.800
We'll start off with gammas
being emitted in all directions

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.810
from our bag of banana ashes.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.930
Now the question is,
where do these 511 KeV

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.790
photons come from?

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:07.480
If the gamma ray interacts
with the detector

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.322
by any mechanism
including pair production,

00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:12.280
what are the possible
things that could happen?

00:33:14.873 --> 00:33:16.290
There's three
different scenarios.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:24.810
Let's pick a 511 KeV color.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:28.950
Well first of all, it might
just undergo pair production.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.690
And it'll release
two 511 KeV gammas.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.735
Let's see, those are
our 511 KeV gammas.

00:33:37.735 --> 00:33:40.110
And because they're gammas,
and they interact with almost

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.890
nothing, they can get out.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.400
So you might end up--

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.250
your energy that you
detect in the detector

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:53.710
might be the energy of your
gamma ray minus 2 times

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.930
511 MeV.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.880
This is what we refer
to as double escape.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.010
Close the quotes like that.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:13.350
So if this gamma ray right
here came in at 1,460 KeV,

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.320
and the double escape peak--
if it undergoes pair production

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.469
in the detector and both of
those 511s elevens escape,

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.030
because a lot of them do--

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.850
where would you expect
there to be a double escape

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.710
peak on this spectrum?

00:34:29.698 --> 00:34:34.247
AUDIENCE: Add that minus 11.022.

00:34:34.247 --> 00:34:35.080
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.880
Let's say, add that minus--

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.730
so we're at 1,460 minus 1.022.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:43.420
That comes out to about 450 KeV.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:49.659
450 KeV right here, not
much going on, is there?

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.620
You're not going to see
it in every detector.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.389
Especially the larger
the detector is,

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:59.490
the less likely both of those
photons are going to escape.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.190
So this is where the
concept of detector size

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.020
can tell you whether
or not you're

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.030
going to see every peak
that's physically happening.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.300
So in this case, the germanium
detector is pretty big,

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.830
it's pretty expensive.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:14.550
So chances are a lot
of those 511 KeVs,

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:18.520
even though they're produced
in pairs, one of them

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.080
didn't quite get out.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.870
Yeah, Luke?

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:25.300
LUKE: So, the gamma from the
banana goes into the detector.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.500
And then it produces
pairs, and then

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.633
those pairs are annihilated,
and that produces the vibration.

00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:31.800
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.330
That's right, why don't we
write that down in steps

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.315
for, let's call this pair
production in the detector.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:52.280
So step one would
be gamma emission.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:57.185
Step two would be
electron-positron creation.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.810
Step three would
be annihilation.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:11.330
Annihilation in the detector.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.590
And then step four would
be somewhere between zero

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:24.990
to two photons escape.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.010
So we have, actually,
three scenarios

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:36.880
that could happen here for pair
production inside the detector.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.590
One of them we just described.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.390
Where pair production
happens, you

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.550
get annihilation in a
very short time frame,

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.850
like tens of picoseconds
or hundreds of picoseconds.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.830
Both the gammas get out.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.620
That would have
produced a 460 KeV

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.320
peak, which it might be there.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.540
But I can't tell if that's
a peak or if that's noise.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.773
So we don't really know.

00:36:56.773 --> 00:36:58.690
And chances are, the
reason that didn't happen

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.080
is because the detector was big.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.130
So our next possibility.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:06.600
What if one of those photons
gets out and one of them

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.560
doesn't?

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.290
It then interacts via
Compton scattering,

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.970
or photoelectric effect, or
any of the possible mechanisms.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.300
Then you'll end up
with an energy counted

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:24.263
equal to energy of the
gamma minus only one

00:37:24.263 --> 00:37:25.430
of those things getting out.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:26.750
And we call that single escape.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.930
At what energy would that
single escape peak be?

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.846
Oh.

00:37:39.846 --> 00:37:41.100
AUDIENCE: 511?

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.270
MICHAEL SHORT: It would be--

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:48.330
that peak would be at the energy
the gamma 1,460, minus 511 KeV.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.240
So roughly 900 KeV or so.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.820
There we go, there it is.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.320
That's the second
bit of evidence

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.480
that there is pair
production going on.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.990
Not only do you have a peak
at 511 KeV, which we have not

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.930
explained yet, but you also
have the single escape peak,

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.010
which is the energy of
your gamma minus one

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:14.900
escape from a 511 KeV photon.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.400
Yeah?

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.940
LUKE: When you mean
escape, do you mean escapes

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.770
through the detector,
or what is that?

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:19.562
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:38:19.562 --> 00:38:22.040
I mean-- when I escape, I
mean it escapes the detector

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.660
and is no longer counted.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.400
So it might go and
drop somewhere else,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.340
but your detector
doesn't know it.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.860
So what's the third
scenario that could happen?

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.370
What if zero of
these photons escape?

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.773
What energy will you count?

00:38:36.773 --> 00:38:37.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.678
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:38:38.678 --> 00:38:40.220
So all that's going
to happen is it's

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.390
going to look like the
photoelectric effect.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.982
In reality, you'll have
slightly, slightly lower

00:38:45.982 --> 00:38:47.440
energy, because
you have three work

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.380
functions to subtract off from
the three photons doing stuff.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.270
But I would count
that as correct.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.700
It's going to look just like
the photoelectric effect.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:59.710
First, you get that
energy minus 1.022 MeV.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.500
And then both of
those 511 KeV photons

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.710
interact in the
detector by, probably,

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.330
photoelectric emission.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:12.930
And you just get another count
at this channel, right here.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.660
Now the last question
I want to ask you guys,

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.060
where did this peak come from?

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.490
Under what circumstance
would the detector just

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:21.795
count 511 KeV?

00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:31.760
I'll give you a hint.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.818
There's a reason I drew gammas
going off in every direction.

00:39:36.818 --> 00:39:39.177
AUDIENCE: So they
don't hit the detector.

00:39:39.177 --> 00:39:40.010
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.170
So most of the gammas
don't hit the detector.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:47.380
But let's say you had a gamma
that went into anything else,

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:51.606
like the copper shielding, and
it underwent pair production.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.040
And one of those gammas made
it through the detector.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.070
I'm sorry, one of those photons
made it through the detector.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.800
That's actually where these
things are coming from.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.600
Because most of
those gammas are not

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.400
heading towards the detector.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.000
This is a very
small, solid angle.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.720
But surrounding the
rest of the detector

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.690
is this really dense copper,
and these high energy gammas

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.960
in this relatively
high Z material

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.910
undergoes a lot of
pair production,

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:26.860
so it's firing out 511 KeV
photons in all directions.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.780
And some of those
enter the detector

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.370
when nothing else
enters the detector.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:36.190
And that's why you get this
511 KeV peak right here.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.530
So we haven't explained
every peak on this graph.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:44.700
Does anybody have
any ideas where--

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.510
what's that about?

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.170
Or that?

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:47.785
Or those?

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.380
AUDIENCE: Cosmic radiation?

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.852
Could be cosmic rays.

00:40:56.852 --> 00:40:58.310
That's probably
what's contributing

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.620
to a lot of the noise,
here, as well as

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.720
thermal noise in the detector.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.350
But what else haven't
we accounted for?

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.770
Now, to bring this a
little more into reality,

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.690
we ran an experiment
where we burned bananas.

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:11.540
We didn't put a potassium-40
certified source in.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.400
We put bananas in.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.198
What else could be going on?

00:41:16.198 --> 00:41:17.840
AUDIENCE: Other isotopes?

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.090
MICHAEL SHORT: Other isotopes.

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:20.290
That's right.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.110
But you can identify
them quite easily, one,

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.140
by checking to see where
you expect the photo peak.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.350
So just from the
decay diagram, you'll

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.800
expect to see some interactions
or photoelectric effect

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.650
interactions, at these
transition levels.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.020
Luckily, you know they're
not due to potassium,

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:42.060
because potassium has
only got one of them.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.630
In addition, you should see
some very similar features.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.230
So if you have a
photo peak here,

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:52.932
you would expect to see another
Compton edge 0.238 MeV away--

00:41:52.932 --> 00:41:54.890
and it's kind of hard to
tell if it's going on,

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.060
because that's a rather
weak photo peak--

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.850
and you would expect, then,
for the high energy gamma rays

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:04.300
to see another single escape
peak-- maybe right there--

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:09.840
and add to the 511 KeV peak,
because those are all the same.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.710
So when you take the
spectrum of a real thing,

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.650
and you have to deconvolute
it, or take it apart

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.200
in terms of its
constituent interactions,

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.527
it's important to know what all
these possible interactions are

00:42:22.527 --> 00:42:24.610
so that you can take them
apart and say, start off

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.560
with a photo peak,
which should tell you

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.150
what elements are there.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:30.430
And then you can subtract
off the expected amount

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.680
of Compton scattering,
the expected

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.050
amount of single
escape peak, and then

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:38.321
see what's left over, what other
isotopes may there be that you

00:42:38.321 --> 00:42:39.404
haven't accounted for yet.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:47.040
The last thing I want us to
try, as a mental exercise,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.910
is to draw two spectra.

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.200
Let's say, this will be
energy versus intensity.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.110
And for this I want you
to imagine that, at first,

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.383
your detector is very small.

00:43:02.383 --> 00:43:04.550
And then I want you to
imagine that your detector is

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.860
very large.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:10.100
And I'm going to keep
this visible so you can

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.840
have this as a mental model.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.670
If we had just one
isotope, potassium-40,

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.380
what do you think
the spectra would

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.140
look like for an
extremely small detector

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.910
and for an extremely
large detector?

00:43:26.535 --> 00:43:27.410
So where do we start?

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:33.003
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:33.003 --> 00:43:34.170
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:36.270
And will there be any
difference between the two?

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.040
Probably not.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.040
So small detector,
maybe a large detector

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.330
is going to have a
larger intensity.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.830
But for the same
type of detector,

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:51.930
you're going to have
pretty much the same thing.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:52.590
What's next?

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:57.870
AUDIENCE: Compton edge?

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:59.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Compton edge.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.480
So there's going
to be some energy

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.430
that Compton scattering
is going to start out,

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:07.290
and then it's going
to proceed up, thusly.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.235
Is there going to be any real
effect of the detector size?

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:18.190
Probably not, because as soon
as you release that Compton

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:21.380
electron, that electron slams
into all the other ones,

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.100
and nanometers or
microns of material,

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.200
and all the energy is collected.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.728
What's the real
difference going to be?

00:44:29.728 --> 00:44:31.073
AUDIENCE: The 511 peak?

00:44:31.073 --> 00:44:32.240
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.660
So the 511 peak, and the
other associated ones.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.690
So for a really,
really small detector

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.550
we have the possibility
for a double escape

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:44.780
peak, a single escape peak,
and just more photo peak.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.180
What's the most likely scenario?

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.180
AUDIENCE: Double escape?

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.670
MICHAEL SHORT: Double escape.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:55.570
So if we go down here, let's
say if this difference is

00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:02.470
1.022 to MeV, you would expect
a larger double escape peak.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:07.050
And what would you expect
your single escape peak to be?

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:08.020
AUDIENCE: Smaller?

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.562
MICHAEL SHORT:
Significantly smaller.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:17.300
So let's say this difference
right here is 511 KeV.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.075
How about for a large detector?

00:45:20.075 --> 00:45:21.500
AUDIENCE: Opposite.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.950
MICHAEL SHORT:
Quite the opposite.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.490
You might expect a tiny
or even nonexistent

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:29.320
double escape peak, maybe a
larger single escape peak.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.510
But most of the time
you're just going

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.810
to add on to your photo peak,
depending on the resolution

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.370
of the detector.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:39.070
Because in this case,
for a small detector,

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.160
if you have an interaction
inside that volume chances are

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.510
most of those 511s get out.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.010
For a large
detector, chances are

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.760
most of them stay in and undergo
their own Compton scattering,

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.810
or photo peak reactions.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:55.340
So let's say that all
these detectors will also

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.910
have a 511 KeV.

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:00.140
We'll just mark that off.

00:46:05.108 --> 00:46:06.650
Let's just give them
the same height.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:14.320
What else are we missing,
if this is an ideal scenario

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.040
with no noise?

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:29.060
Well what are those five-- what
can those 511 KeV photons do?

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.680
Can they make pair
production of their own?

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.180
No.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.770
They're not high enough energy.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.840
In fact, they're half
the required energy.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.160
Can they undergo
photoelectric effect?

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:46.690
Sure.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.180
That's probably where
we're getting those 511s.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:53.210
Can they undergo
Compton scattering?

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.320
Why not?

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.980
There's no minimum
energy to scatter.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:04.670
So what you're going to end up
with, then, is 238 KeV away.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:07.100
You should have
another little Compton

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:15.410
edge at a distance of 238
KeV away from the 511 KeV.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.330
Now in reality, you
probably won't see it

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.080
because you're going
to have other X-rays,

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.455
you'll have
bremsstrahlung, which

00:47:21.455 --> 00:47:23.990
we'll talk about tomorrow, which
is that breaking radiation.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:25.870
You'll have
background radiation.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.100
And it might be hard to
see, but technically it

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.880
should be there, because
any photon of any energy

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.830
is going to have that same
sort of Compton edge shape.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.450
The shape changes
just a little bit,

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:39.190
depending on the
energy of the photon,

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.940
but you're always
going to have an edge.

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.940
You're always going to
have some sort of a bowl.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.190
Just how big the edge
is compared to the bowl,

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.350
well, we'll get
to that tomorrow.

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.318
So it's a little
after 5 of 5 of.

00:47:50.318 --> 00:47:51.860
I think this is a
good place to stop,

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.670
because it's the full conceptual
explanation of the ways

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.770
that photons can
interact with matter.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.530
So I want to ask you guys if
you have any questions based

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:03.070
on what we've done today?

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:03.660
Yep?

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.168
AUDIENCE: So 511 KeV's
the rest mass of electron?

00:48:06.168 --> 00:48:06.960
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.418
AUDIENCE: So that's
just the energy

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:10.983
you assume it has when
you have pair production?

00:48:10.983 --> 00:48:12.150
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.580
So the electron and the
positron annihilate,

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.620
turning their mass into energy.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.530
Since the rest mass of
each of those is 511 KeV,

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.512
the photons come off at 511 KeV.

00:48:21.512 --> 00:48:22.054
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:22.054 --> 00:48:22.685
Got it.

00:48:22.685 --> 00:48:23.477
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep?

00:48:23.477 --> 00:48:24.938
AUDIENCE: So when you say
the electron and the positron

00:48:24.938 --> 00:48:27.373
annihilate, is the
positron just a hole?

00:48:27.373 --> 00:48:28.890
MICHAEL SHORT:
Ah, good question.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.810
The positron is not a hole.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.690
So like here, we were talking
about an electron hole pair.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.550
A hole would be, let's say, an
atom with a missing electron.

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.570
A positron is a particle
itself of antimatter

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.360
that has the same mass,
but the opposite charge,

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.300
as the electron.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.610
And so every particle's got
its antimatter component,

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.820
like there are antiprotons
and antineutrons, that if they

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:55.610
find their regular matter
selves, do annihilate.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.290
Yeah?

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:59.810
AUDIENCE: If the detector
doesn't pick up gamma rays

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.500
directly, how do you measure--

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:05.143
like, why would a small
detector see double escape?

00:49:05.143 --> 00:49:06.560
MICHAEL SHORT: So
a small detector

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.870
would see double escape,
because at first--

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:12.980
let's say a gamma ray interacts
and undergoes pair production.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.190
And so it's going
to, let's say, create

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:18.067
an electron-positron pair.

00:49:18.067 --> 00:49:20.400
And it's going to give them
a whole lot of extra energy.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.560
So they're going to knock
around and ionize things.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.780
And that's going to
count up to the energy

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.000
of the gamma minus MeV.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.830
Then, when they
annihilate, if it's

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:34.067
a small detector chances are
those gammas just get out.

00:49:34.067 --> 00:49:35.650
We're going to be
going over why soon,

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:38.290
when we get into mass
attenuation coefficients,

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:41.278
or cross sections or
interaction probabilities.

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:42.820
But as the energy
of a gamma goes up,

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.100
it's interaction
probability goes way down.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.970
And this is a fairly
high energy photon,

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:51.310
compared to, like,
the easier KeV X-rays

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:52.870
that you tend to see.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:57.040
So chances are, these photons
get made from annihilation,

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.803
but they don't stay
in the detector.

00:49:58.803 --> 00:50:00.970
Then the bigger the detector
is, the more mass there

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:04.360
is in the way, and more
likely they get counted.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.370
But all of this happens,
well, at the speed of light.

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:09.740
At least the photon part.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.130
And so it's so fast that
the detector picks it up

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:16.250
as that sum of all the different
processes of energy in one time

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:16.750
interval.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:24.320
Like I said, this is the harder
stuff, because it's not direct.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.868
It's a multi-step process
with different possibilities.

00:50:27.868 --> 00:50:30.410
But it's important to know where
the single and double escape

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.810
come from, where
the 511s come from,

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.902
which is outside the detector.

00:50:34.902 --> 00:50:36.100
Yes, have a question?

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:36.683
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:36.683 --> 00:50:39.070
Would you say the detector
can-- the detector

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.590
itself can measure the
energy of a photon?

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:44.430
Is the measurement of 511
KeV, is that due to the fact

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:48.320
that it will hit an electron and
cause the-- what is it called?

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.060
MICHAEL SHORT: Like
ionization cascade?

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.220
Exactly.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.030
Yeah so if a 511 KeV
photon enters the detector,

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:58.600
the detector does not know
until an electron interaction

00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.830
happens.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:02.530
So most of the photons
that enter this detector

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:04.150
leave the detector.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.870
That's why if you actually look
at the banana stuff, which I'll

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:18.200
pull up right now,
at the efficiency,

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.170
check out those values, there.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.070
Efficiency is in the realm
of 10 to the minus 4 or 10

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:28.000
to the minus 3, which is to
say that out of every 1,000

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.140
or 10,000 photons that enter
the detector, one of them

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.150
undergoes an
electron interaction

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:37.990
and the other 9,999 just
goes screaming on through,

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.310
and the detector does not
know that they're there.

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.340
The way that Mike Ames
got these efficiencies is

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.320
by putting a source
of known activity

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.990
in, calculating how
many gammas the detector

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:52.140
should have picked
up, and taking that

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.520
divided by the number that
it actually picked up.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.230
And so that way, you know how
many gammas really went in,

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.180
and how many gammas it saw.

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.580
And that's how you get
the detector efficiency.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.070
And you will have to
account for this when you do

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.280
this on the homework problem.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.072
So the only quantities
you're going to need

00:52:08.072 --> 00:52:11.280
is how many gammas that you
get, what's the efficiency,

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.520
and then back that out.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:16.340
So you'll have to calculate
the activity of the bananas,

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.070
and then figure out how much
a banana weighs, and then you

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.440
should be able to calculate
the radioactivity of one

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.800
banana in curies, or
becquerels, or microcuries.

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.840
It's all good.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.850
So good question.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:33.330
So it's three of, so I'm
going to let you guys go.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:34.890
But I'll see you again
tomorrow, and we'll review

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.015
a little bit of this stuff.

00:52:36.015 --> 00:52:38.430
And we'll get into more of
the math of the cross sections

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:41.580
and why Compton scattering
and pair production take up

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.820
the energies that they do.

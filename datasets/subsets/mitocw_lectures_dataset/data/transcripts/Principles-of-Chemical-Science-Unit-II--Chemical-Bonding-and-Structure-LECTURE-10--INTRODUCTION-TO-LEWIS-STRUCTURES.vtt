CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Lewis structures.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.080
So I tell students who have sort
of no background in chemistry

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.610
before they come
into this class,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.050
and there always are some, that
there are some topics in 5.111

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.960
that having no
experience with the topic

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.210
is actually a good thing,
and Lewis structures is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.459
one of these things.

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:48.750
I think if you've seen it
before, you're like, oh yeah,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.530
that's easy.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.640
I know how to do that.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.800
You don't practice
and you get on an exam

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.910
and you're like,
oh wait a minute.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.090
I forgot how to do this.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.980
And the students who
haven't seen it before

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.490
know all the rules and just
get brilliant, perfect scores

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.120
on the exam.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.640
And the other students
are like, man.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.530
I forgot how to do
my Lewis structures.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.190
So here are Lewis structures.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.990
We're going to go over them.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.300
So I really like
Lewis structures

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.440
because they're relatively
simple, and they work.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.520
Like 90% of the time, they
are the correct structure.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.540
And I'm a big fan of
simple things working.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.810
If you wanted to get
from 90% to 100%,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.480
you'd have to use
Schrodinger's equation,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.380
but you can get 90% just with
the simple Lewis structures

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.620
I'm a big fan of that.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.590
I love it when simple things
really work pretty well.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.230
OK.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.000
So when Lewis structures
the key to this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.950
is thinking about the electrons
being shared so that you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.790
get a full valence shell.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.620
And having the electrons
distributed in such a way

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.880
that all of the atoms have
the number of electrons

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.250
that make them happy,
which is usually

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.970
eight electrons, which is
an octet, that noble gas

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.400
configuration.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.860
So every dot in
a Lewis structure

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.220
represents a valence electron.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.010
And we can then
look at some atoms

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.220
and put dots around them
to indicate the number

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.810
of valence electrons.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.220
So we also have to know how many
valence electrons atoms have.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.720
And so why didn't
you just practice

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.106
with a clicker question.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.620
And here's part of the periodic
table up here if you need it.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.610
All right.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.970
I'm told 10 seconds.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.610
Everyone was crazy fast.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.820
Yes.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.760
So seven is the correct answer.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.800
You could look at
the periodic table

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.790
and sometimes with these
it's a counting thing.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.680
So this is one where you
want to always double check

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.480
if things don't make sense.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.290
All right.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.550
So we can put seven
electrons around fluorine,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.530
and we'll have two
fluorines here.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.649
They'll both have seven
electrons around them.

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:43.440
And now I'm going to
jump to another slide,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.870
but I'm going to show you
the seven again in case

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.207
you haven't written them down.

00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:49.290
If you don't want to,
they're not in your handout,

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.860
but that's probably OK.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.390
So when you bring
them together, you

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.290
can bring them together in such
a way that they can all share.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.940
And so if we put in green, then,
one of the fluorine's seven.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.450
And then we put in blue
the other fluorine's seven,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.880
you can see that they can
share two in the middle

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.680
and both are very, very happy.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.870
So just thinking about
this really simple idea,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.579
how many electrons will give you
an octet, will give you eight?

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.340
And how can you
put things together

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.370
in such a way that allows
for that to happen?

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.010
Now there are a
few elements that

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.930
do not want eight in
their valence shell,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.280
and hydrogen is one of them.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.800
It just has that
one S. So it only

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.230
wants two, that's
all it can handle.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.050
So this is an
exception, hydrogen

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.940
is going to want two electrons.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.070
Hydrogen loves to interact
with things, though.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.320
It interacts with lots
and lots of things.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.950
And here hydrogen with
its one valence electron

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.220
is interacting with
chlorine with its seven

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.720
valence electrons, and they are
sharing two electrons forming

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.410
a bond together.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.690
So when we're talking
about Lewis structures,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.590
we're talking about
different kinds of electrons.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.820
So we're talking about bonding
electrons, the electrons that

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.640
are involved in the bond,
and also lone pair electrons.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.240
So chloride in HCl is going
to have two bonding electrons,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.650
one was its, and one
came from hydrogen.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.450
And it's also going to have
six lone pair electrons,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.490
or we could say
three lone pairs.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.670
So when we say a lone pair, that
indicates two electrons there.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.160
So it has one, two, three,
four, five, six or one pair,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.980
two pairs, three pairs.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.850
Now there are rules
to Lewis structures,

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.830
and here is the complete rule.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.200
In your handout, this
wouldn't fit on one page.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.050
It's on two pages.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.140
And these rules, if you
do work these problems,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.140
you will remember these rules,
and they become pretty easy.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.050
But it's important to work
Lewis structure problems

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.070
so that the rules become
really familiar to you.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.660
And it takes time to work
Lewis structure problems,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.110
so don't wait to the last minute
to start this problem set.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.124
There's a lot of Lewis
structure problems on it,

00:06:24.124 --> 00:06:25.790
which means it's not
difficult, but it's

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.421
going to take some time.

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:27.920
All right.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.070
So let's briefly go
over these rules.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.790
First what you want to do is
draw in the skeleton structure.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.880
Just put the atoms down.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.200
Hydrogen and fluorine are always
going to be terminal atoms.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.210
Don't put them in the
middle of a molecule.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.880
That gets chemistry
professors really upset

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.130
to see hydrogen in the
middle with lots of bonds

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.950
to things, so don't do it.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.580
And typically the element with
the lowest ionization energy

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.070
goes in the middle, and
there are some exceptions

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.720
and we'll see some
of those exceptions.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.440
But that should be
your first guess.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.180
You want to count the
number of valence electrons.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.200
If there's a negative charge,
you need to count that in

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.900
or if there's a positive charge
you need to subtract that

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.246
from the total.

00:07:13.246 --> 00:07:15.620
Then you want to figure out
the total number of electrons

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.070
needed, so everyone has
their full valence shell.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.570
You need to subtract these two
to get the number of bonding

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.350
electrons.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.210
And here are some of
the things that it's

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.360
really easy to make
math mistakes here,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.550
so if your structure makes
zero sense at the end,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.670
go back and check your math.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.100
Assign to bonding
electrons to each bond.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.350
If any remain, you
want to think about

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.320
whether you have
double or triple bonds.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.900
And there's only certain
kinds of atoms that can

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.530
have double and triple bonds.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.110
So be careful where
you're putting

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.600
your double and triple bonds.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.020
If any valence electrons
remain, those are loan pairs.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.750
And then lastly, you want to
figure out the formal charge

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.862
on all of the atoms in
your structure to make sure

00:07:59.862 --> 00:08:01.820
that this is a valid
structure, and we're going

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.900
to talk about formal charge.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.260
So first, let's
just try an example.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.700
And your sheet has two
examples on the same page.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.060
We have HCN and we
also have CN minus.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.949
So we're going to do HCN first,
so don't fill your entire page

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:19.490
because you're going
to have to write

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.920
things for CN minus as well.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.520
But before we start, we need to
figure out which atom is likely

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.660
going to be in the middle.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.960
And so why don't
you tell me what you

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.240
think on the clicker question.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.813
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.060
Yup.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.080
So here again we want to have
one that has a lower ionization

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.780
energy, and you also want
to consider other things

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.610
like hydrogen can't
be in the middle.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.160
OK.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.243
And it was written that
way, but sometimes they're

00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:42.290
written in a way that is
not as straightforward.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.790
OK.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.225
So I'll put that up.

00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:48.850
All right so we'll
go through the rules

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.630
and we'll try to work this out.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.522
So first I can write--
I'm going to start--

00:09:53.522 --> 00:09:55.930
I guess I'll write over here.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.790
So number one, we're just
going to write HCN with C

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.740
in the middle.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.780
So that's the first
thing we're going to do.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.630
Next we're going to consider
the valence electrons.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.060
And you can just help me
out by yelling things out.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.370
How many valence electrons
does hydrogen have?

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.780
AUDIENCE: One.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.820
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
What about carbon?

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.000
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.166
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Nitrogen?

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:18.850
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.950
CATHERINE DRENNAN: And you can
always check me on my math.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.166
How much does that equal?

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:23.040
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.248
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Excellent.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.690
There's nothing like
adding simple numbers

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:33.310
in front of 350 people to really
put the stress in one's day.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.420
OK, so to have a complete
full valence shell, what

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.447
do I need for hydrogen?

00:10:38.447 --> 00:10:39.149
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:40.690
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
What about carbon?

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.480
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.630
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Eight to be complete.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.170
Nitrogen?

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.940
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.572
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Eight.

00:10:47.572 --> 00:10:50.000
And I think we add this
up, we should get 18.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.360
How's that?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.180
All right.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.250
So for four, now we're going
to subtract these numbers

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.060
from each other to tell us how
many bonding electrons we have.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.090
So we have 18 minus 10.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.780
And we should have eight
to bonding electrons.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:13.820
For five I'm going to
now assign two per bond.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.030
So I'm going to put one here.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.560
Another here.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.220
Another here.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.030
Another here.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.790
So I've assigned two per bond.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.210
And now I see if
I have any left.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.245
Do I have some left?

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.060
I've used four, I had eight.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.500
So yes, I have four more.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.170
And if you have more
bonding electrons,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.120
then you are supposed to
assign those bonding electrons.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.620
And think about
whether it's allowed

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.040
to have double or triple bonds.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.830
Can hydrogen be involved
in the double bond?

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.760
No.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.480
Carbon nitrogen?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.182
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:53.182 --> 00:11:54.890
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Yes, or a triple bond.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.650
So I have four
more, so I'm going

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.670
to put one, two, three, four.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.650
So I'm going to
have a triple bond

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.970
between my carbon and my
nitrogen. And now I'm good.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:12.010
So now I want to see do I
have any extra electrons.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:19.210
So for this, I had 10, I used
eight, so I have two left.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.950
So I'm going to assign
those two as a lone pair.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.050
Should I put them on hydrogen?

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.591
What about carbon?

00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:28.090
No.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.500
Carbon already has its eight,
because it has four bonds.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:38.350
So then I'm going to
put it on nitrogen.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.040
And then the only thing
left is formal charge, which

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.210
we haven't talked about yet.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.270
So before we do
formal charge, I just

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.460
want to do the same
thing with CN minus.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.960
And I will say if
you want to draw

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.700
triple bonds, that's fine too.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.780
You don't have to indicate
the dots as bonds.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.120
It's perfectly fine to
write out a triple bond.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.977
So I could have
written this as well.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.550
OK, so let's look at CN minus.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:23.540
So how many valence electrons
does carbon have again?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.200
Four.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.930
Nitrogen?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:26.640
Five.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.680
Am I done?

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.400
AUDIENCE: No.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.316
CATHERINE DRENNAN: No.

00:13:29.316 --> 00:13:30.860
I need to add one
because there's

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.950
a charge on this
molecule of minus one.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:42.130
So now so I have 10 again.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.050
Three I'm going to
figure out how many

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.350
electrons I need to
complete my valence shell.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.768
How many from carbon?

00:13:50.768 --> 00:13:51.700
AUDIENCE: Eight.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.741
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Eight.

00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:54.140
Nitrogen?

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.730
Eight so now I have 16.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.720
I will subtract.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:08.480
Now 10 from 16 and get
six bonding electrons.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.410
And I'm going to assign
first just two of them.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.020
So I'll assign one, two here.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.990
And then we-- this is to assign.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.960
Six said, do you
have any left over?

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:28.160
I had six, and I only used
two, so the answer is yes.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.770
I have four more.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.820
So I can put those in
one, two, three, four.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.030
Again, we're going to
have a triple bond.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.510
And then we ask are
there any electrons left?

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.770
So we had 10, we
used six of them.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:52.230
And so we're going to
have now four more here.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.460
So now I can assign--
this only has-- this

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.480
is not complete for carbon.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.690
So I can put a lone
pair on carbon,

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.060
and I can put a lone
pair on nitrogen.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.630
And now they have
their complete octet.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.880
And we get to assign
formal charge.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.360
So I could write it this way,
or I could have written it

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.786
with a triple bond here.

00:15:16.786 --> 00:15:20.850
And don't forget to put
the charge on the end.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.560
All right.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.590
So now let's consider
formal charge,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.900
because we're never done
with our Lewis structures

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.910
until we've considered
formal charge.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.560
So formal charge is a
measure of the extent

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.380
to which the atom has
really lost or gained

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.670
an electron in the process of
forming this covalent bond.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.610
So as we'll talk about, it's
not the same as oxidation number

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.830
where you have like
sodium plus one,

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.520
but again, there's
some differences

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.190
in how many are
brought to the table

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.750
and what it ends
up with in the end.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.996
So there's an equation
which you'll have to learn,

00:15:57.996 --> 00:15:59.620
but if you do enough
of these problems,

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.080
it'll be stuck in your
brain and you can't purge it

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.490
even if you want to.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.710
And so formal charge, FC,
is equal to the number

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:13.090
of valence electrons,
symbol V, here,

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.800
minus the number of
lone pair electrons

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.480
minus half of the number
of bonding electrons.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.790
So at least this
equation makes sense.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.610
If you forget what they mean,
you can probably think about it

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.820
and it'll come back to you.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.630
So in doing these
formal charges,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.070
you want the formal
charges to add up

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.780
to the charge on the molecule.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.760
So if we had HCN, that's
a neutral molecule

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.360
so the sum of all of the
formal charges must be zero

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.090
or you did something wrong.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.200
If it's CN minus, the
sum of the formal charges

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.380
has to add up to minus one
or you did something wrong.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.010
So this is a good way
of checking your math.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.280
So always remember
that the sum needs

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.190
to add up to the total
charge on the molecule.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.609
If you remember that, that's a
really good check to make sure

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.010
you didn't make some kind
of weird math mistake

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.220
and add things wrong and have
an appropriate number of loan

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.690
pairs or something going on.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.190
OK.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.220
So let's calculate
formal charge now

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.390
on our CN minus
molecule up here.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.540
So the formal charge
now on carbon here.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.110
So how many valence
electrons do carbon have?

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.320
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Four.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.106
How many lone
pairs does it have?

00:17:40.106 --> 00:17:41.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.110
CATHERINE DRENNAN: It has
one lone pair, two lone pair

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.710
electrons.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.310
This is the total number of
lone pair electrons here,

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.550
and then half the number
of bonding electrons.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.930
So it is expanding electrons
and half of that is three.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.079
And so that should add up
to a charge of minus one.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.120
You can also, instead of
thinking half the number

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.680
of bonding electrons,
you can also

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:08.110
just think about number of
bonds if you want to to do this.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.900
All right so to see if
you have the hang of it,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.270
let's do a clicker question.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.670
OK, 10 more seconds.

00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:13.800
Most people got it right.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.980
I can't actually read the
number, but that was very good.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.320
It always seems wrong to
put zero as the answer,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.510
but that is, in fact,
the answer here.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:29.400
So if we look at this again,
we have five valence electrons

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.050
on nitrogen. We have
two lone pair electrons,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.960
and we have six
bonding electrons.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.750
Half of six is three,
and so that's zero.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.570
Or you could have said,
well, if this is minus one,

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.010
and the charge is
minus one, then

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.490
that had to have been zero,
otherwise Professor Drennan

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.310
did something wrong, and
that's just not possible.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.730
So the answer there
would be zero.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.500
And you can see that the total
formal charge is minus one,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.160
and the total charge of the
molecules also minus one.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.290
So again formal charge does
not equal oxidation number,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.800
it's something special.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.340
It tells you kind of in
this arrangement of atoms

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.920
in the molecule,
did this atom kind

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.990
of come up with a little
bit more at the end

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.020
or a little bit less, depending
on where it started from

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.320
and where it is.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.440
And where you want
in these structures

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.450
for the formal charge to be low.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:31.560
So we can use a formal charge to
decide between Lewis structures

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.330
so that the structures
with the lowest

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.090
absolute values of
this formal charge

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.020
are more stable structures.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.710
So if you have really
high formal charges,

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.590
that means that molecule
isn't really very stable

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.090
because you want low charges.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.570
You want lower energy.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.890
You want things to be in a
more neutral and happy state.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.770
So we want to figure
out which ones

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.240
are going to have low charges.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.460
So let's look at another
example, Thiocynate ion,

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.380
and it has a carbon,
sulfur, and nitrogen in it,

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.010
and it has a charge
of minus one.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:14.790
So I might tell you the
ionization energies for carbon,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.960
sulfur, and nitrogen,
and then ask you

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.360
which atom do you
think is going to be

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.335
in the center of the molecule?

00:21:23.335 --> 00:21:24.210
So what do you think?

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.280
What's in the center
of this molecule based

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.590
on those numbers?

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.545
Just yell it out.

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:30.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.480
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Sulfur.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.640
So sulfur has the lowest
ionization energy,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.850
and I told you that's usually
the thing in the center.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.030
But you can start with that.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.890
It's always good
to start with that,

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.980
but then you want to
check the structure

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.840
and make sure that a structure
with sulfur in the middle

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.430
has the lowest formal charge.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.450
So let's take a look at that.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:57.630
So we can draw structure A
with sulfur in the middle,

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:02.210
and then calculate the
formal charges on that.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.360
And if we do that, we see
for the nitrogen here,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.020
nitrogen has five
valence electrons,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:14.550
it has four lone pair electrons,
and it has half of four bonding

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:19.290
electrons, so it would have
a formal charge a minus one

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.830
in this particular structure
that has sulfur in the middle.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.010
We can look at carbon.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.540
Carbon has four valence
electrons, Four lone pair

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.410
electrons, and half of
four bonding electrons,

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.920
so it has a charge of minus two.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.370
Then we can look at sulfur.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:41.340
Sulfur has six valence
electrons, zero loan pairs,

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.310
and half of eight
bonding electrons,

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.250
so it has a formal
charge of plus two.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.550
So overall, this does
equal the minus one.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.650
So it's a valid structure.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.370
But is that the
lowest energy one?

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:00.120
We also could put carbon
in the middle or nitrogen

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.270
in the middle.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.770
So let's look at what
this does for us.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:08.960
So with the formal
charge on nitrogen now,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.190
we have five minus four lone
pair electrons, minus half

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.770
of four bonding
electrons, minus one.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.140
So that's the same.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.180
Now we can look at carbon.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.500
We have now just no
lone pair electrons.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.803
It has four minus
zero minus four,

00:23:26.803 --> 00:23:31.520
half of eight bonding
electrons, or zero.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.550
And for sulfur, six minus
four lone pair electrons,

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.245
and half of four bonding
electrons, or zero.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:47.260
Next, structure C, five minus
zero lone pairs minus half

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.690
of eight, plus one.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.240
So that one's different.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.630
Carbon, we have four
valence electrons

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:01.550
minus four lone pairs minus
half of four, bonding minus two.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:06.070
And for the sulfur, six
minus four lone pairs

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.880
electrons, half
of three or zero.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.160
So now with the clicker,
tell me which is most stable.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.488
All right, 10 seconds.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.506
I think this can be 98%.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.300
That's what I'm thinking.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.254
I'm feeling good.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.540
Well, close.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.700
Yeah.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.200
What?

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.056
No, no.

00:25:01.056 --> 00:25:01.555
Sorry.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:13.210
It should be B. Yeah,
it should be B. Yeah.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.830
Sorry I actually-- Yay.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.790
There we go.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.320
Yeah, B is correct.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.990
So if we just look
at it over here,

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.300
it has the lowest number
of formal charges,

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:51.600
so the answer is B. OK.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.590
Let's start with this simply.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.310
Who wants to tell me why one,
how they could look at this

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.665
and realize one was
not the correct answer?

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.060
I think this is on.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.230
Give it a try.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.470
AUDIENCE: One's not correct
because if you look back

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.230
at your atomic radius chart,
this is pretty much doing

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.330
the exact opposite of that

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.940
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah,
so helium definitely

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.260
not the biggest atom there is.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:31.880
OK so six got a lot of
attention, and so did two.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.840
And ionization energy, electron
affinity, and electronegativity

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.110
are definitely
connected to each other,

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:46.680
but there is a clue that
electron affinity would not

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.510
be the correct.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.945
Does someone want to say
what you might have noticed?

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.420
AUDIENCE: For electron
affinity, it increases and then

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.480
stops at the noble gases
because noble gases do not

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.080
want electrons.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.120
So in this particular
chart, all the noble gases

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.040
are like the highest--
are the highest ones

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.570
in the relative
area, which would

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.822
mean that electron affinity
would be incorrect.

00:27:11.822 --> 00:27:12.780
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yep.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.920
That's right so the noble
gases were the clue.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.130
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:18.860
Yep.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:24.090
And so if electron affinity also
is not high at the noble gases,

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.620
they're also not
electronegative.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.384
Noble gases just don't
want extra light.

00:27:27.384 --> 00:27:28.800
They don't want
to lose electrons,

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.216
they don't want
to gain electrons,

00:27:30.216 --> 00:27:33.030
they just want to be left alone.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.810
So this trend is for
ionization energy.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.920
And because noble gases
want to be left alone,

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.980
they don't want to lose
any of their electrons.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.480
Great.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.120
So this is good to
be thinking about,

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.900
because we're finishing up now
for the handout from last time.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.170
And we're going to be talking
about electronegativity again.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.690
We never move very far away
from a lot of these topics.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.300
They just keep coming back.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.905
So we just keep reviewing them.

00:28:02.905 --> 00:28:04.530
All right, I don't
need to microphones,

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.260
although, I don't know, I
kind of like having this one.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.210
Anyway.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.270
So let's take out the
handout from last time,

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.430
and let's finish it up.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:16.800
We were talking
about formal charge,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.900
and we had looked at
examples where we calculated

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.580
formal charge,
and then we looked

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.800
at which structure would
be lowest in energy,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.710
and that was the structure
where you had the least

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.360
separation between
the charges on them,

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.250
so the smallest
absolute numbers.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.850
If you have formal charges
of zero, that's fantastic.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.250
That's what the molecule wants.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.830
Minus one, plus
one, if you must,

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.180
but when you start having
plus two minus two, that's

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.690
a lot of charge separation,
so that's less favorable.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.560
So we're going to have
more examples of that

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.160
as we go along.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:00.710
But now, what-- if you had
calculated formal charge

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.370
and they're all the
same, how do you

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.810
know which structure is correct?

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.930
So what if you have-- and
this is-- just some people who

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:09.790
are having trouble.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.400
This is the top of page
four from the handout.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.190
You have two valid
Lewis structures

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.040
that have the same
formal charge,

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.650
how do you know where it goes?

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.000
And the answer is that
the negative formal charge

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.910
should go on the most
electronegative atom.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.770
And so that's why we are sort of
talking about electronegativity

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:32.610
again.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:35.940
And so electronegativity--
remember electronegativity

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.090
is high when the electron
affinity is high,

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.900
meaning that the atom
wants to get an electron,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.670
has a high affinity
for electrons,

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.780
and also a high ionization
energy, which means it

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.610
doesn't want to give
up its electrons.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.340
So that's something-- it
likes to have electrons,

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.800
and so you want to put
a negative value, which

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.100
indicates there's more
electrons on something

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.890
that's electronegative.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.757
So negative on
negative over here.

00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:02.340
And so that's what
you're looking for.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.140
That's how you're going
to make a decision.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.210
So let's look at an example.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.480
So here is a molecule,
and we're going

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.670
to look at two possible
Lewis structures of this

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.960
with similar formal
charges, and decide which

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.690
has the correct structure.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.540
So first let me give you a
couple hints that can be useful

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.790
in problem sets and in exams.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.320
When you see CH3,
that's a methyl group,

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.320
and that's going to
be terminal so you're

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.190
going to have these three
hydrogens associated

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.600
with that carbon, and
that's going to be

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.860
at an end of the molecule.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.580
So it could look like
one of these two things.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.920
So we have the carbon,
we have it attached

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.060
to three hydrogens, a carbon
attached to three hydrogens,

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:53.350
and then attached to something
else, this nitrogen here.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.080
And this structure where
it's just kind of written out

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.760
in a line or a chain
of atoms, what we

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.450
call chain molecules sometimes.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.560
Often the atoms are
actually written

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.080
in the order in which
they're attached,

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.900
so that's definitely true here.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.850
CH3, three hydrogens
attached to the carbon,

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:18.100
so they're attached to the atom
that came before in the chain.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.990
The nitrogen is also going
to be attached to the carbon.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.640
Even though it
follows the hydrogen,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.140
you're not going
to have hydrogen

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.306
in the middle of a bond.

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:28.055
It's not going to be
bonded to two things.

00:31:28.055 --> 00:31:31.620
Hydrogen is always terminal, so
even though nitrogen is here,

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.660
it's got to be
attached to the carbon.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.500
So we have three
hydrogens and then

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.490
a bond between the
carbon and the nitrogen.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.860
Now we have a hydrogen
after the nitrogen,

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.260
and by this rule it
should go on the nitrogen.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.860
But you might want to double
check that that's true.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.520
And then we have
an oxygen. Again,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.690
the oxygen is going to have
a bond with the nitrogen.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.520
You're not going to have a bond
with hydrogen in the middle.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.350
Hydrogen's always terminal.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.170
So the only real
choice we have here

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.390
is we can put the
hydrogen on nitrogen

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.730
or we can put the hydrogen
on the oxygen here.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:09.120
And so we can use this rule
about electronegativity and

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.830
formal charges to figure out
which of these structures

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.410
is right.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:17.160
So in this particular case,
all of the formal charges

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.100
are zero on all of the
atoms, except there's

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.290
one minus one charge.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.360
And in this structure,
the minus one charge

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.380
would be on the oxygen,
and in this structure

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.330
the minus one charge
would be on the nitrogen.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.030
And if everything
else is zero then you

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.630
have the sum of
your formal charges,

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.630
minus one, equal to the
charge on the molecule,

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:40.750
which is minus one.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.300
So both of these are
valid structures.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:47.400
Both have low values of
formal charge, which is right.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.750
So it's going to be
the structure that

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:54.450
has the negative charge on the
most electronegative atom is

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:55.950
the right structure.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.780
And so here you need to
remember some of your rules

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.820
about electronegativity.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.630
And in terms of
electronegativity,

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:07.750
we see that oxygen has
greater electronegativity

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.460
than the nitrogen.
And so that's where

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.190
we would want to put
our negative charge--

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.330
on the negative charge
goes on the atom that's

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.860
the most electronegative.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.740
And that would generate
the lower energy structure.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.380
So if you're given a table
of electronegativities, which

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.250
you often are,
you can look it up

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.100
and validate that that's
going to be the correct place.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.700
And in fact, experimentally
we know that that's

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.920
the right structure.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.080
So that works.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.920
So if you have two structures,
identical formal charges,

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.510
valid structures,
then the last step

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.210
is to think about where
that negative charge should

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.216
go, and pick the atom that
is the most electronegative.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.720
All right we have
one more thing we

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.070
need to talk about
in Lewis structures

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.740
before we start
violating various rules

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.560
that we've learned,
and that is that we

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.050
need to talk about
resonance structures.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.190
And so to explain to you what
a resonance structure is,

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.679
it's really helpful to
start with an example,

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.250
so that's what
we're going to do.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.400
And we're going
to consider ozone,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:20.190
which is three atoms of oxygen.
And we have the ozone layer,

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:24.659
which protects us from UV
damage and is very valuable,

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.010
and we should not destroy
it with chemicals being

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.889
released into the environment.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:32.429
And because you don't have
complete say over that,

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:33.870
always wear sunscreen.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.130
OK.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.050
So let's build up
these Lewis structures,

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:42.199
and then consider what's meant
by a resonance structure.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.350
So here we have part
of the Periodic Table

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.110
that you're going
to need, and we

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.920
need to think first about
the valence electrons.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.929
So oxygen has six
valence electrons

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:57.030
and there are three
oxygens, so that's 18.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.300
To get a full octet for each
of the oxygens, three oxygens,

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:06.250
an octet is eight valence
electrons, so that would be 24.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.350
To figure out the number
of bonding electrons,

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:11.940
we're going to be subtracting
our octet electrons

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.860
from our valence electrons.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.600
So 24 minus 18 is six.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.790
And then our next step is
to assign those bonding

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.290
electrons two at a
time, two per bond.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.080
So let's take a look at that.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.250
We can put one bond here
between these two oxygens,

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.750
one bond here between
these two oxygens,

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.440
and then ask do
we have any more?

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.500
And we do.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.770
Because we have six bonding
electrons, we used four,

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.230
so we have two more
bonding electrons.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.350
So we need to make
a double bond.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.100
But now we have the question of
where to make that double bond.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.920
Am I going to put it
between these two oxygens

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.770
or am I going to put it
between those two oxygens?

00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:02.150
And so I could say put it
there, but I could also,

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.670
in structure two, put the
double bond over here.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.170
All right.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.480
We'll come back to that
question in a minute.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.570
Let's first figure out if we
have any remaining valence

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.300
electrons, and we do.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:20.060
So we had 18 and we've only
used six, so we have 12 left.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.510
So we're going to put
those in as lone pairs.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.640
And so I can put
them in over here.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:30.200
One set here, one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.210
And I can also do
that over here.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:36.140
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.570
And now we have two
structures, so we

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:40.340
need to think about
formal charges

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.550
to see if that can help
differentiate structure

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:47.390
one from structure two.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.590
OK.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.360
And let's look at that.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.670
Be sure everyone's ready.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:57.440
And that is a clicker question.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.050
So I'll put that back up.

00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:49.640
All right.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.340
Let's just take 10
more seconds, and we'll

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.120
talk about what the right answer
is, and a little bit of a trick

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.055
for doing these,
perhaps, a bit faster.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:11.600
OK.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.600
So that was pretty good.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.660
So let's look at why
that's the right answer.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.870
And we'll take a look
at that over here.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.470
So let's do the calculations.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.120
So you have to remember the
equation for formal charge

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.070
for sure and once you
do enough problems

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.160
it should stick in your
head pretty easily.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.400
So if we look over
here-- so this

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.060
is the formal
charge on oxygen A.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.830
There were six
valence electrons,

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:40.900
there are four lone pair
electrons, minus half

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.640
of the bonding electrons.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.300
There are eight bonding
electrons, so that's two.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.870
So that's a formal
charge of zero.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:54.510
For oxygen B over here, we again
have six valence electrons,

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.690
and we have two
lone pair electrons.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:01.260
We have six bonding
electrons, so half of six

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.620
is three, which is plus one.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.290
And on oxygen C over
here, six minus six

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:14.600
lone parallel electrons, half
of one bond, so half of two

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.110
is one, minus one, overall
the charge here is neutral.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:22.080
And that's good because
it's a neutral molecule.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.930
So to do this
structure faster, you

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:28.500
have to realize that
oxygen A over here

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.330
is the same as C over there.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.050
So you can just
copy down what you

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:40.890
had for C is now A. B is exactly
the same in the two structures,

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.630
so it's the same as
what you calculated.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.710
And now this C was
the same as this A,

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:49.260
so we can put that
same value that we

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:56.496
calculated for A into C.
So they're both the same.

00:39:56.496 --> 00:40:01.980
Same formal charges, which
structure is correct?

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.950
And the answer is both of them.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.200
And in fact, you
need both of them,

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.640
so there's data--
chemists love data--

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.830
and the data is that
the bonds are actually

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.550
equivalent in the molecule.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.940
So it isn't that there's
one double bond and one

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:24.030
single bond, there's just
one kind of bond in ozone,

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:28.160
and it's between a
single and a double bond.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.850
And so this is how one would
draw that kind of thing.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.420
You would have structure one
here and structure two here.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.610
You would put them
both in brackets,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.620
and you would put this
special double headed

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.680
arrow between them
and that indicates

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.100
that both of these structures
are needed to describe

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.290
the properties of the molecule.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:54.880
You do not have a stationary
double bond and a single bond.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.170
You have kind of a
mixture between these two,

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.290
and that's what a
resonance structure is.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:04.560
So let's take a little bit
more of a look at this.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.980
So this is just what I had
before, experimental evidence

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.870
is that the bonds
are equivalent.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.930
There isn't a
double and a single,

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:15.750
there's something in
between, a one and a half.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.360
And this is called
a resonance hybrid,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.580
and it's of length of
these two structures.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.600
So this structure is
blended with that structure.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.870
So some of you are aware
of hybrids from biology,

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.810
and now with cars.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.190
So a mule would be an example.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.230
And if you're thinking
about what a mule is,

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.990
you don't walk out into
your barnyard one day

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.520
and see a donkey one day
and you go out the next day

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.950
and you see a horse.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:44.490
A mule is a hybrid between
a donkey and a horse.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.090
So if you were a chemist,
you would do this.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:48.900
You would put the
donkey in brackets,

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.150
and the horse in brackets, and
put your double headed arrow.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:55.620
And if you see this,
you'd say, oh yes, a mule.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.230
So that is what this is.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.830
Both structures are
needed to describe ozone.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.030
One structure isn't enough.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.100
You need both of them.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.860
They're in resonance
with each other.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:12.210
And so what's true about
the electrons in ozone

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:18.210
is that they're delocalized
across all of these bonds,

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:21.030
so there isn't like
a double single.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.760
All of those electrons
are delocalized.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.387
They're shared over
this set of atoms.

00:42:27.387 --> 00:42:29.970
And you can have two resonance
structures, you can have three,

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:30.810
you can have four.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.180
It depends on the
molecule in question.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:38.040
And in all those cases, those
electrons would be delocalized.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.150
So just to sum that up,
resonance structures,

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:47.050
two or more, same arrangement
of atoms-- and that's important.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.947
It's the electrons
that are different.

00:42:48.947 --> 00:42:51.030
And this isn't in your
handout, out but just think

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.310
about this for a second--
because it was in your hand

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.510
out a minute ago.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.180
Are these resonance structures?

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.060
No.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:00.540
They're not
resonance structures.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.760
The atoms are in
different positions.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.490
So one of these structures is
right one of these structures

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:06.450
is wrong.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.420
With resonance structures,
they're both correct

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.600
and both needed to
define the structure.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.590
So pay attention.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.060
This is a common mistake.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:15.740
Pay attention.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.950
Ask yourself, are the atoms
in a different position?

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:19.200
That's not resonance.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.020
You're just looking-- atoms
are the same, formal charge

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.670
are the same,
you're just looking

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:27.890
at whether you have different
arrangements of electrons.

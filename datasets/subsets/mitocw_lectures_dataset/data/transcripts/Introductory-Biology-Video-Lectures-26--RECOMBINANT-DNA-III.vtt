00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.000
So I just want to back up a couple
because I think there's still some

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.000
confusion about what a restriction
enzyme is and exactly what it does,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.000
although I indicated, a three prime
hydroxyl and a five-prime phosphate.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.000
Let me show you.  This is the way a
lot, at least a large class of

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.000
restriction enzymes,
went.  We've seen a deoxyribose

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.000
backbone before with a phosphate
backbone going on up to

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.000
the next nucleotide.
This is the five-prime position.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.000
This is the three prime position.
There is a phosphate here.  It goes

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.000
down to the next one.
It goes down like this.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:06.000
So what I'm showing you,
GAATTC, five prime to three prime,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.000
here's where I indicated the first
cut comes from.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.000
And I indicated that the cleavage
generates a G with a three prime

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.000
hydroxyl, and the G ends up with a
five prime phosphate.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.000
So what that means is that the
hydrolysis happens right there,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.000
so that after cleavage, what you end
up with is a five-prime phosphate

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.000
and three prime hydroxyl.
This is paired with the C on the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.000
opposite strand.
It makes one cut here,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.000
and then it would make an identical
cut on the opposite strand.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.000
So if we were to pull those apart
this strand here would have G with

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.000
its three prime OH,
and the other strand would be TTAA.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.000
And if we were to pull the apart.
We'd have A A T T C, a three prime

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.000
OH here, five prime phosphate there,
five prime phosphate there.  Again,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.000
you have to remember,
this strand is going five prime,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.000
three prime in that direction.  This
was going five prime, three

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.000
prime in the end.
And the beauty of these restriction

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.000
enzymes, at least it's not true of
all of them.  But it's true of a lot

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.000
of them as they generate these what
are called sticky ends.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.000
You can pull them apart.
They come back together, though,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.000
and reform those base pairs.  It's
almost like having little bits of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.000
Velcro at the end.
And when this end is looking for a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.000
complementary sequence to pair with.
It doesn't know what's out here,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.000
and it doesn't know what's out there,
all it sees as this.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.000
So I can cut this and rejoin it or
I can cut them and pull apart,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.000
take another piece of DNA that's
been cut with the same enzyme and

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.000
therefore has the same corresponding
little sticky ends on each end,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.000
and it could insert right in the
middle.  And that's the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.000
principle of cloning.
And it was the development of these,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.000
if you will, magic scissors that
made it possible to take this DNA

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.000
which looks so homogeneous,
nothing but GA's, T's, and C's,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.000
and then cut it up in defined ways.
When I was a postdoc, a friend of

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.000
mine had just purified $2 million
worth of EcoRI because he purified

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.000
some of this enzyme.
At that point,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.000
the only way to get these things was
to produce them yourself and purify

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.000
them.  Now there are literally
hundreds of these and they recognize

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.000
different sequences,
and once people understood that they

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.000
existed, then they just started to
look in different,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.000
usually they're from bacteria,
and they just looked in different

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.000
bacteria until they found another
one.  And then they purified it.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.000
So if you go to, say, any of the
companies that do stuff for

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.000
recombinant DNA, you'll
find lists like this.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.000
Funny little abbreviations like
EcoRI usually have something that

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.000
tells you some abbreviation related
to the organism,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.000
from which the restriction enzyme
was isolated.  And you can find

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.000
things that will cut,
I won't say every sequence,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.000
but very, very, many sequences.
There are literally hundreds of

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.000
these, and you just order them.
And the next day, a FedEx package

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.000
arrives with a little bit of the
enzyme that will cut

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.000
at that sequence.
Another concept that seemed to be a

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:16.000
problem, was what's a vector?
So if you understand that there are

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.000
sequence specific molecular scissors,
that if we have a piece of DNA and

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:31.000
there's an EcoRI site here,
you would come to think of it like

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:39.000
that because it's going to cut in a
slightly skewed way.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.000
Maybe there's another one right here,
another one over here.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.000
If we take this DNA and cut it with
this particular enzyme,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.000
we get a break here.  Then this will
get this piece running from here to

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.000
here.  We'll get this little piece
here.  We'll get this piece here,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.000
and will get whatever goes off on
those sides.  So that's naked

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.000
DNA in a test tube.
So I could cut any piece of DNA at

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:19.000
some sites generating a bunch of
fragments and if I just took those

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.000
fragments and transformed them into
E. coli, I took naked DNA,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.000
took it from the outside, put it
inside, is it going

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.000
to replicate?  No.
Why not?  Because there's a special

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.000
signal called the origin of
replication that says "start

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.000
replicating DNA here".
This came from a piece of human,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.000
lets say some of my DNA, it would
not have a signal in it that said to

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.000
the E. coli replication machinery,
"start replicating DNA right here".

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.000
So the principle of, apart from
being able to cut DNA fragments,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.000
is you have together to replicate so
you can make lots of

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.000
lots of copies.
The trick is to attach the DNA,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:11.000
at least a widely used trick is to
attach the DNA to something that has

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.000
an origin of replication that will
work in the organism in question.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.000
And that was what we call a vector.
So this is an E. coli cell.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.000
Another thing that's very confusing
is all the circles that show up in

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.000
this course.  This is huge.
The vector was double-stranded DNA

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.000
that maybe, let's say,
had a unique EcoRI restriction site

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.000
in it.  That's the only EcoRI
restriction site.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.000
The other thing that we'd need to
have is an origin of DNA replication.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.000
So, that's why this plasmid is able
to propagate itself.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.000
This little circle of DNA is able
to propagate itself,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.000
and then some kind of selectable
marker.  And, most of the time

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.000
that's a drug-resistance,
so although it doesn't have to be.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:05.000
And if we cut that here,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:13.000
generate sticky ends, then we can
take this fragment and stick it in

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:20.000
here, to give this piece here joined
to the vector.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:28.000
And that's an insert.
Let's say it was that piece there.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.000
In fact, if you wanted to clone DNA
in E. coli, and then have the

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.000
plasmid work in yeast,
if you just take that plasmid that

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.000
works, the vector with its insert
that works in E.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.000
coli and put it in the yeast,
it won't replicate either.  And

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.000
that's because these other languages
other than the genetic code are not

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.000
universal.  So,
you also have to put also in a

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.000
sequence that said to the yeast
replication machinery "start

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.000
something here".
People call that a shuttle vector,

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.000
something that will replicate in E.
coli or replicate in yeast,

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.000
and the same principle applies to
other organisms

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.000
Okay, now probably the trickiest
thing, the thing where I sort of

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.000
muddled it on Friday,
and I apologize for that,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.000
was this discovery of restriction
enzymes.  And again,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.000
some of you were frustrated.
You said, why do I waste time?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.000
Why not just tell you stuff that's
on the exam?  Okay again,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.000
people were talking about molecular
scissors when I was an undergrad and

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.000
grad student, and chemists were
trying to think if they could come

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.000
up with some way to get some
specificity in how to cutting DNA.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.000
And the answer,
the discovery of restriction enzymes

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.000
didn't come from that kind of
experiment.  It came from somebody

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.000
trying to understand what seemed to
be a really obscure piece of biology.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.000
Julie made up a lovely little slide.
But I think it basically did was I

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.000
left at one of the little layers
that I usually show.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:03.000
So, let me just talk.
Here's, again, what Luria saw when

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:10.000
he was doing these experiments.
So, I'm going to tell you now what

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:17.000
was in strain A and B,
and maybe that will help.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:24.000
But I wanted you first to see it
without knowing what anything beyond

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:31.000
what Luria knew.
OK, strain A has no restriction

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:38.000
enzyme, and no modification
enzyme.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:48.000
And although there are different
types of modification enzymes,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:58.000
many of them are methylases.  So,
we'll call that.  And this one has a

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:06.000
restriction enzyme.
And, it has corresponding methylase.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:12.000
Just to review that again, if you
can figure this pretty much out from

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:18.000
first principles that if you were an
organism, and you had a restriction

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:24.000
enzyme that would cut this,
there are two things you can

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:31.000
possibly do to keep from cutting up
your own DNA.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.000
One is to never have that sequence
of pure DNA.  That would prevent you

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.000
from cutting up your own DNA,
even though it has it.  It's pretty

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.000
constraining now,
because somewhere in a particular

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.000
protein, you might need that little
bit of sequence to encode something

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.000
that you need to make a critical
protein.  So instead what you find

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.000
is organisms have a restriction
enzyme, have those sequences,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.000
but they don't cut up their own DNA
because they modify their own DNA,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.000
by putting, in the case of this one,
they put a methyl here.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.000
And I drew that out the other day.
You can see, you can put a methyl

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.000
group on the exocyclic amino group
of adanine, and not interfere with

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.000
base pairing.  But what you can do,
is interfere with the way that the

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.000
restriction enzymes sees that
sequence.  And when the cell pulls

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.000
the DNA apart,
each of the old strands is

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.000
methylated, and a new strand is
initially not methylated.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.000
But that's enough keep the
restriction enzyme from

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.000
doing its thing.
And then the methylase will come

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.000
along, find a sequence,
and then the progeny strand,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.000
the daughter strand, will begin to
get methylated.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.000
So, once you get DNA methylated,
you can propagate it as long as you

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.000
have the methyl group.
So this was what was really

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.000
underlying what Luria did.
But he didn't know that.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.000
Let me quickly just go through this
again.  So he grew the strain,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:05.000
the phage on strain A, no
restriction enzyme,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.000
just plain old DNA.  So,
he picks a plaque that's probably

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.000
about a billion phage in a plaque,
somewhere around 10^8, 10^9 probably,

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.000
no that's not true,
a little less than that,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:25.000
somewhat less than that, but lots
and lots of phage particles in the

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.000
plaque. Resuspend them and
then plate them out.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.000
And of course it grew on strain A.
That's what it was growing on.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.000
That wouldn't surprise you at all.
The surprise was, even though he

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.000
knew he had lots and lots of phage,
hardly any of them grew on strain B.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.000
But, he found a rare plaque that
had learned to grow.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.000
And he tested then, and this thing
grows on strain B.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.000
That was not a surprise because it
had to grow on strain B to be up

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.000
there.  And he tested,
and it still grew on the strain A.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.000
So up until now,
everything we knew,

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.000
everything we've talked about in
that course, you think,

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.000
ah-ha, this original phage couldn't
grow on strain B,

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.000
but it's mutated. Somehow.
It's learned to grow on strain B.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.000
That would be a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.000
But if that were the case,
what would've happened?

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.000
Well it was growing on those phage,
you pick them again, it should still

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.000
grow on A and B,
and they still do.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.000
The problem with that model was
that they grew on strain A.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.000
They had trouble growing on strain
B.  Now that we've learned to grow

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.000
on strain B, but you hadn't
forgotten how to grow on strain A.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.000
But if you take the ones that were
growing on strain A,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:56.000
they grow on strain A,
not a surprise.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.000
This is the problem right here.
If this was a mutant, permanent

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.000
change, then we should have been
able to have it grow on strain B as

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.000
well.  So what was really happening
in there?  Well,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.000
at the beginning,
the phage DNA was lacking any kind

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.000
of modification.
It grew fine on strain A,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.000
because there was no restriction
enzyme.  When it went into strain B,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.000
that now had an enzyme, a
restriction enzyme that cut up any

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.000
time it found that sequence.
And so, most of the phage that

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.000
injected their DNA,
those DNAs were trashed by the

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.000
restriction enzyme.
But there is a methylase in there

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.000
that's also able to methylate those
sequences.  And what happened

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.000
somewhere along the way was that
there was the methyl,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.000
on one phage DNA, and got enough
methyls on there that the phage

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.000
could be replicated before it got
cut up by the restriction enzyme.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.000
Once the phage molecule has
methylations on the site,

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.000
it's able to grow just fine on
strain B, and it will be able to do

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.000
that forever.
However, if you take that DNA with

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.000
the methyls on it,
and we put it back strain A,

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.000
it'll still grow, as this one
doesn't have any kind of restriction

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.000
enzyme, but while it's growing its
busy losing all the methyls again.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.000
We are right back to where we
started from.  An obscure experiment,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.000
one of the most obscure you could
get, many people would have paid no

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.000
attention.  It does
not seem worth it.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.000
So, the phenomenon was called
restriction.  They had to give it a

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:39.000
name.  It wasn't mutation.
They said this phage DNA was being

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.000
restricted somehow when it grew on
strain B.  People called them,

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.000
postulated there must be a
restriction enzyme that was doing

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.000
this restricting of phage growth.
When they found out what was doing

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.000
it, they had discovered magic
scissors that would cut DNA at

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.000
particular sequences.
So, the point here again,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.000
to try and go back and do this,
I hope some of you will get this

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:08.000
anyway, many of the really important
discoveries come out of basic

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.000
research.  They are easy to ridicule.
Why would I spend money on cancer,

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:14.000
human disease or something, for
somebody studying some little weird

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:18.000
phenomenon about phage.
But if you want to trace back to

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.000
the experiment,
it sort of started the biotech

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:24.000
industry.  It was the discovery of
restriction enzymes.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:28.000
It took a little while to discover
what it was, but the reason they

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:31.000
were discovered,
were people were trying to

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.000
understand that phenomenology.
Once we got restriction enzymes,

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.000
we already had ligase, which is sort
of the tape we'd need,

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.000
and just to show you here,
when we go back to this one,

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.000
you can see that if we put these
together again,

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.000
we have a three prime hydroxyl,
and a five-prime phosphate.  That's

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.000
what DNA ligase knows how to do,
because that's how you seal up the

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.000
end of a Okazaki fragment.
So, that particular part of the

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.000
molecular biology toolkit was
already known to molecular

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.000
biologists who had been studying
DNA replication.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:13.000
OK, so, if we took some DNA from
anything, and we cut up into pieces

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:21.000
like this, and then we join them
with a vector that had been cut,

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:29.000
so let's just sort of open it up a
little bit, this fragment would go

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:37.000
in here into one vector
molecule.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.000
This fragment would insert in
another vector molecule,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.000
and so on and so forth.  Then we
would have what I said was a library,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.000
and the problem at this point is,
so you transform those into E. coli,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:58.000
and now we have a whole series of E.
coli.  They have their own

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.000
chromosome, every one of them
because they still have

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:10.000
to be a bacterium.
So, let's take three members of E.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:19.000
coli from this library, and they
will all have this vector,

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:28.000
but they'll have, let's say,
insert number 1, 2, 3.  This insert

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:35.000
is a little.
This insert is bigger,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:40.000
and so on.  If we did it right.
We have every possible fragment of

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:46.000
DNA from the original source sitting
in its own vector.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:51.000
And the whole collection of E.
coli in this population in the

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.000
certain library,
and the next part of the trick was,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:02.000
how do you find the thing you want,
especially if you take my DNA with 3

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.000
billion base pairs.
That's an awful lot of restriction

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.000
fragments no matter what you do.
How do you go about doing it?  So

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.000
the experiment that I showed you at
the end of the lecture,

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:20.000
cloning by complementation,
is fairly simple, and it was

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.000
basically one of the first methods
that was used to find genes in

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.000
recombinant library.
And that would be, for example,

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:33.000
something that had thisGene mutation
in the chromosomal DNA.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.000
This is what the situation I'd
described the other day.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.000
So, if we put the library into
every cell, such that the bacterium

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.000
we transformed the library into was
broken for the hisG gene,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.000
and that mutant couldn't grow on
minimal medium unless we put in

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.000
added histadine.
But, if one member of that library

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.000
had the wild type,
hisG gene, let's say it was this one

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.000
here, maybe it had several
genes on it.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:13.000
But let's say over here.
We had hisG+, then the strain is

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:19.000
back to being able to synthesize
histidine because it's got all the

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:25.000
enzymes.  What I was pointing out
was this really is complementation,

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:31.000
just like we did in that phage cross.
We've got one broken copy of the

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:36.000
gene.  We've got a good copy.
And all you need is one good copy,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:41.000
and you're back in business.  What I
was saying at the end of the lecture

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.000
was this is not a general solution,
though.    If I wanted to find the

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:51.000
corresponding histidine gene from my
DNA, and all of these biosynthetic

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.000
pathways, pretty much they rose so
early in evolution,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.000
the biochemistry is essentially
identical in all cells.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:06.000
Can I use this approach to find the
same gene for my DNA?

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.000
What do you think?
Why don't you turn to somebody

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.000
beside you and see if you can talk
for a minute, and then let's see if,

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.000
I can think of at least a couple of
problems.  Let's see if you can come

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.000
up with one or two of them.
Find somebody near you and see if

00:22:21.100 --> 00:23:06.000
you can come up with anything.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:14.000
Anybody want to volunteer?
An idea of why it would not work?

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:22.000
Or some of you think it would?  No
ideas?  God, it's Monday.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:30.000
[LAUGHTER]  I feel like most of you
guys.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:36.000
Somebody, come on.
What do you think?

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:42.000
It's going to work?
No idea?  What has to happen for it

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:48.000
to work?  I'll give you a vector
that has my gene corresponding to

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:54.000
that enzyme.  It's in E.
coli.  I need to make the protein.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:24:00.000
Yeah?  No, it's in the vector.  We
cloned it into an E.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:07.000
coli vector.  So, that's got it.
Yeah?

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.000
Well it'll have a language that will
say "start transcription",

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.000
but whose language is it going to
have?  It's going to have my

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.000
transcriptional stuff.
Will that work in E. coli?

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.000
Even though the open reading frame
is fine, that's good.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.000
How about translation?
I didn't even tell you about that.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.000
There is actually some specific

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.000
stuff needed.  That's not universal,
either.  So when you get the RNA you

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.000
still have to translate it.
There is another thing that might

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.000
mess us up.  Do you remember
anything else about,

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.000
yeah?  Introns and exons?
What if my gene has introns in it,

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.000
which it almost surely has?  We have
to get rid of those.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.000
E. coli doesn't know what they are.
It's not used to taking them out.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.000
You see the issues?
Although that's a cute thing and

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.000
that helps you find a gene from E.
coli by complementing E. coli mutant,

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.000
or maybe you could do it with yeast
if you had a factor that would

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.000
replicate in yeast, it wasn't
a general solution.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.000
So people had to use a whole variety
of different ways.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.000
Here's another way.
You know that you have that genetic

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.000
code.  That was worked out years ago.
So let's say I was a biochemist,

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.000
and I'd found a protein that I was
interested in,

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.000
and I purified it,
and they got it out to single

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.000
protein, and then I could cut it up
with things that proteases that will

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.000
cut the protein into pieces,
and there are ways of sequencing

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.000
protein.
I'm not going to tell you how it

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.000
works in this course.
We just don't have time.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.000
But you can get the sequence of
little pieces of protein.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.000
And let's imagine that this was the
sequence of part of the protein that

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.000
I purified.  It's one of my enzymes
[SOUND OFF/THEN ON] and I'd like to

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.000
find the gene.
Well, how could I use that

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:05.000
information to figure out where the
gene is in this library?

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:11.000
So here's the strategy.
We get out the genetic code,

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:18.000
which Gobind Khorana and Marshall
Nirenberg helped work out,

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:24.000
and we say OK, alanine, and if you
look it up, what you'll find is that

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:31.000
it's GC, and then it can be A T C or
G.  It can be any of those.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:36.000
If we look up what the codon for
aspartate.  We'll find that there's

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:41.000
a G or an A, but it could be T,
or it could be C.  We look up

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.000
lysine; it'll mostly be A,
but it could be A or G.  You'll

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:51.000
notice the variation of those things
is almost all in  the third codon if

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:57.000
that hadn't struck you.
Same thing with threonine: A,

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:02.000
C, and this is another one;
therefore codons that encode this.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:09.000
And this one asparagine is that.
So knowing that piece of the protein

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:18.000
doesn't define a unique sequence.
Though, what we could do it is we

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:27.000
could synthesize what's
called a mixed probe.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:32.000
And that would mean when we are
going to synthesize this DNA and

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:38.000
we'd start with a G building block.
And then we'd add a C building

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:43.000
block.  So, now we made G and C.
And at the next step, we'd add an

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:49.000
equal mixture of A,
T, G, and C.  So, what we would get

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.000
out of that would be we'd be getting
G, and then the next biosynthetic

00:27:54.100 --> 00:28:00.000
step would give us G,
C.  And then the next biochemical

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:06.000
step would give us GCA,
GCT, GCC, or GCG.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.000
At the next step,
we'd add a G.  So everyone of these

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:15.000
would get a G.
Everyone would get an A,

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:20.000
and then the next step, they would
branch.  And if you follow that out,

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.000
you'll see by the end you have a
mixture of probes.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:30.000
One of them is going to be the
right one that you find in the DNA.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.000
Now if you work out the number of
possibilities,

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.000
you'll discover that most of the
time there is only going to be one

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.000
probe that's unique.
Once you get to about 20

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.000
nucleotides, any sequence,
on average, is represented once in

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.000
the human genome.
So as long as you make the probe

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.000
long enough, one of the things in
your mixture will be a defined probe.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.000
So, what we can take is we have all
these different pieces of DNA that

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:03.000
are the logical variants
you can see here.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.000
And then we would label the probe
with P32.  It's a radioactive

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:14.000
isotope, and it's very easy.
You can add it to a five-prime

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.000
phosphate.  There's a special enzyme
that will very easily take the

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:25.000
terminal phosphate from ATP and put
it over.  It doesn't really [SOUND

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:31.000
OFF/THEN ON] for this course
how we get it there.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:36.000
But we can do is radioactively label
the probe.  So now we've got this

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.000
mixture.  And,
somewhere in this library is a piece

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:46.000
of DNA that's going to have the gene
that's encoding the protein that

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:51.000
we're interested in.
So, how do you go about trying to

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:56.000
deal with that?
So, what we'll do is we'll plate

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:01.000
our E. coli library onto a
bunch of Petri plates.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:07.000
So, I won't put too many colonies on
here, so we can sort of see a

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:13.000
pattern.  But,
we'd have probably a lot of them,

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:20.000
and we'd have a bunch of plates.
You can work out statistically how

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:26.000
many plates you have to have to have
a chance of finding your gene of

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:33.000
interest.  Then what we do,
is lay a membrane on the plate.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:40.000
It's a particular type of membrane,
and what that will do is it will

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:48.000
make a copy of everything that's
there, and we're going to save the

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:55.000
plate.  And then we're going to
treat the membrane,

00:30:55.100 --> 00:31:03.000
OK?  We've got a membrane that's got
an identical pattern.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:09.000
They've got some of the bacteria
from the colonies stuck at the

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:15.000
corresponding parts on the membrane.
We're going to lyse the E. coli;

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:22.000
that means break them open so all
their insides spill out.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:28.000
We will denature the DNA by
treating with a condition.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:35.000
You can, for example, vary the pH
and make the strands come apart.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:40.000
That gives single stranded DNA,
"ss" I'm using as an abbreviation

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:46.000
for single strand of the strands you
pulled apart.  And,

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:51.000
this sticks to the membrane.
So, now we've got, at every one of

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:57.000
these little positions on the
membrane something that

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:03.000
looks like this.
Here's the membrane,

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:09.000
and there's some sort of single
stranded DNA that's stuck to the

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:15.000
membrane in that fashion.
The DNA that's stuck here came from

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:21.000
the bacterium here that had a
particular insert.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:27.000
Over here, we have all the E.
coli DNA and the vector DNA, but we

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:34.000
will have a different piece of DNA
in the vector.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.000
Everybody with me?
OK, so if we were now to take our

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.000
radioactive probe that we made up
there and get the conditions just

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.000
right, that single stranded probe
will come in, and it will try and

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:50.000
find its complement.
It'll form hydrogen bonds because

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.000
that's the lowest energy well.
And, we think about it

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.000
thermodynamically.
And, if we can get it right,

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.000
the temperature and the conditions
right, nothing will stick unless

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.000
it's an exact match
to the sequence.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:12.000
And, if we get the right probe that
can form hydrogen bonds with

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:19.000
everything on here,
and it's got P32 at this point,

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:25.000
what will happen is we'll have now,
the probe will stick, say, to this

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:32.000
particular colony,
now with radioactivity right there.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:40.000
So, put some photographic film over

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:48.000
the membrane, and right here there's
P32, and that'll expose the film and

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:57.000
nowhere else.  And then,
when we develop, what we'll find is

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:06.000
one, if this works well,
anyway, one spot.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.000
So, now we know that that piece,
that colony had a piece of human DNA

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.000
in it that was related to the
sequence from the protein that I had

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.000
purified.  So we go back to this
colony, I think our things have

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.000
probably migrated around a little
bit here.  Let's move this up just a

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.000
little bit, and make
it a little better.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:32.000
So this one is this one.
So, now I can go back to this

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:37.000
colony and pick it out.
And, let's say it's this insert.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:43.000
So, now I've found I can sequence
the rest of that piece of DNA.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.000
We'll talk about how we sequence
DNA in the next lecture.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:54.000
So that's an alternative way of
identifying a clone of interest.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:59.000
There was a particularly painful
way of finding a gene in a library

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:05.000
that we for the most part do not
have to do any more.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:18.000
It was called positional cloning.
And for example the gene that when

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:32.000
it's broken causes cystic fibrosis,
it's a very difficult disease.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:37.000
Humans who have cystic fibrosis
have a very tough time.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:42.000
So there's a great deal of interest
in finding the gene that was broken

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:47.000
in these patients.
Human geneticists,

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:53.000
I showed you something about
pedigrees, they would have a

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:58.000
chromosome.  They might have banding
patterns, and they would have

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:03.000
figured out that somewhere along the
chromosome that the gene for cystic

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:09.000
fibrosis lay somewhere between two
genetic markers that they

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.000
had identified.
Now, the amount of DNA between

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.000
something that you knew that the
gene was here,

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.000
and something knew that the gene was
there, could be huge.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.000
It could be many, many,
many times the size of the E.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.000
coli chromosome.  So, what people
would do is they'd clone something

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.000
from here, a little piece of DNA
from there, and also clone something

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.000
and they get a little piece
of DNA from there.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.000
And then they go into the library,
and they try and find something that

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:44.000
had this DNA and something that
extended in this direction the

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.000
little bit.  By the sort of thing
you'd have marker A somewhere in the

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.000
middle of the cystic fibrosis gene
but you didn't know exactly where.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:58.000
You'd clone a little piece of DNA
and use that to find another one

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:03.000
that overlapped with it.
And that you'd find,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.000
use that to find another piece of
DNA.  You'd walk your way over this

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.000
way, and you'd start the same
process at the other end.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.000
And, every one of these things,
the same kind of operation that

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.000
we've got here,
so cycles, and cycles,

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.000
and cycles of acquiring the next
adjacent piece of DNA,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.000
and working your way along here.
And you had to use more than one

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.000
different restriction enzymes,
otherwise you wouldn't be able to

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.000
get these overlaps.
And by doing that,

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.000
eventually they were able to get all
the DNA that was between these

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.000
markers.  They knew the cystic
fibrosis gene was there from the

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.000
maps they had made by studying human
pedigrees.  And then,

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.000
once you knew the sequence,
then you'd take candidate genes,

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.000
and you'd take a bunch of cystic
fibrosis patients,

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.000
and you'd start to see if every
person who had cystic fibrosis had a

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.000
mutation in that gene.
And, eventually they got it.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:10.000
That process in the case of cystic
fibrosis took five years to do that

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:16.000
with a huge team of people.
And, I guess it was from 1985-1990.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:21.000
If you wanted to do that experiment
today.  We come now to one of the

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:27.000
most widely used ways to finding a
gene of interest,

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.000
and that is you go to the computer.
The whole human genome sequence is

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:35.000
in there.  If we were to do that
experiment today,

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.000
we'd say, well, I know what this
gene is, so you look that gene up in

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.000
the database.  And you knew what
this gene was and you look up the

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.000
database.  Then you just look at all
the DNA that's in the middle.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.000
And you'd see a whole series of
open reading frames.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.000
And you'd probably say,
well, what do I know about the

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.000
biology of cystic fibrosis?
Could I make a guess?  Is it a

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.000
membrane protein?  Is it
not a membrane protein?

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.000
And, there are certain
characteristics that would probably

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.000
allow you to make a guess.
And then, you could jump right in

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.000
and start sequencing DNA.
You could start the experiment

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.000
practically that afternoon instead
of five years later.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.000
So, if you look back from the
literature, you'll find some of the

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.000
key genes; in fact,
in human biology, we're isolated by

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.000
this very painful process of
positional cloning,

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:31.000
and you hardly ever have to do that
now.  It may be the odd case where

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.000
something's needed,
but most of the stuff now,

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.000
there are these amazing databases,
and I'll give you the URL for it at

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.000
the beginning of next lecture.
And I'll show you when,

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:48.000
this is an experiment in which
someone took this gene for cystic

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:53.000
fibrosis.  It is a membrane protein,
and it's one of those proteins that

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:57.000
mediates the passage of chloride
ions across the membrane.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:02.000
And, if that gets broken,
you end up with cystic fibrosis.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.000
What someone has done here is
they've taken that green fluorescent

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:12.000
protein gene.
And, they've fused it to the end of

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.000
the cystic fibrosis gene.
So, you can tell where the cystic

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:21.000
fibrosis gene is localized in a lung
cell by looking to see where the

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:26.000
fluorescence is.
And, I think you can see that the

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:31.000
fluorescence is out there
along the membrane.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:35.000
OK, so at the beginning of next
lecture, I'll introduce you to how

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:40.000
we take one of these recombinant
plasmids, and make what's called a

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.000
restriction map.
It's using a very simple,

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:49.000
little piece of apparatus like that,
and we'll go in and tell you about

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.000
DNA sequencing,
and this PCR technique you've heard,

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.000
preliminary chain reaction that
you've heard so much about, OK?

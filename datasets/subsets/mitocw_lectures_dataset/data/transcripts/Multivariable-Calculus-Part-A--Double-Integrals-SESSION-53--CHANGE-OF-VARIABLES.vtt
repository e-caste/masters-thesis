CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.100
In this video, I'd like us to
work on the following problem:

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.030
So given the region
R shown below,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.190
which I'll mention
more of in a moment,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.740
compute the integral
double integral

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.910
over R of the
quantity 4 x squared

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.040
minus y squared to
the fourth dx dy,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.230
and I want you to do it
by changing variables to u

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.930
is equal 2x minus y and
v is equal to 2x plus y.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.080
And the region,
defined down here,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.720
is just these
three line segments

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040
and the intersection
of the region bounded

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.490
by these three line segments.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.040
So one of them is a portion
of the y-axis, one of the them

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.121
is a portion of the line
defined by 2x minus y equals 0,

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:54.120
and one of them is a
portion of the line defined

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.690
by 2x plus y equals 2.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.320
So why don't you do
this, make sure you

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.810
use this change of variables,
and then I'll come back,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.600
and I'll draw the accompanying
region in the u, v plane,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.880
and then we'll see
how I set it up.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.720
OK, welcome back.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.360
Well, the first
thing I'm going to do

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.630
is I'm going to draw the
region in the u, v plane that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.020
is determined by this region in
the x, y plane and the change

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.090
of variables.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.710
Now, as was mentioned in the
lecture, all of the changes

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.010
are linear, and so I'm going
to be taking lines to lines.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.550
So what I'm going to do is
determine at each endpoint

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.350
here where that endpoint goes
under the transformation,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.230
and then I will
connect the dots.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.980
So what do I get?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.400
Well, this first one is (0,
0) for x and y, and so that

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.830
corresponds to x and y
are 0 here, so u is 0,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.960
and x and y are 0 here,
so it would be a 0,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.209
so that's the point (0,
0) on the u, v plane.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:04.750
Now, I want to
mention something here

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.690
is that based on how
these lines were defined,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.360
this is telling you that all
along this line 2x minus y

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.640
equals 0, that means u is equal
to 0 all along that segment.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.310
And if you'll notice also,
2x plus y is equal to 2

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.020
here, so v is equal to 2
all along this segment.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.250
So we should expect whatever
u is, v's going to be 2 here,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.580
and whatever v is here,
u is going to be 0.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.220
OK, so I'm going to have
something with u, 0 initially,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.050
and then v, 2, I
can already expect,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.290
it's going to come up here
and move over that way.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.570
But let's just check.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.210
So this is the point (0,
2), 0 for x and 2 for y.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.400
Let's see what it is
in the u, v variables.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.850
So u in that case is negative
2 and v in that case is 2,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.340
and so I'm going to
go left 2 and up 2.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.210
This might not be drawn to
scale, but this is negative 2,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.087
and this is up 2
here, and so that's

00:03:04.087 --> 00:03:05.920
where this point goes
in the transformation.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.560
This point is 1/2 comma 1.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.342
You can actually
check what it is.

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:14.050
But actually, as I
mentioned, you already

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.800
know what has to happen, because
this segment is connected right

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:30.330
here, and then we said all
along this line, v is 2,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.610
and all along this line, u is 0,
and so that actually carves out

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.290
that rectangle.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.130
So if you were worried and
you weren't able to do it

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.630
that way, what you
could actually do

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.170
is say, well, where does
the point (1/2, 1) go?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.950
If I plug in 1/2
for x and 1 for y,

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.240
I notice that I get u
equals 0 and v equals 2,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.480
and that's this point.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.906
And so now, I'm
looking at this region.

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:54.780
Now, these two things
are not drawn to scale,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.238
because what I want to point
out is they're both triangles.

00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:00.160
It's easy to find the area
based on how they're sitting

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.400
in two-dimensional space.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.510
So what we see
here is if I wanted

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.730
to find the area
of this triangle,

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.830
let's make this the base.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.300
The base is 2 and
the height is 1/2,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.510
so 1/2 of base times height
is-- that area is equal to 1/2.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.570
So the area of R is 1/2, and
what's the area of this one?

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.650
The area this one is-- well,
I've got base 2 and height 2,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.140
and so it's 1/2 of 2 times 2,
and so that gives me area as 2.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.390
So here the area is
1/2, here the area is 2,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.580
and so notice that
I've multiplied

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.730
by 4 to get from here to here.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.760
So I can anticipate
that I should

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.320
have-- based on the principle
you saw in lecture, I

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.220
should have something
like du dv is going

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.660
to be equal to 4 times dx dy.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.250
That is what I expect to get.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.500
Now let's see if when
we do the Jacobian,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.516
we get the same thing.

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:51.640
Let me double check, right?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.530
This is area 2, this is area
1/2, so I have 1/2 times

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.530
4 is going to give me 2.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.821
Yeah, that's what I should get.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.510
Oops!

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.100
That sticks out a little.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.580
So now let's just
check our Jacobian

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.990
and see if that is
indeed what we get.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.850
So I'm going to look at u sub
x, u sub y, v sub x, v sub y,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.350
right?

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.860
So u sub x is 2, u
sub y is negative 1,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.050
so I get 2, negative 1.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.130
v sub x is 2, v sub y
is 1, so I get 2, 1.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.860
2 times 1 is 2, minus negative
2 gives me, indeed, 4.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.784
So I do get, in fact, du
dv is equal to 4 dx dy.

00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:40.200
So I know that I'm going to
have to-- because I'm changing

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.310
variables, though,
from dx dy to du dv,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.000
I'm going to divide
by 4, obviously,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.570
when I do the substitution.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.850
The substitution will
be replacing just dx dy.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.140
So I just mention
that, but notice:

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.640
Again, we get what
we expect to get.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.900
We got a 4 based on the
picture and we got a 4

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.950
based on the Jacobian.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.420
And so now, we need to
finish up the process.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.530
We need to figure out how to
write this in terms of u and v

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.910
and then figure out our
bounds in terms of u and v,

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.720
and then we're done.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.090
So let me mention, one
thing you should notice

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.110
is that u times v is
equal to exactly-- this

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.160
is going to be a
difference of two squares,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.410
and it is precisely 4 x
squared minus y squared.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.300
If you need to multiply it out
to check, you can check it,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.410
but that's indeed what it is,
which is why this particular

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.260
substitution is quite nice,
because that means this

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.420
function I'm supposed to be
integrating is just u*v raised

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.030
to the fourth.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.370
So I'm almost done.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.890
So let me write in the
pieces I know, and then we'll

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.110
fill in the last two spots,
or four spots, which will be

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.360
all the bounds on the integral.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.750
So I'm going to write
it here, give myself

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.960
some space to write the bounds.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.720
So I'm replacing the 4 x squared
minus y squared by a u*v,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.450
so I'm going to get u times
v, and then the function,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.585
that is raised to the fourth
in the initial problem,

00:07:00.585 --> 00:07:02.450
so I raise that to the fourth.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.970
Then dx dy, as I
mentioned, will be replaced

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.190
by a du dv divided by 4.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.906
And so I can just put this
over 4 and write du dv.

00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:13.780
I should be careful
which order I want to do.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.960
It doesn't really matter.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.250
I can do either one.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.990
du dv, OK?

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.240
And so now I want to
know what u goes from

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.600
and to and then what v
has to go from and to.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.667
So if I come over
here, you'll see

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:27.250
it didn't matter,
because I could have

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.540
picked either direction to go.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.710
But if I'm going
to go with u, I'm

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.290
coming from whatever this
function is over to here,

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.790
right?

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.330
And this value here is easy.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.930
That's u equals 0.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.560
So the top bound for u is 0,
and the bottom bound for u,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.650
this is v is equal to minus
u, so the bottom bound for u

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.690
is when u is equal
to negative v.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.150
So I'm running from-- because
I put the du on the inside,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.320
my first one is
running from minus v

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.420
to-- what did I say-- 0, and
then the v-values from there

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.940
go between 0 and 2.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.320
You can see this easily
from the picture.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.370
So they go between 0 and 2.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.440
And I am not going to finish it
off from here, because it would

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.480
require not too much work.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.750
It's actually quite
simple, because it's just

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.175
a polynomial and u and
a polynomial and v,

00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:19.800
but there are a lot
of powers and there

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.300
will be big powers of 2.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.760
So suffice it to
say, at this point,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.120
we can evaluate this
integral and it's quite easy

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.822
to evaluate.

00:08:26.822 --> 00:08:28.530
And the main point I
think we should make

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.320
is how did it make it simpler?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.940
I mean, the initial problem,
if we come over here,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.900
this is annoying to
find an anti-derivative,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.350
but not impossible.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.639
But the really
annoying part is I

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:43.430
would have to take this
region and split it

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.570
into a bunch of pieces,
or at least two pieces,

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.100
to evaluate the integral
in a reasonable way

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.191
or my y-values would go from
this line here up to this line

00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:52.690
here.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.170
It could be complicated.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.260
So what we've really done is
we've simplified the region.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.510
That's the easiest thing.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.680
I mean, we also
simplified the function,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.350
but we've really simplified the
region we're integrating over.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.540
And so we only have-- one is a
function and one is a constant,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.530
and that's quite nice
to have on the inside.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.880
So I think that's
where I'll stop.

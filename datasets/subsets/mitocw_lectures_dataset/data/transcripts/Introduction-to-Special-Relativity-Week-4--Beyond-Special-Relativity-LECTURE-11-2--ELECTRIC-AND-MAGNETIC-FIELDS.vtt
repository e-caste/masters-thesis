MARKUS KLUTE:
Welcome back to 8.20.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.395
So this section is a preview
or maybe a review of 8.02

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:16.270
depending on whether or
not you have listened

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.360
to electromagnetism
[? already. ?] So first I just

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.890
want to remind you how we relate
electric and magnetic fields

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.290
and how we can describe
them from a different moving

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.410
reference [? point. ?] So if
the reference point moving in x

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.950
direction, then the x component
of the fields do not change.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.650
But the transverse
components do change,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.280
as we have discussed before.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.500
The core of this
section is about how

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.540
the fields-- the electric
and magnetic fields

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.250
are actually
generated by charges

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.230
and their distributions.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.280
And this relation is described
by Maxwell's equation.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.490
The entirety of 8.02 are
classes on electromagnetism

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.280
is about how to understand
Maxwell's equations.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.400
So I'll do this here in a
very short and brief manner.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.050
So you can write
Maxwell equations

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.620
in four different equations.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.800
The first one is
called Gauss's law.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.480
And if you read the
equation, it just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.940
says that the divergence
of an electric field

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.450
gives the density of
the source or the charge

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.070
density of the source.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.370
You can also read this equation
by saying a charge density

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.830
generates an electric field.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.630
So charges generate
electric fields.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.270
Similarly, Gauss's
law for magnetism

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.500
can be read as magnetic charges
generate magnetic fields.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.750
Or the diversion of
the magnetic field

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.850
is the density of
the magnetic source.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.560
However in nature, we haven't
observed magnetic monopoles

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.100
or at least not yet.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.760
And so therefore,
there's no such thing.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.580
There's no magnetic density.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.340
You can read this equation also
saying that all magnetic field

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.290
lines need to be closed.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.527
And so that's another
way to look at this.

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:04.110
And we have Faraday's
law, which means

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.290
that we can induce
electric fields

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.280
in a coil equal to negative
change of the magnetic field.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.380
In other way, if you want
to create an electric field,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.140
you can do this with a charge.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.690
Or you can do this by changing,
as a function of time,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.190
the magnetic field.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.830
Changing magnetic fields
generate electric fields.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.890
And very similarly, we
can look at Ampere's law

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.000
and saying that changing
electric fields generate

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.200
magnetic fields.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.620
And you can also generate
magnetic fields with a current,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.190
as we have seen in the
previous [? section. ?]

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.340
So this is how we can
understand [INAUDIBLE] Maxwell's

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.990
equations.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.030
The difficulty
now, 8.02, is often

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.880
to understand the concept
of fields, the fact

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.400
that there is a
[? vector ?] describing

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.980
the strengths of
this abstract thing,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.382
of an electric or magnetic
field somewhere in space or

00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:02.840
[INAUDIBLE] are
changing this time.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.220
That's [? complicated. ?]

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.620
And then there is
also a little bit

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.220
of functional analysis
needed in order to understand

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.630
and how to apply the electric
field by a specific charge.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.600
Those cases can often
be simplified by having

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.020
symmetric configurations,
like a charged atmosphere,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.140
or a point charge,
or a cylinder,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.060
or charges along the line.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.420
In those cases, those
integrals or those divergences

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.920
can be calculated in a
straightforward manner.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.570
OK, so then there's
another aspect

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.810
which is relating
[? charge/discharge ?]

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.700
distributions or
fields to forces.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.240
And that's done
by Lorentz force.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.200
So the force of the
charged particles

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.570
which is moving in
electromagnetic field

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.050
is given by the strength
of the charge itself

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.430
times the electric field, plus
the velocity of the charge,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.180
plus the strength of
the magnetic field.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.980
OK, what that means is I can--

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.560
if I put a charge in an electric
field, it's being pulled.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.060
It's being accelerated.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.850
If I have a moving charge
in a magnetic field,

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.100
it's being bend around or
the force bending it around.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.710
And then I can have this
relativistic equation

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.459
of motion, which uses our
relativistic equation of motion

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.050
and sets it equal to
our Lorentz force.

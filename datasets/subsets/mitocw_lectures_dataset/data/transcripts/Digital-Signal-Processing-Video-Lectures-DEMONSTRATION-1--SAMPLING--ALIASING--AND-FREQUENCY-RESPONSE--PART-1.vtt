ALAN OPPENHEIM:
In This lecture, I

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.080
would like to demonstrate
the effects of sampling

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.740
and aliasing, and also, some of
the properties of discrete time

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.630
linear systems.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.850
What we'll be using
to demonstrate

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.110
this is a programmable digital
filter, which is contained

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.470
in this box,
programmable in the sense

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.650
that many of the parameters
of the filter-- for example,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.190
the filter coefficients, the
coefficient and arithmetic word

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.440
length, the sampling rate
etc, are easily changed.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.080
In other words, programmable.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.390
So this is the basic
digital filter.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.850
And then, of course, we have
some associated equipment

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.730
to help us with
the demonstration.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.950
Well, we'll be returning to this
filter in a few minutes, when,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.640
together with my colleagues,
Mike Portnoff and Dave Harris,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.040
I'll be demonstrating
several of the ideas

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.030
that we're about to talk about.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.170
But first of all, let me
explain what the basic setup is.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.910
The programmable digital
filter consists, essentially

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:01.860
of a system which is a sampler,
a continuous time, or C

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.630
to D converter, which converts
an impulse train to a sequence,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.200
a digital filter to
obtain a filtered output

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
sequence, a "discrete
time to time" converter

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.090
to convert the sequence
back to an impulse train,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.780
and finally a D-sampling or
smoothing low-pass filter.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.770
So at this point, we have
a continuous time input.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.610
At this point, we have a
continuous time impulse train,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.090
at this point, a sequence,
then a sequence here,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.540
an impulse train, and back
to a smooth, continuous time

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.490
function.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.710
For the first part
of the demonstration,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.950
what I would like to
focus on is just simply

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.490
the effects of
sampling and aliasing.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.740
And so for the first
part, I'll just

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.050
simply choose this
digital filter

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.220
to be an identity system.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.730
In other words, the impulse
response of this system

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.440
is just simply an impulse.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.900
In that case, this
overall system

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.080
collapses to a somewhat
simpler system,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.010
as I have on this
next viewgraph where

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.590
we convert from a continuous
time input to a sequence

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.540
and then back to the
continuous time input.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.320
And, in fact, we could really
collapse the A to D or C

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.170
to D converter and
D to A converter

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.980
together since we're simply
converting from an impulse

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.420
train to a sequence and then
back to the same impulse train.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.550
To see what the
effect of this system

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.600
is in both the time domain
and frequency domain,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.920
we can look at the associated
time waveforms and spectra.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.340
On the left-hand side, we have
the associated time wave forms

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.270
and sequences.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.170
On the right-hand side, the
associated Fourier transforms.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.340
So we can think of an input
continuous time function, which

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.750
is of some general form, with
a band-limited spectrum--

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.430
band-limited from minus
omega c to plus omega c.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.550
When we sample this
to obtain the impulse

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.000
train with a sampling
period of capital T

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the associated spectrum is
then a periodic replication

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.440
of this band-limited spectrum.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.480
So we have the Fourier
transform of x of a of t.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.090
Then the same thing
reproduce that multiples

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.910
of 2 pi over capital T

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.580
When we then convert
this to a sequence, that

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.150
implies a frequency
normalization,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.120
a normalization of the frequency
axis, so that this periodicity

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.570
gets converted to a
periodicity with a period of 2

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.920
pi in the digital frequency
variable small omega.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.010
Otherwise, the general shape
of the Fourier transform

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.480
stays the same.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.970
We then go back through
the system, converting.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.960
Back to an impulse
train and then finally,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.690
by low-pass
filtering, we extract

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.970
just the one replication of
the original Fourier transform.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.140
And what we would recover
is x of a of j omega.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.930
We would recover
this exactly provided

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.970
that the bandwidth is
small enough compared

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.030
with the sampling frequency.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.660
If, on the other hand, omega
sub c is too large in relation

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.470
to the sampling frequency,
then what we end up with

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.460
is an interaction between
these two pieces of the Fourier

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.660
transform.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.100
And that interaction is what's
referred to as aliasing.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.980
The effect aliasing
is most easily

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.910
understood in terms of
a simple example, namely

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.870
a sinusoidal input.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.560
So let's consider,
specifically, what

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.260
happens with the spectra in
the case of a sinusoidal input.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.680
Here, we have an
input cosine omega 0t,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.470
an assumed sampling rate of
2 pi over capital T. This

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.620
then is the Fourier transform
of this sinusoid or cosine.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.670
After sampling, that is just
simply periodically repeated

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.010
with a period equal to
the sampling frequency.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:38.470
And we see that if omega 0, the
input frequency is low enough,

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:46.230
then the original spectrum,
or Fourier transform,

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.640
falls within the passband
of the low-pass filter.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.120
This dashed line corresponds
to the frequency response,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.880
an ideal frequency
response, associated

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.320
with the D-sampling
low-pass filter.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.650
And, of course, if the spectral
fall, as I've shown in here,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.440
then there is no aliasing.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.340
In other words, what we
recover at the output

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.860
of the low-pass
filter is just simply

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.460
the original Fourier
transform, or equivalently,

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.470
the original signal.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.140
Now, let's consider,
on the other hand,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.830
the effect of increasing
omega 0, the input frequency,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.180
and we can think in
particular of what

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.800
the effect is on each one of
these impulses in the Fourier

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.150
transform.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.350
As omega 0 increases, this
impulse moves to the right,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.000
this impulse moves to the left.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.230
And likewise, in the
periodic replications,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.750
this impulse moves
down in frequency.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.960
This impulse moves
up in frequency, etc.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:58.740
Now, if omega sub s minus omega
0 is greater than omega 0,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.530
then these two impulses
haven't crossed.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:08.190
However, if omega sub s minus
omega 0 is less than omega 0,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.500
then the situation
that we have is

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.480
what I've illustrated here,
where now, the impulses that

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.120
lie in the passband
of the filter

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.620
are at the frequency
omega sub s minus omega 0

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.380
rather than at the
frequency omega 0.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.310
So as we think of increasing
the input frequency, what

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.280
happens for a while, is
that the output frequency

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.409
will correspondingly increase.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.490
But after we've increased
omega 0 past this point,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.760
then the output of
the low-pass filter

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.640
will decrease in
frequency because it's

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.560
taken on the alias of a new
frequency or a new sinusoid.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.570
And so the output,
in, that case is

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.510
cosine omega sub
s minus omega 0.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.960
And there's a
little t over here.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.600
There is-- I want to
demonstrate this effect.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.760
There is another
effect that we'll

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.150
observe in the process
of demonstrating

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.500
this, because of the fact that
in any real-world situation,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.540
in fact, this
low-pass filter is not

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.660
going to be an ideal low-pass
filter, as I've shown here

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.340
but in fact, is going
to have some transition

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.220
with associated with it.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.940
And so as omega 0 and
omega sub s minus omega 0

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.990
get very close in frequency,
in essence, both of them

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.550
are having some influence on
the output because of the fact

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.850
that there isn't infinite
attenuation of one

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.390
of the impulses an exact
replication of the other.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.220
So what we'll see
in that case, as we

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.730
get an input frequency which
is close to half the sampling

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.020
frequency, will see, in addition
to the effective aliasing

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.760
that we want to
demonstrate, we'll

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.920
see an effect
which, essentially,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.630
is a beating phenomenon.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.810
So let's move over
to the digital filter

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.640
and demonstrate these effects,
where I remind you now

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.160
that this filter, the
digital filter aspect of it,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.610
is just simply an identity
system so that it corresponds

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.450
to sampling, and then
simply sampling and low-pass

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.580
filtering.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:26.580
What we have as an input, if
we look at the oscilloscope,

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.470
is on the upper trace, the input
sinusoid, on the lower trace,

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.180
the output sinusoid.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.420
And as we see it right
now, the input sinusoid

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.520
has chosen to be low enough
frequency so that, in fact,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.310
there is no aliasing.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:46.330
Well, let's now increase
the input frequency.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.010
And what we'll observe is
that the output frequency

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.380
increases likewise.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.370
The output frequency is still
equal to the input frequency.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.890
We're now getting
into the vicinity

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.900
of half the sampling
frequency so

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.660
that what we're beginning
to see now in the output

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.090
is not just a sinusoidal output.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.910
But in fact, what we see
are the two components.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.530
In other words, we see the
beating effect due to the fact

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:18.490
that the low-pass filter is
not an ideal low-pass filter.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:24.270
Now what we want to observe as
we sweep past half the sampling

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.090
frequency is the aliasing
effect-- in other words,

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.240
the fact that the
output sinusoid

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.070
will decrease in frequency.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.850
Let's first sweep
back down to DC.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.810
So the output sinusoid
follows the input sinusoid.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.900
And then we'll sweep
automatically from 0

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.660
up to the sampling frequency.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.740
And let's see that.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.390
So on the bottom trace
is the output sinusoid.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.450
The top trace is
the input sinusoid.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.190
Were now in the vicinity of
half the sampling frequency.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.800
We're now past half
the sampling frequency.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.830
And you see that the output
is decreasing in frequency

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.390
while the input was increasing.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.330
Let's finally look
at that again.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.430
But this time, let's also
listen to the output sinusoid.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.010
And what you'll hear, in
addition to observing this

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.870
on the bottom
trace of the scope,

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.500
is the fact that the
output frequency first

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.670
increases, and then decreases,
even though the input frequency

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.472
is continuing to increase.

00:12:25.472 --> 00:12:26.430
So let's do that again.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.650
But now, in this case,
let's listen to the output.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.638
[SOUND WAVES RISE AND LOWER]

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.690
OK, now what we would
now like to consider

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.200
is the effect of
actually carrying out

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.360
some digital
filtering in-between

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.430
the sampling and D-sampling.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:13:00.510
And so let me return
to the basic system

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:11.750
again where we had previously
removed this digital filter.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.400
And now, what we
want to consider

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.080
is the effect of the overall
system, when we, in fact,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.660
insert an interesting,
or a more interesting,

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.610
digital filter in the middle.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.390
The digital filter that
we're going to insert

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.680
is a low-pass filter.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.740
And the impulse response
of the low-pass filter,

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.290
or the unit sample response
of the low-pass filter,

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.660
is, as I've shown up here.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.380
And it's a symmetric
unit sample response.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.730
And consequently, it corresponds
to a linear phase filter.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.740
The associated
frequency response

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.420
I show down here, where this
is now the filter passband.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.010
This is the filter stop band.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.170
And, of course,
there is some ripple.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.320
There is an infinite
attenuation in the stopband.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.290
And I remind you of the
fact that, of course,

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.370
the digital filter frequency
response must, by necessity, be

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.720
periodic with a period of 2 pi.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.800
The cutoff frequency associated
with the particular filter

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.610
that we want to
demonstrate is pi over 5,

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.650
or one tenth of 2 pi.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.100
And the factor one
tenth is a factor

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.010
that I'll want to
refer to again shortly.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.550
Now, the overall
system, of course,

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.590
is a continuous time system.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.920
In other words, we have
a continuous time input.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.540
We have a continuous
time output.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.320
And the question
then is, what is

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.490
the equivalent continuous
time system in relation

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.820
to the digital filter
frequency response

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.240
that we have illustrated here?

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.470
In other words, what is the
equivalent frequency response

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.450
of the corresponding
continuous time system?

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.320
We can answer that
by simply referring

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.040
to the basic definition
of frequency response

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.710
for the continuous time
case and frequency response

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.070
for the discrete time case.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.290
In the continuous time case, for
a linear time invariant filter,

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.170
the frequency
response is defined

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:26.210
as the gain change applied
to a complex exponential.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:30.300
So if we consider a complex
exponential as the input,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.980
then the output of the system
is a complex exponential

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.000
at the same complex frequency,
but with an amplitude,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.440
which is equal to the frequency
response of the system

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.960
at that frequency.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.350
Likewise, for a
discrete time system,

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.170
we can consider a
complex exponential input

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.600
at a frequency small omega.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.080
And the output is a
complex exponential

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.220
at the same complex frequency,
with an amplitude change,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:05.480
which is the frequency
response of the digital filter,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.620
or discrete time filter, again
evaluated at that frequency.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.340
Well, simply from
these definitions,

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.500
we can trace our way
through the system

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.810
and see fairly easily what
the equivalent analog,

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:25.910
or continuous time filter
frequency, response is.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.240
Let's consider the
overall system.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.590
And let's choose an input,
which is a complex exponential.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.800
And we'll choose the complex
exponential carefully

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.620
to avoid aliasing.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.770
We then sample this
complex exponential

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.870
and convert that to a sequence.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.810
And the sequence
values are there

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:50.630
for e to the j omega
and capital T. Well,

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.730
this is just the
discrete time complex

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:58.190
exponential with a frequency of
capital omega times capital T.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.400
So the output of
the digital filter

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.880
is a complex exponential with
the same complex frequency,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.910
capital omega times capital
T, with an amplitude,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:13.400
which is the frequency response
of this filter evaluated

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.780
at the frequency of the input--

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.450
In other words, evaluated at
capital omega times capital T.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.300
Then we convert that
back to an impulse train,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.550
and finally, low-pass filter.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.990
And the output of
the low-pass filter

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:35.000
then has the same amplitude,
but now multiplying

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.820
a continuous time
complex exponential

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.890
at the original input frequency.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.160
So simply from the
definition comparing this

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.940
to the input from the definition
of the continuous time

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.570
frequency response, the
continuous time frequency

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.180
response is equal to this term.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.060
In other words, it's
the frequency response

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:01.040
of the digital filter, but with
a rescaling of the frequency

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.010
axis--

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.490
in other words, with
the digital frequency

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:10.920
variable small omega replaced by
capital omega times capital T.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.880
The consequence of that for the
particular digital filter that

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.720
we're talking about-- or, in
fact, for any digital filter--

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.320
is that the
continuous time filter

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.640
frequency response has the same
shape as the digital filter

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.980
frequency response, but has
a rescaled frequency axis--

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.550
rescaled according
to this scaling.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.190
And in essence, what the
rescaling corresponds

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.060
to-- and I think you can
verify this on your own--

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:50.220
is to reconvert or rescale the
frequency 2 pi in small omega

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.510
to the sampling
frequency in large omega.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.630
And the upshot of
all of this, is

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.540
that this cutoff frequency,
which in a digital filter

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:07.320
is a pi over 5, is now rescaled
to pi over 5 capital T.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.710
And what we would observe
is that as capital T,

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.410
the sampling period
changes, then

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.110
the bandwidth, or
the cutoff frequency,

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.830
of the continuous time
filter changes also.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.780
So let me remind you of the
fact that the digital filter had

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:30.060
a cutoff frequency
which was 1/10 of 2 pi.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.860
2 pi gets rescaled to
the sampling frequency

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.680
in the continuous time domain.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.530
And the filter cutoff
frequency will then

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:46.960
get rescaled to one tenth of
the filter sampling frequency.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.120
Let's illustrate
some of these effects

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.730
with the digital filter.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:56.590
What we have, as I said was,
is a low pass filter impulse

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.840
response and frequency response.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.690
First let's look at
the impulse response

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.180
of the filter of the overall
system-- in other words,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:10.480
after the D-sampling
low-pass filter.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.510
What we see here is the impulse
response of the overall system.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.440
And we observe, for one thing,
that it's a symmetrical impulse

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.620
response-- in other words,
corresponds to a linear phase

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.710
filter.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.860
We can also look at
the impulse response

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.340
before the D-sampling
low-pass filter.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.270
Lets take out that the
D-sampling low-pass

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.520
filter slowly.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.540
And what we observe is
basically the output

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.840
of the digital-to-analog
converter, which,

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.470
of course, is a staircase or
boxcar function, not an impulse

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.280
train.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.130
In the real world, the output
of a [? D-day ?] converter

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.070
generally is a boxcar
type of function.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.010
We can put the D sampling
filter back in now.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.760
And notice that the effect
of the D-sampling filter is

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:03.670
basically to smooth out the
rough edges in the boxcar

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.526
output from the [?
D-day ?] converter.

00:21:06.526 --> 00:21:09.010
All right, now what
we'd like to demonstrate

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:14.140
is the actual frequency response
of the overall continuous time

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.130
filter.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.570
And we can do that by
sweeping the system

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.430
with a sinusoidal input.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.150
And what we expect
to see, of course,

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.080
is as the sinusoidal
input frequency gets

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.440
past the effective
cutoff frequency,

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.150
then the output sinusoid
is greatly attenuated.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.970
Let's now sweep the
filter frequency response.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.160
And there is the filter
cutoff frequency.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.270
We can demonstrate the
filter characteristics

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.320
in several other ways.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.890
One way is to choose, as a
display, instead of the output

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.760
as a function of time, we can
display the output sinusoid

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.690
as a function of frequency.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.040
And so we'll observe that
on the left-hand scope,

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.540
while on the
right-hand scope, we'll

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.540
have the same trace
that we just saw, namely

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.750
two traces the upper trace
as the input sinusoid,

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.420
the lower trace as
the output sinusoid.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.050
And in addition to observing
the frequency response,

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.200
let's also listen to
the output sinusoid

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.710
and observe the
attenuation in the output

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.050
as we go from the filter
passband to the filter

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.100
stopband.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.160
Again, a 20-kilohertz
sampling rate and a sweep

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.900
range from 0 to 10 kilohertz.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.184
[SOUND WAVES RISE]

00:22:48.957 --> 00:22:50.790
Now, of course we're
in the filter stopband.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:59.930
Now, if we increase the sweep
range from 10 kilohertz to 20

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:03.420
kilohertz so that the sweep
range is equal to the sampling

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.210
frequency, in essence,
that corresponds

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:10.710
to sweeping out the digital
filter from 0 to 2 pi.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.930
And in that case,
we'll begin to see

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.840
some of the periodicity in
the digital filter frequency

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.930
response.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.490
So let's do that now with
a 20-kilohertz sampling

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.445
rate and a sweep range
of 0 to 20 kilohertz.

00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:25.676
[SOUND WAVES RISE AND FALL]

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:36.770
Now we come near 2 pi, we
get back into the passband,

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.060
and finally, back to a
0- to 10-kilohertz sweep

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.500
so they were again, sweeping
only from 0 to pi with regard

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.863
to the digital filter.

00:23:47.863 --> 00:23:50.809
[SOUND WAVES RISE]

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.560
OK, now, what we would
like to demonstrate

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.840
is the effect of changing
the sampling frequency.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.790
And we know that the sampling--
that the effective filter

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.440
cutoff frequency is tied
to the sampling frequency,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.050
and for this particular
filter, corresponds

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.990
to a tenth of the
sampling frequency.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.570
Consequently, if we double
the sampling frequency,

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.770
we should double the effective
filter passband width

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.010
or double the filter
cutoff frequency.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.380
And so let's do that now.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.140
Again, a 0 to 10
kilohertz sweep range,

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.307
but a 40-kilohertz
sampling frequency.

00:24:38.307 --> 00:24:40.602
[SOUND WAVES RISE]

00:24:40.602 --> 00:24:45.040
And we should observe that the
filter cutoff frequency has now

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.200
doubled out to 4 kilohertz.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:54.260
Now let's begin to decrease
the filter sampling frequency.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.890
So from 40, let's change
the sampling frequency

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:58.620
to 20 kilohertz.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.354
And we should see the cutoff
frequency cut in half.

00:25:03.354 --> 00:25:05.844
[SOUND WAVES RISE]

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.970
Now we can go even further.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.910
We can cut the sampling
frequency down to 10 kilohertz.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.160
And remember that the sweep
range is 0 to 10 kilohertz.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.506
So now we'll be
sweeping from 0 to 2 pi.

00:25:24.506 --> 00:25:26.876
[SOUND WAVES RISE]

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.490
So as we get close to 2 pi,
we'll see the passband again.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.560
[SOUND WAVES FALL]

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.200
And now, let's cut down the
sampling frequency even further

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.965
to 5 kilohertz.

00:25:43.965 --> 00:25:46.310
[SOUND WAVES RISE]

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.928
Here we are at 2 pi.

00:25:48.928 --> 00:25:51.320
[SOUND WAVES RISE]

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.000
And then at 4 pi.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.590
[SOUND WAVES FALL]

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.640
Now finally, let's
demonstrate this effect

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.570
of changing the
effective filter cutoff

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:06.200
frequency by changing the
sampling rate by carrying out

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.380
some low-pass filtering
on some live audio.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.520
And we'll demonstrate this
by listening to the audio,

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:20.750
and also, observing the audio
on on a single trace, namely,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.430
the time waveform.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.680
And we'll begin it with a
sampling frequency of 40

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.550
kilohertz, change that then to
20 kilohertz, 10 kilohertz, 5,

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.580
and then 2 and 1/2,
corresponding to a filter

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.570
cutoff frequency then of 4
kilohertz, then 2 kilohertz,

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:43.520
then 1 kilohertz,
then 500, , 250 etc.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.250
So let's begin 40 kilohertz.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.916
And then we'll
work our way down.

00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:52.286
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.470
Now, let's reduce that to
a 20-kilohertz frequency

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.220
or a 2-kilohertz filter.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.760
And 10 kilohertz
sampling frequency.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.130
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.850
And finally, a 5-kilohertz
sampling frequency

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:20.480
corresponding to make 500-cycle
equivalent analog filter.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.815
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.370
All right, now let's
finally conclude

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:31.020
by returning to a little
higher quality ragtime

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.580
by changing the sampling
rates back to 40 kilohertz.

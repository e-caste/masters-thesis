00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.060
ADAM MARTIN: So, last semester,
my grandfather passed away,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.000
and I was responsible for
explaining to my two sons

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.210
how a funeral works.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.619
So I'm a professor, right?

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.220
I pride myself on being able
to explain things clearly.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.880
So I went to tell
my five-year-old son

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.220
sort of what's going
on during the funeral.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.375
I told him, your papa's body is
up in that wooden box up there.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.000
We're going to
celebrate him right now.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.070
We're going to go
to the cemetery,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.760
and then we're
going to bury him.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.960
And you know, I'm a professor.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.390
I thought I nailed it, OK?

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.000
Except my son was
showing this looking

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.890
look of concern in his eyes.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.790
And he looked at me.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.940
He was like, what
about his head?

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.320
So my plea for this
semester is please let me

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.815
know when I've forgotten
the part about the head, OK?

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:16.440
You know, you guys
are listening to me.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.160
I might have forgotten
something that,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.670
to me, seems kind of obvious,
but that, for you, it

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.600
would help to know to
understand the material.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.930
So today, we're going
to start with cells.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.190
And so here, you can see this
is one of my favorite movies.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.000
This is a neutrophil cell
here that's migrating.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.010
You can see it's chasing
after this smaller

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.040
cell which is a bacteria cell.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.125
And around this neutrophil,
what you're seeing here

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:46.750
are these red blood
cells, which aren't

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.380
doing very much of anything.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.990
So the point I'm
making with this video

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.330
is that cells have a
huge amount of diversity.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.100
So cells have diversity.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.460
As you can see from the video,
there's a diversity in size.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.035
There's diversity in shape and
also diversity in behavior.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.070
OK, so we're going to
unpack this a little bit.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.110
And I just want to start
by just pointing out

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.050
that until now in the
semester, we've dealt mainly

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.390
with very small things, such as
atoms, small molecules, lipids,

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.650
and proteins.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.410
And the size of these
structures, they're

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.870
on the nanometer scale.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.585
Now, cells are a
unit up in size.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.520
Cells span several orders
of magnitude in size.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.770
So bacterial cells
are on the small side.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.970
They're on the 1 micron
to 10 micron size.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.290
So you can see that here.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.340
Most bacteria is about
1 micron to 10 micron.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.170
But our cells span from tens of
microns to hundreds of microns,

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.490
and even larger than that,
because the human egg

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.120
is on the order of a
millimeter in size.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.120
This is not a human egg,
but this is a frog egg.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.560
You can see often the egg cells
are the biggest of all cells.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.470
The biggest cell
is an ostrich egg.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.440
It's about 15
centimeters, I believe.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.238
So cells span a huge,
wide range of sizes.

00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:37.030
I'm going to start with
the simplest, which

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.770
is a bacteria cell.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.230
And what I want to point
out about this cell

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.150
is its simplicity.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.990
So here, you can see this
is an electron micrograph

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.160
of bacterial cell here.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
And this is a cartoon
just illustrating

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.900
some of the key features.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.540
You have a plasma
membrane and a cell wall.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.750
The cell wall here is in sort
of-- the periplasmic space

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.320
is in green.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.440
And this encapsulates
the cytoplasm.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.690
And the only other real
structure you can see,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.440
in this case, is this nucleoid
structure in the middle.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.975
And what the
nucleoid is, is it's

00:04:13.975 --> 00:04:16.300
just the chromosome
of the bacterium.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.700
And I want to point out
that later on in the course,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.850
Professor Imperiali is going
to come back and tell you

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.890
about antibiotics and
how bacteria can develop

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.580
antibiotic resistance, which
is of critical importance

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.080
for biology and medicine.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.280
So our cells are more
complicated than this.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.920
And that's because if
you look at this EM here,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.930
you can see that
eukaryotic cells--

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.900
and we are eukaryotes--

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.840
have membrane-bound
compartments.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.900
There's a nucleus here that
houses our nuclear DNA.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.190
And also, there's a series
of membrane compartments

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.870
that span the cytoplasm.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.880
Now, our cells, even in a single
organism, such as us, our cells

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.620
have incredible diversity
and specialization.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.220
So there's diversity
within a single organism.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.400
There is specialization.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.110
So as we develop
from a single cell,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.720
our cells acquire
properties that

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.640
allow them to carry out specific
functions in our bodies.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.540
And an extreme example
of this is shown up here.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.760
These are pictures or drawings
of neurons from Ramon y Cajal,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.740
and you can see how
this looks nothing

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.640
like the cartoon picture of
a cell I just showed you.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.030
These cells have
highly dendritic sort

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.010
of arrays of protrusions.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.160
And these cells
have evolved such

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.940
that they are very good at sort
of transmitting information

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.140
in the body, right?

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.260
An extreme example of a
nerve is a sciatic nerve,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.020
which extends from the
base of your spinal cord

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.650
all the way down into your foot.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.010
So it's about a meter long.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.120
That's an extreme
specialization for a cell.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.490
So these cells are
specialized, but what's

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.190
important to note is that
within a single organism,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.530
the genomic DNA of a cell
is more or less the same.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:42.140
So genomic DNA is the same, with
some exceptions, some of which

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.700
we'll get to in the course.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.930
The genomic DNA is the same.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.750
What's different
is the genes that

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.740
are being expressed in
these cells and the proteins

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.680
that they encode that give
these cells different functions.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.910
So what's different and
what allows cells to acquire

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.970
these different functionalities
is this different gene

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.085
expression.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.310
OK, so that's the overview.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.340
Now I want to talk
about compartments.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.690
And if we go back
to this cartoon

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.612
that I showed you from your--

00:07:34.612 --> 00:07:37.130
oh, I just wanted to
point out that right now,

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.180
at MIT and the Broad,
there is a project

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.490
that's ongoing to really
define all the cell types that

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.750
are present in humans.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.970
And this is known as
the Human Cell Atlas.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.470
And I just want you
to take a minute

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.180
to think about if you wanted
to define different cell types,

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.110
what would you look at to
classify these cell types?

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.150
Anyone have an idea?

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.650
Yes?

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.160
What's your name?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.020
AUDIENCE: Rachel.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.900
ADAM MARTIN: Rachel.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.310
AUDIENCE: Cell function.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:09.640
ADAM MARTIN: What's that?

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.450
AUDIENCE: Function.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.970
ADAM MARTIN: You could
look at function.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.960
That might be a little
subjective in how to interpret.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.191
What defines the
function of the cell?

00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:20.995
AUDIENCE: I'm thinking
like what it does

00:08:20.995 --> 00:08:22.790
and how it works
with other cells.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.290
ADAM MARTIN: But
is there something,

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.850
I guess, within
that cell that would

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.010
define what its function is?

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:29.510
Yeah?

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.450
What's your name?

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.213
AUDIENCE: Samantar

00:08:31.213 --> 00:08:32.130
ADAM MARTIN: Samantar?

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.200
AUDIENCE: Samantar

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.150
ADAM MARTIN: Samantac
All right, yeah?

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.530
AUDIENCE: Gene expression data.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.030
ADAM MARTIN: Gene
expression, right?

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.570
What genes are these
cells expressing?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.680
So what they're doing is
they're isolating single cells

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.790
from tissues.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.920
And then they're looking
at gene expression.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.820
So which type of
molecule here would

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.640
be the molecule you'd want
to look at if you want

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.172
to look at gene expression?

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.880
Not Miles.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.182
Malik.

00:09:07.182 --> 00:09:09.265
AUDIENCE: You look at mRNA.

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:10.390
ADAM MARTIN: mRNA, exactly.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.350
Malik is exactly right.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.330
So you look at the mRNA, right?

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.550
Because if there's mRNA, that
means that gene was expressed,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.452
and it's possibly encoding
the translation of a protein.

00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:25.660
So that's what they're doing.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.450
They're isolating single cells
and doing a massive single cell

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.100
RNA seek project.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.140
And that's helping
to identify new cell

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.010
types in the human body.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.930
OK, coming back to compartments.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.550
So I showed you this picture.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.420
You can see there are lots of
membrane-bound compartments

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.040
in the cell.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.880
You can see the
lines in this cartoon

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.040
represent lipid bilayers.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.410
And so these are
compartments that

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.373
are completely encapsulated
by a lipid bilayer.

00:09:56.373 --> 00:09:58.040
And I'm going to
remind you of something

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.100
that Professor Imperiali
told you about already.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.720
And the reason I'm
saying it again

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.320
is because it is so
freaking important, OK?

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.670
So if we consider
a lipid bilayer

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.330
where the circles are the
polar head groups of the lipids

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.900
and the squiggly lines are
the fatty acid chains--

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.135
I'm not going to draw all
the fatty acid chains.

00:10:24.635 --> 00:10:25.760
So this is a lipid bilayer.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:37.810
And these head groups, are they
hydrophilic or hydrophobic?

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:38.310
Yes?

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.760
What's your name?

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.140
AUDIENCE: Stephen.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.184
ADAM MARTIN: Stephen.

00:10:40.184 --> 00:10:40.940
AUDIENCE: They're hydrophilic.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.880
ADAM MARTIN:
They're hydrophilic.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.840
They like water, right?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.200
The water is on the
different faces here.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.610
These are hydrophilic.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.570
How about this
central region here?

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.070
Yes?

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:57.570
Name?

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.240
AUDIENCE: Ory.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.003
ADAM MARTIN: Ory.

00:10:59.003 --> 00:10:59.920
AUDIENCE: Hydrophobic.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.620
ADAM MARTIN:
Hydrophobic, good, right?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.230
That's excellent.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.910
So these are hydrophobic.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.360
Hydrophobic.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.080
So what that means is you have
this hydrophobic layer that is

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.600
surrounding each of
these compartments,

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.050
and that's going to serve
as a barrier such that water

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.050
and things dissolved in water
cannot pass through this

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.580
barrier unless
something allows it to.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.730
So each of these compartments
are membrane bound,

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.750
have properties in
the lumen that's

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.490
in the interior of
the compartment that's

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.400
going to be different from
that of the cytoplasm.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.310
And the cell, the
interior of the cytoplasm,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.310
is going to be different from
that of the extracellular

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.560
space.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.750
So let me just give
you some examples

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.620
of how things are different
inside and outside the cell

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.320
and also inside and
outside these compartments.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:07.510
So if we consider the
plasma versus the cytoplasm,

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.720
we can consider the
concentration of various ions.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.080
And I want to get the
concentrations right.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:21.430
Let's consider sodium, which is
a monovalent cation, potassium,

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.960
and calcium.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.290
I'm just going to use
these as illustrations.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.190
So sodium is concentrated
outside the cell,

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.990
about 150 millimolar,
and is less concentrated

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.910
in the cytoplasm.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.800
So there's a huge difference
in sodium between the outside

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.740
and the inside of the cell.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.320
Potassium-- now, you
might think potassium

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.760
would be a lot like sodium.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.830
It's a monovalent cation.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.660
It's a similar size.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.350
But it actually shows
the flip distribution.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.590
So it's four millimolar
in the exoplasm

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:05.350
and 140 millimolar
in the cytoplasm, OK?

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.440
So there appears to be some
selectivity here, right?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.070
The cell is concentrating
certain things

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.850
inside the cytoplasm, and
it's excluding others.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:24.010
So there's selectivity, even
between closely related atoms

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.480
here.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:31.450
OK, calcium is two millimolar
in the exoplasm and around 10

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.200
to the negative fifth
millimolar in the cytoplasm.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.370
So because there are these huge
gradients in the concentration

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.580
of these ions leads
you to expect that this

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.040
is a non-equilibrium state.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.283
Because if it were equilibrium,
these ions would go in and out,

00:13:51.283 --> 00:13:53.950
and they'd equilibrate such that
the same concentration would be

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.160
on the inside as the outside.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.840
And so there's selectivity.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.950
And also, there's
non-equilibrium,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.880
which suggests that
energy is required

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.460
to maintain this asymmetry.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.890
I want to point out it's
not just the concentrations

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.010
of various molecules that are
different between the inside

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.640
and the outside, but the
plasma membrane can also

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.140
have a voltage across it.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.890
So this is exoplasm.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.060
This is cytoplasm.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.915
And this membrane
can hold a voltage.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.080
And this is going to become
incredibly important when

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.870
we talk about neurons,
because neurons use changes

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:54.000
in this voltage to transmit
signals across their length

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.450
and also to transmit
signals at the synapse.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.920
And we'll talk about
that later in the course.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.540
So this is known as
membrane potential,

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.596
this voltage difference.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:20.520
I also, again, want to point
out this endomembrane system

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.150
in here, where the
gray regions here

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.400
are sort of compartments
that will communicate

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.540
with each other.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.050
And so there's this
whole internal structure

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.950
of endomembrane system
which is compartmentalized

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.610
from the cytoplasm, OK?

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.130
And so now I want to talk
about how do things get

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.280
in and out of this structure.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.880
So I think we're up to
three, getting in and out.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.520
So cells-- and this is
very important in cell

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.400
communication, right?

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.160
For cells to
communicate, cells have

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.920
to send things, like
signals, to other cells.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.220
And also, cells
can take in stuff

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.220
and sort of receive
things from other cells.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.870
So how is it that this happens?

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.500
Well, if we consider the
plasma membrane of a cell--

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.080
this is a lipid bilayer, PM.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.410
I abbreviate Plasma
Membrane, PM.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.200
So that's a lipid bilayer.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:37.320
And let's say that there's
some type of sort of molecule

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.700
that's on the
outside of the cell.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.400
So, in this case, this
would be exoplasm out here.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.930
This would be inside
the cytoplasm here.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.900
Let's say this cell
wanted to sort of take up

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:57.810
this pink structure
into the cell.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.380
How would it do that?

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.670
Well, this pink structure,
because it's hydrophilic,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.990
cannot pass through
the lipid bilayer.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.390
So the cell has to
use another strategy

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.109
to take this up into the cell.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:17.760
Let's see.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.540
I'll use a little blue here.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.319
So let's say the region of the
membrane right here is in blue.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:31.850
Then, what can happen is this
blue structure can invaginate,

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.370
and it can take up
this pink molecule.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.360
So the plasma membrane
can invaginate.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.030
The plasma membrane
can invaginate,

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.700
and if it has this
pink molecule,

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.960
then if there is a
cision event here,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.260
you've now gone from
having your pink molecule

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.390
on the outside of
the cell to having

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:02.090
the pink molecule in this
vesicle or circular structure

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.640
on the inside of the cell.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.880
So here now we have this.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.730
We have our vesicle in blue.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.140
And now the cell has picked
up this pink molecule,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.900
such like this.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.940
So this process of
sort of taking material

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.010
from the outside and
sort of bringing it

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.500
into the inside of
the cell is known

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:38.180
as endocytosis, which is the
process of taking something

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.770
from the outside and bringing
it in the cell, this is also

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.840
a way that viruses
can get in your cells,

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.010
which is a more nefarious
way that this system is used.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.530
All right, I need a volunteer.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.740
Yes.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.290
Ory, come on down.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.490
Don't worry.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.120
This'll be simple.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.740
I just need you to put
pressure on my head right here.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.940
So you see the tassel.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.740
Make sure they can
see the tassel.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.130
You see this tassel?

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.220
This tassel is
that pink molecule,

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.640
is right now on
the outside, right?

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.750
But I'm going to endocytose
it by going like that, right?

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.990
And I also got a hand.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.250
That's great.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.670
So you see, that's
basically endocytosis.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.630
I just endocytosed my tassel.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.980
All right, you can go up.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.420
We're all set, yeah.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.690
I can do the next one.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.630
OK, so the opposite
of this process--

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.880
let me get another color here.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.930
You can also have vesicles that
are on the inside that then

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.590
fuse with the plasma membrane
and release their contents

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.280
to the exterior.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.710
And this is called exocytosis.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.930
So exocytosis is
something that's

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:11.690
starting out inside one of these
vesicles and then goes out, OK?

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.850
So this is not
exactly reversible,

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.400
because there are different
protein machineries that

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.060
mediate either
endocytosis or exocytosis.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.385
So now I'm going to
exocytose my tassel.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.730
There we go.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.210
So I just exocytosed it, and
now my molecules is again

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.930
facing the outside world.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.320
So this is a way for cells
to sort of taken things

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.630
and also to secrete molecules,
like signaling molecules,

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.430
into the extracellular space.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.090
So now, we're moving
on, and now we're

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:54.980
going to talk about compartments
within compartments.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.050
So we're on four--

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:04.370
compartments within
compartments.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.550
And you're going to see how
this relates to endocytosis

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.400
in just a minute.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:16.100
So compartments
within compartments.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.350
So the example I'm
going to use here

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.020
is an organelle that
is present in us,

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.690
in animal cells, which
is the mitochondria.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.240
And you all know
that the mitochondria

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.530
is the powerhouse of the cell.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.230
Whenever I say mitochondria is
the powerhouse of the cells,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.155
I have to do 10 push-ups,
because it's so cliche.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.800
I mean, my five-year-old
knows that mitochondria

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.580
is the powerhouse of the cell.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.200
It's a gross
oversimplification, OK?

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.810
Mitochondria are way more
interesting than that,

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.630
and I'll show you
in just a minute.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.160
All right, I'll
draw mitochondria,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.910
the same mitochondria
that my kids draw me.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.220
So here's a mitochondria.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.950
I'm drawing first
the outer membrane.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.430
So there's an outer membrane
to the mitochondria.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.785
And this organelle also
has an inner membrane.

00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:35.395
So this is the inner membrane.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.735
The inside here is
called the matrix.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.220
I'll draw some DNA
molecules there.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:59.650
So this is known as the
mitochondrial DNA, which

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:00.910
I'll mention in just a minute.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.550
So this is the mitochondria.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.420
Where could such an organelle
come from, evolutionarily

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.330
speaking?

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.090
You know, one problem that
eukaryotic cells have is they

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.390
cannot make
mitochondria de novo.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.360
The way that
mitochondria is passed on

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.240
is it's replicated
during cell division,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.540
and it's passed on from
one cell to the next.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.420
And you guys all got
your mitochondrial DNA

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.220
and your mitochondria, at least
initially, from your mother.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.180
So this is not an organelle
that can be synthesized de novo.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.220
And the fact that
this is the case

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.030
has led to a theory known
as the endosymbiont theory,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:52.830
or hypothesis, which basically
states that there was

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.650
an ancestral eukaryotic cell.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.490
And the way that organelles such
as mitochondria and plastids

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.770
were derived is from
engulfing bacterial cells that

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.440
were either capable of
oxidative phosphorylation,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:13.200
in the case of mitochondria, or
were capable of photosynthesis,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.090
in the case of chloroplasts.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.630
And so this engulfment is much
like this endocytic process

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.980
that I just talked to you.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.710
It's not really endocytosis,
because these bacteria

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.590
are much better than
an endocytic vesicle.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:34.800
So it's more of like a
macro sort of pinocytosis

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.480
or something like that, OK?

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:45.600
So something you may have
seen in the news lately--

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.280
so some of the evidence for
this endosymbiont theory

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.240
is that mitochondria and
plastids have their own DNA,

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.520
OK?

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.310
So these organelles
have retained DNA.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.110
The genes in the DNA
encode for proteins, that

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.280
function in the mitochondria.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.630
It also includes ribosomal
RNAs and transfer RNAs

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.110
that are required
for protein synthesis

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.270
within the mitochondria.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.390
But a lot of the genes that
are required for a functioning

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.440
organism have now been
exported to our nuclear DNA,

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.630
and those genes are made
and proteins are produced,

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.120
and then they're imported
into the mitochondria.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.620
But the mitochondria has
retained a number of genes,

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.490
and it's encoded in
the mitochondrial DNA.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.050
Another reason to
think that this

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.500
could be from a symbiotic
relationship, this ancient,

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.410
between eukaryotic
and prokaryotic cells

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.070
is that these organelles
divide by fission

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.700
similar to how bacteria divide.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.110
So they divide by fission.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.270
So I'll show you a
real mitochondria

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.420
and a mitochondria undergoing
fission in just a minute.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.950
I just want to point out
that in the news recently,

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.480
there's been talk of
three-parent babies.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.300
And I just want to explain
to you what that is.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.590
So eggs that are--

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.580
I shouldn't say
embryos, but eggs

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.360
that have the nuclear
DNA from two parents

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.380
can then be given mitochondrial
DNA from another parent.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.900
So these three-parent
babies are essentially

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.350
babies that have
nuclear DNA from two

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:50.900
parents but mitochondrial
DNA from a third parent.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.010
So here's just an article in
the NewScientist reporting

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:59.450
that this is imminent,
and now it's been done.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.520
Now, why would you
might want to do that?

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.920
Anyone know why someone
would want to do this?

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.296
Yes?

00:27:08.296 --> 00:27:10.713
AUDIENCE: There might be a
defect in the mitochondrial DNA

00:27:10.713 --> 00:27:11.950
of both parents.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:12.700
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.747
So Stephen, right?

00:27:13.747 --> 00:27:14.330
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.560
ADAM MARTIN: Stephen's
exactly right, right?

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.020
There are diseases
that are so associated

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.150
with faulty mitochondrial DNA.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:26.970
And if you're a mother and
you have the mutations that

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.510
cause this disease, this
would be a way for you

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:35.550
to have a child without passing
on the disease to your child.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.690
And so this is something
that is still controversial,

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.680
but that's why people are
exploring the opportunity

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.460
for making these so-called
three-parent babies.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.120
Again, I've a pet peeve
with textbook pictures

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.590
of mitochondria.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.150
Here's your textbook picture.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.950
Everything's labeled nicely.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.220
This is what mitochondria
look like in real life.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.670
Mitochondria, like the
endoplasmic reticulum,

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.360
actually, form these tubular
networks that essentially

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.790
span the entire cell.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.460
So it's convenient for
us to depict mitochondria

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.430
like this in textbook,
but mitochondria are

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.140
way more interesting than that.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.240
They're dynamic organelles.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.030
And I also want to make
the point-- we kind of talk

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.040
about these organelles
like they behave

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.980
as these separate
entities, but in fact, they

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.250
interact with each other.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.810
And there's lots of interesting
biology behind that.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.210
So I'm going to show
you one movie that's

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:37.350
from work done by Gia Voeltz,
and this Friedman person

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.920
is the first author.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.100
She just gave a talk
here at MIT and showed

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.030
some beautiful movies.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.970
All right, focus
on this movie here.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:49.350
The ER is labeled in green,
and the mitochondria is in red.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.040
And what you see is there
is this mitochondria tubule,

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.500
and it's crossed by
the ER right here.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.680
Now, focus on this
when the movie plays.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.680
You're going to see that the
mitochondria undergoes fission

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.830
right at these points, where
the ER and the mitochondria

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.570
intersect.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.660
So that illustrates-- and
now they've mechanistically

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.350
dissected what sort of makes
the mitochondria undergo fission

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.360
at these crossing sites.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.700
But it really
illustrates the real sort

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.340
of complexity and
dynamics that are

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.770
present in a cell,
which you might not

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.170
be getting from your book.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.020
Oh, I did want to mention that--

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.330
so there's a chapter
in your book--

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.030
I think it's Key Concept 5.3--

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.090
where you can read about
all the organelles.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.560
You should read that and know
roughly what the organelles do.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.420
I mean, I could
lecture about that,

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.470
but it would just be so
boring that I can't do it.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.290
I'd have to do a
ton of push-ups.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:55.150
So we have to sort of choose
what we lecture about.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.170
So I would just suggest you
read that part in the textbook.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.500
If you have questions,
come talk to me.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.370
And just be familiar with what
your organelles are doing.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.888
Yes, Ory?

00:30:04.888 --> 00:30:06.180
AUDIENCE: What was the chapter?

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.535
ADAM MARTIN: It's 5.3.

00:30:08.535 --> 00:30:09.900
AUDIENCE: Is it like a chapter?

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.210
ADAM MARTIN: It's
Key Concept 5.3.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.453
It's probably listed in
the assignments, right?

00:30:14.453 --> 00:30:16.120
AUDIENCE: It's a
section in the chapter.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:16.870
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.837
AUDIENCE: It's
only a little bit.

00:30:18.837 --> 00:30:20.298
It's not going to be long.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.810
ADAM MARTIN: All right.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.080
I have one last part,
which is to prepare you

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.210
for Friday's lecture.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.920
In Friday's lecture,
we're going to start

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.750
talking about genetics.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.370
And before we talk
about genetics,

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.740
we're going to talk
about something that is--

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.870
we're going to lay the
groundwork, essentially,

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.050
for genetics by talking
about how cells divide.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.750
So I think one of the
most miraculous things

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:51.400
that cells do is that they
can undergo this trick where

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.640
they replicate themselves and
split it into two daughter

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.250
cells.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.090
And you're seeing here, there
are chromosomes in the middle

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:58.870
here.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.030
They're going to line up
along the metaphase plate.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.790
And now they're going to get
pulled to separate sides.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.030
They're going to wiggle
back and forth first.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.350
Then, in just a minute, they're
going to get segregated.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.761
They'll go eventually.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.690
There they go.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.550
So you see-- and
then the cell is

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.360
going to pinch at the equator
and divide in two, OK?

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.850
So now I'm at this last
part, the cytoskeleton,

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:32.260
because the cytoskeleton
is the answer to part

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.490
of how these cells divide.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.580
And before I present
the cytoskeleton,

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.070
I just want to briefly
mention chromosomes

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.730
and what they look like.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.360
So the chromosomes
are your nuclear DNA.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.600
They're linear pieces of DNA,
as opposed to the mitochondria,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.830
which has circular DNA.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.700
And again, the fact that
mitochondria have circular DNA

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.630
is analogous with sort of
bacterial chromosomes, where

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:02.350
bacteria have circular DNA.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:06.190
But our chromosomes are
linear pieces of DNA.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.160
And you guys have probably
all seen chromosome spreads

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.620
that look like this.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:17.440
So this would be a
chromosome that's replicated.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.870
There are two
copies, one and two.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:27.310
So this is a replicated and
condensed chromosome, right?

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.010
Initially, chromosomes are
just like bowls of spaghetti.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.690
Everything's mixed together.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.290
But during mitosis, the
chromosomes condense, and then

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.260
they sort of resolve
from each other, such

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.840
that you can see the
arms of the chromosome.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.630
And you can see where the
chromosomes are coupled

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.980
to each other at
this structure here,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.867
which is known as
the centromere.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.870
And at this centromere, a
protein complex assembles.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.720
I'll just draw it like this.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.489
This protein complex is
called the kinetochore.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.140
The kinetochore is a
complex of hundreds

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.730
of proteins that assemble
into this large platform that

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.800
sits on the centromere.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.650
And the kinetochore
is able to attach

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.880
to the cell's cytoskeleton,
specifically microtubules.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:30.400
So this attaches
to microtubules.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.300
And I will tell you what
microtubules are right now.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.220
So microtubules are a component
of the cell's cytoskeleton.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.970
So the cell's cytoskeleton is
a network of filamentous rods

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.950
that are present in the cell.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.870
And the term
cytoskeleton kind of

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.360
makes it sound boring,
I think, because it

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.890
makes it sound static.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:00.100
But the cytoskeleton
is anything but static.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.500
It's actually a dynamic
machine in the cell.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.210
And these machines that are
assembled from these fibers

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:08.514
are able to generate force.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:14.889
So these microtubules
and the cytoskeleton,

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:18.400
they generate force.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.050
You can think of them
as motors or machines.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.954
So there are machines
that generate force.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:31.000
And I'll just illustrate
this with a couple of videos

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.170
and slides.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:38.260
So, again, this is not a stable
structure, but very dynamic.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.710
So this is going to be a
movie where, in green here,

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:46.280
microtubules are labeled, and
the red label's the nucleus.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.389
And these cells
in this fly embryo

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:53.332
are going to undergo
cycles of nuclear division.

00:34:53.332 --> 00:34:55.540
And so you're going to see
the microtubules assemble,

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:59.080
disassemble,
assemble, disassemble.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.870
So you see how dynamic
this process is.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.720
The cell is able to assemble
this force-generating

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.470
apparatus, which is known
as the mitotic spindle, each

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.390
and every cell division.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.910
So this structure,
or machine, is

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.180
critical to physically
segregate the chromosomes

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.920
to opposite poles of a cell.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.640
So now I'm going to tell
you about the microtubules

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.790
themselves.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:36.050
So microtubules, as
the name implies,

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.250
are sort of tube-like polymers.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:45.340
So these microtubules
are biopolymers,

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.480
which means that cells are
expressing sort of genes that

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.140
encode for proteins that
form a subunit that can then

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:57.440
self-assemble into a
larger rod-like structure.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.070
And you can see one of these
rod-like structures here.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.580
They essentially
look like straws.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.510
They're about 25
nanometers in diameter.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.940
And I'm going to show
you this video showing

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.520
you microtubules both
disassembling at first

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.900
and then assembling.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.330
So that's a dissembling
microtubule.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:19.420
But they also assemble
to form these longer

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.200
rod-like structures.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:29.310
So these biopolymers
are dynamic,

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:34.540
and they both assemble
but also disassemble.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:40.430
And both the assembly and the
disassembly can generate force.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.900
Microtubules can push if they
polymerize into something.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.010
They push it, right?

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:50.030
Just like you're kind of poking
someone with your finger.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.660
Now, they also
disassemble, and when

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.690
they shrink and disassemble,
they can actually pull.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:00.590
And I'll show you an
example of that right here.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:04.030
So this is an example that's
reconstituted, meaning they're

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:05.590
just purified proteins here.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.830
There's no cell.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.720
And what this is, is a bead.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.890
And you see the dark stripe
here is a microtubule.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:16.010
You can see it growing.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:17.770
There's the end right there.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.510
That microtubule's
going to grow.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.670
It's going to grow
out to about here.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.638
And then at the
end of the movie,

00:37:24.638 --> 00:37:26.680
it's going to stop growing,
and the microtubule's

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.755
going to shrink back.

00:37:27.755 --> 00:37:30.130
And you're going to see that
when the microtubule shrinks

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.430
back, it's going to actually
pull this large bead

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.518
and pull it towards the
left side of the slide.

00:37:37.518 --> 00:37:38.060
Here it goes.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.670
It depolymerizes and pulls.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:41.170
You see it?

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.170
So these microtubules
can generate

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:48.400
a pulling force that's strong
enough to pull this glass bead.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:54.070
And also, it's strong enough
to pull an entire chromosome.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.160
It's actually much stronger--

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.180
it generates much
more force than it

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.030
requires to pull a chromosome.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.060
So it seems like there's
some robustness in the system

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.680
so that it's generating
a pull that's

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.800
much stronger than needed to
actually drag a chromosome

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.370
through viscus media.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.550
So during mitosis, the
way this system is set up

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.940
is there's what's known
as a bipolar spindle.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.140
I'll just write down that.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.260
We'll come back to it
in Friday's lecture.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.595
There's a bipolar spindle.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:34.810
And the bipolar spindle is made
up of a number of microtubules.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:39.550
So here, you can see there
are two poles, here and here.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:43.300
And in the middle, along the
sort of equator of the cell,

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.980
the chromosomes will line up.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.230
There are just two
chromosomes here.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.770
And you can see how microtubules
reach out from the pole

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:54.190
and attach to both sides
of that chromosome.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.390
And you can imagine that
when these microtubules are

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.240
told to shrink and
disassemble, if they're

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.955
able to remain attached to that
kinetochore, which they are,

00:39:04.955 --> 00:39:06.580
when they shrink,
they're going to pull

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.270
the two copies of the chromosome
away from each other, OK?

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.870
And so this is the
basic machinery

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.650
that allows for chromosomes
to be segregated in cells.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.700
OK, that's it for today.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.340
Any questions?

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.300
All right, terrific.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.130
Good luck on your
exam on Wednesday.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:29.980
It's in here.

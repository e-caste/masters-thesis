00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.870
PROFESSOR: Today, I want to
spend a fair amount of time,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.750
to start out with, talking about
this business of, how do

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.300
you go from pass band to a
baseband in a wireless system

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.970
and some of these questions
about time reference and all

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.730
of these things.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.400
When we were dealing with
ordinary channels that didn't

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.190
have fading in them and didn't
have motion or anything like

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.370
that, it was a fairly
straightforward thing to think

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.000
of a transmitter having its
time reference and the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.740
receiver locking in on its time
reference, which had a

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.310
certain amount of delay
from what the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.610
transmitter was doing.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.390
As soon as you start having
multiple paths, each with

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.610
different delays in them, this
starts to get confusing.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.060
If you try to write
it down carefully,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.090
it gets doubly confusing.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.760
If these path lanes are changing
dynamically, it gets

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.620
even more confusing.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.170
So I wanted to spend a little
bit of time at the beginning

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.560
of the hour trying
to sort that out.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.040
It's not sorted out that
well in the notes.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.050
As you'll see, it doesn't get
sorted out too well here

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.600
either because the problem is,
whenever you write everything

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.990
down, it becomes a nightmare.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.040
So this is just another effort
at trying to do this.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.420
Let's start out by just looking
at a single path.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.880
This single path, we're going to
assume, has a time varying

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.990
attenuation, which we'll call
beta of t and a time varying

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.590
delay, which we'll
call tau of t.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.290
Namely, this is the same thing
that we did before.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.460
We started out with a fixed

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.190
transmitter and a fixed receiver.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.810
Now, since we're allowing both
the attenuation and the delay

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.510
to vary, but only
having one path.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.760
What we're essentially thinking
is, that is the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.490
receiver, which is in a vehicle
for example, which is

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.680
moving away from or towards
the transmitter.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.480
So these are the, or in a sense
an easy way of keeping

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.740
track of that physical
situation.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.490
So the response at passband to
a real waveform, x of t, it's

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.600
going to be just beta sub t
times x of t minus tau of t.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.020
In other words, here's
the delay here.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.040
Here's the attenuation
here and we just

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.290
have a single path.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.390
Now if you start out with a
baseband waveform, if you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.680
start out with a complex
baseband waveform, say u of t,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.230
you're going to shift this up
first to a positive frequency

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.040
band, which we'll call u sub p
of t, which is u of t e to the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.950
2 pi ifct and you're going to
transmit it as x of t, which

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.410
is equal to two times
a real part of that.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.900
Half the time we've been dealing
with going through

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.340
this modulation from baseband
to passband in terms of

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.160
cosines and sines.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.210
Half the time we've been doing
it in terms of complex

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.980
exponentials.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.780
One of the problems that appears
as soon as you get

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.320
into wireless is that if you
really like to do things in

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.120
terms of cosines and sines, you
really run into a lot of

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.460
trouble here because with phases
varying all over the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.890
place, it just becomes very,
very difficult to track what's

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.280
going on with all of the cosine
terms and all of the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.520
sine terms.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.670
So what we sort of have to wind
up with here is this, in

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.010
a sense, simpler but more
abstract viewpoint where we

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.820
think of modulation as being a
two step process, where we

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.750
first take the take the low pass
waveform, move it up in

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.340
frequency and then we add on the
negative frequency part as

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.185
an afterthought and then at the
receiver, what we're going

00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:35.930
to do is have a Hilbert filter,
which you would never

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.780
build, of course.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.500
You would always build it in
terms of cosines and sines,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.670
but conceptually have a Hilbert
filter which blocks

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.670
off that negative frequency part
and then you just shift

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.020
things down in frequency
again.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.320
So that's the way we're thinking
about this here, so

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.500
we're going to have u of
t shifted up and then

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.570
transmitted as 2 times the
real part of up of t and

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.610
therefore, it's going
to get received --

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.880
the received waveform
at the passband.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.810
We're still using the timing
at the transmitter.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.460
That's the purpose of going
through all this analysis, to

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.520
look at what's going on at
transmit time and what's going

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.150
on at receive time.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.340
So in terms of transmit time,
this received waveform at

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.510
passband is just the attenuation
term times x of t

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.040
minus tau of t, which is two
times the real part of theta

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.990
of t times this positive
frequency part.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.280
Now when you write it out in all
of its glory, it's 2 times

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.410
the real part of the attenuation
times the input

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.750
you started with, but now this
has been delayed by tau of t

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.320
and e to the 2 pi ifct, but this
was the carrier that was

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.030
put on at the transmitter,
physically at the transmitter

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.130
and now we're at the receiver,
so that carrier has gotten

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.980
delayed by a factor
of tau sub t.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.890
The question is, how do
you demodulate this?

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.660
How do you come down again from
transmitter to receiver?

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.830
What we've thought all along and
what makes a lot of sense

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.150
until you start putting these
delays in, which are really a

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
pain in the neck, is that what
we're going to do is just

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.750
multiply this positive frequency
waveform by e to the

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.860
minus 2 pi i f sub ct, but
that's not what we're going to

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.440
do because the receiver sitting
there and the receiver

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.260
has to recover timing
and it has to

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.760
recover carrier frequency.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.770
So what's it going to do?

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.700
It's going to figure out what
the timing is and the timing

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.480
that it wants is at time 0, it
wants to be seeing what the

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.730
transmitter transmitted
at transmit time 0.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.250
In other words, if you look at
what the transmitter was doing

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.530
at time 0, it was sending, say,
the first bit that was

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.040
going to be sent.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.500
In receiving this, we want to
have our timing so we're

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.920
looking at that first
bit sent.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.340
So our timing is going to be
shifted from what it was then.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.140
So we're going to take
this new timing.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.900
The receiver clock time is now
going to be t prime, which is

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.890
t minus this delay term.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.910
If you get confused between
the minuses and the pluses

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.470
here, don't worry about it.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.610
I get confused about them too
and the only way I can

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.410
straighten them out as to put
down one or the other and then

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.720
spend ten minutes looking at
it and try to figure out --

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.500
after I write it down --

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.150
whether it should really be a
plus or a minus and I think

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.115
these sines are right, but I'm
not going to try to argue why

00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:56.140
in realtime.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.820
But anyway, this received
waveform now, as a function of

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.440
received time, is going to be
the received waveform and in

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.150
terms of transmit time --

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:15.100
and in place of t now, I'm going
to have t prime so that

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:20.090
since you t prime is equal to t
minus tau of t, this is why

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.290
it's t prime plus tau of t.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.590
In other words, what I'm looking
at now, at time 0 at

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.560
the receiver is what was
being transmitted a

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.910
little while ago.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.590
So that's this term and that's
going to be the real part of

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:39.070
this, where I've taken account
of all of these shift terms.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.260
Now if you look at this
carefully, you see that u of t

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.170
minus t of t is turned
into tau of t prime.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:53.420
This term has turned into 2 pi
ifct prime, so everything is

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.700
fine there.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.920
What I should have done with
this term is to compensate for

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:04.010
the fact that I'm now looking at
it in a different time and

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.520
at this point, what I'm going to
do is to say, this quantity

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.310
is changing so slowly
with time that I

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.090
don't care about that.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.920
If you really try to adjust this
to make it right, it's a

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.000
terrible mess.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.430
So we're just not going
to worry about it.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.280
So what we receive then is
approximately equal to this

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.900
where the approximation is due
to the fact that I'm not

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.070
evaluating this attentuation
term at exactly the right

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.170
time, because it's a pain
in the neck to do so.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.550
All of this stuff with wireless,
you simply have to

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.150
make approximations all
over the place.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.930
You have to make crazy modeling
assumptions all over

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.470
the place, because the
physical medium is so

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.740
complicated that you can't do
much else and the whole

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.180
question is trying to make the
right approximations and get

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.960
some sense of which thing's very
fast and which thing's

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.900
very slowly.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.620
So that's the equation
that we had.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.800
What we receive now at passband,
but at the received

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.050
time scale is this
quantity here.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.150
So what's the receiver
going to do?

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.640
The receiver, at its time is
going to demodulate by

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.890
multiplying by e to the
minus 2 pi ifct prime.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.090
First, we're going to take away
this 2 times the real

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.960
sine by going through the
Hilbert filter, which just

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.210
removes this.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.810
At that point, we have a complex
positive frequency

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.390
waveform and then we're going
to multiply that positive

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:52.315
frequency waveform by e to the
minus 2 pi ifct prime, where t

00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:55.860
prime is the only thing the
receiver knows anything about.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.650
So after you shift the baseband
with a recovered

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.820
carrier in receiver time, what
you get in receiver time is v

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.980
of t prime as equal to beta
of t prime; namely, the

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.820
attenuation at t prime -- or
this is the approximate part

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.080
of it -- times what
was actually set.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:23.300
So now, think of this as saying,
suppose this delay

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.210
term is actually changing
with time.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:32.780
Namely, it's some tau 0 minus a
velocity term, vt divided by

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.120
the velocity of light.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.590
In other words, the time delay
that you incur, where the

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.480
change in the time delay that
you incur, is due to the time

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.620
that it takes light to travel
from where the receiver was to

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.220
where the receiver is now.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.650
We can also write that as tau
0 minus the Doppler shift

00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:01.120
times the time divided by
the carrier frequency.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.030
Now here's another
approximation, because what

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.180
we're sending --

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.380
I mean, this quantity
here is exact.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.180
When you try to convert from
the velocity, which you're

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.100
going to, for what it does in
frequency, which is the

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.090
Doppler shift, it's a function
of the frequency.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.120
Here what we're assuming is that
all the frequencies we're

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.480
dealing with are so close to the
carrier frequency that we

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.500
can just ignore everything
else.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:38.170
So we're just writing this as
the Doppler shift divided by

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.170
this carrier frequency.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:45.510
Now if you view the passband
waveform, going into a

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:50.220
baseband of modulation and you
think of doing this in

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.200
transmit time, what are
you going to do?

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.100
In terms of transmit time,
you've got to get rid of not

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.220
this term, but this
thing here.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.070
So in terms of transmit time,
you're going to be multiplying

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.520
by e to the minus 2 pi i times
carrier frequency minus the

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.740
Doppler shift.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.460
So the thing that's happening
is that time at the

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:22.300
transmitter gets spread out a
little bit at the receiver.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.480
In other words, as this
receiving antenna is moving

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.910
away from the transmitter, a
period of time like this at

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.210
the transmitter is a period of
time like this at the receiver

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.000
and therefore, a certain number
of cycles of carrier at

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.110
the transmitter looks like a
different number of cycles of

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.110
carrier at the receiver.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.450
Therefore, if you're dealing
with transmit time, you're

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.830
taking account of this
Doppler shift.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.240
You're multiplying not by the
carrier frequency, but by the

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.660
carrier frequency minus
the Doppler shift.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:00.020
If you do it in receiver time,
you're just multiplying by the

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:11.450
by this carrier frequency,
because the trouble is, your

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.230
clock is running
a little slow.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.880
Because your clock is running
a little slow, you think

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.410
you're demodulating at the
actual carrier frequency,

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.720
whereas in terms of what the
transmitter thinks, you're

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.180
doing something else.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.440
If you all got confused when you
studied relativity, this

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.550
is exactly the same problem you
got confused about there.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.120
There's nothing very mysterious
about it or hard

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.230
about it, except that to most
of us, time is a very

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.850
fundamental quantity
and you don't like

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.690
to monkey with that.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.780
If you can't count on time being
what it's supposed to

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.990
be, you're really
in deep trouble.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.290
When you try to write equations
that do that, it

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.450
makes things very,
very tough also.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:02.210
So anyway, the result after we
look at this in both ways, is

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.700
that you get the same answer
each way, but the receiver

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.340
sees the carrier frequency and
sees this carrier frequency in

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.390
transmitter time and
it sees this

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.480
frequency in received time.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.960
Of course, the receiver only
sees received time because the

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.260
receiver sitting there trying
to measure from the waveform

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.420
coming in what that carrier
frequency is and what that

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.670
time base is.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.190
So now it gets to be fun.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.580
We look at multiple paths.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:47.460
When you look at it in transmit
time, what gets

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.710
received at the receiver,
according to the

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.760
transmit clock --

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.990
so here we are at the
transmitter and we're peering

00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:03.270
at what's going on at this
distant receiver and you now

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.770
have the thing that we've talked
about in the notes

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.390
where you have all these
different paths.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.660
Each path is associated with a
certain attenuation and each

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:17.370
path is associated with
a time delay.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.950
This can be written in terms of
what has gotten modulated

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:26.170
up from baseband as 2 times the
real part of this sum --

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.870
of beta j of t times the
positive frequency part of

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.500
what got transmitted and then
it now has this delay in it.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.420
This can be rewritten in the
same way that we did before,

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.580
but now we just have all of
these paths in there instead

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.830
of one path.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.490
If you look at this expression
then, we have all of these

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.530
propogation delay terms.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.660
We have this baseband input,
which has been delayed in

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.880
different ways for each path
and you have have this

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.260
exponential, which has
been delayed also.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.310
So at this point, the receiver
is in a real pickle because if

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.630
the receiver is smart enough
to see -- yes?

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:17.680
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.450
PROFESSOR: The receiver
doesn't know anything.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.600
It's like you're driving in your
car, you're talking on

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.930
your cell phone and
your cell phone --

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.960
I mean, the only way your cell
phone knows that you're moving

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.380
is that the cell phone is
getting some waveform coming

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:38.190
in and it has to tell from that
waveform what's going on.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.400
So it's going to do things like
the carrier tracking that

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.510
we were talking about before and
it's not going to have too

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.560
much trouble because all of
these changes are taking place

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.190
relatively slowly, relative
to this very high --

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.100
either one gigabits or two
gigabits or four gigabits, or

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.350
what have you, carrier
frequency.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.890
So all these changes look like
almost nothing, but at the

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.830
same time, they're fairly
important because they keep

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.820
changing faces.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.950
But anyway, in terms of the
transmitter clock, this is

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.960
what you actually receive.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.220
So at this point, what the
receiver has to do is it has

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.190
to retrieve clock time and the
clock time that it retrieves

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.460
is going to be --

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.690
receiver clock time is --

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.170
is t minus tau 0 sub t --

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:52.830
so it's t prime equals
t minus tau 0 sub t.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.330
That's the same thing it was
before, except that this tau

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.830
zero of t here doesn't
really amount to

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.830
anything physical anymore.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.140
It's just whatever the circuitry
that we have trying

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.870
to recover carrier and trying
to recover timing --

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.220
it's just whatever that happens
to come up with, so

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.520
with this best sense of the
timing it should use if it's

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.870
going to try to detect
what the signal is.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.630
So it's some arbitrary
value and again, this

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.600
is varying in time.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.060
So again what we have is now
this expression becomes really

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:36.150
messy, because instead of
having a receiver time

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:42.710
variation, which cancels out
what the actual variation in

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:47.110
path length is, you really
have two terms that are

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:51.320
different and you have the same
thing in terms of this

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.170
phase, which is changing
and this is the

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.740
more important term.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.020
But anyway, you have that.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.840
You can then demodulate.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.920
What do you do when
you demodulate?

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.840
You take this thing in receiver
time and you multiply

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.360
by e to the 2 pi i, e to
the minus 2 pi i --

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.890
this carrier frequency, what
you think it is, times this

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.960
time reference, what you
think that is --

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.320
So that term has disappeared and
what we then wind up with

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.190
is the carrier frequency times
these two terms here.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:27.780
That's to the left there.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.810
These two terms turn out to have
both Doppler shift terms

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.190
in them and also time
spread terms.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.600
So when we write that out in
terms of Doppler shift, what

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:49.420
we wind up with is the input,
which is then delayed by some

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.590
arbitrary amount of time,
where this is our best

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.010
estimate of the right time to
use and this is the actual

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.910
time on that path.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.080
The thing that's happening here,
which you don't see in

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.560
the notes unfortunately, in
the notes, it pretty much

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.440
looks at things as far as
transmit time is concerned.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.070
Therefore, what you see is
expressions for impulse

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.710
response where the impulse
response is at some time much

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.570
later than time 0.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.620
You have a --

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.030
I mean, you put in an impulse
of time 0, what you see is

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:29.230
stuff dribbling out over some
very tiny interval, but a good

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.340
deal later than what
got put in.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.510
What we want to do now is to
shift that so that in fact,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.120
when we look at filtering and
things like that, we have a

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.190
filter which starts a little bit
before 0 and ends a little

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:48.540
bit after 0 and that's the
whole purpose of this.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.310
If you don't think my purposes
just to confuse you, it really

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:57.440
isn't, although I realize this
is very confusing, but you

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.970
sort of have to go through with
it to see why these time

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.950
shifts appear in the places
where they do.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.910
But anyway, up here in the
phase, you wind up with the

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.050
Doppler shift terms and down
here, when you're worrying

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:14.450
about the input waveform, you're
worrying about these

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.520
time shift terms.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.950
We'll see we'll see how they
come in a little later.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.990
To make the expression a little
bit easier, let me look

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:33.310
at tau j prime of t as tau j
minus tau 0 and let me look at

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.480
the Doppler differential as
the Doppler that actually

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.040
occurs on path j minus what
the receiver thinks the

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.860
Doppler is.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.010
This is this receiver term that
we've demodulated by and

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.220
therefore, we've really gotten
rid of this term.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.460
Then when we rewrite this
received baseband waveform --

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.110
and I've now gotten rid of the
t primes because everything

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.980
we've done up until now, we've
just automatically assumed

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.060
that the receiver timing and the
transmit timing, we didn't

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.120
have to be careful about it and
it wasn't until we got to

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.370
wireless that we do have
to be careful about it.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.420
So now we're throwing it out
again and what we have is

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.360
these attenuations, which
are very slowly varied.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.990
These terms, which are now
delayed by this difference

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.650
between the actual delay and
what the receiver is assuming

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:28.750
that the light ought to be.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.600
So these are really just
differential delays relative

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.560
to each other.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.770
These are Doppler shifts
relative to each other.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.940
So that's the whole receive
baseband waveform then.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.300
If you look at this, it's not
apparent where the carrier

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.770
frequency is coming in and the
carrier frequency is coming in

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:59.030
because these Doppler shifts
have the carrier

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.140
frequency in them.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.250
Namely, the Doppler shift is the
velocity times the carrier

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.520
frequency divided by
the speed of light.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.710
One of the things you have to
be very careful with in the

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.990
wireless business, is that
everybody thinks it's a neat

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.210
idea to be able to be able to
go up to higher and higher

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.570
frequencies.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:23.440
When you go from one gigahertz
up to four gigahertz, one of

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.540
the things that you have to
deal with is that every

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.020
Doppler shift you're dealing
with is now four times higher

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.270
than it was before.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.650
So there's one big disadvantage
in operating at

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.530
extremely high frequencies.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:44.080
It's not necessarily a bad
thing, but it's there and if

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.540
you have a bunch of different
paths which are all acting in

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.520
different ways, you
suddenly wind up

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.330
with some real problems.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.050
The received baseband waveform
on path j is going to change

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.270
completely over an interval --

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:08.380
1 over 4 times the
magnitude of this

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.680
differential Doppler shift.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.600
The Doppler shift might be
positive or negative, but if

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.050
you look at this expression up
here, that's the amount of

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.020
time that it takes for
this quantity to

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.120
change by pi over 2.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.940
When this changes by pi over 2,
this exponential goes from

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.580
its maximum one down to zero or
it goes from zero to minus

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:39.430
one or it goes from minus one
to zero or from zero up to

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.530
plus one, and that's a
pretty major change.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.940
So the interval which is
required to do that is 1 over

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.600
4 times that Doppler shift.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:00.490
The Doppler spread now is
defined as the difference

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.490
between the maximum Doppler
shift and the

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.390
minimum Doppler shift.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:13.580
If we choose this Doppler shift
D sub 0 that we had,

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.280
because of what the receiver
was doing, seeing all these

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.740
different Doppler shifts and
trying to come up with

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:24.960
something in the middle, that's
pretty close to what

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:30.330
the receiver thinks it should
be using as far as receive

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.600
time is concerned.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.860
So it's the maximum plus the
minimum divided by 2 and then

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.060
each of these differential
Doppler shifts is going to be

00:26:40.060 --> 00:27:00.430
somewhere between that overall
Doppler spread minus Doppler

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.970
spread over 2 and plus Doppler
spread over 2.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.220
It goes from --

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.130
minus D over 2 up to plus D over
2 and this difference in

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:25.130
here, is strangely enough, D.
So what we've done is by

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.770
adjusting our received
timing --

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.520
and slowing it down or speeding
it up if necessary,

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.850
is we wind up with Doppler
shifts that are sort of spread

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:39.580
around from negative Doppler
shifts to plus Doppler shifts.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.520
What that means is, if you look
at this expression, it

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.660
takes a period of
time, about --

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:55.780
here we had 1 over 4 times the
differential Doppler, which is

00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:02.000
now 1 over 2 times this overall
Doppler spread.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.270
So what that says is, there's
a coherence time on the

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:12.150
channel of about 1 over 2 times
the Doppler spread.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.090
That's important because that
says the channel is going to

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:21.570
look like the same thing for a
period of time, which is about

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:26.330
1 over 2 times this Doppler
spread term.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:31.270
I think this will be
D instead of D 0.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.050
So you find out what the Doppler
spread is and the

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.970
reason you want to find out what
the Doppler spread is is

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.920
that that tells you how long
the channel remains stable.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.400
Why do you want to
know how long the

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.460
channel remains stable?

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.590
If you're going to do detection
or anything like

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.170
that, if you're going to filter
the received waveform

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:54.040
to try to find out what the
input waveform is, you would

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.780
like to know what the
channel is doing.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.060
You'd like to be able to
measure the channel.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.450
If you're going to measure the
channel, you really want to

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.100
know how long it stays the
same before you have to

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.970
measure it again.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:10.300
If you look at all these
cellular systems and you look

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.360
at every other wireless system
in the world, all of them do

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.780
one of one of two things:
either periodically they

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.760
measure what the channel is so
they can use it and the other

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:28.040
thing they do is every once in
awhile, they send a pilot tone

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.760
and they use the pilot tone to
try to figure out what kind of

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.930
channel they have.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.510
This is the thing which tells
you how often you have to send

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.290
that pilots tone.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.700
If you know about estimation
theory, it's also the thing

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.210
that tells you whether you
have any chance or not of

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.930
estimating what the channel
is, because it takes you a

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:52.110
certain amount of time in the
presence of noise to estimate

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.410
something and if that something
you're trying to

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:58.520
estimate it's changing faster
than you can estimate it, then

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.030
you don't have a prayer
of a chance.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.490
So yes, this is important.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.620
This is the prime coherence.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.860
It's one of the main parameters
of a wireless

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.330
channel you want
to understand.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.900
It tells you how long the
channel will remain

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.400
essentially the same before
it changes and

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.390
becomes something different.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.420
Both of these quantities
are very approximate.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.680
If anyone wants to tell you that
it's twice what I say it

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.060
is here, I certainly wouldn't
quarrel with them.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.060
I mean, it's like talking
about the bandwidth of a

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.740
waveform them that you send.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.090
I mean, you look at the spectrum
of what you send and

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.900
it's going to be something
which sort of tails off.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.400
If you want to call it the
maximum out there where it's

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.940
going to zero or the minimum,
where it starts to go to zero

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.590
or what have you, it doesn't
make much difference.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.790
Here, it's a worse situation
because you

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.590
don't shape this waveform.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:58.210
It's just given to you and you
find something which is going

00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.800
to be tailing off slowly.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:06.040
It's going to have little bits
of nothingness way out there.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.890
All this is is just one very
approximate number, which

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.600
tells you what that Doppler
spread is and therefore, which

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.740
tells you how long the channel
is going to remain stable and

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.030
yes, in half of that time the
channel starts to change and

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.300
in twice that time, the channel
might be still sort of

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.450
like it was before.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.570
So this is only a very
approximate way of looking at

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.000
these things, but it gives you
an idea about what you can do

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.380
and what you can't do.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.170
It gives you an idea, for
example, if you say, can I

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:41.550
take this wireless system I've
been using and use it at a

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.360
frequency that's 10
times as high --

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.480
and you know when you use it
at a frequency 10 times as

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.910
high that the stability of the
channel is going to be 10

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.650
times as small.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.930
You know if you were having
trouble measuring the channel

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.930
before, you know you don't have
a prayer of a chance when

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.030
you go up to that higher
frequency, so it so it tells

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.280
you things like that.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.390
There are two other sort of
related quantities, which are

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:13.210
called multipath spread and
coherence frequency.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.130
So we have Doppler spread on
the one hand, which is a

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:23.840
physical phenomena and that
gives rise to coherence time,

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.720
which says how long the channel
will stay the same and

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.110
in the opposite domain --

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:34.360
and these are almost dual
quantities of each other, you

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.220
have something called multipath
spread, which --

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.800
and multipath spread is
pretty much what it

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.690
sounds like it is.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.290
You have a bunch of
different paths.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:48.690
You send a very short duration
waveform and things start

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:53.070
trickling in on the shortest
path and then you got a big

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:58.650
bunch of stuff in all the paths
which are sort of the

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:03.480
same lanegth and then they sort
of dribble away again.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.570
So the waveform that you see
coming in is spread out from

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:09.830
what you send because of these
multiple paths and the

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.570
multiple paths having different
delays on them.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:19.560
Because you have all of these
different delay paths, you're

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.330
going to have an impulse
response for this channel,

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.580
which has a certain
duration to it.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.210
When you take the Fourier
transform of that, you find a

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:34.480
certain duration for
Fourier transform.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.240
As we're going to see in just
a minute, that's the thing

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.550
that tells you how stable this
channel is in frequency.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:47.620
If you measure it at one
frequency, how far do you have

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.960
to go in frequency before you
find something which is

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.460
totally separate from what
you measure down here?

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.650
This is something the
cuts both ways.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.520
Having a large frequency
coherence and having a large

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.460
time coherence can be good
or it can be bad.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.000
If you have a very large time
coherence and a very large

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.910
frequency coherence, you can
measure the channel once and

00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:16.290
you can use it for a long time
and you can use it over a

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.360
broadband width and everything
looks very nice.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.290
If the channel happens to be
faded over that long period of

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.440
time and over that long interval
of frequency, you're

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.480
really in the soup.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.500
On the other hand, if you have
a very small time coherence

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.540
and a very small frequency
coherence, if the channel

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.030
doesn't look good there, you
move to a different time

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.710
interval or you moved to a
different frequency interval

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.440
and you can transmit again.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.940
So both of these quantities have
good aspects to them and

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.900
bad aspects to them, but if you
want to evaluate what a

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.550
physical wireless channel is and
somebody lets you ask two

00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.510
questions, the two questions you
ought to ask are, what is

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.450
the time coherence and what is
the frequency coherence?

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.570
Those are the first things
you want to find out.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:10.080
Everything else is sort
of secondary.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.500
So trying to claim that the
frequency coherence here

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.160
almost has a matter
duality, as 1 over

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.440
twice the time spread.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:26.170
Let's take a slide to
see why that is.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:38.160
If I take the impulse response
at baseband of this channel,

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.100
which I wrote down here --

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:48.310
here's the impulse response and
you get that directly from

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:52.130
the baseband response for
giving input waveform.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.600
With all these different paths,
what this impulse

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.400
response is at a particular time
t -- namely, this is the

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.770
response at time t to an impulse
tau seconds earlier.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.520
In other words, when I'm using
this notation here, I'm really

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.400
thinking of t as a receiver
time and t minus tau as

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.490
transmit time.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.530
But anyway, this
is what it is.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:25.920
You take the Fourier transform
of this for a particular t --

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.240
in other words, we talked
about this a

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.070
little bit last time.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:34.090
You have a function of two
parameters here and at any

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.420
given t at the receiver, what
you see is a spread of

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.650
different inputs coming in
from the transmitter.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.540
What we're interested in now is
at that particular time t

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:49.870
at the receiver, what's the
Fourier transform, when you

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:53.440
take the Fourier transform on
tau to see what kinds of

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.100
frequencies are coming in?

00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:03.090
We take the Fourier transform
of a unit delta function and

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.990
you just get an exponential
function.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.820
So the transform of that delta
is just this e to the minus 2

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.080
pi if times tau sub
j prime of t.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.820
This is this differential delay
that we're faced with

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.860
and we still have the Doppler
shift over here.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.100
So when we look at it this way,
we have both the Doppler

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:29.640
shift sitting there and
we have this delay

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.840
shift sitting up here.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.700
Now the question we ask is, how
much does the frequency

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.280
have to change before this
quantity is going to change

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.380
materially?

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.330
The answer is the same
as it was before.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:49.590
When this quantity here changes
by pi over 2, you have

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.330
a totally different result
than you had before.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:55.970
So the question is, how much
does a frequency have to

00:37:55.970 --> 00:38:05.650
change in order for f times tau
j prime of t to the change

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:10.260
by a factor of one-fourth.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.780
So the answer that we come up
with is, this has to go from

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:23.740
minus L over 2 to plus L over 2
and this is where we get the

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.630
result that we were just
talking about, that the

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:34.290
frequency coherence is 1 over
2 times the multipath spread

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.540
of the channel.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:49.180
The next thing we want to do
in this long process --

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.860
it's a process that we've sort
of been doing all along.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:39:00.440
The whole purpose of looking
at waveforms and looking at

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.220
digital communication is to be
able to go from sequences to

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.060
waveforms --

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.190
and what do you think the next
thing we're going to do is?

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.140
We're going to go from
these waveforms --

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.245
we've now got them down to
baseband waveforms and we want

00:39:13.245 --> 00:39:17.840
to go back to looking
at sequences.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.650
So what we would like to do is
to take this input waveform,

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.170
view it in terms of the
sampling theorem --

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.880
better thing to do would be to
view it in terms of input

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.400
pulses, but that's too
complicated for now, so we'll

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.950
just take the input waveform and
view it as a sequence of

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:41.390
data that we're sending
-- the u sub k's

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.560
times these sinc waveforms.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.070
Same thing we've been
doing all along.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.190
We take a sequence of numbers,
we put little sine x over

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.160
x-hats around them and
that gives us a

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.600
band limited waveform.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.760
The baseband output is then --

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.210
you can look at the same way.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.380
The baseband output
is going to be

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.630
limited to the same frequency.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.880
Question here: You have
these Doppler shifts.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.550
So when I send a frequency which
is right up at the limit

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:20.990
of w over 2, what I get back
from that is going to be

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.320
spread out a little
bit from that.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.720
So if I send a waveform that's
limited to w over 2, I'm going

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.120
to get back a waveform
which is a little

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.750
bit bigger than that.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.230
What do I do about that?

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.130
I worried about it in the notes
a little bit and I'm

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:41.960
probably going to take it out
from the notes, because as a

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.400
practical matter, the amount of
Doppler shift that you get

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:54.380
is such a negligible fraction
of the kind of bandwidth you

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.020
would be using for transmission
that you just

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.430
want to forget about that.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.670
So we are going to forget about
it and what's coming in

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:07.090
is again a band limited function
with maybe a little

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.930
bit of squishiness on it.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:14.870
We get this baseband output,
which we can then view in

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:16.840
terms of the sampling theorem.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.320
We can sample the output
and what do we get

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.020
when we're all done?

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:28.390
Here's the nice thing that we
can jump to: The output at

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:32.920
this free time m is
then the sum --

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.780
namely, it's the convolution,
it's the discrete convolution

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:42.210
of what went in at time m, at
time m minus 1, m minus 2, m

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.840
plus 1, m plus 2 --

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:51.320
and what we're doing is, we're
designing this recovery time

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:56.870
so the main peak is about a time
0, so k goes from minus

00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:00.890
something to plus something here
and then we wind up with

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:06.020
these channel terms, which are
again, sampled at this point

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.690
because we can sample them,
because it's only these low

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:13.850
frequency components of the
channel response that make any

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:15.000
difference.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.300
They're the only things that
give us this output here and

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.280
this output has already
been filtered

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.540
down to this low frequency.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.880
When I look what these
components are, these are big

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.080
messes again.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:37.370
They're sums over all of
these different paths.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:45.050
So what we're winding up
with is a function --

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:52.680
if I sketch g of tau and t as
a function of tau, what I'm

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.120
going to find is a bunch
of different terms.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.420
Now I'm going to filter this
so every one of these turns

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.730
into a little sinc x
over x and then I'm

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.590
going to sample it.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.960
So what I wind up with then is
this goes into something which

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.130
looks like this.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.065
It's going to look like
something which goes up and

00:43:29.065 --> 00:43:32.340
comes down again, and I'm just
interested in what it's sample

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:38.140
values are and I might wind up
with five or six sample values

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.840
and that expresses
the whole thing.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.030
I mean, this is something you
have to think about a little

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.490
bit because it's something that
we've done about 10 times

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:54.120
already, but now when we do it
here it looks very different

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.780
from what we've done before --

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.970
except this is what it
is analytically.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:11.570
This is what it is in pictures
and that's where it comes out.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:20.830
The thing that's going on here
then is we started to look at

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:23.690
this physical modeling in
terms of ray tracing and

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:36.170
things like that and what we're
doing at this point is

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:40.180
we're modeling what's going on
at the frequency bandwidth

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.840
that we're using --

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.300
namely, not the carrier
frequency anymore, but the

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.550
baseband bandwidth.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:51.380
We're viewing this filter as
having filtered these things

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:56.650
out for us so we wind up with
a baseband discrete filter

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:00.420
that filters these impulses
and aggregates them under

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.270
discrete caps.

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:07.780
So at this point, when we look
at this filter for what the

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:11.630
channel is doing, instead of
seeing a bunch of impulses, we

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:14.120
see a rather smooth waveform.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:18.110
If we look at what contributes
to each tap, we see a large

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.775
number of different
paths, which all

00:45:20.775 --> 00:45:24.720
contribute to the same tap.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.710
If the multipath spread
is not too large

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.230
relative to 1 over w --

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:35.600
if if the multipath spread is
small relative to 1 over w,

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.510
then you can really represent
this whole thing in one path.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.790
In other words, if the multipath
spread is very, very

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:47.500
small and the sampling time
interval is big, everything

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.980
just appears under one tap and
that's called flat fading.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:56.490
When you have flat fading, the
output that comes out is

00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:00.360
really just a faded version of
the input and there isn't any

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.710
time dispersion on it.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:02.960
It all just --

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:10.420
it's an undistorted version of
what got sent, except it's

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:16.640
very slowly fading and coming
back up again and fading again

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.950
and coming back up again.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:25.790
If you have a slightly wider
bandwidth, then you need

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.660
multiple taps.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.610
If you look at most of the of
the systems that are being

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:37.110
built today, the largest number
of taps they ever used

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:40.780
in this kind of implementation
is three to five or something

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.310
in that order, so it's not a
huge number of taps that we're

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:47.560
talking about, because the
bandwidths are not huge.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:47:03.740
But anyway, statistically what
we wind up with is that if the

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:09.090
bandwidth that we're using is
relatively narrow and it's not

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:17.430
too many times what this
term 1 over L is --

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.870
namely, this multipath spread,
then we wind up with a small

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.910
number of paths.

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:26.440
We can sort of assume that we
have a large number of paths

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:30.130
coming in on each tap and then
what we're doing is that each

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.810
tap strength is going to be a
sum of a bunch of terms which

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:38.250
are essentially random.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.670
If you add up a bunch of
complex terms that are

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:42.480
essentially random,
what do you get?

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.850
If you add up a very humongous
number of them, you get

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.260
something which is Gaussian.

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:58.460
If you were modeling these
things statistically, you

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.250
would like them to
be Gaussian.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:01.870
So what do you do?

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.610
You assume that they're
Gaussian, which is what

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:07.180
everyone does.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:13.240
As a slight excuse for that,
what we're really interested

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.900
in if you're designing cellular
systems, you're

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.720
trying to build cellular
receivers which will deal with

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.460
all of the different
circumstances that they come

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:28.850
up against and as you walk
around or drive around using

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:34.360
these things, if you look at
the ensemble of different

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.150
situations that these phones
are faced with, over that

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:43.180
ensemble of things, each of
these taps is pretty much

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:47.090
going to look like a Gaussian
random variable.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:51.270
If you look at one sample path
of one little cellular phone,

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:54.430
then no, it won't look like that
-- but as far as a design

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.300
tool, it looks like something
which you can model as

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:04.040
Gaussian because you're going to
view each of these taps in

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.390
this filter, in this time
varying filter, the sum of

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:12.430
lots of unrelated components and
therefore, we're going to

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:18.040
take the density of these taps
and a statistical model as

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.410
being jointly Gaussian --

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.700
a proper Gaussian random
variable for each of them.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:29.430
What happens if different taps
is jointly Gaussian?

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:35.030
So what we wind up with is a
model for wireless channels

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:41.820
then, where the channel itself
is a Gaussian random process

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:46.050
and as a Gaussian random process
both in tau and in t,

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:52.460
it's easier to look at if we
look at it in terms of these

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.490
discrete samples.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:58.770
Namely, we're going to look at
the channel now, not in terms

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.880
of a wavelength type of thing.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.920
We're just going to look at it
as a bunch of taps, which the

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:10.720
receiver has to add over to get
to the received waveform.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.660
We're going to model each of
those taps as being Gaussian.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:17.810
We're going to model in time
t as being stationary.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:23.450
We're going to model them in
time tau as coming up and

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:27.180
going back down again and
existing over a multipath

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.260
spread that's about
L in duration.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.430
So the phase is going to be
uniform with this density.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.270
This is this two dimensional
independent Gaussian density

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:47.010
that we've looked at so many
times and if you look at this,

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:50.560
it has circular symmetry to it,
which means if you look at

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.940
it in an amplituding phase, the
phase is random, uniform

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.790
between zero and 2 pi.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:03.700
The energy in it is exponential
and the magnitude

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:07.050
is this, which comes
from that --

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:11.310
which is what you call
a Rayleigh density.

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:14.840
So Rayleigh fading channels are
simply channels which you

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.820
have modeled as having
taps, which are

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.590
really random variables.

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:28.030
Real and imaginary parts, each
of them have the same

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:29.200
distribution.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.320
I mean, you'd be very very
surprised if you looked at

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.640
these taps after the way we've
derived them and you didn't

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.260
find the same distribution
on the real part as

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.510
the imaginary part.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.900
If you look at the real part
and imaginary part, they're

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.100
simply coming as an arbitrary
phase, which comes from some

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.800
arbitrary demodulating frequency
that you've used

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:02.670
with a phase in there that
doesn't have any physical

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:04.540
connotation at all.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.650
I mean, what is real is what
you choose to call real and

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:11.490
what is imaginary is what you
choose to call imaginary.

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:15.650
If you made your time reference
just a little bit, a

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.870
smidgen away from where your
time reference is, what is

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:21.840
real would become imaginary and
what is imaginary would

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.250
become real again and you can't
expect the channel to

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:29.140
know what time reference
you've chosen.

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:32.350
I mean, this is sort of a big
philosophical argument, but

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:36.400
you certainly wouldn't expect
these random variables to have

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.900
a distribution which
is anything other

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.220
than uniform in phase.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.750
So that's the distribution we
get and what we now have is we

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:53.170
changed this awful physical
situation into a very simple

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:58.070
analytical situation where what
we're doing is modeling

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:03.350
this complex channel as just a
bunch of taps in time, at some

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:07.190
bandwidth that we're using and
each of these taps is now

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:14.820
Gaussian and the output is going
to be the discrete sum

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.710
as we take a discrete sequence
of inputs, pass it through

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:23.100
this discrete filter and then we
add up these outputs and at

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.840
that point, we have to worry
about how do we detect things

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.730
from what's coming out?

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:31.040
So they say here -- this is
a really flaky modeling

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.370
assumption and it's only partly
justified by looking at

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:40.890
lots of different situations
that a given cellular phone

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:44.310
would be placed in.

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:47.790
If we look at this whole
ensemble, it makes a little

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:56.380
bit of sense, but really what
we're doing here is saying

00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:00.280
what we want is a vehicle to
let us understand how to

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.010
receive these waveforms.

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.350
We know there is going
to be fading.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:07.290
Since we know there is going to
be fading, we have to find

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:10.520
some kind of statistical model
for it if we're going to find

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.100
sensible things to do
and this is the one

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:14.350
we're going to pick.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.530
It's very common instead of
using a Rayleigh fading model

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.870
to use a Rician fading model.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:28.620
A Rician fading model makes
sense because if you have a

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:34.790
line of sight directly to a base
station, the waveform you

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:38.090
get from the base station is
going to be kind of strong and

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:41.790
all of these waveforms you get
reflected from other obstacles

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:45.320
and so forth are going
to be rather weak.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.300
So in that case, you're going
to have one strong received

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.290
waveform, which is one big peak
and everything else is

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:53.840
going to be very weak.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.490
The thing that that says is the
kind of statistics that

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:04.020
you want are not a sum of a lot
of little tiny things, but

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.910
the sum of one big thing and
lots of tiny things.

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.910
That's not a good
model either.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:13.340
What you would really like is
a sum of a bunch of medium

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:17.420
sized things most of the time,
but about as far as anybody

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:26.280
gets talking about statistical
models for fading channels is

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:30.090
talking about Rician model and
talking about Rayleigh models

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:32.820
and then worrying about what
happens the different paths of

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.970
these filters.

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:38.590
The trouble with Rician random
variables is they're very

00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:39.710
complicated.

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:42.050
They have vessel functions
in them.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:47.100
If you read the notes I passed
out today, you find that when

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:51.690
you try to detect things, when
they've gone through this kind

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:57.780
of Rician fading, everything
is just a bloody mess.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.690
That's the way it is.

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:07.850
Since we are talking now about
a statistical model for these

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:12.463
channels, we would like to have
something called a tap

00:56:12.463 --> 00:56:19.040
gain correlation function, which
is going to tell us how

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:22.540
each of these taps
vary in time.

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:33.020
That's just the expected value
of Gkm and G of k prime n.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.050
What we're going to assume, and
what is really a very good

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:40.220
assumption, is if you look at
the things that add up as taps

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:45.870
under a particular value of k
and under some other value of

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:50.040
k -- in other words, all of the
paths that are coming in

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.710
in one range of delays and all
the paths that come in on

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:56.450
another range of delays, those
things are pretty much

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:58.190
independent of each other.

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:05.080
So almost always, when you start
calculating tap gain

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.840
correlation functions, you
assume that this is

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:10.370
independent when k is
unequal to k prime.

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:13.340
So really the only thing you're
concerned about here is

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:18.030
how these quantities
vary in time.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:20.830
We've already talked about
how they vary in time.

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:26.860
In other words, that was why
we talked about all of this

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:30.520
business about time coherence
and Doppler shifts.

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.610
The thing which is causing these
things to change in time

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:36.000
is these Doppler shifts.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.040
We have already decided that the
amount of time the channel

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:46.040
remain stable is about 1 over
2 times this Doppler spread.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:50.390
Here we have an analytical,
statistical way of doing the

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:52.570
same thing.

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:56.840
In other words, you can look at
this correlation function

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.710
here and you can see how long
it takes before it drops

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:02.800
essentially to zero.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:08.270
So you can define the time
coherence in terms of this

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:12.900
duration here just as well as
the way we've already done.

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:17.410
In other words, how big does n
have to get before this thing

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:19.660
gets small?

00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:22.080
What's the advantage of doing
it this way instead of in

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.060
terms of Doppler shifts?

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.160
If you want to measure it, you
don't have to go out and

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.210
measure where these paths are.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:34.670
If you want to measure it, you
just take a cellular phone and

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:37.490
you measure where these things
are coming in and how they

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:41.380
change in time and that gives
you a direct view of what the

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.970
time coherence is.

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:49.360
Why that W was there, there's
a problem in the problem set

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.720
that will give you some insight
into why it's there,

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.720
but otherwise it's
just arbitrary.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:58.290
I want to spend the rest of
the time talking about

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:03.440
Rayleigh fading, because
Rayleigh fading is something

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.420
you can analyze easily.

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.280
We're going to do something
even simpler.

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.110
We're going to do Rayleigh
fading where you have

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.380
a single tap model.

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:21.040
In other words, where the
bandwidth that you're using is

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:28.090
small enough that all these
different paths all fall in

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:29.630
the same delay range.

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:37.690
In other words, it's where the
multipath spread, L, is small

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:42.370
relative to 1 over W. That's
what's called flat fading, so

00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:45.550
we're assuming flat fading and
we're assuming that it changes

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:48.240
in time according to
a Rayleigh model.

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:59.030
Suppose that we do something
really simple, like trying the

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:02.060
antipodal signalling that we've
been using all along,

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.130
which is really neat when
you have Gaussian noise.

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:14.390
It's just about the best kind of
signaling that you can use.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:18.410
It doesn't work at all here
and it doesn't work at all

01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:23.360
because since this channel is
Rayleigh fading, you don't

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.570
know what the phase is of the
channel, so you send a bit and

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:31.180
what comes in is something
which, sure, it has an

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:34.880
amplitude to it, but it has a
completely random phase to it,

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.530
so you can't tell the
difference between

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.450
one and minus one.

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:42.350
The only way you can tell is to
send first one signal and

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:45.620
then another signal, but if
you send one signal and

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.910
another signal, you might as
well choose a single pattern

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:52.720
which lets you do
this sensibly.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.840
So the particular thing that
we'll look at is something

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.880
called post position
modulation.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.850
This is essentially the same as
about ten other schemes and

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:06.580
we'll talk about that a little
more later, but what you're

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:10.630
going to use is two degrees
of freedom, which is two

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:13.060
different time instants.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.930
In the first instant, you're
going to send an a.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:19.680
In the second instant, you're
going to send a zero where

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.850
conversely, you're going to
send a zero in the first

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:26.750
degree of freedom and an a in
the second degree of freedom.

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:30.280
So you can do this either with
two different frequencies, you

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.570
can do it with two different
time instants.

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.960
You can do it in all sorts
of different ways.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:39.660
Any time you have two degrees of
freedom, you either use one

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.940
degree of freedom or you use the
other degree of freedom.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.870
It's not like the situation
we've talked about before,

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:49.320
because these degrees of
freedom are now complex

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.910
degrees of freedom.

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:55.420
If I send the one, it's going
to come in as some complex

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:01.140
number, which is going to
have uniform phase.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:09.240
So my hypotheses now are one
hypothesis is a and zero and

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.260
the other hypothesis
is zero and a.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:18.550
What's going to happen with
these hypotheses is that

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:21.440
first, the channel is going
to do its thing to them.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.430
In other words, if I send this,
the channel is going to

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:27.470
take that a.

01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:31.780
It's going to multiply it by a
circularly symmetric Gaussian

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:37.150
random variable, so it's going
to come as some blob and in

01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:41.410
the other dimension, what I send
is a zero, so what comes

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.170
in there is nothing.

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:47.890
I'm going to add noise to this,
so when I send a zero,

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:49.530
I'm going to get --

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:51.950
from the channel, I
get a blob in this

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:53.490
first degree of freedom.

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:55.440
The noise adds another
blob, which is

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.110
also circularly symmetric.

01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:01.600
What comes in the other degree
of freedom is zero on the

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.120
channel and a blob of noise.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.660
So I'm going to base my
detection on either a big blob

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.310
or a little blob and on the
other hypothesis, I got a

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:15.610
little blob here and
a big blob there.

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:21.210
So the question is, you have to
look at this pair of blobs

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:23.380
and decide from it what
you think was

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.840
the most likely signals.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:34.000
Sounds hard, but it turns out
that it's easy, because look,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.820
under the hypothesis H 0, what
you're going to receive --

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.800
and these are a times a complex

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.310
variable, G 0 plus Z 0.

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:50.090
Both of these are Gaussian
random variables, both zero

01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:55.630
mean, both circularly symmetric
and V 1 is going to

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:57.630
be just Z 1.

01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:01.340
So here I have a sum of two
Gaussian random variables.

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.840
Here I have one Gaussian
random variable.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:17.190
V 0 is complex Gaussian and its
variance is a squared plus

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:21.550
N 0 times W, because that's
what the noise is.

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:27.320
So I look at the probability
density of these two complex

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.330
Gaussian random variables,
sample value v 0 and v 1,

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:33.350
conditional on H 0.

01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:35.700
What I have is some
constant here --

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.370
I don't even care about it --

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:41.470
times e need to the minus
v 0 squared divided by a

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:45.070
squared plus wn 0.

01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:49.700
This is the variance of
V 0, because V 0 was a

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.820
squared times G 0.

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.000
That's the a squared there.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.170
Variance is Z 0 WN 0 and for the
other random variable --

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:03.260
that's the little blob
random variable --

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:06.660
probability density of that
is minus v 1 squared

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:11.510
divided by WN 0.

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:14.640
For the alternative hypothesis,
I get the same

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.470
constant out front, which I
haven't even bother to write

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:23.480
down, times e to the minus
v 0 squared over WN 0.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.430
Here are the other variables:
The one where we have the big

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:32.060
blob, so that's the variance
a squared plus WN 0.

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:36.980
I take the log likelihood ratio,
which is to take the

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:42.400
logarithm of the ratio of these
two hypotheses, of these

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:48.450
two likelihoods, and when I take
this quantity and divide

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:52.890
it by this quantity, these are
both up in the exponents, so

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:56.590
I'm just taking this and
subtracting this.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.450
When I subtract this quantity
from this quantity and then

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:05.000
subtract this quantity from this
quantity, what I get is

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.110
just this quantity here.

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:14.480
I mean, you can see it's simple
because this difference

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.970
is going to be the same as this
difference, except they

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:18.670
have a different sign.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:22.060
So it's just algebra to find out
what happens when you when

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.190
you take this minus this
and then you take

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.980
minus this plus this.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:30.660
This is what you get.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:34.400
Then you look at that for a bit
and you say, how do I find

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.580
the probability of
error from this?

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:41.210
Before we find the probability
of error, the first thing we

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:47.050
have to do is say, what's
the maximum

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:50.500
likelihood rule to use here?

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:54.530
Maximum likelihood rule is you
take the log likelihood ratio

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:57.730
and if it's positive,
you choose v0.

01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.770
If it's negative, you choose v1
and if it's 0 -- if 0 was

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:05.390
zero probability, it doesn't
matter what you do.

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:09.140
So what we're interested
in now is, what is the

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:13.800
probability that this quantity
here is going to

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.460
be bigger than zero?

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:24.720
But you see, this isn't hard
because when you look at the

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:29.430
difference between v 0 squared
and v 1 squared, v 0 squared

01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:32.430
is an exponential
random variable.

01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:37.490
It's just the energy of
a complex Gaussian.

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:41.210
So we're taking one exponential
random variable,

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:44.710
subtracting off another
exponential random variable

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:49.790
and we're just looking at it
over on the region where these

01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:53.170
things are positive.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:59.470
When you integrate that, this
is the answer that you get.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:00.875
I mean, it's not hard
to integrate it.

01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.125
I just don't --

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.850
and if you look at the notes,
the notes carry it out in all

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:12.900
of its gory detail, but it
really is about two steps.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.350
The thing we want to look at is
this result here, because

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:21.370
it looks so different from all
of the error probability

01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:23.610
results that we've
gotten before.

01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:26.880
I mean, before, error
probabilities go down

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:33.670
exponentially as a square of
the signal amplitudes that

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:37.350
we're using and they go down
exponentially with the energy

01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:38.890
that we're using.

01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:46.230
Here, this crazy thing is going
down as 1 over 2 plus

01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:48.270
energy to noise ratio.

01:08:48.270 --> 01:09:02.390
This is 1 over 2 plus
Ed over N 0.

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.880
So it really goes down slowly.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.440
So what's going on?

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.500
I mean, why is it that with all
of these Gaussian random

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:14.440
variables where things go down
so fast, we're really in such

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.690
deep trouble here?

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:23.010
The trouble is, every time the
fading is significant and the

01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:27.340
fading is significant
whenever --

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:32.630
under hypothesis 0, if
you don't have much

01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:34.190
of a channel --

01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:37.110
namely, if both v 0 and
v 1 are both very --

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.940
if both the real part of G 0 and
the imaginary part of G 0

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.750
are both very small --

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:51.160
which happens with reasonable
probability --

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:59.280
then you don't have a chance of
trying to decode correctly

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.740
because the two signals are both
going to look the same,

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.660
because both of them are just
Gaussian random variables.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:12.220
So as a result of that, when
you're dealing with Rayleigh

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:17.580
fading, you really have to find
something else to do in

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.700
order to make this work.

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.000
I mean, if you have Rayleigh
fading and you just try to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.320
communicate in the way that we
tried to communicate before --

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.700
just sending individual bits
and hoping for the best,

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.890
you're in very deep trouble.

01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:36.660
So next time we'll start to
talk about ways of dealing

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.170
with this using diversity, using
channel measurement,

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.400
using all sorts of other
things, but --

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.190
I don't know what happened to
the person who was supposed to

01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:53.380
evaluate the class, but maybe
they will come in next week.

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.900
I don't Know.

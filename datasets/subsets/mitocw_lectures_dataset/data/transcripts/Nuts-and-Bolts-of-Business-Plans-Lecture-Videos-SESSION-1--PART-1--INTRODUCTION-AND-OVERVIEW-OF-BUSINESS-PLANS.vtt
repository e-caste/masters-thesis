JOE HADZIMA: OK, Good evening.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.670
Everybody nice and
warm from the snow?

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.490
Thank you for coming to Nuts
and Bolts of New Ventures

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.860
and Business Plans on a
snowy night in Cambridge.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.320
My name is Joe Hadzima.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.090
And this is the first
of six evenings we're

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.350
going to have for the course.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.950
The course name is Nuts
and Bolts of New Ventures

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.250
and Business Plans.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.700
First of all, it's not really
about the business plan itself.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.140
Think of it as we're going
to talk about how to plan

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.870
and execute a new venture.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.150
And don't think
of a business plan

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.030
as a fixed document
in this course.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.410
Really, it's a dynamic
process we're going through.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.150
It may be a document.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.774
It may be a few slides.

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.190
But at the end of
the day, what it

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.420
ends up being is a
shared vision between you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.060
and your team as to where
we are, where we're going,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.780
and how we plan to get there.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.370
So that's the goal of all this.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.820
And I should also
say, because I know

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.700
some people in the audience are
not doing traditional business

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.340
ventures, we're going to use
the business terms a lot,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.580
but this could equally apply
to social-developmental

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.610
entrepreneurship, to nonprofits
even to governmental ventures.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.130
It's a way of thinking about
how to organize new ideas

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.480
and get them going.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.410
Now a little bit
about the course.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.430
This is the 25th
year-- it's hard for me

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.660
to believe it's been 25
years-- for the course.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.950
And the founding of the course
has an entrepreneurial lesson

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.060
in it.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.590
So here's the backstory.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.180
I was teaching some things
here on legal stuff.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.110
And some students
came up and said--

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.970
I think we had one
entrepreneurship

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.485
course at Sloan at
the time and they

00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:22.850
had taken that-- and they
said it's a great course,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.110
but it's not telling
us anything practical.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.050
So could you do a
course during IAP

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.470
to tell us how to do
something practical,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.460
how to start a company?

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.740
So this was back 25 years
ago before the internet.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.580
And the IAP courses were
in a fixed, printed catalog

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.480
that you would get.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.260
Shows you how far we've come.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.950
So I said, well, I'll
think about doing a course

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.290
and let me get back to you.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.650
Well, I got tied-up
with some other things.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.110
And then they came to me and
said, we put it in the catalog

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.010
and we dare you not to show up.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.220
Interesting.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.160
So I thought about
it for a while

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.860
and I thought, well,
I should be angry,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.110
but I think I have a customer.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.820
I think these people
want something.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.285
So the first attribute
was I had a customer.

00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:14.450
I'll right, I'll play
this game for a bit.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.970
Problem is I only had
two weeks to organize it.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.780
So that wasn't enough time
to really do anything formal.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.870
So I said-- I think it was
four nights-- all right,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.580
we'll do two hours, three
hours, we'll do eight topics

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.932
and I'll go and find some
people who know about those.

00:03:32.932 --> 00:03:35.140
And how am I going to make
it easy at the last minute

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.430
to get these people?

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.320
I said just come into class
and whatever the field

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.515
is that you're in speak maybe
10 minutes on the five things

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.890
I wish somebody had told me
about whatever you're talking

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.760
about before I got started.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.615
Then we'll do
questions and answers.

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:52.490
And I said, I've got to
make it entertaining.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.800
So I called up people
and said, do you

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.960
know somebody who
can do this talk?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.625
And if you do, you have to
have seen the person talk,

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:05.100
they have to be entertaining,
you have to vouch for them.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.500
And so we did this in
a period of two weeks.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.540
And probably half
the speakers that

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.870
showed up for that first
session I had never met before.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.730
So I'm thinking this is
going to be a disaster.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.709
It turned out to
be a great success.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.590
And I think the
lessons for this,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.280
in an entrepreneurial way were
I had a customer for a product,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.570
they wanted something, I
was able to clearly define

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.580
the task-- because I didn't
have time to do anything more;

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.310
if I had done it
myself, it probably

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.810
would have taken
longer and not been

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.110
as good-- I got great people,
and I was able to communicate

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.480
to them what the task was, and
then I got out of their way

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.600
and they did a great job.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.180
So there's an
entrepreneurial lesson

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.830
in how to start a company.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.590
Make sure you have
customers, get great people.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.350
The whole business planning,
new venture-type thing

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.080
is really trying to
find what the task is

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.580
and then to be able to
communicate, and execute on it.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.214
So the course really is
an entrepreneur venture.

00:05:09.214 --> 00:05:10.130
That's how we started.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.539
And later Joost
basically figured out

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:15.830
how we could get credit for it.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.450
And it's just
blossomed ever since.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.820
So that's the background.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.490
In the 25 years we've
seen all sorts of things.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.610
We've seen bubbles--
the internet bubble.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.750
I stood here thinking I
just read in the paper

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.810
that Hotmail, back
in 1997 or so,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.450
had started up and been sold
in 18 months for $450 million,

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.730
basically giving away email.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.480
And I'm thinking how
am I going to explain

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.440
to people this isn't
the way it usually

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.950
works in periods of time.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.270
More recently, Instagram.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.090
So there are some things that
happen at points in time that

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.730
defy direct logic.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.970
And if you can
catch those waves,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.390
that becomes a good thing to do.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.170
We've also seen busts after
the internet collapsed,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.840
after the financial
markets collapsed.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.270
Actually, that is one of the
best times to start a company.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.320
And many of the really
enduring companies

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.770
have been started
during down times.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.850
And the reason is resources
aren't available-- financing

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.070
dries up-- you've got
to be really focused,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.350
you have to actually
deliver something of value.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.260
And there's a lot of history
about companies to get

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.400
started during down times.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.930
But through all of
that, ups and downs,

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.240
it all boils down to
really two basic thoughts,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.390
and we're going to touch
on it over and over again

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.190
in the course.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.600
And that is whether it's
a business, whether it's

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.360
a nonprofit, whether it's
a governmental project,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.470
the first thing you've
got to do is create value.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.479
So if you're not creating value,
You can't really do anything.

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.270
And then having created
value, the question

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.810
is how do you capture
some or all of that value

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.580
to make what you're
doing sustainable.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:13.740
And sustainable in the concept
of the traditional companies is

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.350
profit and in the context
of developmental stuff

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.760
it can be we can do it
again, rinse and repeat.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.494
So when we look
at creating value,

00:07:22.494 --> 00:07:23.910
we're going to be
asking questions

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.140
about who do we
create value for,

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:33.340
how much value do we create,
and how do we create it.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.290
And then when we talk
about capturing value,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.570
the traditional way has been
for customers somebody who

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.830
will pay you for your
goods, the product you do,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.220
or your services.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.910
And the trick, as we'll see,
in financial projections

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.420
and the business
model parts that'll

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.710
come in the next few days, is
that whole process something

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.920
where you can make enough
money that you can continue it.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.230
So traditional capture of
value is through customers.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.750
There are other ways
to capture value

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:09.320
in the area of the
advertising or monetization

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.660
that we'll talk about also.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.930
And you think about things like
where third parties provide

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.470
that payment.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.110
So think of the US
health care system

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.280
where historically the patient,
the person who the value is

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.650
delivered to-- as in you're
going to get treated--

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.800
isn't really paying
directly the cost of that.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.770
So sometimes figuring
out how that works

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.320
can be the challenging part.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.640
So at the end of the day,
to make all this happy,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.390
we're going to need people--
that's the number one

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.200
thing you're going to
need for a venture--

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.822
resources of some sort-- either
cash or partnerships-- skills--

00:08:53.822 --> 00:08:56.030
some of them you'll learn
in this class, some of them

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.000
you'll learn on the job--
and then that one that's

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.800
the hardest one to figure
out, but if you can get it

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.200
it's the best, and
that's called luck.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.440
I'll always, go with some luck.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.000
So our goal for the
course is basically

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.740
to make sure you get infected
with the entrepreneurial

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.490
thinking virus.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:22.540
And it really is a virus
that can be infectious.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.430
The good news is it's
not known to be fatal.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.980
It's highly contagious.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.850
It is a lifelong affliction, so
you'll have to get used to it.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.260
But at the end of the day,
I think if you catch it

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.850
you'll be in best shape.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.670
This is what we're going
to be doing tonight.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.660
We're going to tell you a little
bit about who you are, we're

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.390
going to introduce
the teaching team,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.230
we'll introduce the case
study and business plan

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.920
basics tonight, and then
we'll take a small break,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.980
and then we'll get on
with Steve Pearse, who's

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.850
come all the way from
Florida today to talk to us.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.570
He's thinking maybe that
wasn't such a good idea.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.665
So who is in the class?

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.140
Some of you signed up-- many of
you signed up-- at the website.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.690
We had 160 signed up.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.114
And the organizations
that you're from

00:10:18.114 --> 00:10:20.030
are-- and I'll just read
them alphabetically--

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.740
Boston University, Broad
Institute, Columbia University,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.030
the Department of Defense,
Harvard College, Harvard

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.730
Kennedy School, and
Harvard Business School,

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.400
Mass General Hospital,
University of Massachusetts,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.620
University of Macedonia,
University of Michigan,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.745
Toronto, Wellesley College,
several private companies

00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:46.610
that I won't say your names to
protect you, and of course MIT.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.710
Now the areas that you
said you were interested

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.200
in are all over the place.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.500
We have consumer devices,
foreign language learning,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.580
financial technology,
social enterprise

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.880
related to health care,
educational technology,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.772
medical devices.

00:11:02.772 --> 00:11:04.480
One of the reasons
I'm going through this

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.120
is that we hope that in
the period of this course

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.650
you'll actually form some teams.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.424
So if you find some of
these topics interesting,

00:11:12.424 --> 00:11:13.840
or if you're some
of these people,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.112
then at least I'm
shouting you out a bit.

00:11:16.112 --> 00:11:17.820
We have nuclear energy--
for those of you

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.910
into that-- specialty biotech
chemicals, a sleep product,

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:28.970
oncology drug delivery,
biotechnology, 3D printing,

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:34.500
eyeglasses in West Africa,
independent film industry, lab

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.490
testing process and equipment,
big data, data privacy,

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:46.040
B2B information technology,
energy technology, aerospace,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.050
crowd-funding, and e-commerce.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.590
So hopefully you'll find
a kindred spirit in those.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.230
Now what about the
background of the people?

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:59.050
We have some people this is
the first course they've ever

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.674
taken in entrepreneurship.

00:12:01.674 --> 00:12:03.340
We've had people that
have taken a bunch

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.340
of other entrepreneurial
courses at MIT

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.347
or at other universities.

00:12:07.347 --> 00:12:09.180
In fact, we have a
couple of people who have

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.030
taken Nuts and Bolts before.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.520
They did pass before, but
they're back for more.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.520
Several start-ups, somebody who
has always been in government,

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.530
and a couple people in 15 plus
years in large organizations.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.070
And some members of the
venture mentoring service

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.520
are actually in the audience.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.240
So we have undergraduates,
grad students, post-docs,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.450
visiting faculty, and staff.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.510
So it's a pretty
diverse audience

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.760
and we've got a lot to cover.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.530
So a little advice to the
people that are first timers.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.580
I would say soak it all in.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.829
And as you go
forward, try to think

00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:50.620
about the kind of things
we talk about when

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.660
you approach entrepreneurial
things for the first time.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.670
More experienced people, now use
this to refine your thinking.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.950
I've been in this course
for, as I said, 25 years.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.540
And every single year I
come up with some refinement

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.220
of my thinking listening
not only the speakers

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.770
but to the questions that come.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.380
So I hope you enjoy the course.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:19.246
We do have to calibrate
before we get going, though.

00:13:19.246 --> 00:13:23.310
It is MIT, so we have
our first formula.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:32.270
And it is H equals
R divided by E.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.480
So I've got an audience with a
whole bunch of different people

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.670
and we're trying to
solve this equation.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.844
And we're trying
to maximize H. So

00:13:41.844 --> 00:13:43.260
for those of you
that can't see, H

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.970
equals R divided by E.
Anybody want to take

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.410
a guess what these symbols are?

00:13:52.805 --> 00:13:54.426
Yeah, the snow has got to you.

00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:55.300
I'll give you a hint.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.160
H is happiness.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.577
OK, let's see.

00:13:59.577 --> 00:14:00.077
Yeah.

00:14:00.077 --> 00:14:01.540
AUDIENCE: Reality
over Expectations.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.164
JOE HADZIMA: Oh, he
jumped right to it.

00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:06.730
Reality over expectations.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.760
Last year somebody said
revenue divided by expenses,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.610
which is equally good I guess.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:12.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.175
So this is a
generalizable formula.

00:14:15.175 --> 00:14:19.730
And for those of you who have
even slight idea of math,

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.640
if I lower your
expectations to zero,

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.087
I can make you infinitely happy.

00:14:24.087 --> 00:14:26.170
But I think I'm never going
to be able to do that.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:31.260
But the point is this works
both for teaching here

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.870
and for everything you do.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:39.450
If you over-deliver
on what you promise,

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.510
you'll have people happy--
your investors will

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.410
be happy, your customers.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.360
So happiness is reality
divided by expectation,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.920
with the fact that you can never
quite get expectations to zero.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.250
So lower your expectations--
I want you to all be happy

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.170
as we move through the course.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.348
So who are we?

00:15:01.554 --> 00:15:06.270
We have Joe Hadzima,
Joost, Gino, Yonald

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.990
Chery, and some highly
paid volunteer speakers

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.710
I'll introduce.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.310
A little bit about
my background.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.530
Senior lecturer at Sloan.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.800
Was a partner in a law firm
in Boston for many years.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.510
Was one of the founding
judges of what's

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.080
now the 100K competition.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.590
Former global chairman of
the MIT Enterprise Forum.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.140
Managing director at Main
Street Partners, where we do

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.170
technology commercialization.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.410
And co-founder and
president of IPVision

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.010
that does intellectual
property analysis.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.890
I should say this is
the first course at MIT

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.600
that we're aware of that brought
both sides of campus together,

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.400
the engineering, science,
architecture side of campus

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.582
to the Sloan side.

00:15:44.582 --> 00:15:46.040
You would think
they're miles away.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.492
Until this class, they
really weren't together.

00:15:48.492 --> 00:15:50.450
There have been a lot of
companies launched out

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.130
of this class.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.390
Some have gone public.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:58.080
And it's been quite
a history over time.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.100
Then I'd like to introduce
our case study next.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:09.920
This is Virtual Ink, if you
can't read that logo up there.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.810
This is a case you
have in the materials.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.460
Is a computer
peripheral company.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.020
And let me see if I
can make this work.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.590
I'll give you a little bit
of an introduction here.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.966
Is that appearing up there?

00:16:33.966 --> 00:16:34.632
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:16:34.632 --> 00:16:37.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.622
-For the times when you
don't need a projector

00:16:39.622 --> 00:16:42.246
and writing on the whiteboard
is the best teaching tool,

00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:45.820
there's the MimioCapture
ink recording system.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.630
Enabled by MimioStudio Software,
the MimioCapture system

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.610
actually sees and
records everything

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.570
you write on the board in
real time and multiple colors.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.035
It can even convert
handwriting into editable text.

00:16:59.035 --> 00:17:01.510
The system creates
digital files that you

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.975
can send to your students so
now they can focus on the lesson

00:17:04.975 --> 00:17:06.460
rather than on taking notes.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.182
And you'll save time by
using the digital files

00:17:09.182 --> 00:17:10.420
in other classes.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.760
The MimioCapture
system works with you

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.254
MimioTeach interactive
system and comes complete

00:17:16.254 --> 00:17:19.150
with a magnetic charging
tray, four rechargeable marker

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.990
holders, and a digital eraser.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.150
The MimioCapture system,
bringing your white board

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.170
notes into the 21st century.

00:17:33.156 --> 00:17:34.374
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:35.040
JOE HADZIMA: OK.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.489
So that is an overview of what
Virtual Ink eventually became.

00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:42.030
And in fact, today they have a
whole bunch of other products.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:47.760
Yonald, our entrepreneur, who's
going to come in at the end,

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.830
was the founder of it.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.942
He's got a very
interesting story.

00:17:50.942 --> 00:17:52.900
The reason we use Virtual
Ink, even though it's

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.780
a little bit dated-- it
was in the late 1990s--

00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.050
is that it's an easy
concept to understand,

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.090
although there is some
technology behind it,

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.470
to be sure.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:08.530
It was entered in what was
then the 50K competition.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.400
It's an interesting story of
the times and the company.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.390
And most importantly,
Yonald himself comes in

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.470
and he tells you stuff that
you're not going to find.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.270
It's so easy to get people
into a class like this

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.180
who are successful.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.147
Oh, I came up with this
idea in my dorm room,

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.230
and I did this, we raised
some money, went public,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.960
now I'm wealthy.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.829
Well, you don't really
learn anything from that.

00:18:32.829 --> 00:18:34.870
You learn if it's lucky
and everything works out.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.910
But Yonald comes in
and he'll tell you

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.510
a very interesting story
of what he went through

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.700
during the whole period.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.520
Now we'll mention it from time
to time during the course.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.750
You'll see reference to it
in some of the materials

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.130
as you prepare.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.830
The entire plan is
in the course reader.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.930
Do not assume, however,
that it's a model plan.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:01.320
Every year we get people
handing in the executive summary

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.380
and they follow exactly
the Virtual Ink thing.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.270
And I don't want you
to do that-- I want you

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.560
to think on your own about it.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.980
But it's an interesting one.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.770
I tried to find another plan
to work on and a lot of people

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.450
won't give up
their original plan

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.180
or they never actually had one.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:23.140
So it's a unique
situation we have.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.150
Now we're going to go
into business plan basics.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.960
This is a introduction I'm
going to give about what's

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.800
in a business plan, the kind of
things you need to think about.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.579
And then over the course of
the next five, six nights

00:19:35.579 --> 00:19:37.620
we'll be filling in each
of the components of it.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.710
So think of this as a
high-level overview.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:46.350
And it's going to be a little
bit like the MIT fire hose

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.430
approach.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.820
For those of you who
aren't MIT students,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.560
they say that going
to MIT is like trying

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.560
to drink water from a
fire house-- it's just

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.240
so much coming at you.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.090
And we're going to
throw a lot at you

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.900
over this period of time.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.860
Some of it's going to stick
right away and some of it you

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.940
won't get for a while.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.790
And the reason I know
that is we get emails

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.504
back constantly saying, oh, I
just encountered this situation

00:20:11.504 --> 00:20:12.920
and I finally
figured out what you

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.640
were trying to explain to us.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.360
So we always want feedback.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.212
And as long as people find
what we're doing useful,

00:20:19.212 --> 00:20:20.920
we're going to continue
to do the course.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.160
So topics in my
overview is why write

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.470
a plan, what should
be in it, and then

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.800
talk a little bit about the
plan as a financing document.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.730
So does anyone know
who this character is?

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.810
This is Dwight Eisenhower,
Supreme Commander

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.680
allied forces
Europe, D-day, became

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.030
president of the United States.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:55.360
Life magazine he's on the
cover and he says plans

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.980
are worthless.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.810
So I guess we're
done with the course.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:06.550
This is a guy who planned and
executed this massive invasion.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.710
And if you've read any
of the history of it,

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.090
it's just an amazing operation.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.420
So plans are worthless.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.710
But planning is everything.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.310
So we'll talk about
business plans

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.130
and whether to write
one specifically.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.050
So for example, the
Wall Street Journal

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.210
had a big article about
does a start-up really

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.950
need a business plan.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.470
And what they're talking about
are written business plans.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.250
And there are academic
studies showing

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.170
that people would
be better off just

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.390
to go off and
launch the company.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.410
And I pretty much agree
with that at one level.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:48.060
I've been around the country
judging various business plan

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.890
competitions or classes
that have business plans.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.550
It's pretty clear that
the people doing it

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.400
have no intention of
actually starting a company.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.360
It's just an academic exercise.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.630
At MIT, that's not
what we're doing.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.490
And what Joost and the
people at the 100K did was

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.010
say we're trying to build
tomorrow's leading companies.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.150
This is about trying to
actually get things going.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:15.120
So a business plan, or at least
thinking about a business plan,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.390
is really what you need
to do to launch a company.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.930
So why actually
write a real plan?

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:28.360
Well, you have to, you
think, because nobody's

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.460
going to finance you
without something written.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.210
You may need it to talk
to strategic partners,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:38.180
to explain what you're
doing to others,

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.060
and to attract key people.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.005
But the real reason you
need to write a plan

00:22:43.005 --> 00:22:47.990
or think about it is you need
to understand your business.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:53.860
What is the scarcest resource
that you as an entrepreneur

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.610
have out there?

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:57.690
AUDIENCE: Money.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.510
JOE HADZIMA: Money?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.051
We have plenty of
money in the world.

00:23:00.051 --> 00:23:00.770
AUDIENCE: Time.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.520
JOE HADZIMA: Time.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.900
It's your time.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.320
The reason to
think it through is

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.550
you want to spend the
next three to five years--

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.350
or whatever--
working on something.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.712
Is this the best idea you have?

00:23:12.712 --> 00:23:14.920
For an entrepreneur, it's
always, well, I need money.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.210
Well, the point is
money tends to flow

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.210
to where opportunity is.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.210
So if you can create value and
opportunity, you can get money.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.950
It's harder in some parts
of the country than others.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.950
But the real scarce
thing is your time.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.160
So you really need to
understand and think

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.140
about the process of planning.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.690
The famous expression
people don't plan to fail,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.100
they just fail to plan.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.530
And in the course
of this course,

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.520
we're going to be asking
you to think about who

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.240
are your customers or users.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.210
Who cares about what I do?

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.720
Will they buy or use
what you're doing?

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.840
What will they pay or how can
you otherwise make money or get

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.980
resources, capture value?

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.010
How are you going to
make and deliver it?

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.050
Think about something as
simple as Netflix as a concept.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:07.240
Back when it wasn't
streaming it was a DVD

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.780
in a packet shipped to you.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.120
It's not an amazing concept;
it's pretty straightforward.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.240
But their key was they
could actually deliver on it

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.220
effectively and efficiently.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.960
Or Amazon selling books online--
that's how they got started.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.610
What's so hard?

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.020
Well, there's a lot that
goes on in the background.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.390
And what are the resources,
people, and technology

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:27.890
you'll need?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.930
And so whether it's a
Web 2.0, or biotech,

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.675
or social-developmental, I want
to just reiterate that there

00:24:39.675 --> 00:24:41.740
are really two basic things.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:48.110
It's create value and then
figure out a capture or harvest

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.494
the value.

00:24:49.494 --> 00:24:51.160
That's the key thing
we're trying to do.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:25:00.874
So how many of you have seen
the movie The Social Network?

00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:02.040
You may remember this scene.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.080
Let's see if this
works, if I can do that.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.150
So Eduardo says, it's
time to monetize the site.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.870
And Mark says, what's that mean?

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.070
And Eduardo says, it means
it's time for the website

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.195
to generate revenue.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.320
No, I know what that
means, but I'm asking you

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.460
how you want to do it.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.480
And he says
advertising-- remember

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.640
that famous advertising.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.910
And Mark's reaction is, no.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:41.300
And Eduardo says, well, we've
got 4,000 members-- this

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:45.260
is Facebook, 4,000 members.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.030
And Mark says, because
Facebook is cool.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.170
If we start installing
pop-ups for Mountain Dew,

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.031
it's not going to.

00:25:51.031 --> 00:25:53.030
And Eduardo says, well,
I wasn't really thinking

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.160
about Mountain Dew.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.160
But maybe at some point.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.800
I'm talking about the business,
and the company, the site.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.370
And Mark says, we don't
even know what it is yet.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.640
We don't know what it is, we
don't know what it can be,

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.540
we don't know what it will be.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.460
We know that it's cool,
it's a priceless asset.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.490
I'm not giving it up.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.570
Eduardo says, when
will it be finished?

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.450
And the famous answer
is, it won't be finished.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.587
That's the point-- the way
fashion is never finished.

00:26:22.587 --> 00:26:24.920
So here they are, these guys
that have created something

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.503
that they think has
value, and they're

00:26:26.503 --> 00:26:28.960
trying to figure out how
to harvest the value.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.500
So I went and I looked
at the 10-K for Facebook.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.220
10-K is the annual report
you file with the Securities

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.150
and Exchange Commission when
you're a public company.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.710
And in the first
part of it you have

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:45.930
to say what your business is.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.850
And they say our mission
is to make the world more

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.540
open and connected.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.970
And so I'm looking to try
to figure out what they say

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.380
they're business is after that.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.830
And it was very curious.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.400
They had three major
headings in the 10-K.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:06.060
The first one was how we
create value for users.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.450
The second one was how we
create value for developers

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.940
through the Facebook platform.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.210
And the third one was how do
we create value for marketers.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:20.090
So here they are a public
company with billions of users

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.040
now and they're focused on
how do they create value,

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.560
and they're still struggling
a bit with what their revenue

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.420
model is on the other side.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.666
So my point is the
same things that you're

00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:32.540
going to think about
starting a company-- how

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.110
do you create value and how
do you harvest value-- never

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.610
goes away.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.600
It's constant through this.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.890
I thought I could go to the 10-K
and find some really nice story

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.710
about how they harvest value
and they're still thinking

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:45.850
about how to create value.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.680
Now one way to think about
what we're going to do here

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.390
is to have a visualization.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.060
And I think of it as a pyramid.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.370
So at the top of
the pyramid you can

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.120
think of as your
mission statement,

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.210
similar to what Facebook said.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.800
And underneath that,
supporting that,

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.140
is your elevator
pitch-- do people

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.330
know what elevator pitches are?

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.500
We did that in the 100K.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.810
It used to be all of the
venture capitalist offices were

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:18.650
high buildings.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.380
So you'd have maybe 20 floors.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.520
The theory is you get
into the elevator,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.930
the person turns you
and say what do you do,

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:30.760
and you have 20 floors to
explain it in maybe 30 seconds.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.924
A lot of the VCs have moved
to two story buildings,

00:28:35.924 --> 00:28:38.340
so you have to do this as you
run up the stairs with them.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.810
So you've got to be even
crisper today than before.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.070
Underneath that might be the
executive summary-- we'll

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.260
go into that a little bit.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.630
Under that might be that
the PowerPoint presentation.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.420
Under that could
be the full plan,

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.250
if you get to the
point of writing one.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.530
But underneath all of that
are a set of foundations

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.190
of individual topics.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.480
We'll go through some of
these through the course.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.200
And the point is that
it takes a lot of effort

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.500
to distill everything down
up to the tip of the pyramid.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.580
And what you're
looking for is you

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.180
can describe that
top very clearly

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.810
and have it supported all
the way down through it.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:21.770
The mission statement might
be a sentence or a paragraph,

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.390
the elevator pitch
could be 30 seconds,

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.020
the executive summary
two to five pages,

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.250
PowerPoint 10/20/30.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.480
Do you know the 10/20/30 rule?

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.190
I put a link in on the website
to the Guy Kawasaki clip

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.050
about that.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:45.080
So PowerPoint-- I totally don't
do this in this presentation--

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:52.400
he says 10 slides, 20
minutes, 30 point font,

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.650
that's what you're aiming for.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.220
And then the full business plan
could be anywhere from 25 to 30

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.590
pages, if you end up doing that.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.200
The slides, by the way, for
most of the presentations

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.420
will be posted on the
website afterwards.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.960
So that will help you out.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.190
So now the question is, all
right, I sort of get it,

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.140
it's this image that I
have to do and figure out.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.590
Question is who
actually writes this.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.780
Is it the founder
alone, the team,

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.750
or even a professional
hired writer consultant?

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:35.880
Charlie Tillett-- who will
be here on Thursday-- and I

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.380
stood outside this room at
an MIT Enterprise forum event

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.030
during the break, and I asked
Charlie who had entered the 10K

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.260
competition back in the day.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.430
What are you doing
this summer, Charlie?

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:48.810
He says, well, I'm
graduating from Sloan,

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.410
I'm trying to think what to do.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.584
I said, well, I'm working
with some entrepreneurs.

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:54.500
I've been working with
them for a couple years

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.550
and they really could use
someone to help write a plan.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.430
They need to get some funding.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.950
And Charlie was game.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.665
We hopped in his truck,
drove up to a strip mall

00:31:03.665 --> 00:31:09.010
up in Tewksbury, I think it
was, a room with 10 engineers.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:14.335
And ended up joining the
company to write the plan

00:31:14.335 --> 00:31:18.210
and stayed with them through
when they went public.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.335
But at the end of the day,
it was the entrepreneurs

00:31:20.335 --> 00:31:22.120
that needed to own the plan.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.000
These guys were great
engineers, but they

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.680
couldn't write a plan if you
paid them a million dollars.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.440
They just couldn't
articulate it well.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.610
So that's one of the reasons
we try to put teams together.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.940
Because if you have a great idea
but you're missing some skills,

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.440
you've got to figure out a way
of getting people with skills

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.600
together.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.350
And those entrepreneurs
would never

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.320
have gotten anywhere
near where they are today

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.830
if Charlie hadn't joined them.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.330
And Charlie wouldn't have been
able to take a company public

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.871
if he hadn't hooked
up with the idea.

00:31:48.871 --> 00:31:52.160
So the point is
whoever writes it,

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.790
the team has to own the plan,
by which I mean they really

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.324
have to be able to defend it.

00:31:58.324 --> 00:32:00.490
Sometimes the issue is,
well what do they look like.

00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:04.170
Don't put it in a big binder.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.670
It doesn't really matter
how you put it together.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.720
It should just look somewhat
professional, but not overly

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.420
slick.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.630
You're an unknown character.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.000
If Bill Gates came up
to me and threw a napkin

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.370
on the table with some ideas
on it, he'd have my attention.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:26.100
But if you do the same thing,
you're not quite there yet.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.630
So it's the first
step towards it.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.290
You've got to have
something that

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.670
says this is a serious team
or person that are going

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.790
to do some serious things.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.760
Now the thing to
remember is the plan

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.137
is really a selling document
at the end of the day.

00:32:42.137 --> 00:32:43.720
If you're going to
be an entrepreneur,

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.250
you better get
comfortable with selling,

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.900
because you're always selling.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:53.410
You're selling customers,
you're selling financing people

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.410
trying to convince them.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.201
By selling I mean you're
trying to convince

00:32:56.201 --> 00:32:58.800
somebody that's what
you want them to do

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.250
is something they should do.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.840
Convincing people to do
something is quite a skill

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.092
and you should get good at it.

00:33:07.092 --> 00:33:08.300
You really should work at it.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.930
It's selling customers,
financing sources, partners,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:13.700
recruiting people.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.450
So you're always selling as
an entrepreneur at some level.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:21.040
You may not be the best, but
you should really practice that.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.100
So this plan, the first part
it's a selling document.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.584
And whatever it is, it's
not a hype document.

00:33:27.584 --> 00:33:29.625
At the end of the day,
it's got to be defensible.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.050
The elements of a full plan--
these are the topic areas,

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.490
whether or not you put them
in a written document or not,

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.810
you need to start
to think about.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.180
And during the course we'll
touch on a number of these.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.810
There's executive summary in
a traditional plan, something

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.470
it says what's the
opportunity you're looking at,

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.060
what's the market
you're going after,

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.150
what are the economics
of the business,

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.930
all of these things we'll go
into a little more detail.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.680
For the technologists
in the audience,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.600
note then there's no
particular section here

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.250
that says technology.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:13.280
And the reason is people by
and large don't buy technology.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.620
Technology is something we
use to accomplish things.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.540
And so the plan really
isn't fundamentally

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.060
about the technology, it's
what the technology enables.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.260
And when Bob Jones
comes in tomorrow,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.250
he'll talk a little
bit more about that

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.695
from a "what people
actually buy" viewpoint.

00:34:30.695 --> 00:34:32.820
Now a little bit more into
the nuts and bolts here.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.429
Cover page-- you should
have one in a plan.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.650
It should have some information
that you can figure out

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:42.360
who this plan is.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.880
How to reach people,
confidentiality legend,

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.210
and the securities
law legend, we're

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.840
going to cover that
in detail on the night

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.260
we do the legal stuff.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.620
Here is the Virtual Ink
cover page as an example.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.972
They've got some
contact info there.

00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:01.430
It always frustrated me, when
I actually got a written plan

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.340
if I liked it, often I
wouldn't be able to figure out

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.220
how to contact the people.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.230
So put the address on it.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.090
And they at they put a
little confidentiality legend

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:16.100
on it-- it looks something
like that, initially.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.390
And, as we'll see
in the night when

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:21.750
we do the legal stuff, when
the lawyers get ahold of this,

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.282
the legend changes a little bit.

00:35:24.282 --> 00:35:26.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.620
So I'm not saying don't
get the lawyers early on,

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.200
but realize that you've got
to manage them a little bit.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.290
But we'll go into
that in more detail.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.680
Now if you actually
have a written document,

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.660
it should have a
table of contents

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.440
so people can figure
out what's in it.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.580
And it should have page numbers
and all that sort of thing.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.710
So my question to you is what
do you think people read first

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.400
in a business plan?

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.220
What's the first
thing you would read

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.204
if someone gave you a plan?

00:35:57.204 --> 00:35:58.700
AUDIENCE: Executive summary.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.200
JOE HADZIMA: Executive summary,
because, as you'll see here,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.890
that explains what's going on.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.630
What's the second
thing people look at?

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.360
Probably most important
beyond when they figure out

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.610
what the heck this is about.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.230
It's the people.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.410
Who are these people?

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.307
So if you've got actual
document and they're

00:36:18.307 --> 00:36:19.890
trying to figure it
out, they're going

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.015
to get a little frustrated
if they can't figure out

00:36:22.015 --> 00:36:23.270
where the information is.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:26.205
So not to overdo it, but
have a table of contents.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.770
So if the first thing they
read is an executive summary,

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:33.670
what is it really?

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:38.290
Well, it's the first thing
investors read, as I said.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:42.990
Think of it as a resume
for your full plan.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.910
So the goal is to
get the interview.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:48.500
When you have a resume,
it goes out there,

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.070
you want to get the interview
so you can explain yourself

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.720
and hopefully get the job.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.090
In the case of a business
plan, the executive summary

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:01.360
or the elevator pitch is
really to get a chance

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.590
to explain more fully
what it is you're doing.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.760
And then when they look
at the executive summary,

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:15.220
I like to think about what
investors are looking for.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.380
And they're the three Ws.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.370
First one is why this.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:25.240
Why is what these people
are proposing to do,

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.130
why is it something I
should be interested in?

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.550
Why are they interested in it?

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.180
Is it a big problem?

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.680
It could be a big
market opportunity

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.550
or a big problem in the world.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:41.180
Amy Smith, who was
a MacArthur fellow,

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:44.080
teaches over at the Edgerton
Center, was in the 100K.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.580
And I remember quite
distinctly when

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.546
she got up to give her pitch
at the judging competition.

00:37:48.546 --> 00:37:50.170
She said something
that went like this.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:56.770
She said 1.9 billion
people in the world

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.760
don't have access
to clean water.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.420
Well, I didn't know that.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.854
In order to test
whether water is clean,

00:38:06.854 --> 00:38:08.270
the traditional
way of doing it is

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.640
to incubate the water to see if
anything bad is growing in it--

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.630
she said it a little more
articulately than I did.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.410
And she said all the
existing incubators

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.980
are powered by electricity.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.180
If you look where the
1.9 billion people

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.760
without clean water live and you
look where the electricity is,

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.810
they're not in the same place.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.950
Our invention is a
way to test water

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.620
without using electricity.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.220
Let me explain how you did it.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.220
So from an initial viewpoint,
well this is a big problem.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.050
So why this?

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.290
Big problem.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.560
So that's the first
thing-- why is what you're

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.290
proposing something important?

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.400
Why are you spending
your time on it?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.950
The second is why now.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.650
Why it is now the
right time to do it?

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:59.640
I've been on the bleeding edge
of technology for many years.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.470
I had somebody come up to me
at an investment conference

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.390
last year and he
said, you're at MIT,

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.920
and he said, well, tell me about
this new 3D printing thing,

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.870
it's really hot.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.170
And I said that's been
around for 20 plus years.

00:39:14.841 --> 00:39:17.090
Now it's getting interesting
for a variety of reasons,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:20.900
but I can show
you '20 years ago.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.290
So sometimes right
now is the right time.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:28.690
And I'll give you some
examples down the road.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.070
The third is why this team.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.710
Big problem,
something important,

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.300
there's a good
reason why it's now--

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.517
why are these people
right people to do it?

00:39:38.517 --> 00:39:40.100
Those are the things
people are really

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.920
trying to glean when they read
your plan or hear your pitch.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.670
To which I asked, if
they get the first three,

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.500
there's a fourth
one they get, which

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.410
is-- want to guess
what the fourth one is?

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.240
Why won't this work?

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.110
So in a selling
process when they

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:03.610
get the potential customer
pushes back and is starting

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:07.490
to ask questions about will it
work for this or work for that,

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:09.180
you've sort of got them hooked.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.650
And Steve will
probably talk to you

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:14.470
about how to set the hook
a little bit later tonight.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:18.550
So the three whys-- why
this, why now, why this team.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.500
That's what should come up.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:25.180
And the why won't this
work, part of the task

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.490
is to figure out
how to lead people

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.870
to the right conclusion on that.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:32.700
And I'll talk about it in
a little moment on that.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.280
So the executive summary,
two to five pages max.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.020
It's got to be clear.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.586
It's like a resume.

00:40:39.586 --> 00:40:41.210
And the object is at
the end of the day

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.580
someone could really articulate
what you're going to do.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.660
The elevator speech is to
the executive summary--

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.950
the elevator speech
might get you an invite

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:53.510
to submit an executive summary,
which might give you an invite

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:57.240
to do the whole plan or a pitch.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.580
It's going to try in two to
five pages to say who you are,

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:07.480
what are you doing, what is
a market, how many dollars

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.980
do you need, what resources,
what is your sustainable

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.545
advantage if you do this,
why you're going to succeed.

00:41:13.545 --> 00:41:15.170
You've got to pull
all of that together

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.461
in a very short period of time.

00:41:16.461 --> 00:41:19.550
It's a difficult
document to write.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.140
And you may end up writing
it over and over again,

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:26.550
because you've got to distill
that whole thing down to it.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:32.600
Let me give you an example
of two executive summaries.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.420
And since the font is so
small, I'll read it from here.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:41.280
The first one is called
electronic components.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.280
And let me read it to you, if
you can't see it on the screen.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.890
Electronic Components
Inc is a start-up company

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.790
that will make a variety
of electronic components

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:54.750
beginning with a new type
of aluminum base capacitor.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:57.020
The unique product, coupled
with an excessive demand

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.640
for capacitor devices,
will provide us

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.460
with an ample share of
the capacitor market

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.600
and numerous opportunities
for expansion

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.750
into related
electronic components.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.060
Everybody on board?

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.530
This is a real one.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.510
The founders are
dedicated and determined

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:17.470
to make the venture a successful
and profitable entity.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:18.606
That's good to know.

00:42:18.606 --> 00:42:19.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.400
I thought they were
just doing this for fun.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.570
Technical expertise
is provided by James F

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.820
Lynch, who's been involved
in designing capacitors

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.975
for 11 years.

00:42:27.975 --> 00:42:29.350
He attained a
bachelor of science

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.840
in electronic engineering
from Massachusetts Institute

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.040
of Technology.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.500
That alone is
probably going to get

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.186
him-- the experience
and the fact

00:42:37.186 --> 00:42:40.406
that he's MIT-- will overcome
all the other deficiencies

00:42:40.406 --> 00:42:42.780
here, which is I don't think
most people would understand

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.560
what it is he's proposing to do.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.920
Do you know what
they propose to do?

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.000
What its excessive
demand for capacitors?

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.920
Why is there excessive demand?

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.920
How big is the market?

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.790
And if you read the
rest of it, which

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.720
I suggest you do when
you get the slides,

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.780
it reads a bit like
a grant proposal.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.237
There is a good
thing in here that

00:43:07.237 --> 00:43:09.320
says that they've actually
put their own money in,

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.620
so the guy is committed.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.400
Now this is an
example of something

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.160
where, given the nature
of the person involved,

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.230
there's probably a lot
of substance underneath.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.700
But it's not doing a very good
service in trying to convey it.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:25.000
So that's a shame,
because there's so many

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.360
plans you read which don't
have any substance behind them

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.830
and yet they read a lot better.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:33.600
So we've got to figure out
how to make things better.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.450
Now the other one, by way of
contrast, is People Express.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:39.960
Well, let me read it.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.820
The eastern seaboard
of the United States

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.350
is ripe for the entry of a new,
super-efficient, low cost air

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:48.590
carrier to provide quick,
reliable, intercity air

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.289
transportation.

00:43:50.289 --> 00:43:52.080
Such an entity would
bring to the Northeast

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.730
the same benefits
that have accrued

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:56.370
to other areas of
the United States.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.760
Chief among these are
frequent jet commuter service

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.190
between major cities,
prices competitive

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.660
with private
automobiles, fulfillment

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.920
of the congressional goals
in enacting the Airline

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.335
Deregulation Act.

00:44:08.335 --> 00:44:09.960
The new company will
be able to achieve

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.440
these goals for the following
reasons-- aggressive

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.170
innovative management that's
been tested in the field;

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.380
equipment and facilities
designed specifically

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.970
for low cost production
of air transportation;

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.370
manpower selected,
trained, and motivated

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:26.390
to be efficient and
profit-oriented--

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.210
read between the lines,
non-union, probably;

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.110
and new systems to be applied
to the entire business.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.770
Now if you look at those
two executive summaries,

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:38.680
I think most people think
that the People Express, which

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.990
was the early version of
what we now call JetBlue,

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.290
is a lot clearer to
understand what it is.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.500
You could pretty much
see what they're doing.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.720
They're experienced guys, they
thought about how to design it.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.482
And you could start having
a discussion around this

00:44:57.482 --> 00:44:58.940
in a lot more detail
than you would

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:02.080
with the electronic components.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.130
So the trick is to end up having
an executive summary looks more

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:08.900
like the People Express than one
that just wastes a lot of words

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.120
and doesn't get to what
they're supposed to be doing.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:15.750
This is the Virtual
Ink executive summary,

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:18.510
which you'll see.

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:23.300
And again, it's not exactly
the model, but look at it.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.540
It was put this way into
the 50K at the time.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.420
And you decide
yourself whether you

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.330
think it's a good
executive summary as part

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.120
of your assignment.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.855
So let's move into
the body of the plan.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.910
And when I say the plan, I mean
in your planning process also.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.910
So the question is, what is the
opportunity you're going after;

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.960
what is the problem
you're trying to solve?

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.470
How big is it, what's
the opportunity now,

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:53.530
what's going to
happen over time,

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:59.290
and why is this the right time
for the product or service?

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:03.070
This reminds me in the 100K--
when it was the 50K back one

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.322
year we had a
semifinal award saying

00:46:06.322 --> 00:46:07.530
here are the semifinal teams.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.000
And one team came
up and said, I guess

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.760
you guys didn't like our plan.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.510
Now back in those days,
we didn't actually

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:15.370
know who the people were.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:17.244
That was part of it--
they were all no names,

00:46:17.244 --> 00:46:19.050
we just looked at the ideas.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.614
And I said, well, I don't
actually know what yours was.

00:46:21.614 --> 00:46:24.030
And they said, well, we were
the guys with the air traffic

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:26.900
control system improvement.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.750
And it was a fascinating plan.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.989
They had figured out how
to make it more efficient.

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:34.280
And I learned a lot of things
about air traffic control

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.170
systems.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:38.100
And I said, the
problem is none of us

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.960
could see how that
could be a business.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.670
You would have to change the
entire air traffic control

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.340
system it appeared
in the United States.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:49.450
It looked like a great
solution, but is it a business?

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:52.220
And they said,
well, did you know

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:56.010
that the Federal
Aeronautics Administration--

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:59.070
FAA-- has put out a
request for proposal

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.790
for changing the air traffic
control system in the United

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:04.550
States?

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:05.890
No.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.840
Why would I know that?

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.730
They had assumed
everyone knew that.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:11.729
That would have changed
at the whole complexion.

00:47:11.729 --> 00:47:14.820
That meant at that
time the convergence

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.860
of a driver for the
business was there

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.070
and they didn't tell us that.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.240
So they didn't get
another opportunity.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.910
In the health care
area for many years

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:27.180
we'd see really interesting
technologies that could

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.520
improve outcomes for patients.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.090
And the question was, well,
who was going to pay for it.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.130
And a couple years
ago Medicare put

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.690
in some rules that said
that hospitals get penalized

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:40.920
if patients get readmitted.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.890
That's opened up
a huge opportunity

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:46.690
for things like home monitoring
or other kinds of things

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:49.887
that before it'd be very hard to
see how that was going to work.

00:47:49.887 --> 00:47:52.220
So there are a lot of new
companies trying to figure out

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.570
how they can do
things to finally help

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.985
patients for better outcomes.

00:47:56.985 --> 00:47:59.360
There wouldn't be a market
for that five years ago-- it'd

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.950
be a long, hard, uphill climb.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.140
So why is this the right time?

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.760
As I said, I've
been on the bleeding

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.290
edge of some of the stuff.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.790
The body of the
plan, it should talk

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.920
about the market, who's there.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.000
We'll go into more
detail with Bob

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.520
about talking about customers.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.741
Investors have these different
ways of thinking of things.

00:48:20.741 --> 00:48:22.490
And one of the questions
that surprised me

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:27.260
early on in my career was a
VC that's said, OK, I get it,

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.260
you've got a great idea.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.830
But let's say you do everything
that you said and you win.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:37.140
Who loses and what are
they going to do about it?

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.920
And we hadn't
thought about that.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.310
So you've got to think about
you're disrupting a market,

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.759
for example-- what's the
response going to be?

00:48:45.759 --> 00:48:47.550
The incumbents are just
going to sit there.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.280
So what's your plan for
thinking it through?

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.245
That's an example of
the planning process.

00:48:54.245 --> 00:48:55.620
These are the kind
of questions--

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.920
again, with Bob
Jones tomorrow night

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.230
we'll go into pricing,
and distribution,

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:01.380
and sales tactics.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:07.940
And another VC expression is
will the dogs eat the dog food.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.944
So it sounds like a great
thing, you convinced me

00:49:10.944 --> 00:49:12.610
it's a great thing,
but what evidence do

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.440
you have that anyone wants it?

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:20.990
That's customers-- will
the dogs eat the dog food?

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:25.110
Now the development
plan is how do you

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:28.300
piece the different
components together

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:32.410
in order to make something
that can work within the time

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:36.610
constraint you
have as a start-up.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:38.290
You don't want nuclear fusion.

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.790
Nuclear fusion we've
been working on

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.030
for 50, 70 years now.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:44.260
And the problem is, if
you've got a nuclear fusion

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.760
kind of project, is until
it completely works,

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.720
nothing works.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.150
So there's really
not a business.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:55.460
Is there a way you can take a
portion of it and make it work?

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.570
I looked at Zipcar early on.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:00.820
Everyone's familiar with Zipcar?

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.090
Fascinating concept-- it's
revolutionized a whole bunch

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:05.550
of transportation things.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:08.110
But there were so
many moving parts

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:12.010
that you had to put together
in order to make that work.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:13.900
At a place like
MIT, where the joke

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.140
is-- if you're recruiting
a faculty member,

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.090
you can have one
of three things,

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:25.650
you can have tenure, the
Nobel Prize, or parking.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.510
So parking is what
everyone picks.

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.150
So here's a company
Zipcar that's

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.400
got to figure out how
to get parking places.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.050
There are a lot of things that
were out of their control.

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:36.900
And at the end of
the day, it may not

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.896
have been a good investment.

00:50:38.896 --> 00:50:40.270
It may have changed
things, but I

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.400
don't think a lot of people
made a lot of money in Zipcar.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.360
So you want to try
to think through

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.630
do you have to change the
world totally in order

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:51.690
to make a dent in the world.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:54.760
Because again, limited time.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:51:00.950
The action plan--
this is part of what

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.080
I like to think of as the
identification of credibility

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.140
testers.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.670
As engineers, if
you said I've got

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:13.220
to build a bridge
across the Golden Gate,

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:16.620
there's a lot of things you
have to do to make that work.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.740
And engineering is very
much a think everything

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.860
through kind of thing and
often is very sequential

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.230
in its process.

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:29.370
The credibility testers, a
different way of thinking of it

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:32.480
is are there some things
that will make this project

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.240
extremely difficult
that if I can show

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:39.060
I can solve I can
de-risk the situation.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.660
So thinking about
a project from how

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.410
do I convince somebody
this is doable

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.110
is an important part of it.

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:48.900
Maybe in the case of
the Golden Gate Bridge,

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:54.740
it would be securing
access right to an on-ramp.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:59.110
Or if you think the issue
is a technical issue, doing

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:03.100
are sounding to figure out
how deep the bedrock was.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.842
I was sitting out
on Cape Cod beach

00:52:05.842 --> 00:52:07.300
one weekend with
some house-guests.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.365
And one guys told me he's
working on this project.

00:52:10.365 --> 00:52:13.619
It was very windy out there and
he said it's really windy here.

00:52:13.619 --> 00:52:15.160
I said, yeah, it's
always windy here.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.700
And he says we're working
on something involving that.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.100
And it turned out he was one
of the guys from Cape Wind.

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.300
And what they were doing
was securing access rights

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.740
to land the cables on it.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.240
Because if they
didn't do that, they

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.240
couldn't get to the next level.

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.830
So that first thing is can you
identify credibility testers

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:35.020
to reduce the risk.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.860
And if you reduce the risk,
both for you and for investors,

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.287
you have a higher
probability of success.

00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:42.120
The other thing is to
think about-- whatever

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.980
you're doing-- about
how to sequence

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.090
that relative to your resources.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.680
So the ideal scenario
again, remembering

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.390
H equals R divided
by E, is you want

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:56.120
to be able to ideally say I'm
going to do X and actually

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.430
achieve it.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:59.910
And then you can ask
for additional resources

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:02.530
to do the next step.

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.860
If you don't plan
that out well and you

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:08.830
get stuck between
tasks, then you

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:10.590
might be able to get
away with that once.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:12.923
But if you do it a second
time, people are going to say,

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:15.290
well, I'm not sure these
guys can actually execute.

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:18.130
So thinking about what are
the steps I can do versus

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.830
the resources in order
to achieve something

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:23.105
that I can say, look,
I've added value

00:53:23.105 --> 00:53:24.605
so you should give
me an opportunity

00:53:24.605 --> 00:53:28.120
to add even more value.

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.510
And I always like to try
to avoid dependencies

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:33.859
on others if I can.

00:53:33.859 --> 00:53:34.650
That's a big thing.

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.350
When you deal with a large
company as a start-up,

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:38.490
you're moving fast.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:42.590
And what they think is fast
is an eternity for a start-up,

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:45.280
because they just have
cumbersome processes.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:49.950
So if you can figure out how
to avoid dependency on them.

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:53.560
We won't cover the lean start-up
concept in the class here,

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:57.260
but I do recommend the book
for you to think about.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:02.160
How do you test out concepts
with a minimum viable product?

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.840
It's a valuable read.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:09.170
And it applies beyond
the Web 2.0 area.

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:12.560
And then often there's some
things you need in a plan.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.620
But this doesn't go in the
plan, it goes in the appendices.

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:19.770
All of these things
about resumes,

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:25.950
getting a business plan
that has the founder

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:30.750
with 15 pages of publications
and stuff is just overkill.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:32.840
Put it in the appendices.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.484
If you have any of
these other things,

00:54:34.484 --> 00:54:36.525
don't put it in the main
plan, have it available.

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.350
So now we'll talk
about the business plan

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:45.900
as a financing document.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:50.490
And think of this about three
different levels of reading.

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.621
The first reading
is like a resume.

00:54:53.621 --> 00:54:55.620
If you make the cut, you
get the second reading,

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.320
which is to figure out
if this going to justify

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.090
the investment.

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:01.940
And the third reading
is to say, OK,

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.750
is this a plan that
I as an investor

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:07.430
and you as an entrepreneurial
team can commit to.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:09.930
And the point is if you
don't make the first cut,

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:11.560
you don't get the
second two cuts.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:16.710
So the question is what helps
people make the first cut.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.960
And these are some of the
things that occur to people.

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.780
Here's an idea there's just
too good to ignore; god,

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.630
what a brilliant idea.

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:28.120
Or a financial promise
that's too good to turn down,

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.290
if you have that.

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:34.510
A team that's good enough to
believe in-- most investors

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:36.170
will tell you
they'd rather invest

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:41.430
in a top team, an A
team, with a B idea

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:43.502
than an A idea with a B team.

00:55:43.502 --> 00:55:44.960
Because things are
going to change.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.540
You want to make sure you've got
a team that can deliver on it

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.740
when things happen.

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:54.320
An action plan that's
credible and focused.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.610
Details to give assurance
of insight, commitment,

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:58.590
and follow through.

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:01.130
And actually a format and
style that says these guys

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:05.940
are serious about achieving
what they want to do.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.480
Some reasons plans fail
to make that first cut?

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.550
One is just an
insignificant market.

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:15.369
I've seen plans that
say our market is

00:56:15.369 --> 00:56:16.410
going to be $100 million.

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:18.250
And you look at the
financing requirements

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:20.125
and they say we're going
to need $20 million.

00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:26.020
Well, that's just too much
money for that size market.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.752
So that's an example
of either they

00:56:27.752 --> 00:56:29.460
have to redefine the
market or figure out

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.350
how to do it cheaper.

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:35.110
Non-credible technology-- this
is usually not an MIT problem,

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:38.235
although the issue can
be at MIT that you're

00:56:38.235 --> 00:56:40.960
much too early along.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.710
That is, if it's working
on the lab bench,

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:45.293
there's a lot of steps until it
actually gets into the market.

00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:51.630
And then a failure to understand
the market can be an example.

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:59.910
For example, I was reading a
plan that the device clearly

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:02.690
required an FDA approval.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:04.930
I mean, I just couldn't
believe it didn't.

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:07.110
And yet, they never
said anything about it.

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:11.379
And the question was, well,
they should've addressed that.

00:57:11.379 --> 00:57:12.920
And if I have to
pull it out of them,

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:16.570
then it gives you a negative
feeling about the team.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:20.690
And then other reasons.

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:24.320
The plans is too
optimistic or naive.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.770
Or maybe sometimes
not ambitious enough--

00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:30.100
I have a semiconductor
device that I'm

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.510
going to double the
speed in five years.

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:36.550
Well, that's probably not
a big enough improvement.

00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:39.930
So these are all reasons
why things may not

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:43.340
get the second read.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.940
There are cosmetic reasons.

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.180
And I hate to say it,
but it's so aggravating

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.180
to see a team with really good
ideas screw up on the basics

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:56.040
like misspellings, sloppy stuff.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.820
Again, it's like a resume.

00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:00.230
If you can't get the resume
looking professional,

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.250
why would I even want
to talk you or hire you?

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:08.000
So that's see the
overview of things

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.150
tonight for the business plan.

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:13.330
Why write a plan or
have a planning process,

00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:14.694
what should be in the plan.

00:58:14.694 --> 00:58:16.110
Again, at a high
level we're going

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:19.740
to go into each of the sections
over the next six days.

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.740
And then a little bit of
thinking about the plan

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.820
as a financing document.

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.660
And I'd like to leave you at
this point with this triangle

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.410
that we're going to
come back to probably

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:33.340
each night just to drill it in
of what you're trying to do.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:37.150
At the end you're trying to come
to a very clear idea of what

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:39.070
you want to do, what
it takes to do it,

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.020
and have all the
support underneath.

00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:43.264
And it's an iterative process.

00:58:43.264 --> 00:58:45.680
Some people think this is all
linear-- I think about this,

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.820
I test that, it moves on.

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:51.240
It's very much like science
can be-- we try something,

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.710
it fails, we figure out
why it fails, we go back

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.770
and try it again.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.810
But the goal is to find
that sweet spot where you

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:01.550
can actually make a difference.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:05.980
So with that, I'll ask if
there are any questions.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.270
Again, this is a high
level, but if there's

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:10.890
some things that
need clarification,

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:12.150
I'll do the questions now.

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:14.060
Otherwise, we'll take a break.

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:19.110
We usually say take
10 or 15 minutes

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:20.480
and meet the people next to you.

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.690
Because one of the
requirements for the course,

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:25.250
if you're doing
it for credit, is

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:27.740
you've got to put together
a written requirement,

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.380
the executive summary
or a pitch deck.

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:35.197
We want to try to get
teams formed to help you

00:59:35.197 --> 00:59:37.530
if you're somebody with an
idea and you need some people

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:39.800
to help, vice versa.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.410
Given that it's probably a
blizzard out there tonight,

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:46.300
I think we'll defer that initial
meeting until tomorrow night,

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.000
take like a five
minute break or so.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.270
And we'll get
Steve to get stuff,

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:53.480
who's going to tell you
how to make a pitch.

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.870
So at the end of the day,
after everything you've done,

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:57.495
you've got to come
and make that pitch.

00:59:57.495 --> 01:00:00.030
And Steve is going to give
you the precursors of that.

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:06.740
So we'll come back at about
7:15, give you eight minutes.

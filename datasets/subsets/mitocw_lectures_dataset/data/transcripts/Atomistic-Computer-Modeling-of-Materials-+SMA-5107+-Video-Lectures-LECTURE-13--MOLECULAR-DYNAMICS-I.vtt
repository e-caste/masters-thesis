WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
PROFESSOR: So what
we'll do today

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.020
is really switching to the
computational description

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.560
and characterization of
thermodynamic properties.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.320
As we have seen in a lot
of the previous lectures

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.620
that we have been focusing
on finding out good energy

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.170
models, that is being
able to calculate,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.960
what is the energy
of a system given

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.600
the coordinates of its ions?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.400
And now what we want
to understand, really,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.690
is, what is the evolution of
the system in the presence

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.352
of a finite temperature?

00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:33.810
Temperature really
means that there

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.140
is an average kinetic
energy available for all

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.720
the atoms and the
molecules in your system.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.080
That means that there is
really a microscopic dynamics.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.050
And we want to follow that.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.610
One of the most
important things--

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.520
and this goes back to, really,
the first lecture that you have

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.030
seen in this class
for the quantum part--

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.130
is that there is the fundamental
de Broglie relation that

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.450
gives us an estimate of what
is the quantum wavelength

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.040
of any kind of object.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.600
Remember, we have said that the
wavelength times the momentum

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.750
should be equal to
the Planck constant.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.190
And that really means that for
an object like an electron,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.340
the de Broglie wavelength that
comes out from that relation

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.070
is comparable to the
distance between the atoms.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.190
So if the wavelength
of an electron

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.610
is of the order of the angstrom,
10 to the minus 10 meters,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.720
it means that the wavelike
properties of the electrons

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.830
needs to be studied.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.260
And the electron will
behave as a wave.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.360
And that's why we
use the Schrodinger

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.570
equation to describe electrons.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.800
The wavelength of the nuclei
is much, much smaller.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.160
That means that
nuclei really didn't--

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.120
we don't really need
to take into account

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.320
to a good approximation the
quantum nature of the nuclei.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.960
The wavelength is
so small that they

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.070
can be treated
practically, correctly,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.320
as classical particles.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.050
And that's why, actually,
nuclei, in a way,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.680
still follow the rules
of classical dynamics.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.830
That is, they evolve
in time following

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.570
Newton's equation of motion.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.610
Again, this is an
approximation that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.730
involves treating the nuclei
as classical particles

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.040
and not as quantum particles.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.290
But especially at
high temperature,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.610
this is a very
good approximation.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.930
And so a lot of approaches
in computational and material

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.840
science have to do with solving
Newton's equation of motion

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.300
for a system of
interacting nuclei

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.580
and evolving those
nuclei in time

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.590
to study the thermodynamic
properties of the system.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.000
And so that's why I actually
started with a reminder

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.980
of Newton's equation of motion.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.730
That is really an ordinary
second-order differential

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.570
equation.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.020
That is, when you have a
particle of mass m in a force

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.020
field that is this
F of r, well, we

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.200
can calculate its
trajectory-- that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.930
is, its position--
as a function of time

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.080
and its velocity as
a function of time

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.320
by integrating this
differential equation.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.190
And in the classical case
that is always presented,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.380
say, is the evolution of a
particle in a constant force

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.000
field, like a particle under
the gravitational law, that,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.870
to a large extent, is constant
if you don't move very much.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.060
And because, in that case, the
force is really a constant,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.970
the integration of
this becomes trivial.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.890
It's really a second
derivative that

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.180
needs to be equal a constant.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.060
And integrating that
gives us a parabola.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.960
But the reason why
I'm focusing on this

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.480
is to remind you of the initial
conditions in our differential

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.990
equations.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.420
That is, if we have a
second-order differential

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.980
equation, the general solution--
let's say in this case

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.700
for this force field would
be a parabola-- is uniquely

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.160
identified once we specify the
position at a certain instant

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.040
and the velocity at
a certain instant.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.399
That is, among all the possible
parabolas in the world,

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.340
you selected the one
that your projectile

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.730
is going to follow once
you have the position

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.130
and the velocity at
a certain instant.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.420
And that's why actually
dynamics and molecular dynamics

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.360
and other physical properties
basically depend essentially

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.540
on the position of the
particle in your system

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.210
and the velocity of the
particle in your system.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.860
That's why there is no physical
observable that depends, say,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.050
on the fifth derivative
with respect to time.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.480
It's really because the
dynamics of that system

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.500
follows Newton's
equation of motion.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.040
OK, with this, what we really
need to deal in general

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.402
is with a system of
interacting particles.

00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:04.860
And for a moment
you could actually

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.390
think that this i,
interacting particles,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.670
could be the planets
orbiting around the sun.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.770
So each of the planet i will
have its own trajectory.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.990
Our r of t will
have its own mass.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.930
And they all live
in a force field.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.510
That's really where the
many-body complexity, again,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.440
comes out.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.480
So many-body complexity,
that is much easier

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.140
to deal with than the many-body
complexity of the electron

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.730
problem because, again, now
we describe each object just

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.420
with a set of six variables,
so its 3-space coordinate

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.580
and its 3-momentum coordinate.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.720
But still, each and every object
interacts with each other.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.270
When you look at the planets
orbiting around the sun,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.640
you, at first
approximation, could only

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.220
consider the gravitational
attraction to the sun.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.400
But in reality, also the planets
interact with each other.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.480
And so, again, even if
this is much simpler

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.310
than the Schrodinger
equation, as soon

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.130
as you start to have more
than two bodies interacting,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.760
it really becomes too complex
to solve analytically.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.610
And so all the molecular
dynamic techniques

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.250
have, as their only
object, basically,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.170
the integration in time
of this equation of motion

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.020
in an efficient form.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.740
There are a couple of comments
that one wants to make.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.390
In general, we deal with
conservative fields.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.480
That is, the force
depends on position only.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.150
That also means that
the work that you

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.800
make in going from one point
to another point, the integral

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.380
of the force times
the displacement

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.140
is going to be independent
from the trajectory.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.590
So the energy, if
you want, is just

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.660
a function of the position.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.980
The other thing that
descends immediately

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.360
from this equation of motion
is that the total energy

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.830
of the system is conserved.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.810
And that's very easy to prove.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.100
And I'll do it in a moment.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.590
And that's what's often called
a microcanonical evolution.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.270
When you read about
microcanonical ensembles,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.420
it means that you are
actually under the condition

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.560
in which the total energy
of your system is conserved.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.570
And again, what is the
total energy of your system?

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.520
Well, if you have one
particle, it's just, trivially,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.050
the kinetic energy
1/2 mv squared

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.640
plus the potential energy
V of r of that particle,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.460
and just doing everything
in one dimension.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.670
And you ask, why is this
going to be conserved?

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.110
Well, you can just prove it
by taking the time derivative

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.060
of this quantity, OK?

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.630
So we have taken kinetic
energy plus potential energy.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.460
We look at the time derivative.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.700
And this is just simple algebra.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:10.840
What you get is 1/2 m times 2
times v times the derivative

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.960
with respect to time,
that is the acceleration,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.210
plus the derivative of the
potential with respect to time.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:26.440
And this can just be written
as mass times velocity times

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.420
acceleration plus--

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.190
and we can rewrite
the derivative

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.830
of the potential with
time as the derivative

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.679
of the potential with
respect to position

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.892
times the derivative of the
position with respect to time.

00:08:39.892 --> 00:08:41.559
And now you see where
we are getting to,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:48.550
because this term here is
equal to minus the force,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.460
while these terms here
is equal to the velocity.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.030
And so it goes away with here.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.510
And so what we have is
that m, the derivative

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.080
of the total energy
with respect to time,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.190
is equal to the mass times
acceleration minus the force.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.930
That is 0 because
the particle follows

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.650
Newton's equation of motion.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.630
So because of Newton's
equation of motion

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.190
and because the particle
follows exactly that evolution,

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.740
we have that the sum
of the kinetic energy

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.600
plus the potential
energy needs to be

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.540
conserved during the evolution.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.950
And that's actually the
fundamental sanity check

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.620
that you will always
have and you can always

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.350
do during a molecular
dynamics simulation.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.350
That is, you can check
that your integration is

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.250
correct by making sure that
the total energy of your system

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.440
is concerned.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.000
OK, so what do we do in a
practical molecular dynamic

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.810
simulation?

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.960
Well, the idea is that, as
in the motion of the planets,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.710
we want to integrate
the equation of motions

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.880
with this caveat that, again,
each particle interacts

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.200
with each other particle.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.160
And so it's really
a many-body problem,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.200
even if it is a classical
many-body problem.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.980
And so it's really
easier to integrate

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:19.620
than a many-body
Schrodinger equation.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.580
And in general, the
way particles interact

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.170
with each other can be described
by empirical force fields

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.160
or, in the best-case
scenario, can be described

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.650
using quantum mechanics.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.260
That is the [? functional ?]
theory [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.290
And so what you will
have to do in that case

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.790
is that for every configuration
of your ionic system,

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.870
you need to solve an entire
total energy self-consistent

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.470
problem.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.262
And that's why actually
the first principle

00:10:51.262 --> 00:10:55.920
in molecular dynamics becomes a
very, very expensive challenge.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.330
And we'll see in one
of the later classes

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.070
how this is solved.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.810
There are a lot of systems that
can be described accurately,

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.140
even with very simple potential.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.620
Even more than in the
case of the total energy,

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.900
certain thermodynamic
transitions,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.290
like the transition from
a solid to a liquid,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.490
can be thought of as broadly
independent of the details

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.650
of the interacting potentials.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.480
So even studying a system with
a Lennard-Jones potential that,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.080
after all, was developed
especially to do molecular

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.290
dynamic simulations
of rare gas atoms,

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:43.650
or even just studying a system
that is made by hard spheres

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.730
that don't really interact
when they travel in space,

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.990
apart when they really
hit each other--

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.100
so what is called a contact
interaction that is 0 all

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.670
the time apart from the instant
in which the two spheres

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.420
collide--

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.080
can sometimes give you a
very accurate qualitative

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.400
description of the thermodynamic
transition in a problem.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:13.270
And molecular dynamics actually
was first introduced really

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:18.700
to study systems, like liquids,
for which it's very difficult

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.160
to develop analytic techniques.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.900
You see, if you want
to study a solid,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.590
you can actually
choose a potential.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.810
And if the potential
is simple enough,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.950
you can analytically
calculate the potential energy

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.060
of a periodic repetition
of all your atoms.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.050
But if you study
liquid, disorder

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.830
is really an essential part
of the state of the system.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.880
And so the entropic
contribution to the free energy

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.040
of the system is fundamental.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.600
And really there are no
reasonable analytic ways

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.610
to address a lot of the
questions that you have.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.270
And that's why
people really moved

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.750
to solving on the computer
the Newton equation of motion.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.750
And this is a short history,
really, of molecular dynamics,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.260
reminding you what is the
history of computers, really.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.580
In 1952, one of the
first computers, MANIAC,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.990
was operational in Los Alamos.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.130
And that's when Metropolis,
Nicholas Metropolis,

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.657
in collaboration with
actually a husband and wife

00:13:31.657 --> 00:13:33.490
couple, Rosenbluth and
Rosenbluth and Teller

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.540
and Teller, developed what is
called the Monte Carlo method.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.930
That was a very powerful
method to address

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.260
exactly this entropic
free energy problem.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.770
And that you'll see in
one of the later classes.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:54.010
But really, 1956 sees the first
molecular dynamic simulation

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.020
by Alder and Wainwright.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.880
And as I said, in looking at
the dynamics of hard spheres,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.100
these are the milestone papers.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.710
Vineyard is studying
radiation damage

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.180
in copper, what happens when
you have a copper atom that

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.760
is really put in
motion by a very

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.200
energetic radiation kicking it
and starting running around.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.530
And really this is
the classic paper

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.880
of Aneesur Rahman studying,
with a Lennard-Jones potential,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.860
the dynamics of liquid argon.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.710
Again, a Lennard-Jones potential
is actually very accurate

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.460
to describe rare
gases that ultimately

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.680
repel each other at
very close distance

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.710
and, at large distances,
attract each other

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:44.170
with this weak dipole-dipole
interaction that goes as 1

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.820
over r to the 6th.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.660
And then really the first
ab-initio molecular dynamics

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.910
and the first theory for
ab-initio molecular dynamics

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:58.140
was developed in the mid
'80s by Car and Parrinello.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:03.120
OK, now, there is
a universal way

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.400
to think of these dynamics of
your classical system composed

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.910
of N particles.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.570
And as we have said,
since they follow

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.870
Newton's equation of motion,
what we really need to track,

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.060
the only quantities
that we need to track,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.120
is their position as
a function of time

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.850
and their velocity as
a function of time.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.070
And generally speaking,
the kinetic energy

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.500
is just a function
of the velocities.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.500
And the potential energy is just
a function of the positions.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.980
So if you have N
particles, you really

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.390
have to follow in
time six n variables.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:47.280
And if we define for a moment
a six-dimensional space, what

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.420
we really have is that
an instantaneous state

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.170
of your dynamical system, that
is all its position and all

00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:01.440
its velocity, can be represented
by a single point in this 6N

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.010
dimension of space.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.190
So if you have got just
a hydrogen molecule

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.740
with two nuclei,
what you really need

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.265
is a point in six dimensions.

00:16:10.265 --> 00:16:11.640
If you have a
water molecule, you

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.920
need a point in nine dimensions.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.140
And the evolution-- sorry.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.500
If you have a
water molecule, you

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.290
need a point in 18 dimensions.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.110
And if you have a
hydrogen molecule,

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.300
you need a point
in 12 dimensions.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.760
And the dynamical
evolution of your system

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.860
is described exactly by the
evolution of this point.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:41.720
So we often think at this
phase space that we'll have,

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.760
for an N particle, 6N
dimension, of which--

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.530
let's try to draw
a bit dimension--

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.680
3N of them, those
represented in green,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.620
will really represent
the positions.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.470
And the other 3N will
represent velocities.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.180
OK.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.060
And obviously this is
all orthogonal dimension.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.589
And your point
will be somewhere.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.970
The certain instant in time T
will have a set of velocities,

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.470
will have a set of positions.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.599
And the Newton
equation of motion

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:22.260
will make it evolve
in this phase space.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.910
So really your molecular
dynamic integration

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:32.180
consists in following
in time this evolution.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.940
And that evolution
is, in principle,

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.180
analytically and
uniquely defined

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.650
once you know the position
and the velocities

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.020
at every instant.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.430
And-- well, we'll
see that later.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.900
OK, so what do we
do once we have

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.740
a computational algorithm
that allows us to evolve

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.320
this point in phase space?

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.150
And I sort of summarized
here the three main goals

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:09.230
that could follow from a
molecular dynamic simulation

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.430
in the order that
we'll see them.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.070
Really, one of the
most common ones

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.670
is to use molecular
dynamic simulations

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.180
to calculate thermodynamic
properties, that

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:28.070
is to calculate what we
call ensemble averages.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.430
Suppose that you have
a system like a solid.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.130
And you have calculated,
say, its lattice parameter,

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.860
like you're doing
in lab 2 or lab 3.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.790
And suppose that you start
heating up this solid.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.930
What happens?

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.900
Well, the atoms, in
the classical sense,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.720
start oscillating more and more.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.410
And you know from
experience that most solids

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.290
start expanding when
you warm them up.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.530
So a molecular
dynamic simulation

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:03.640
could tell you how much a solid
expands when you heat it up

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.230
because basically you start
evolving your system from 0

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.160
temperature.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.410
And then you increase
its temperature.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.070
And really,
temperature, remember,

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.580
is just the average
kinetic energy of the ions.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.500
And as you increase
the temperature,

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.600
the ions oscillate
more and more.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.530
And if you let your unit
cell expand or contract

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.580
in time following what
is the stress overall

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.370
of all the atoms
in your unit cell,

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.850
you see that your
system increases

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.110
the dimension of the unit cell
and starts oscillating around

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.240
a value that's
really an average,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.480
depending on temperature.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.500
And all these sort of statements
can be actually made formally

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.590
in a way that we'll
see in a moment that is

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.480
the language of thermodynamics.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.220
That is, if we have
a finite temperature,

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.660
we'll have a certain
probability associated

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.300
with every microscopic
configuration.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.810
OK, so if you are
at 0 temperature,

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.450
really what you have is
that you have a probability

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.240
1 to be in the lowest energy
state possible and probability

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.190
0 of being in any
other energy state.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.630
If you start increasing
your temperature,

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.980
states that are energetically
similar to the ground

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.040
state but not really
the ground state

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.020
start to have a certain
probability of being occupied.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.580
And the more
temperature you have,

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.190
the more very costly
configurations

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.830
can be accessed by your system.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.990
And really, the
average properties

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.360
at a finite
temperature need to be

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.410
an average over all these
possible states weighed

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:59.160
with their appropriate
thermodynamic weight, weighed

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.740
with the probability
of being in that state.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.880
And so this is what an
ensemble average does really.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.440
It tries to span all the
possible states in a system

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.110
with a probability
that is proportional to

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.030
their thermodynamical weight.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.770
And then for each state, you can
calculate a certain property,

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:28.000
like what is its average
potential energy, what

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.710
is its lattice
parameter, and so on.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.290
And out of that,
you can calculate

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.150
the average
thermodynamic property.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.040
And we'll see, actually,
an example in a moment.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:45.290
So we'll see a practical
application of this.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.520
The other thing that you can
do with molecular dynamic

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.240
simulator is actually
study the evolution

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.710
in real time of your system.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.790
So you could actually
study a chemical reaction.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:03.460
What happens if you have, say,
an explosive molecule that

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.530
is decomposing, OK?

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:09.130
And in particular, whenever you
have a chemical reaction that

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.520
tends to be a bond-breaking
and bond-forming reaction,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.790
you'll probably need to use a
quantum mechanical approach.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.400
But in principle, you
can set up your system

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.130
in an initial
configuration and see what

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.300
happens as you evolve in time.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.270
You could look at a
catalytic reaction.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.690
Say, maybe you are interested
in studying fuel cells.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.740
And you want to see how a
hydrogen molecule decomposes

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.930
when it arrives on
a platinum surface.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.300
Well, you can take
your hydrogen molecule

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.530
and project it delicately
towards the platinum surface.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.710
And follow, with your
molecular dynamic techniques,

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:49.390
the dynamics of all these nuclei
as the molecule chemisorbs

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.240
and dissociates in time.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.190
And then really the
last application

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:05.630
of molecular dynamics is more
of an optimization algorithm.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:10.810
There are problems in
which it's very complex

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:15.850
to find what is the lowest
possible solution, what

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.710
is the optimal solution.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.590
That is, you could
try to find out

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:29.050
what is the schedule of all your
flights in an airplane company.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.900
And obviously that's a
complex optimization problem

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.470
because you can't move
one plane at a time

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.220
and figure out what is the best
possible solution because there

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.460
might be a completely
different choice of planes

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.420
and itineraries that
actually gives you a best

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.560
performance overall on the net.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.170
And so you can always take
one optimization problem

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.320
and express a cost function.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.860
That is depending on
what is your interest.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.310
Minimize the amount of
oil, let's say, used

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.500
in running all these routes.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.800
So when you have a cost function
of a very complex problem,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:14.320
you have really an object
that depends on many variables

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.370
and that has a lot
of possible minima.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.650
OK, so this would be,
really, the problem

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:27.320
of optimizing the air
routes of an airline.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.650
What you have is a lot
of possible variables.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.830
And there are a lot of
reasonable solutions.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.930
But you really want to find the
one that is the best for you,

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.090
something like this.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.030
And molecular
dynamics can actually

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.730
help to solve this
problem because it's

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.930
a problem that is absolutely
analogous of having

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.690
a system of interacting
particles that

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.810
has a certain potential
energy surface

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.320
and trying to explore that
potential energy surface,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.970
moving around, until you
find the lowest minimum.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.000
You could think of this
as a mountain range.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.090
And you have your
skiers that are really

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.130
your particles moving around.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.520
And you want to sort
of let the skiers ski

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.470
around as much as possible until
they find the minimum energy

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.440
state.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.610
And so you can use a
thermodynamic analogy.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.950
You heat up your system.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.430
That really means
that every particle

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.810
has a lot of kinetic energy.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.920
So having a lot
of kinetic energy

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.550
can easily overcome any
kind of potential barrier.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.550
And you have a lot of these
particles moving around.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.980
And then you cool
them down slowly.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.070
And as you cool
them down, they'll

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:55.220
start piling up in the
lowest possible energy state.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.720
And once you have reached,
very slowly, 0 temperature,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.090
you look at where all your
particles have ended up.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:07.100
And so you have at
least a good sampling

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.770
of the relevant minima in
your potential energy surface.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.850
So actually molecular dynamics--
and this is called simulated

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.440
annealing, in this context--

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.869
can actually be used as
an optimization technique.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.860
And we don't have to go as
far as the case of an airline

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.800
or what is called the
traveling salesman problem.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.470
But often what we
have is that we

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.660
have a system that is fairly
complicated to characterize.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.410
Say we want to describe
maybe an interface

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:53.770
between a perfect silicon
crystal and the SiO2 substrate

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.350
because we are in the
electronic industry.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.570
Well, I mean, we have a
problem because how do we

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.740
construct the interface
between a crystalline solid

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.420
and an amorphous system?

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.230
I mean, we can try putting
atoms in a reasonable position.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.150
But it's never going
to work very well.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.030
And so what we
can do is actually

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:17.200
use molecular dynamic techniques
to let the atoms evolve

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.630
according to their
interaction and to the Newton

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:23.335
equation of motion and
somehow find, by themselves,

00:27:23.335 --> 00:27:27.430
a slightly more favorable
green minima instead

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:32.350
of the initial configuration
in which we have put them.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:38.320
OK, so, in principle, if you
had infinite computing power

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.230
or infinite
mathematical prowess,

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.380
you would have really
solved the problem

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:50.920
of characterizing on a computer
any material that you wanted.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.200
The reason why you
can't really do

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.730
that in general and
indiscriminately

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:03.460
has to do with four problems
that arise in the approach

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.660
that I've mentioned.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:11.110
And I've mentioned them here, I
guess, in order of importance.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:15.430
And the first and
most dramatic problem

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.290
is the one of time scales.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:24.320
That is, atoms move around and
vibrate at time scales that

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.960
are characteristic of atoms.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.740
That is, say, in a
molecule, it will

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.480
take tens of femtoseconds
or hundreds of femtoseconds

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.430
to have a periodic oscillation.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:41.060
So these are femtoseconds.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.880
10 to the minus 15
seconds is the order

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:51.090
of magnitude of the dynamics of
the atoms at room temperature.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.380
Now, a lot of
interesting problems

00:28:54.380 --> 00:29:00.410
take place in times of
seconds, minutes, or hours.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:06.110
A classical problem is
how a protein folds itself

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.670
in its native state.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.150
And you know, this is a
process that can take seconds.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.190
And so we have,
really, the issue

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:18.890
that all our calculation takes
place on the timescales of 10

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.930
to the minus 15.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.410
And often we need to reach
physical properties that

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.780
are of the order of seconds.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.650
So we need to span a
15 order of magnitude.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:36.890
And that means that if it
takes a time x to perform

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.540
one single molecular
dynamic operation,

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.535
we have a 10 to the 15 cost
to get to the reasonable time

00:29:43.535 --> 00:29:46.160
scale for a lot of
macroscopic processes.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.070
And that's really a scale
that we can't bridge.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:54.980
If we do quantum mechanical
simulations for a small system,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.130
we can easily reach
the times of tens

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.610
of picoseconds or
hundreds of picoseconds.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:05.330
If we do classical molecular
dynamic simulation,

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.380
we can go maybe three, four,
five orders of magnitude

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.430
better.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.630
And so we can start
accessing nanoseconds

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:21.870
and maybe start getting closer
towards the microsecond.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.960
But there is still an
enormous gap to reach.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.780
And this is really
a difficult problem

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.460
to overcome because we
have dynamics taking place

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.410
at different levels.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.770
Say, think of a protein.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:40.740
We have the atomic dynamics
of an atom vibrating around.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:46.050
And then we have dynamics of
subunits maybe interacting

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.290
with the different amino
acids along the chain.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:53.220
And then we have structural
motifs that want to move around

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.900
and then maybe the first coil-up
in a certain configuration.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.700
But that's not really very good.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.220
And then after a while
they sort of open up

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.680
and recoil in a
different configuration.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.810
And so the more you look at your
system on a larger and larger

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.030
length scale, the
more you discover

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:16.680
that there are dynamics of
more and more complex groups

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.050
that are slower and slower.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:24.210
And integrating from the atomic
motion up to the mesoscale

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.610
and the macroscopic
scale of these dynamics

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:31.030
is really an impossible
problem to do by brute force.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:35.790
And I would say that it's
still the conceptual problem

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.420
for which less
progress has been made.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.030
It's really the
most difficult one.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.000
And you'll hear a
lot of talks nowadays

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.150
in science about
multiscale modeling

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.850
and about bridging timescales.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.780
And it's obviously a
very important challenge.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.060
But I still think we are
at the stage in which there

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.310
are very little solutions.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:03.270
Somehow related to the
time-scale problem,

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:06.525
there is the length
scale problem.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:13.890
Suppose you want to study
a system close to a phase

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:14.490
transition.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.760
Suppose that you want
to see a gas evaporate.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.350
You want to study a
liquid-to-vapor transition.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.560
What happens exactly
at the temperature

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.100
where the liquid and the
vapor are in equilibrium?

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.490
Suppose that you are
studying water boiling.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:39.120
At normal condition,
it boils at 373 Kelvin.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.320
And at that temperature, why
there is a phase transition?

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.660
Basically because
the free energy

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.580
of the liquid and the free
energy of the gas are the same.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.250
You go a little bit
above the temperature,

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.540
the free energy of
the gas is lower.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.020
So the system wants
to be all gas.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.570
You go a little bit below
the boiling temperature,

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.530
the free energy of
the liquid is lower.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.800
So the system wants
to be a liquid.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.190
But as you get closer and
closer to the temperature,

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.670
these two free energies
becomes comparable.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:15.930
That means that the cost
of transforming from liquid

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.080
to the gas and
from gas to liquid

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.630
becomes smaller and smaller.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.650
And it is 0 at the
transition temperature.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:30.900
That means, in practice, that
since it doesn't cost anything

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.620
to transform from one
state to the other,

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.560
you have lost all
possible length

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:45.330
scale because you can nucleate
a bubble of gas of any size

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.440
with 0 cost.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.320
So if you think of
the transformation

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:54.840
from a liquid to a vapor as
the nucleation of bubble of gas

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.680
exactly at the temperature
of the transition,

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.330
that cost has become 0.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.790
And we can nucleate
bubbles of any size.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.060
So the phase
transition is a moment

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.159
where we lose length scales.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:11.100
The fluctuation
can have any size.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.639
And so any kind of
finite simulation

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.159
will break down
because it's really

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:21.690
only in the infinite system that
we represent appropriately all

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.760
these sizes popping
up in our system.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.060
And so that's why
it becomes very

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.199
difficult to study
accurately, say, a boundary

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:31.260
at a phase transition.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.770
We say that the length
scale starts diverging.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.380
And that's why one
needs to be careful.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:42.750
This problem is not as serious
as the problem of time scales.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:48.929
But it's still one that you
want to consider very carefully

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:52.440
and one you need to spend
some time thinking, actually.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.310
That is, often we use a
periodic boundary condition

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.720
to describe an extended system.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.810
And so the question
that you always

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:05.850
have to ask yourself is, how
large should I make my unit

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.870
system that is periodically
repeated before it's really

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.920
describing accurately
the infinite system that

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.630
is the goal of my simulation?

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.660
Suppose that you want
to study water, OK?

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.990
Or suppose that you want
to study any liquid.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.170
In principle you want
an infinite system.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.990
In principle you can deal
only with a finite number

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.530
of degrees of freedom.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.950
So the two possibilities
that you have,

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.850
you could study a
droplet of water, OK?

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.910
But then obviously you
encounter the problem

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.100
that, when you
study a droplet, you

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.300
have a very large influence
coming from the surface effect.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.360
A droplet is a droplet because
of the surface tension.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.290
And before reaching
the thermodynamic limit

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.950
of that droplet behaving
as a bulk liquid,

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.130
you need really to
go to enormous sizes.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:03.240
If instead you study, say,
the same number of molecules

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.700
in periodic boundary
conditions, you

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.170
eliminate the presence
of the surface.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:11.340
And so you can reach
the thermodynamic limit

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.870
of the system behaving
as a bulk much faster.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:18.510
But still you need to
always ask your question,

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:22.110
is your simulation
still large enough?

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.890
And there is a size
that is large enough.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.130
And that's the other
very important concept.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:35.250
That is, whenever your
simulation cell is so large

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:39.900
that the dynamics of
one water molecule

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:45.080
doesn't affect the dynamics
of a water molecule

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.570
that is far away from
yours as much as it

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.940
is its periodic image, your
system has become infinite.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.870
That is, whenever you have
a molecule in a liquid,

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:01.640
you really dynamically interact
not with every other molecule

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:08.180
in the infinite liquid but only
with a sphere of neighbors.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.650
And you need to
understand how large

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:15.290
is that sphere of neighbors
because those and only those

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.410
are the molecules
that affect yourself

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:20.390
in the center of that sphere.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:25.490
And if you decide that for
a water molecule at room

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:29.210
temperature the sphere of
neighbors with which there

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:32.720
is a dynamic interaction
has only a radius of 10

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.370
angstroms, whenever your unit
cell is larger, is a cube,

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.160
say, larger than 20
angstroms inside,

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.670
you are studying, in
practice, an infinite system

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.850
because every molecule
in that system

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:51.940
sees all the independent
neighbors that it needs to see,

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:52.610
OK?

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.750
So even a simulation with a
finite number of molecules

00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:01.490
can reproduce exactly the
behavior of an infinite system

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:06.560
provided a molecule interacts
with other independent

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:12.590
molecules up to a maximum
range of dynamical correlation.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.170
And we'll actually
define this quantity

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.850
in the lecture that follows.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:21.050
So again, length scales
are another problem

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:24.110
and a problem in which periodic
boundary conditions tend

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.500
to help a lot.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.370
But again, suppose that
you want to study something

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:32.300
like the strength of a metal.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:37.850
Well, you have now a problem
in which a lot of length scales

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:43.070
becomes intertwined because
in the strength of a metal,

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:48.440
you might want to consider what
is the dynamics of impurities

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.660
that strengthen that metal.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.330
Like, if you have steel,
you have carbon atoms

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.800
in between the ions.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.820
And so you need to understand
what is the atomic dynamics.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:03.650
But then there will be dynamics
of units on a larger length

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:07.190
scale because in a metal there's
going to be these location

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.080
and slip and glide planes.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:14.570
And so there is coordinated
motion of thousands of atoms

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.500
that you want to consider.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.630
And then, in reality, a real
metal is never a crystal.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.130
But it's always a
polycrystalline material.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.770
So you have grains.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:28.220
And inside that grain you
have a consistent ordering

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.150
of the atoms.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.370
But then grains are mismatched.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:33.240
And there are grain boundaries.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.510
And so you have a
lot of length scales

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.420
to consider if you
really want to predict

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:44.020
what would be the mechanical
response of a real system.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.680
OK, so this is the challenge,
if you want, number 2.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.170
The challenge
number 3 is the one

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.850
that we have described
more in detail up to now

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:58.660
that is determining
how accurate can

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.930
be your prediction of the
interaction between nuclei.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:04.510
And you have seen everything
that we could tell you

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.440
about empirical potential
quantum mechanical simulations.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.850
And in principle, even if
it's obviously very expensive

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.520
to make very accurate
predictions of the interaction

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.600
between atoms, in principle
it's the less conceptually

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.230
challenging of the problems.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:25.990
I mean, we can just try all our
electronic structure methods

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.680
at will.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.920
And we can try to see
how accurate we become.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.510
And the last challenge
that is also not

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:39.550
really a conceptual challenge
and it can be solved

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:43.480
but is just a very
expensive one to overcome

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.940
is this one in which
we treat the nuclei

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.650
as classical particles.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.950
And that tends to be,
in general, very good.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.470
But it's sort of an
approximation that

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.920
breaks down the more
you go towards lighter

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.020
and lighter nuclei
because, remember,

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.490
the de Broglie relation.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.730
Your wavelength
times your momentum

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.890
is equal to the Planck constant.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.350
So the lighter you
are, the smaller

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:14.800
your momentum, the longer your
wavelength, the more quantum

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.970
you become.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:20.080
So something like hydrogen that
has a nucleus that is just one

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.470
proton, so it's fairly light--
or it's the lightest of all

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.850
possible nuclei--

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:30.040
tend to still have
significant quantum properties

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.290
even at relatively
high temperatures.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.670
You see, the more you
increase the temperature,

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.870
the more the average momentum
of your particles become

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.390
and the more
classical they become.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.870
But the lower the temperature,
the more quantum they become.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:47.170
And something like hydrogen
is still significantly

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.000
quantum at room temperature.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.480
And what does that mean?

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.140
Well, it means
that that particle,

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.380
it's really a delocalized
system that can actually

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.000
tunnel through barriers.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.460
That's if you want one of
the important differences

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.710
between a particle
that behaves according

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.680
to classical mechanics and
one that behaves according

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.150
to quantum mechanics.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.580
If you are behaving as
a classical particle,

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:13.150
you need to have enough kinetic
energy to overcome a barrier.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.520
If you are a skier and
you are in a valley

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.490
and you want to go
in the other valley,

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:20.200
you need to have
enough velocity to be

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.460
able to overcome the mountain.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.880
If you are a quantum
skier, you can actually

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.090
have some finite probability
of tunneling through.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:34.600
And so there are tunneling
problems that are important

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.450
not only for hydrogen
but sometimes

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:40.930
even for much more
massive particles

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.530
or even for groups of
particles, provided

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.410
that the energy barrier
that they need to overcome

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.390
is small enough.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:53.410
And I've shown you in the
first quantum class an example

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:57.370
in a perovskite crystal in which
we have this cubic structure

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.860
with an octahedral
cage of oxygen

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:04.390
that can configure itself
in a ground state that

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:08.230
is ferroelectric, in which
the oxygen cage displaces

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:10.420
with respect to
the cubic symmetry

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.750
and induces a permanent
electrical dipole

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:14.805
in your system.

00:43:14.805 --> 00:43:16.180
Well, there are
certain materials

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.680
that have this structure.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.100
But since the
octahedral cage can

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.790
have roughly six
possible choices on where

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:31.030
to move offsite, if you
decrease the temperature enough,

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.190
the oxygen cage
will start actually

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:36.910
tunneling between all
the six possibilities.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:40.420
Instead of finding
itself at 0 temperature

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.300
in a broken symmetry
configuration in which

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:48.010
the oxygen cage has chosen one
of those six possibilities,

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.470
in reality, because
of quantum tunneling,

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.620
it keeps tunneling between
all the six possibilities.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.500
And on average your
system looks cubic.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.580
And on average you don't have
really any ferroelectricity.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.220
But the polarizability
of the system

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.430
is going to be different
from that one in which

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:10.420
the octahedral cage was
sitting squarely in the cube.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:15.480
So there is a dielectric
response that is different.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:21.860
So there are cases that are
fairly exotic, I would say,

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.150
for most applications, in which
tunneling effects of the nuclei

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.000
could become important.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.380
But there is one other
important consequence

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.750
that comes from
quantum mechanics that

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:39.260
tends to be important
in a lot of cases.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.950
And that consequence has
to do with the quantization

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:45.590
of vibrational excitations.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.890
That is, if you look at
the motion of any system--

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.660
a molecule, a solid--

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.770
in classical terms, well,
that molecule or that solid

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:58.280
can have any amount
of kinetic energy.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.740
In a hydrogen
molecule, the atoms

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.160
can have 0 kinetic energy
if we treat it classically.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.200
Or they can move
just a little bit.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.960
So they have a very minute
amount of kinetic energy.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.600
And we can just increase
the kinetic energy

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.800
that those atoms
can have at will.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.380
In reality, because the
system is a quantum system,

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:24.190
the vibrational
modes of a molecule

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:29.320
or the vibrational modes of a
solid are actually quantized.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:34.780
And you can't have arbitrary
amounts of vibrational energy.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.470
Actually, in its
quantum ground state,

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:42.340
a molecule will not be at rest.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:46.280
But it will be in what is called
the zero-point motion state.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.200
That is what is the quantum
mechanical ground state.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.280
You can think of the
analogy with the stability

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.470
of the atoms.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:01.450
In its ground state, the
electron around the proton

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.960
is not collapsing onto
the proton because

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.060
of the Coulombic repulsion.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.490
If the electron was
a classical particle,

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.380
it would collapse
on the nucleus.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.220
And the hydrogen atom would be
just a proton and an electron

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.000
sitting in the same place.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.330
But because the
electron is quantum,

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.340
it can't really collapse.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.580
And its lowest energy
state is a state

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:29.290
that is the 1s orbit for the
hydrogen in which the electron

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:32.740
is around the atom but
doesn't collapse onto it.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:37.690
And the excitation of that
electron to the next energy

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:40.750
state is a quantized excitation.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.140
You can't go to a
level of 1s that

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.020
has an energy for the
hydrogen of minus 1

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:51.700
Rydberg to another state
that has energy minus 0.99

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.220
or minus by 0.98 or
any kind of amount.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.240
The next state in which
the electron can live

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:03.820
is a state that has an energy
of minus 1/4 and then minus 1/9

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.890
and so on and so forth.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:10.440
The same thing happens for the
vibrational level of molecules,

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.170
OK?

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:15.940
A quantum molecule
in its ground state

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.840
is not in a state where
the atoms do not move.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.410
But it's in a state where the
atoms have a certain amount

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.300
of quantum kinetic energy.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.400
And it's in a state
called zero-point motion.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.150
And if you want to
increase the kinetic energy

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.390
of this molecule, you
can't do it continuously.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:35.980
There is a quantized cap.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.100
So you need to
provide enough energy

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.550
to heat up the system
to the next state

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:45.640
and then to the next state
and then to the next state.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.740
And that, if you think,
affects deeply how you

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.150
are going to heat up a system.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:56.920
That is, if you look at the
specific heat of a solid,

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.440
that is basically the
quantity that tells you

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.850
how much heat the system is
going to be able to take,

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:07.720
and you look at what happens
at very low temperature,

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:13.150
you discover that actually the
system is almost unable to take

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:17.830
any heat because all the
vibrational excitation are

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:21.610
much larger than the average
amount of kinetic energy

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.490
that you have if you
are looking at what

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:28.600
it takes to bring something
from 1 Kelvin to 2 Kelvin.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:33.640
OK, but this is still
relevant if you have a system

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.210
like water, even at 300 Kelvin.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:41.050
In water, say, at 300
Kelvin, what you have is

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.490
you have these water molecules.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:46.030
Remember what you have-- your
oxygen, hydrogen, and hydrogen.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:50.020
And the modes of vibration
of these molecules

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.800
are stretching modes
of the hydrogens.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.830
And then there are
scissor-like models

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.110
in which the two bonds do this.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:04.300
And then these are
intermolecular modes, just sort

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.860
of relevant to one molecule.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.880
And then there are all
the molecules interacting.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.020
Well, at room temperature,
all the internal modes

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.910
of the molecule, the stretching
and the scissor modes,

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:24.610
have so much vibrational
energy in their ground state

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:28.660
that it's almost
impossible to excite them

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.320
to the next vibrational state
with the average temperature

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.960
that you have at 300 Kelvin.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.530
So even a system as
fundamental as water

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:43.390
has really a hybrid
behavior in which

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:48.190
the vibrational interaction
between molecules

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:51.400
can actually be
populated arbitrarily

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.770
by the temperature that
is surrounding you.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.300
But it's almost impossible
to excite a molecule

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:04.060
from a zero-point stretching
motion to the next one.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.060
And so, say, the
specific heat of water

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:11.320
will be slightly exotic because
really part of its vibration

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.640
are quantized.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.070
And so there are
a number of cases

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:22.510
in which this classical nuclear
approximation is not exact.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:27.610
And luckily they can be studied
with specific techniques

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:31.030
that we'll see in some of
the later-application classes

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:32.300
during this course.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.750
But remember this-- if there
is one thing that you want

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:37.660
to remember about the
behavior of nuclei--

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.380
that this vibrational
excitation are quantized.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.200
And we actually see
this quantization

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:50.130
in physical properties
like the specific heat.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:57.900
OK, so let's discuss the first
of the possible applications

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.440
of molecular dynamics
that I have mentioned.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.650
And that's using
molecular dynamics

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:08.580
to really calculate average
properties of a system

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.590
at finite temperatures.

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:15.330
And what I have written
here is really the summary

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:17.320
of statistical mechanics.

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.910
So that is what, if you want,
Boltzmann would tell you.

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.580
You have a dynamical
system that is

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:28.680
described by this point moving
around in phase space, OK?

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.920
So with a certain
possible set of positions

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.130
and with a certain
possible set of momenta.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:38.100
And suppose that we
want to calculate, say,

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:42.030
what is an average property
at a certain temperature.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:45.060
And we call that property
A. It could be the lattice

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.700
parameter of the system.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.640
Or it could be the diameter,
say-- it's even simpler--

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.740
of your water bubble.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.540
OK, you have this water bubble.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:57.660
And you want to see what is the
diameter of this water bubble

00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.580
at a certain temperature.

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.950
And this diameter is going
to increase with temperature.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:06.840
And what you do, you just
let this system evolve.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.000
And during its
evolution, you keep

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.130
measuring what is its diameter.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.530
And you let this evolve a lot.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:16.320
And you measure
what is its width.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.910
Well, the way Boltzmann would
set this problem is say,

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:26.850
we really need to integrate
over all possible configurations

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:27.840
of the system.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.620
That is, we need to go through
all possible configurations

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.490
of the system.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:38.130
That is, we need to integrate
over the full phase space.

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:41.970
And for every possible
point in phase space,

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:47.190
we need to calculate the
diameter of my water bubble.

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:51.180
And then we need to
take into account

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:55.450
what is the probability of
being in that configuration.

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:59.610
And if you are in a system
at a constant temperature,

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:04.470
the probability of finding
yourself at a given temperature

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:08.550
is given by exponential
of minus beta is just 1

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.410
over the Boltzmann
constant times

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.570
the temperature
times the energy.

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:15.470
That means that
configurations that

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:19.200
have a high internal
energy are very unlikely.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.050
And configurations
that have lower energy

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:25.410
are more likely, to the point
that if the temperature is

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:29.190
0, that is this beta is
diverging to infinity,

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:33.000
only the lowest energy
configuration possible is

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.380
represented.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.840
So this is the statistical
mechanic points.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:40.320
To calculate an average quantity
at a finite temperature,

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.030
we need to sum over all
possible configurations

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:46.920
in space and momentum.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.830
For each possible r
and p configuration,

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:53.490
we'll have a certain value of
the diameter of that bubble.

00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:56.970
We weigh that with
the statistical weight

00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:58.560
of that configuration.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:03.310
And we actually normalize
this expectation value.

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:06.150
And this is what we obtain.

00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:09.420
So if, for a moment, you
think at a phase space that

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:14.220
is two dimensional
and in this square

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.070
we represent all the possible
positions and velocities

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.470
of our system, what
Boltzmann tells

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.560
us is that for every
possible point,

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.110
we will have a
certain value of A.

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:27.960
And the sum of all
the possible values

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.700
of A weighted with the
probability of finding them

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.680
gives us the expectation value.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.630
And so what you
really need to do

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:41.580
is an integral over
all space of this.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:47.040
And the cost of these
integrals diverges

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.650
as the number of
dimensions diverge

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:55.800
because, again, every time we
increase the size of the system

00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.930
by one particle, we have six
more dimensions over which

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.040
to integrate.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.740
And again, if you
think that we do

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.020
this just by
numerical integrations

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.570
by taking points
on a grid and maybe

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:13.560
we just discretize our system
with 10 points along one

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.810
dimension, every time
you add a particle,

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:19.860
you have 10 to the 6 points
that multiply your system.

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.020
So this quantity explodes.

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.830
The point of view of molecular
dynamics is different.

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:31.980
What we say is that, well, let's
just let this system evolve.

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.440
Let this system evolve in time.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.830
And let it evolve at a
constant temperature.

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:42.330
And so now our
point in phase space

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:47.950
is going to go around,
following a trajectory.

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:52.450
And if we let it go
around long enough,

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:56.850
it will spend more time in
the parts of phase space that

00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:00.270
are more favorite, the
ones that are more likely,

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.490
according to the
Boltzmann factor.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:07.050
And so if our evolution,
really, is distributed

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:13.590
in the trajectory according
to this thermodynamic weight,

00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:17.850
thermodynamic factor, then
our expectation value,

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:21.390
the thermodynamic average
for our observable A,

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:25.560
is just trivial,
obtained by integrating

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.900
over the trajectories
all the values

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.890
of A. That is what
I was saying before.

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:33.360
If you want to calculate the
diameter of your bubble, what

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.880
you do in the molecular
dynamic sense,

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:39.180
you just let the
bubble evolve according

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.400
to the equation of motion
at a constant temperature.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.850
And you keep monitoring
its diameter.

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:47.850
And you will see that the
diameter will have an average

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:53.670
and that this is a much more
efficient way then considering

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:56.460
all possible configurations
of the bubble,

00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.600
weighing them with how
expensive that configuration is,

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:04.050
and doing it for all the
possible configurations.

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:07.380
The molecular dynamic algorithm
automatically, if you want,

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:11.340
keeps spanning the most
likely configurations.

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:16.260
And so it does, for you, the
job of going in the place where

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.900
it's most likely to be.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.930
So in order to calculate
a sample average,

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:24.880
we can actually
transform a problem

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.850
into integration
over a trajectory.

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:32.300
And that is almost always
doable under what is called

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.050
the criterion of ergodicity.

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.825
So the equivalence between
the two formulations

00:57:37.825 --> 00:57:39.700
that I'd written before--
that is calculating

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:43.960
a thermodynamic observable
as an integral in phase space

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:47.620
or as an integral over
trajectories-- are equivalent,

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:52.240
provided your trajectory
is really able

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:56.450
to go all over the
place in phase space.

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:58.840
So if, again, this
were phase space,

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.390
you could have, in
principle, the problem

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.420
of a known ergodic
system if there

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:08.770
is something that
prevents your trajectory

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:13.990
to reach certain so-called
forbidden segments

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.450
in your phase space.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.710
And I can give you an example.

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:23.590
Suppose that you are studying
something like silicon

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.940
and you are in the
crystalline state.

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.510
And now you heat it up.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:32.290
And once you go above
the melting temperature,

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:35.800
your silicon will
become liquid, OK?

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.780
Now, suppose that you cool
it down again below, now,

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.130
the melting temperature.

00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:45.880
OK, in principle,
the liquid silicon

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.850
should become again
crystalline silicon

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:52.600
because, at that temperature in
which we have brought it back

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:56.680
to, the thermodynamic
stable state is really

00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.360
the crystalline solid.

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.270
If you do that in practice
with our molecular dynamic

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:04.420
simulation, you see that
you start from the crystal.

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.930
You heat it up.

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:08.980
It becomes a liquid
with no problems.

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:11.590
And then you cool it back down.

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:14.020
And instead of going
back to a crystal,

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:18.160
it goes back to a
glassy, amorphous state.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:22.390
Silicon will find itself
in a configuration

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:25.600
in which locally all
atoms are happy to be

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.520
fourfold coordinated.

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:32.290
But if we look at the long-range
order, it's completely lost.

00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:34.310
The system is not
crystalline anymore.

00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:36.070
It's glassy.

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:37.340
What's happening there?

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.410
Well, it happens that it's
just, for a liquid cooling

00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:46.930
down, so much easier
to trap itself

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:52.720
into a set of configurations in
which atoms are really fairly

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.510
happy as they are,
because what is important

00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:59.470
for silicon atoms is to
be fourfold coordinated.

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:03.280
But what is important
to be in a crystal

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.030
is that this fourfold
coordination extends

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:09.760
and becomes a long-range order.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.820
But for silicon, it's very
inexpensive to mess up

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.390
that long-range order, like
for many other systems.

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:20.140
And in principle, same
thing happens for polymers.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.340
You lower it down.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.520
And they sort of get trapped
in a glassy configuration.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.280
A lot of polymers might
want to stay actually

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.020
in a crystalline state.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.060
But really that is
impossible to reach.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.670
And so if you want
to study, say,

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.830
what are the properties
of your silicon

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:40.360
and you have obtained or you are
trying to obtain your silicon

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.830
structure from a liquid that you
cooled down, you'll actually--

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:46.810
in your molecular
dynamics, you'll

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:52.690
keep orbiting around in
this glassy mass state

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:56.380
and will never reach that
region of phase space

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.680
that is actually very,
very small because it

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.340
needs to have all atoms
long range in very

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.840
specific positions.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:10.090
And so you are really spanning
a system in a nonergodic way.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:13.960
That is, you spend a lot of
time in a region of phase space

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.950
that are not really
representative but out of which

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:19.810
is very difficult to escape.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:23.440
OK, so there are
problems in, again,

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.070
brute force molecular
dynamic approaches that you

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:30.340
have to be careful about.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:35.630
OK, so let's see
how we actually go

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:39.590
and try to do this on
our computer experiment.

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:42.350
And I'll start with
the simplest case

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:46.010
that is what is called
the microcanonical case.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:50.750
That is, we perform a simulation
where the number of particles

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:54.650
is constant, the
volume is constant,

01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:57.920
and the total energy of
the system is constant.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.040
This is what is called a
thermodynamic ensemble.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.120
Again, these are all
extensive variables.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.910
And we are fixing them.

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:10.760
Sometimes it's
appropriate, instead,

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.400
to do a Legendre
transformation and go

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.950
into a different
thermodynamic ensemble.

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.040
Say, you could want not to
be at a constant volume.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.820
But you might want to study a
system at a constant pressure

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.830
where the volume changes.

01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:27.530
And so we need to describe
how we'll actually

01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:28.580
be able to do that.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.670
That is, how will
we be able to move

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:35.990
to a system in which different
intensive thermodynamic

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:37.520
variables are constant?

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.170
But if you take a system of
particles in periodic boundary

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:47.180
conditions and you have 10 water
molecules in a certain unit

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.990
cell and you evolve them with
the Newton equation of motion,

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:54.980
you can obviously know that
the number of molecules

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.450
and the volume of the unit
cell are not going to change.

01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:59.090
And if you integrate
your equation

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:02.510
of motion appropriately, the
total energy of the system,

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:05.750
that is the kinetic energy
plus the potential energy,

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:08.190
is not going to change.

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:12.005
And so as we evolve this
point in phase space,

01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:15.680
its trajectory is going
to span what we call

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.470
the microcanonical ensemble.

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:23.210
And you let this point
evolve long enough.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:28.220
And all of a sudden, you will
have a meaningful trajectory,

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:33.710
that is a meaningful assembly
collection of microstates

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:38.900
of representative configurations
in space and in velocities

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.770
of your system, out of which
you can calculate averages

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:47.820
of any of the observables
that you want to calculate

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:50.190
and that you want
to characterize.

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:55.170
So what do you do in these
molecular dynamic simulations?

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:58.710
Well, there are really
four important steps

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.390
that you need to
take into account.

01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:05.640
And we keep thinking of water,
liquid water, as an example.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.932
That is, you need to
start from something.

01:04:07.932 --> 01:04:09.390
That is, you need
to put your water

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:10.950
molecule in a certain position.

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:13.980
And you need to give
them initial velocities.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.210
And you are almost never
going to be good enough

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:22.710
in choosing a state of
the system that is somehow

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:23.670
meaningful.

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:26.670
You'll always, when you start
building something complex,

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:30.420
put molecules in places that
they don't want to stay.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.410
And one needs to be very
careful, then, in all of this.

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:38.190
But suppose that we have, in any
case, an initial configuration

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:39.900
of position and velocity.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:44.680
Then what we need to do is,
over and over again, integrate

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.460
the equation of motion, that
is, from the current position

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:52.020
and the current velocities,
predict the new position

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.780
after a certain time.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.570
And once you have the new
position at a certain time,

01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:00.450
you can recalculate what
are the forces acting

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:02.760
on the particle in
the new position.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.190
And with these forces,
you can, again,

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:09.610
move the particles by a certain
amount and so on and so forth.

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.940
And that is where the
molecular dynamics

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.600
algorithm comes into play.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.530
We need to integrate
our equation of motion.

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:20.320
And with this, our system
will start to evolve.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.280
We have put that point
in phase space in motion.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.540
And it'll start moving around.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.720
And if we are
integrating correctly,

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:34.090
the total energy of the system
is going to be conserved.

01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:36.930
Now what we need
to do is we need

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:41.460
to make sure that
our characterization,

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.640
our thermodynamic
averages, do not depend

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.260
on our initial condition.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.890
Again, we have started
from a configuration

01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:51.900
that we have built by hand.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:55.230
And because of that,
it's most likely

01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:59.160
a very unfavorable
configuration of the system.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:05.190
OK, so we need to let the
system evolve and somehow start

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:08.610
figuring out really
in which condition

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:10.060
it would want to stay.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:15.030
Think of the previous example
of silicon that is glassifying.

01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:16.620
Well, we had liquid silicon.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.120
We have to cool it down.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.970
In a way, what's happening
is that we are never

01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:25.770
equilibrating it because the
system goes into a glass phase.

01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:30.370
And so it never loses memory
of its initial condition.

01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:34.510
It's always sort of trapped in
this pseudo liquid, now glass,

01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:35.280
state.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.710
While in reality,
at a temperature

01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:40.680
below the freezing
or the melting point,

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.320
equilibrium would be given
by a crystalline state

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.030
with the ions vibrating.

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:47.610
So there are cases in
which equilibration

01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:50.580
is so difficult that we
actually never reach it.

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.010
Silicon never goes to a crystal.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.430
That's why we need
to be careful.

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.210
But in most cases
awfully we are lucky.

01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:59.940
And we lose memory
of initial condition.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.360
Say, the opposite is actually
very easy to achieve.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.420
If we start from the
solid and we warm it up,

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.140
it becomes a liquid.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.400
And if we wait long
enough, that liquid

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.420
will have lost all memory
of having come from a solid.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.210
OK, so it's actually very
easy in one direction

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.670
and very difficult in
the other direction.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:28.090
But once this equilibration time
has passed, well, at that point

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:30.270
we have truly
everything in place.

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:33.120
Our point in phase
space is moving around.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.040
And it's really going into the
regions of high probability

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:41.710
and distributed, according
to Boltzmann distribution.

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:45.600
And so at that point,
we can start an average

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.340
among any of the
physical observables

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.230
that we want to calculate.

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:54.810
And so there are
these four phases.

01:07:54.810 --> 01:08:02.220
And I'll briefly mention
how we actually choose them.

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.630
Initialization.

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:07.020
Well, again, we need
position and velocities.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:11.040
You need to be
careful, in particular,

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.150
to avoid overlap
between your molecules.

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:18.420
If you put two atoms
very close, they

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:22.630
are going to repel each other
with an enormous strength.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:25.229
And if you put
them close enough,

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:27.899
they are going to shoot
in opposite directions

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:31.649
very quickly and completely
kick off and mess up

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:34.630
everything on the side.

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:40.680
So what is difficult is really,
always in configuration space,

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.770
finding the right structures.

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:47.640
This is the difficult part of
choosing initial condition.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.000
Choosing velocities
is much easier.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.830
One possibility is just
giving zero velocity

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:57.270
to the system or a
very small velocity

01:08:57.270 --> 01:09:00.180
and then slowly adding things.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:05.430
And what we usually see is that
configuration in velocity space

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:07.050
is much faster.

01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:08.399
And this is the reason.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:12.029
Think of that trajectory for
a moment of one particle.

01:09:12.029 --> 01:09:15.245
And think of what happens
when you have a collision.

01:09:15.245 --> 01:09:17.370
Suppose that you have
particles, for a moment, that

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.870
are hard spheres.

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:23.890
In a collision, the
velocity of the particle

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:27.149
all of a sudden changes sign.

01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:31.020
So in the velocity part
of the phase space,

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:35.760
your point makes
a sudden jump, OK,

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.300
because the velocity that
was plus 10 has become

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.819
all of a sudden minus 10.

01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:45.899
So in velocity space,
for the limit case

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:50.250
of a system of hard spheres,
your representative point

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:54.060
hops everywhere continuously.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:57.870
In reality, I mean, you have
interaction at all times.

01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:00.060
And you don't really hop.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.030
But you can sort of
move very quickly

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:05.550
from one region to
the other region.

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:09.420
There is not anything similar
to the glass entanglement

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.200
in configuration space.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.140
So it's very easy to
thermalize velocity.

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:20.130
It's very difficult to
thermalize and equilibrate

01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:20.910
position.

01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:25.880
And that's where, all,
you need to be careful.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.140
And if you really
want to be accurate,

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:31.540
what you can also do
instead of giving zero

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.620
velocity to your system,
you can use your concept

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.070
of statistical mechanics.

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:40.300
That is, a system of
classical particles

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:44.560
will have a distribution
of velocities

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.340
that depends on the
temperature at which it is.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.960
And this is 0 in Celsius.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.390
So it's 273 Kelvin.

01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:57.640
And the distribution of
velocity in a classical system

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.970
is actually given by the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:04.910
written above that has
basically this shape.

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:10.330
So it means that if we are,
say, at 0 Celsius, 273 Kelvin,

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:16.570
we'll have a lot of molecules
with a certain velocity.

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:19.060
And then, in
principle, we can have

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.670
molecules with higher
and higher velocity.

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:24.560
But the probability of
finding them decreases.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.540
And as we increase
the temperature,

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.870
the probability distribution
of the velocities

01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:31.270
for the molecules changes.

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:36.730
And so as usual, you can define
both a median or an average

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:37.360
in your system.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:42.160
That is, you can look at what is
the most likely velocity, that

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.310
is the top of this
curve, at 0 Celsius.

01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:49.660
Or you could also define
what is the average velocity.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:51.550
And since that this
curve is asymmetric,

01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:55.310
it's going to be really
shifted a little bit.

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:57.670
And these are actually
the numerical expressions

01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.700
for these two velocities,
the most likely

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:03.350
and the average velocity.

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:06.970
And so I've given you the
example of an oxygen molecule

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:08.320
at room temperature.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.550
We are talking about
1,000 meters per second.

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:15.640
So these velocities,
if you want,

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.620
are similar to the speed
of sound in your material

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:24.370
because, at the end, sound
propagates at a certain speed

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:27.520
because that's the velocity
of the collision from one

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.370
molecule to the next that are
really carrying sound away.

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:33.520
So if you want to
be sophisticated,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.430
you give to your system
a set of velocities

01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:40.990
that could be, say, all
identical to the most likely

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.590
velocity.

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:47.170
But again, equilibration
and thermalization

01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:49.450
in velocity space is very easy.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:52.600
So once you have this,
that is, once you

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.690
have a set of positions
and the set of velocities,

01:12:55.690 --> 01:13:00.010
you need to use Newton's
equation of motion of saying,

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:06.170
of predicting, where your
system is going to go.

01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:11.110
And so that's when the
molecular dynamic algorithm

01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:12.500
comes into play.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.830
So what you need to
do is, as we say,

01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:20.020
you need to use an integrator,
the algorithm that tells you

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.470
what your next position and
what your next velocities

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:24.820
are going to be.

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:28.540
And there are a
number of integrators.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:29.890
There are subtleties.

01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:33.790
But often you find the
name of Verlet algorithm.

01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:36.220
This is one class of algorithms.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:40.710
And the other common class is
the Gear predictor-corrector,

01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:42.310
just to give you
the terminology.

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:45.080
And we look, in a moment,
at the Verlet algorithm.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:48.100
They're all fairly simple.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:52.360
But what is really important
is that this algorithm

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.930
should be robust.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:58.360
That is, they should give
you a trajectory that

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:02.020
is very close to the
trajectory that you would

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:05.950
get from the perfect
analytical integration

01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:07.600
of the equation of motion.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.220
And in particular, what is
the most important thing

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:17.830
is that they should be
accurate in, say, conserving

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.510
the constant of motion.

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:22.060
As we have seen from the
Newton's equation of motion,

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.730
the sum of the kinetic energy
and the potential energy

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:26.560
should be a constant.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.800
If your integration, if
your numerical evaluation,

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.080
of that equation
is poor, you will

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.290
see that the constant of motion
is not any more constant.

01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:38.890
So again, this is
the sanity check

01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:42.220
on the accuracy of
your integration.

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.190
And there are more
subtle elements

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:49.000
of the integration algorithm
that can become important.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.770
But we won't go into that.

01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:55.120
And then as I said,
straightforward integration

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.710
of the Newton's
equation of motion

01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:59.650
gives you the microcanonical
ensemble in which

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:01.570
the total energy's conserved.

01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:04.960
But sometimes you want
to study systems in which

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.270
the temperature is fixed.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:08.890
Or you could want
to study systems

01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:11.360
in which the pressure is fixed.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.480
And so you need to augment your
molecular dynamic integrator

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.740
with some feature that
allows you to control

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.880
those intensive variables.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.050
So if you want, say, to control
the temperature of the system,

01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:29.950
what we say usually is
that we couple the system

01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:31.300
to a thermostat.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.050
That is, we make sure that the
temperature in your evolution

01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:36.010
doesn't change.

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:39.710
And you'll see examples
in the next class of this.

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:43.540
And in the case, in
particular, of something,

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.740
say, like the temperature,
you have a whole set

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.800
of possible thermostats.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.340
That is, you could use
stochastic approaches.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.950
That is, you have your
evolution of your system.

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:59.260
And your system
doesn't conserve,

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.390
if it's microcanonical,
the temperature.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.910
Sometimes it goes towards
higher temperature.

01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:06.620
Sometimes it go towards
lower temperature.

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:12.160
And what you could do is
either every now and then

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.310
absorb some energy or give back
some energy in your system--

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:18.370
and that would be a
Langevin dynamics--

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:22.300
in order to control the average
kinetic energy of your system.

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.910
Or you could somehow forbid, in
the microcanonical evolution,

01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:32.780
your system to choose a state in
which the temperature changes.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:38.140
So if your new positions are
such that your velocity gives

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:41.890
an increase in
temperature, you just

01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:45.430
shorten how much your
atoms move in order

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:47.650
to make the velocity
smaller and in order

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:49.720
to make the kinetic
energy conserved.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.720
Or there are more
complex dynamical ways

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.940
of imposing
temperature that goes

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:57.670
under the name of
extended Hamiltonian,

01:16:57.670 --> 01:16:59.290
or extended system,
of which we'll see

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:02.500
an example that is [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:07.810
But let me give you really
what is the simplest and still

01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:12.520
one of the most used
numerical integrators.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.650
And it tends to be very
robust and very accurate.

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:20.030
So it's still used in a lot of
molecular dynamic simulations.

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:23.890
And there is often no reason to
do anything better than this.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.930
So in a way, we are in
a much luckier situation

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:28.140
than in quantum mechanics.

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.750
This is good enough
in almost all cases.

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:34.930
And this is how we
look at the problem.

01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:38.620
That is, what we
need to do always

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:45.940
is we need to calculate the
position of each particle

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:51.970
at a time t plus
delta t once we know

01:17:51.970 --> 01:17:55.780
the position, the
velocity, and the forces

01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:58.030
on that particle at time t.

01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:01.360
So suppose I'm at a certain
instant in time that I call t.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.980
I know everything about my
system-- position, velocity,

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:04.750
and forces.

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:06.970
What I really need
to do is predict

01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:08.860
what are the new positions.

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.870
And when I'm in
the new positions,

01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:16.090
I want to calculate the forces
again and evolve the system.

01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:17.150
And now, what do we do?

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:20.470
Well, let's do a simple
Taylor expansion.

01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:27.130
That is, this is r of t is a
function of the variable t.

01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:29.080
So we can use a
Taylor expansion.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.160
And r of t plus delta
t is going to be r of t

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.510
plus the derivative of r with
respect to t times delta t.

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:38.980
And that's the velocity.

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.590
Plus 1/2 of the
second derivative

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:43.693
of the position with
respect to time.

01:18:43.693 --> 01:18:44.860
And that's the acceleration.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:48.310
Times delta t squared, and so
on for the third derivatives

01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:51.400
and so on for the fourth,
fifth, ad infinitum.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.550
This is just the Taylor
expansion as a function, OK?

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:58.900
And so it gives us the
position of t plus delta t,

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:03.890
knowing all the derivatives--
first, second, third, fourth,

01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:04.450
nth--

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:05.890
at times t.

01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:07.970
And once we have
the derivatives,

01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:11.470
we can not only predict
what the position would

01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:14.380
be at t plus delta t, but
also what the position would

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:16.900
be at t minus delta t.

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.190
And it's written here.

01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:23.110
And if you think, the
terms with an odd power

01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:25.720
change sign in delta t.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.440
And the terms with an even power
in delta t do not change sign.

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.780
So we have just done
a Taylor expansion.

01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:36.370
And now what we do is we
actually sum these two

01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:38.660
quantities together, OK?

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:43.360
And this is what we obtain, OK?

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.970
We sum the two
quantities together.

01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:50.020
All the odd terms disappear.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.550
This sums to 0.

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:52.960
This sums to 0.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.140
The fifth order, seventh
order, and so on sum to 0.

01:19:56.140 --> 01:20:00.700
So what we have is that we
have rt plus delta t plus rt

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:06.920
minus delta t is equal to
2 times rt plus alpha--

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.130
sorry-- acceleration
times delta t squared.

01:20:09.130 --> 01:20:10.540
It's just written here.

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.820
And then rearrange the terms.

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:15.430
But you see, this is
the Verlet algorithm.

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:18.740
Now what we have when we
look at this expression,

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:21.850
we have an expression
that tells us

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:26.050
what is the position
at my new time step,

01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:30.100
knowing the position
at my current instant,

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.220
knowing the position at
the previous instant.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.820
We are keeping configurations
from our trajectories.

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:38.800
So we know where we were before.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.450
We know where we are now.

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:42.670
And we know where
we are going to be

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:46.150
just by adding to this
the term acceleration

01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:49.610
at the present time
times delta t squared.

01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:53.210
We make an error
because we are not

01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:56.300
introducing terms
that are higher

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.730
order in delta t squared.

01:20:58.730 --> 01:21:02.940
But you see, the term in delta
t cubed has canceled out.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:07.520
So the error that we make
is just of the order delta t

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.420
fourth.

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:11.900
That is, that means that the
smaller we make the delta t,

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:15.620
the smaller we make the
time step, the more accurate

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.420
our integration is.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:20.205
And so this is, if you want
the most critical parameter

01:21:20.205 --> 01:21:22.160
in your molecular
dynamic simulation,

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.030
you need to make sure that
the steps that you take

01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:30.230
are small enough,
considering what is really

01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:34.880
the variation of your
force as a function of time

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.910
because remember
that now that we use

01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:42.830
Newton's equation of motion,
the acceleration at a time t

01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:48.860
is just given by the
force divided by the mass.

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:51.680
And because the force is just
the gradient of the potential,

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.520
it's just given by this.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.980
So at a certain
instant in time t,

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:58.130
you have the acceleration
acting in your particles

01:21:58.130 --> 01:22:01.100
just by taking the force
and dividing by the mass.

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:03.470
So at every instant,
you calculate force.

01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:06.590
And the force lets
you evolve the system.

01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:10.100
And it keeps giving
you the new positions.

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:13.550
And so you know what is the
trajectory and configuration

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:14.420
space.

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:17.630
And you can very
simply find out what

01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:20.150
is your velocity
at every instant t,

01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:23.300
if you need to calculate
what is the velocity just

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:28.500
by doing a final difference
calculation of the tangent

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.000
basically.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.520
The velocity is the
tangent of the trajectory

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.570
with respect to t.

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:35.990
OK, this concludes class.

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:38.810
What we'll see in
the next lecture

01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:43.460
is how we actually take
this Verlet integration

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:46.520
and how we use it to
do the characterization

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:50.040
of the thermodynamic
properties of a real system.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:54.610
So today is Thursday.

01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:56.810
Next week is spring break.

01:22:56.810 --> 01:23:03.280
So we'll see each other
again on Tuesday, 29th.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.500
And I will be at a conference.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:11.290
And all the TAs will be
at a conference next week.

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:15.420
So it will be slightly difficult
communicating via email.

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:19.560
So try to ask a lot of
questions between now

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:23.610
and Sunday for your problem
set that is due the Tuesday

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:24.690
after spring break.

01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:27.990
And that will be problem set 2.

01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:30.500
Otherwise, enjoy spring break.

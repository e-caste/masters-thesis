HARVEY: Good evening, everybody.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.850
I'd like to welcome you to MIT.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.190
My name's Mark Harvey,
and I'm teaching here

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.920
in the music program.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.090
And this semester
we have a course

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.850
called Musical Improvisation.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.060
And thanks to our music section
as well as the alumni class

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.010
funds program, we were able
to bring in some distinguished

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.410
improvisers.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.652
We've had two of these,
a series of four.

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:44.610
We've had two of these.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.280
We have tonight, and then we
have one more in early May.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.869
Let me just say a couple
words about our visitors

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:51.410
this evening.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.410
We have Neil Leonard, who's
been a long time friend,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.640
and Robin Eubanks over here.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.860
Neil came to our
class on Monday,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.120
and we had a great time.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.030
And so this is a
furthering, an enrichment

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.089
of what we're studying.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.380
And now it's a chance for
all of you to engage in this.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500
So you can see by
their bios, they're

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.090
very distinguished world
travelers, master improvisers.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.300
So without further
ado, Neil Leonard.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.728
Robin Eubanks.

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:24.000
LEONARD: Thank you, Mark.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.156
It's wonderful to be
here at MIT this evening.

00:01:27.156 --> 00:01:30.016
I'm very pleased to
have the opportunity

00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:33.904
to play again with the
great Robin Eubanks.

00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:36.820
I'm going to play three
pieces, [INAUDIBLE] pieces,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.210
and the first two were created
under very peculiar or unique

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.100
circumstances.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.140
One was at the invitation of
a conference on sonification

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.965
in Washington, DC a
couple of years ago.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.570
And I did a piece with
a couple of my students

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.125
that involved data that
was collected from the sun.

00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:01.480
And so we made a piece of
music out of celestial data.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.300
And that's the first piece
called Nocturnal Remix.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.990
The second piece
is a piece which

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.923
I created at the invitation
of an art collector

00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:17.335
in Italy, Gianni
Bolongaro who asked me

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:20.770
if I would record the
sounds of a sculpture

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.410
by an artist named
Jannis Kounellis

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.820
And I began a piece, which went
through several renditions.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.800
And what you'll hear
are the sounds recorded

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.640
in his sculpture park,
an Italian vocalist

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.705
from Mount Vesuvius in
Naples, and the third piece

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:46.227
is an improvisation on a song
that you'll probably recognize.

00:02:46.227 --> 00:02:47.560
I won't announce that right now.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.552
Thank you.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.115
EUBANKS: First I want
to definitely thank

00:30:43.115 --> 00:30:49.104
Neil for inviting me up here
because you probably did not

00:30:49.104 --> 00:30:51.676
know it, but Neil and
I have known each other

00:30:51.676 --> 00:30:55.360
for-- Don't say.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.470
Many, many, many,
many, many years.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.460
Both grew up in Philadelphia.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.250
Actually I grew up playing in
a lot of funk and rock bands.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.840
And the first jazz
band I ever played in

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.346
was with Neil in Philadelphia.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:18.320
So it's great to see
how he's developed.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.195
I found out he was teaching
up here at Berklee.

00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:22.310
And we're both teaching.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.780
I teach at Oberlin Conservatory.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.716
And I was just
really happy that he

00:31:29.716 --> 00:31:31.215
invited me to come
do this because I

00:31:31.215 --> 00:31:32.423
don't get to do it too often.

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:36.431
There's still relatively
few horn players

00:31:36.431 --> 00:31:38.430
that are using all these
electronics and things.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.050
And I don't get to do too often.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:45.122
So I just came off of a tour,
a month-long tour last night,

00:31:45.122 --> 00:31:46.556
or the day before maybe.

00:31:46.556 --> 00:31:47.520
I forget now.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.240
And actually played at the
Berklee performance center

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.502
a month ago.

00:31:52.502 --> 00:31:56.013
And I got in yesterday,
and I was up all night

00:31:56.013 --> 00:31:58.390
trying to read the
manuals to find out,

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.820
remember how to work this stuff.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.882
Because basically
what I'm saying is I

00:32:02.882 --> 00:32:05.770
don't know what I'm doping.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:09.330
There's a little bit spun for
me because you kind of fly

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:13.420
by the seat of your pants with
no net, and sometimes you fall.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.255
And it's cool.

00:32:14.255 --> 00:32:17.510
You just get up
and try to make it

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:21.245
so you don't notice when I fall.

00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:23.200
But I'm just going
to try some stuff

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.040
and see what happens
and hope you enjoy it.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.032
Thank you.

I'm going to do.

is just that it is what it is.

LEONARD: We are going to
finish with a piece together.

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:42.268
Does anybody know
what a pregonero is?

01:04:42.268 --> 01:04:45.030
EUBANKS: A what?

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:46.755

01:04:46.755 --> 01:04:48.000
ROBIN: Spanish

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.291
LEONARD: A pregonero is a street
vendor, who lives in Cuba.

01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:54.790
Actually they're
all over the world.

01:04:54.790 --> 01:05:00.420
But the ones that I
know live in Cuba.

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:06.510
And for the past maybe 50 years,
their practice was not allowed.

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:08.940
And as of a couple years
ago, if you found yourself

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:15.500
in Cuba sitting in
your in-laws patio,

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:22.630
you would begin to hear these
people selling ajo, garlic,

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:27.900
soja, onions, exterminators
who could kill

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:37.880
bed bugs, mice, mothers-in-law--
I didn't try them-- car alarms.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.170
The whole deal.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:43.520
This was everything you ever
needed sold door-to-door.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:47.030
There was no advertising,
no Internet, no billboards,

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.570
no what advertisers,
no handbills.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:54.100
Just people roaming the
streets selling their stuff.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:06:02.270
And in the last year as
they came back instantly,

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:05.820
I invited them to
do some pieces.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.563
And some of them
were installations,

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:10.630
and some were performances.

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:12.920
Probably the most
notable performance

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.709
was I decided that I don't
have an interest in going

01:06:17.709 --> 01:06:20.000
to somebody else's country
and telling them what to do.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.520
But I thought in Cuba they
needed an American Idol

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.580
for the pregoneros.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:32.437
And so I staged an American
Idol for the pregoneros,

01:06:32.437 --> 01:06:36.930
an Idol of the Americas,
and invited the pregoneros

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:40.915
and gave prizes for the most
musical pregon, the most poetic

01:06:40.915 --> 01:06:48.060
pregon, the pregonero who was
the most gifted and innovative

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.900
for promoting contemporary art.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.980
We made that category.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:56.895
And national television picked
it up and had the pregoneros

01:06:56.895 --> 01:07:00.860
on national television with
a jury that I selected.

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.670
This project keeps on going.

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:06.720
And the next stop is
the Venice biennial,

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.775
where my wife and
I have been invited

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:12.302
to participate in the Cuban
pavilion of the Venice biennial

01:07:12.302 --> 01:07:13.230
in May.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:18.615
But when I thought of what I
could write for Robin that he

01:07:18.615 --> 01:07:21.990
and I could play, well I still
couldn't get these pregoneros

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.740
out of my mind.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:28.130
So we're going to perform
a short suite of pieces

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:30.380
and in this you'll
hear the voice of one

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:38.260
of these pregoneros and
a lot play with the song

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.610
that this person sings.

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:43.175
So this piece is
called Pregones that I

01:07:43.175 --> 01:07:44.660
wrote for Robin and myself.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.145

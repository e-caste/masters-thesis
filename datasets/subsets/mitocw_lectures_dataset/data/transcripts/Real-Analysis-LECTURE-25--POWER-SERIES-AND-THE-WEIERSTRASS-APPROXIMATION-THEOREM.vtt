00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.320 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So at
the end of last time,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
let me just restate the
theorem that we proved,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:84%
which was the
Weierstrass M-test, which

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I'll state in briefer
form now as the following.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Suppose fj are a sequence of
functions from some subset

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:84%
S of R, so that for all j, there
exists non-negative number M

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
sub j, such that
two things hold.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.575 align:middle line:84%
First off, these M sub j's
dominate the f sub j's.

00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
f sub j of x is less
than or equal to M sub j.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And two, these M sub
j's are summable.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Then the conclusion is, the
sequence of partial sums.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:90%
So converges uniformly.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So there exists some
function f from S to R

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
so that the partial
sums converge uniformly.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is a sequence
of functions built up

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
by the fj's by just taking
the sum of the first j

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:90%
equals 1 to n of them.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example, and I kind
of went through this last time.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So example, if fj of x equals
our old friend cosine of 160jx

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:90%
over 4 to the j, then--

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:90%
and let's say on R. So S is R.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.145 align:middle line:90%
And a couple of things.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
fj of x for all x is less than
or equal to 4 to the minus j.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Because cosine of
whatever you put into

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:90%
it is always bounded by 1.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And since this
converges, this implies

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that this series, which I'm
writing in this way, which you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
should think of as
a limit of functions

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.330 align:middle line:84%
of the partial sums,
which are functions,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:90%
converges uniformly on R.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, this
function defined by--

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:90%
I take x, I stick it into here--

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:90%
is continuous.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Because last time, we proved
that the uniform limit

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
of continuous functions
is continuous.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
This function here
is the uniform limit

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
of the partial sums, which
is just finitely many cosines

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's continuous.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
So this gives another
proof of one of the things

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
we did by hand when we spoke
about differentiability, namely

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
that this function that we
considered was continuous.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
power series, which

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:90%
was our original motivation.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be
saying that a series--

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
so let me, again, make
this perfectly clear.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
When I say, if you like,
make this a definition.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Or really, this is just a--

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.684 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.684 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I was using this terminology
up there in that theorem

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and when I was talking about
this example afterwards.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But when I say a
series involving

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
functions converges uniformly,
I mean the partial sums

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:90%
converge uniformly.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So means there exist a
function f such that--

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and all of these are from
S to R as well, such that--

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.358 align:middle line:84%
just so that there's
no ambiguity.

00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So if I have a
sequence of functions,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
f sub j, and I
form their series,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and I say that converges
uniformly, that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
means there exists
some function f,

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
so that the sequence
of partial sums--

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:90%
these are now functions--

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:84%
converges uniformly
to the function f.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what power series are.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
They're expressions
involving a free variable x.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
can think of them

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:90%
as a series involving functions.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So let me just state the
following theorem about when

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:90%
we have a uniform convergence.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's suppose we have
a power series with radius

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
of convergence rho,
which I will recall

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is defined to be the limit
as j goes to infinity, aj

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:90%
1 over j inverse.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
If this limit is 0, we say
that the radius of convergence

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:90%
is infinity.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So if this is a
finite number, this

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:90%
is a meaningful expression.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:84%
If this is 0, then
this is shorthand

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
for saying the radius of
convergence is infinity.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:90%
So let's assume this is--

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:84%
then, as long as I stay
strictly inside the radius

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:84%
of convergence, I have
uniformed convergence.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the statement
of the theorem.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And for all R in 0 rho, this
power series, now thought

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of as a series of functions of
x, converges uniformly on x0

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:41.060 align:middle line:90%
minus R, x0 plus R.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So the picture is, we have some
radius of convergence, x0, x0

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:90%
plus rho, x0 minus rho.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
If we take any closed
interval, basically,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
inside of that-- strictly
inside of that interval,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.155 align:middle line:84%
then we have uniform
convergence of the power series.

00:09:03.155 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So we'll prove this using
the Weierstrass M-test.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:90%
So let R be in 0, rho.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And for all j--

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and OK, so the
Weierstrass M-test

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
is for j equals starting
from 1 and going to infinity.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to,
just like for series, we

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:90%
don't have to start at 1.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:90%
It can start at 0.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So for all j union
0, what do we have?

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:90%
What are we writing?

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And for all x in
this interval where

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:84%
we want to show
uniform convergence,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
we have that this
function a sub j,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:84%
x minus x0 to the j
in absolute value.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:90%
What is this bounded by?

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:84%
This is bounded by absolute
value of aj, and then j.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And because x is in this
interval, its distance to x0

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to R. So R to the j.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So this will be my Mj that I'll
use for the Weierstrass M-test.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Let me put that in parentheses,
because I may not use that Mj.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So these individual
functions, just polynomials,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:84%
are bounded by this
number for each j.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And now, I want to see if
the series of involving

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:90%
these numbers converges.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:90%
So let me apply the root test.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:90%
We have this is equal to--

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:84%
now, this R to the 1
over j just becomes R.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And it can just come
out of this limit.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:90%
And I pick up a to the 1 over j.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is equal
to 1 over rho by--

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:84%
so this is equal to, if you
like, I can put R over rho,

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
as long as if rho is
less than infinity.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Meaning if the
radius of convergence

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.535 align:middle line:90%
is less than infinity and 0.

00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And what do we notice?

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, R is less than rho.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:84%
R is coming from the closed
interval 0 up to the rho,

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:90%
not including rho.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So this number-- so this
is always less than 1.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But this number is
always less than 1

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.270 align:middle line:84%
too, as long as R
is less than rho.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Which implies that
the series sum from j

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 to infinity of
aj R to the j converges.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the
sequence of functions,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:84%
the polynomials that we used
to build up our power series,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
each of them bounded by
these numbers, a sub j,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:90%
absolute value times R to the j.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:90%
And these numbers are summable.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:90%
The series converges.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So by the Weierstrass
M-test, this

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
implies that the
power series converges

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.825 align:middle line:90%
uniformly on this interval.

00:13:22.825 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So as long as we stay strictly
within inside the radius

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.487 align:middle line:84%
of convergence, we have
uniform convergence

00:13:42.487 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:90%
of the power series.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, using the
theorems that we proved before,

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
we can differentiate and
integrate term by term

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.605 align:middle line:90%
the power series.

00:13:56.605 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So which follows immediately
from this previous theorem

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and then what we proved last
time, which I'll state now.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:39.490 align:middle line:84%
The power series with radius
of convergence rho positive.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:90%
So let me write it this way.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.010 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And the first is for all c
inside x0 minus R, x0 plus R,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
the function given by the power
series, which I'm not going

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:90%
to call this f or anything.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to refer
the power series directly,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:90%
this is differentiable at c.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And to compute the
derivative, you

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.388 align:middle line:84%
can just do it term
by term, meaning I

00:15:25.388 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:90%
can take the derivative inside.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
By dx of j equals 0
to infinity, a sub j,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:90%
evaluated at x equals c.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to simply
differentiating term by term.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And number two, for all a
less than be, well, with x0

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
minus rho less than a, less
than b, less than x0 plus rho--

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:84%
so here I'm sticking to
strictly with inside the radius

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:90%
of convergence.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:84%
There's the x0 plus
rho, x0 minus rho.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, now I'm going
to integrate over

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:90%
some interval inside.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Then I can integrate
term by term.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The integral from
a to b, sum from j

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:08.164 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 to infinity of a sub
j, x minus x0 jdx equals--

00:17:08.164 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'll just write it
this way, sum from j

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:90%
equals 0 to infinity of--

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.538 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, let me
just to really emphasize

00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
that we're interchanging
limits here,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
let me instead write this
equivalently as sum from j

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 to infinity of
sub j d by dx of a sub j,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
x minus x0, j evaluated
at x equals c.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So for power series, I can
interchange the limits.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
The limit being taking
a derivative in the sum,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I can interchange.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, I can also interchange
the integration and the sum

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:84%
as long as I stay within
the radius of convergence.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And this statement
here is a point-wise.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's see why
one is the case.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Two follows immediately
from what we've proven,

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and so, this previous
theorem and the theorem

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
we have about integration
and uniform convergence.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.340 align:middle line:90%
So what about one?

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So first off, we know we
have uniform convergence

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:84%
of the series strictly inside
of the radius of convergence.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So how about, we
need to check to see

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:03.300 align:middle line:84%
if the formal derivative also
has radius of convergence

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:90%
as well equal to rho.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So I claim that the radius of
convergence of the derivatives

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.720 align:middle line:90%
which equals--

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.085 align:middle line:90%
I can write it this way.

00:19:31.085 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.170 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So the derivative of this
guy is j times a sub j times

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:90%
x minus x0 to the j minus 1.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So just shifting indices, this
is equal to times j plus 1,

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:90%
times x minus x0 to the j.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So our claim is that
this power series here

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
has radius of convergence equal
to rho, the original radius

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:90%
of convergence.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So rho is the radius
of convergence

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:90%
of-- why did I come over here.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:90%
I still had a board left.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
The original power series has
radius of convergence rho.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
What we need to
show to prove part

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:84%
one is that the
radius of convergence

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:84%
of the derivatives of taking
the derivatives inside also

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:90%
has radius of convergence rho.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Because then, this would imply
that this power series, which

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
is the derivative of
that one, converges

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:90%
uniformly on the same set.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So then we have
uniform convergence

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:84%
of the power series and uniform
convergence of the derivative

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:90%
of the power series.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So by the theorem we
proved in the last lecture,

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
we would have that the
derivative of the power series

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:84%
equals the power series
of the derivatives.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
focus on this claim.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, just follows
from what we know about limits.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, we compute that
if we take the limit as j

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of-- now,
these are the coefficients

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:90%
for the new power series.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So aj plus 1, j plus 1
raised to the 1 over j,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to limit
j goes to infinity

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
of a sub j plus 1 now raised
to the 1 over j plus 1, j plus

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:90%
1, 1 over j plus 1.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Now all raised j plus 1 over j.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was a special limit
that we looked at last time.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:90%
This, the limit as j goes to--

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
not last time, but
way back when we

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:84%
were looking at
sequences-- the limit

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:84%
as j goes to infinity
of this guy is 1.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So this in fact equals
limit as j goes to infinity,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:90%
this goes to 1, this goes to 1.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually say
this converges to 1 as well.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So this equals to
the j plus 1 over j.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, strictly speaking,
you would have to--

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:84%
so this thing also converges
to-- what does it converge to?

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:84%
This remember, is-- so
where do we have it?

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Do we still have it up here?

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So the radius-- well,
it's way over there.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So let me recall that the
radius of convergence rho,

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
let me put an
inverse here, this is

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:84%
equal to the limit as let me put
a k goes to infinity, of a sub

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:90%
k, 1 over k.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is the exponents
converging to 1.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.930 align:middle line:84%
This is converging
to rho inverse again.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:90%
So I get rho inverse to the 1.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, this is
supposed to be the radius--

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.120 align:middle line:84%
1 over the radius of convergence
to the differentiated power

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
series, which implies the
differentiated power series.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
j is 1 over this limit,
1 over that limit,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:84%
which we computed is
to be is 1 over rho,

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the original
radius of convergence.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So all this to say is that
the radius of convergence

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
of the differentiated
power series, the formerly

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.940 align:middle line:84%
differentiated power
series, is the same

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:84%
as the radius of convergence
of the original power series.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you have
uniform convergence

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
of the derivatives wherever
you have uniform convergence

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:90%
of the original power series.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by the
theorem we proved last time,

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:90%
since both the derivatives and--

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
so since the power series and
the derivative of the power

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
series converges
uniformly on the same set,

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:90%
the power series--

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
the infinite sum, so this guy
is actually differentiable.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And the derivative
of the power series

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:39.530 align:middle line:84%
is the power series
of the derivatives.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But you can iterate this,
because I now have this power

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.970 align:middle line:84%
series with radius
of convergence

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.062 align:middle line:84%
equal to the radius of
convergence of the original.

00:25:53.062 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, I can take
a derivative of that

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and show that has the
same radius of convergence

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:90%
as the original.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:05.175 align:middle line:84%
So let me just leave
this as a remark

00:26:05.175 --> 00:26:06.425 align:middle line:90%
and not state it as a theorem.

00:26:06.425 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Iterating can prove that if
I want the k-th derivative

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.635 align:middle line:90%
of the power series.

00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So on-- so let me say, all x
in here, the k-th derivative

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:84%
of the power series is
equal the power series

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.362 align:middle line:90%
of differentiating term-by-term.

00:26:55.362 --> 00:27:01.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So this holds for k
equals 1, 2, and so on.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And so in particular,
if I evaluate at x0,

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
this tells me that
k factorial, a sub k

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the derivative
of this function, which

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.785 align:middle line:84%
is what you get out when you
stick x into this power series.

00:27:28.785 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And you can interpret this,
although we never called

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
them Taylor series, as a
statement that every power

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.785 align:middle line:84%
series is the Taylor
series of a function.

00:27:52.785 --> 00:27:55.762 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.762 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
At least in this setting
that we're looking at.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So we've answered
pretty definitively,

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.340 align:middle line:84%
at least for the
scope of this class,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:84%
when we can
interchange limits, we

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:84%
can do that as long as we
have uniform convergence

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:84%
of the objects that
we're interested in,

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:34.250 align:middle line:84%
be it the function, the
continuous functions,

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:90%
or function and its derivative.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.782 align:middle line:84%
But there are more powerful
statements out there

00:28:41.782 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that one can make, especially
when it comes to integration.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:84%
This is why essentially why a
different theory of integration

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:90%
was created, or one reason why.

00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully, if I see
some of you in 18 102,

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
which is what I'm
teaching next semester,

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into that
further when we

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:90%
discuss Lebesgue integration.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.690 align:middle line:84%
That was thought of because
somehow Riemann integration is

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:84%
not complete the same way that
the rational numbers are not

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:90%
complete.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Riemann integration
is not complete,

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.275 align:middle line:84%
Lebesgue integration is
complete in a certain sense.

00:29:34.275 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm being very vague
here for a reason.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just giving you
where you can go with this.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Is what the next step is
at least improving when can

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:84%
you interchange two limits
is really a topic that's

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:90%
fundamental to the study of--

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.113 align:middle line:84%
in the study of
Lebesgue integration.

00:30:02.113 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And you have much
more powerful theorems

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
there than you do
here, which allows

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:84%
you to prove interesting
results, and especially about

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Fourier series.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I had
more time, we would

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.192 align:middle line:84%
apply, in fact,
some of the stuff

00:30:20.192 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that we've done
here we could apply

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.150 align:middle line:90%
to the study of Fourier series.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:29.620 align:middle line:84%
But maybe we'll
do that in 18 102.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So I want to now prove the last
theorem of the class, which

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:90%
is also due to the godfather.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So when we had
these power series,

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:84%
so these are defining
functions, very special types

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.370 align:middle line:84%
of functions, what
are called analytic.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They are by definition
essentially the limit

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:90%
of polynomials.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.350 align:middle line:84%
They're the limit of these
finite sums of a sub j's times

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:84%
x minus x0 raised
to the j power.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a polynomial.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So for analytic
functions, which are

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:84%
these functions equal
to power series,

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:84%
they are the limits
of polynomials.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But that's a pretty
small class of functions,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.450 align:middle line:90%
analytic functions.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.000 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But Weierstrass proved this
very interesting result

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that actually
something like this

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:84%
is true for all
continuous functions.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So roughly speaking,
Weierstrass proved

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that basically every continuous
function is in some sense

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.370 align:middle line:90%
almost a polynomial.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Just as we solve for these
analytic functions, meaning

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:15.170 align:middle line:84%
defined by power series,
they are very close to being,

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.980 align:middle line:84%
at least within their radius
of convergence, a polynomial.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is true for
all continuous functions,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that not necessarily
equal to a power series,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
but every continuous function
is almost a polynomial.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And in what sense
do I mean that?

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is Weierstrass's
approximation theorem,

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.610 align:middle line:90%
which states the following.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:58.170 align:middle line:84%
If f is in continuous function
and on the unit interval,

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:84%
say, you can make it a, b, just
by rescaling the variables.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just state it
for continuous functions

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.535 align:middle line:90%
on the unit interval.

00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists a
sequence polynomials

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:31.770 align:middle line:84%
p sub n of x, such
that p sub n converges

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:90%
to f uniformly on 0, 1.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:43.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, in this sense,
every continuous function

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.540 align:middle line:84%
is well approximated
by polynomials.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So every continuous function
is close to being a polynomial.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So I need to first
prove a couple

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:90%
of things that will be needed.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So first off, I'm only
going to look at only a--

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.515 align:middle line:84%
so let me make some remarks
before we go to the proof.

00:34:17.515 --> 00:34:21.639 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're putting the
proof on hold now.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:90%
So let me just make a remark.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily need
to prove this statement

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.650 align:middle line:90%
for every f, just for certain f.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:35.192 align:middle line:84%
And then for every f will
follow from this special class.

00:34:35.192 --> 00:34:44.530 align:middle line:90%


00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:90%
So we only need to consider--

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:84%
we'll only consider the case,
f of 0 equals 0, and f of 1

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:56.900 align:middle line:90%
equals 0.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.903 align:middle line:90%
So f is 0 at the end points.

00:34:58.903 --> 00:35:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Why we're doing
this is so that we

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.200 align:middle line:84%
can extend f to a continuous
function outside of the unit

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:84%
interval by just
setting it equal to 0.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.482 align:middle line:84%
And so, let's suppose we've
proven this special case

00:35:11.482 --> 00:35:12.815 align:middle line:90%
and we look at the general case.

00:35:12.815 --> 00:35:25.240 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Then if I take any
continuous function now,

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:37.420 align:middle line:84%
what do we know that there
exists sequence of polynomials,

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:84%
p sub n, such that
these polynomials,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.210 align:middle line:84%
p sub n converge uniformly
to a small modification

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.160 align:middle line:90%
of f that results in--

00:35:52.160 --> 00:36:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
so this function
here, if I look at it,

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.360 align:middle line:84%
it's a continuous
function on 0, 1,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.070 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just modifying it
by constants and then times x.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And then at f of 1, I get f
of 1 minus f of 0 minus f of 1

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:90%
minus f of 0.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.390 align:middle line:90%
So I get 0.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And at 0, I get f of 0 minus 0.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.590 align:middle line:90%
f of 0 is 0.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Minus 0 times something,
I don't care, equals 0.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So there exist polynomials
converging to this function

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.690 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:40.860 align:middle line:84%
If we've been able to prove the
case just for f of 0 equals 0

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.120 align:middle line:90%
and f of 1 equals 0.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:51.205 align:middle line:84%
So uniformly, and therefore,
the polynomials given by p

00:36:51.205 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:84%
sub n of x plus now x times
f of 1 minus f of 0 plus--

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.680 align:middle line:84%
so this is still, if
this was a polynomial,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.270 align:middle line:90%
so is adding this to it.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:16.430 align:middle line:84%
That's still a polynomial,
converges to f tilde

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:90%
of x uniformly.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, this
is still a polynomial.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:25.810 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So the whole point
of this remark

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.470 align:middle line:84%
is that we only need to consider
the case f of 0 equals 0

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:90%
and f of 1 equals 0.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do
that just so that we

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:84%
can extend f to a continuous
function outside the interval.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way we're going to
build these polynomials that

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:84%
converge to f is by what's
called an approximation

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.620 align:middle line:90%
to the identity.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Really, I guess you could
think of it as an approximation

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.910 align:middle line:90%
to the delta function.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain that
in just a minute.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So for all n natural
number defined c sub n,

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.900 align:middle line:84%
this will be the integral
from minus 1 to 1 of 1

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:33.000 align:middle line:84%
minus x squared raised
to the n, dx, 1 over.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, q sub n
of x, this is going

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:41.190 align:middle line:84%
to be equal to c sub
n times 1 minus x

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:90%
squared raised to the n.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Then a few simple consequences
are, so first off, this

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:58.000 align:middle line:84%
is the integral of a function
which is non-negative,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's positive at plenty of
places between minus 1 and 1.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And you proved in the
homework that this

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:84%
means that the integral
has to be positive.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Then the first is, for all N
natural number, for all x in 0,

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:90%
1.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.175 align:middle line:84%
So the first two of these
observations are very clear.

00:39:21.175 --> 00:39:23.810 align:middle line:90%


00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
qn of x is greater
than-- so minus 1 to 1.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:84%
qn of x is bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's just c sub n, which
is a positive number times 1

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
minus x squared. x squared,
so x is between minus 1 and 1.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, 1 minus x
squared is always non-negative.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Two is, this is
also pretty clear.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:58.870 align:middle line:84%
The integral from minus 1 to 1
of q sub n of x, dx equals 1.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is this clear?

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Because this is equal
to the integral of 1

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:84%
minus x squared raised to the
n, times c to the n, or c sub n.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But c sub n is the
inverse of that integral.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.980 align:middle line:90%
So we should just pick up 1.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the third and less trivial
thing, which is important,

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:35.330 align:middle line:84%
is that for all delta in 0,
1, this function q sub n,

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just a
polynomial, converges to 0

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:52.770 align:middle line:84%
uniformly on the set
delta is less than-- so

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.520 align:middle line:84%
x such that delta is bigger than
or equal to the absolute value

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.320 align:middle line:90%
of x.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.930 align:middle line:84%
No, delta is less than or equal
to the absolute value of x

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.420 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to 1.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, here's minus
1, 1, 0, delta, minus delta.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:15.820 align:middle line:84%
If I look in these
regions, so, if you

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:20.880 align:middle line:84%
like, in the union of
those two intervals, then

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:84%
q sub n, this polynomial,
is converging to 0

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:32.130 align:middle line:84%
uniformly as n goes to infinity
on the union of these two

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.390 align:middle line:90%
intervals.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So what is the picture
of what's going on?

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:84%
What do these q
sub n's look like?

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:44.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.590 align:middle line:90%
So here's minus 1.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Here's 1.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So the first one it looks
like some constant times 1

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.070 align:middle line:90%
minus x squared.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:58.590 align:middle line:90%
So there's the first one.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, as n keeps
getting bigger and bigger,

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.030 align:middle line:84%
this is 0 at higher and
higher order at 1 and minus 1,

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and getting pretty
small near here.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, according to three,
if I take any interval around 0

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and look outside of it,
as n goes to infinity,

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
q sub n in is going
to 0 uniformly.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So what it should look like
is, maybe the next one,

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.860 align:middle line:90%
it's like that.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And then further
still, like that.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So that if I look inside
over here, or over here,

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.500 align:middle line:90%
q sub n is going to 0 uniformly.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So what you should think
of is that the q sub

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.370 align:middle line:84%
n's as n goes to infinity is
something like a direct delta

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.635 align:middle line:84%
function, which is not
exactly a function.

00:42:56.635 --> 00:43:00.560 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So again, so let me
re-emphasize that--

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.920 align:middle line:90%
and this is in quotes--

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:37.980 align:middle line:84%
you should think of q sub n acts
like delta function centered

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.438 align:middle line:90%
at x equals 0.

00:43:40.438 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's in quotes,
because that is meaningless.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But some of you
who've taken physics

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:84%
know what the properties
are of a delta function.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And the integral is 1, it's
somehow 0 everywhere away

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.180 align:middle line:90%
except for the origin.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's infinite there.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:57.600 align:middle line:90%
But somehow, it's integral 1.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:05.820 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So these q sub n's
will show a form,

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.510 align:middle line:84%
an approximation to the
identity in a certain sense.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:14.235 align:middle line:90%
But let me-- let's prove these.

00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:19.210 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's prove the only
non-trivial one, which is three.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Number one and two are clear
based on how they're defined.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's first estimate
how big is this.

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So this constant c
sub n, we don't really

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.270 align:middle line:90%
know what it is explicitly.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But let's compute at
least a rough size of it.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:53.101 align:middle line:84%
So and then, we'll use this
to prove the third part.

00:44:53.101 --> 00:45:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have for all N
and natural number,

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:10.850 align:middle line:84%
the following inequality in xn
minus 1, 1, 1 minus x squared

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:13.130 align:middle line:84%
raised to the n, this
is greater than or equal

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:18.050 align:middle line:90%
to 1 minus nx squared.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Now this, if it's not--

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.850 align:middle line:90%
so it shouldn't be like--

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:84%
hit you in the face
clear why this is true.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But one way you can
prove it is that if you

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:33.780 align:middle line:84%
look at the function g of x
equals 1 minus x squared n.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So first off, this
inequality is even in x.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if x
is negative or positive.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.085 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at this function.

00:45:41.085 --> 00:45:49.980 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.755 align:middle line:90%
On 0, 1, then what's the point?

00:45:52.755 --> 00:45:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:90%
I look at g of 0, this is 0.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And if I compute
g prime of x, this

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is equal to n times
2x times what?

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Times 1 minus 1 minus x
squared to the n minus 1.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is always less
than or equal to 1,

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.280 align:middle line:90%
this thing in parentheses.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is always bigger
than or equal to 0 on 0, 1.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So on 0, 1, this
function is increasing.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And its value at 0's 0.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:44.395 align:middle line:84%
So we get that, which is
exactly what we wanted to prove.

00:46:44.395 --> 00:46:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So now we compute
the size of c sub n.

00:46:55.670 --> 00:47:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So to do that, let me
look at 1 over c sub n.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.400 align:middle line:84%
If I want an upper
bound on c sub n,

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I need to prove a lower
bound on 1 over c sub n.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's take 1 over c sub n
and find a lower bound for it.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the integral
from minus 1 to 1.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So 1 minus x squared
raised to the n, dx.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't remember if I made
this a homework problem or not.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But for even functions
integrating over an interval

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.030 align:middle line:90%
even with respect to the origin.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.508 align:middle line:90%
This is just twice--

00:47:33.508 --> 00:47:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure you
remember this from calculus.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:38.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not hard to
prove with what we

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.800 align:middle line:84%
know of the change
of variables formula

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and so on, that this is equal to
twice times the integral from 0

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:47.240 align:middle line:84%
to 1 of 1 minus x
squared raised at the n.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is bigger
than or equal to 2 times

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:84%
if I integrate to
a certain point.

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.280 align:middle line:84%
This certain point
is chosen so that I

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:03.053 align:middle line:84%
get a result in the end
that's pretty, essentially.

00:48:03.053 --> 00:48:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where
I replace this

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:23.790 align:middle line:84%
by the smaller thing,
which is easy to integrate.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is greater
than or equal to 2,

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:84%
integral 0 1 over root
n, 1 minus nx squared dx.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And I leave it to you to
verify that with this choice

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:48.120 align:middle line:84%
of the endpoint what I get is
4 over 3 root n, 1 over root n.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, so and this
is bigger than 1 over root n.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So I started with
1 over c sub n.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And I showed that it was
bigger than 1 over root n.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, c sub n
is less than 1 over--

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.240 align:middle line:84%
is c sub n is less than
the square root of n.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:23.567 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll use this to
compute what we want.

00:49:23.567 --> 00:49:25.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I mean, we
really just needed

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:31.900 align:middle line:84%
to show that c sub n is bounded
by some polynomial in n.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.730 align:middle line:90%
But this will suffice.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:37.110 align:middle line:90%
So we now want to show--

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.240 align:middle line:90%
so let delta be positive.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.650 align:middle line:84%
We now want to show that Q7 q
sub n converges uniformly to 0

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:54.345 align:middle line:84%
on that set where the
absolute value of x

00:49:54.345 --> 00:49:56.845 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to 1 is
bigger than or equal to delta.

00:49:56.845 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:90%


00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, we note that the following
sequence converges to 0,

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that square root of n
times 1 minus delta squared

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:15.590 align:middle line:90%
raised to the n.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.095 align:middle line:84%
So we should also
put deltas in 0, 1.

00:50:18.095 --> 00:50:26.970 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So this sequence here converges
to 0 as n goes to infinity.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Now intuitively, why is this?

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:41.140 align:middle line:84%
This is because this is
some number less than 1

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.990 align:middle line:90%
raised to the n-th power.

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Exponential always beats just
a polynomial or a power of n.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.460 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see
exactly why this is,

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.790 align:middle line:84%
we could compute
the limit as n goes

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:06.450 align:middle line:84%
to infinity of this sequence
raised to 1 over n power.

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Then this is equal
to the limit as n

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:15.480 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of n
to the 1 over n 1/2,

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.180 align:middle line:90%
1 minus delta squared.

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And this converges to 1.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:20.440 align:middle line:90%
We proved that.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, this equals 1
minus delta squared,

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.420 align:middle line:90%
which is less than 1.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have this theorem
from our section on sequences

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that says, if this
limit is less than 1,

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
then the thing here
converges to 0.

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Or you could interpret
this as saying

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:45.480 align:middle line:84%
that the series with this as
the individual terms converges.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the individual
terms have to converge to 0.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:52:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So which implies limit as n
goes to infinity equals 0.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.100 align:middle line:90%
So now we have this.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And once we have this,
we'll have what we want.

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So we want to prove uniform
convergence on that set.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.800 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.710 align:middle line:90%


00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Then since this
sequence converges to 0,

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:27.250 align:middle line:84%
there exists in M
a natural number,

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:32.440 align:middle line:84%
so that for all n bigger than
or equal to M, square root of n

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:36.160 align:middle line:84%
times 1 minus delta
squared raised to the n

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.470 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And for all n bigger
than or equal to M,

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:51.250 align:middle line:84%
for all x so that delta
is between less than 1,

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:58.090 align:middle line:84%
we get that q sub n,
so it's non-negative

00:52:58.090 --> 00:52:59.470 align:middle line:90%
minus 0 in absolute value.

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:06.360 align:middle line:84%
That's just q sub n
of x raised to the n.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:09.570 align:middle line:84%
This is less than or equal
to the square root of n.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:10.740 align:middle line:90%
That's for this guy.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:15.720 align:middle line:84%
1 minus x squared,
this is getting smaller

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.790 align:middle line:90%
as I get closer to 1.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:19.710 align:middle line:90%
So its biggest at delta.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.660 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.095 align:middle line:84%
And how we chose M is,
this is less than epsilon.

00:53:27.095 --> 00:53:36.080 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're ready for the
proof of the Weierstrass

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:42.940 align:middle line:90%
approximation theorem.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:55.930 align:middle line:90%


00:53:55.930 --> 00:54:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So suppose f is continuous
function on 0, 1.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:07.165 align:middle line:84%
f of 0 equals 0,
f of 1 equals 0.

00:54:07.165 --> 00:54:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:25.307 align:middle line:84%
So this polynomial here
is very concentrated at 0.

00:54:25.307 --> 00:54:28.650 align:middle line:90%


00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:32.430 align:middle line:90%
So well first off, suppose f--

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:33.610 align:middle line:90%
and it's continuous here.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can check
that if it's 0 there,

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and I extend it to
be 0 outside of 0, 1,

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.450 align:middle line:84%
this is still a
continuous function.

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm just defining it
this way because I

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:55.550 align:middle line:84%
want to write certain
symbols in a little bit

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:59.010 align:middle line:84%
without specifying exactly where
the bounds of the integration

00:54:59.010 --> 00:54:59.510 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:02.350 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So we extend f by
0 outside of 0, 1.

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And this function f
is continuous function

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:22.240 align:middle line:90%
on the real number line.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:29.840 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So we define-- now
we're going to define

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:37.350 align:middle line:84%
this polynomial, sequence
of polynomials, p sub n.

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:40.370 align:middle line:90%


00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:45.760 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be equal
to the integral from 0 to 1

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:52.690 align:middle line:84%
f of t times q sub
n of t minus x, dt.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And just to remind you, this
is equal to the integral

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:58.930 align:middle line:84%
from 0 to 1, of f
of t times c sub

00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:07.140 align:middle line:84%
n, 1 minus x minus t
squared raised to the n, dt.

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is just c sub
n times this thing.

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.550 align:middle line:84%
If you expand everything
out, is just a--

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:21.350 align:middle line:90%


00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:24.290 align:middle line:84%
using the binomial theorem,
this is equal to j equals--

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:29.575 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.575 --> 00:56:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
put a sum here,

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:37.760 align:middle line:84%
meaning a finite sum, of
some numbers a sub j, n times

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:43.050 align:middle line:90%
x to the j, times t to the--

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:51.040 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:59.220 align:middle line:84%
well, just some finite numbers
a jk, times x the j, t to the k.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:00.810 align:middle line:84%
All I'm saying is,
if you expand this

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:02.790 align:middle line:84%
out using the
binomial theorem, you

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:06.275 align:middle line:84%
get this theorem, this
polynomial and x sub j,

00:57:06.275 --> 00:57:08.190 align:middle line:90%
t sub k.

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, this is getting
integrated against f of t dt.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.578 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is in
fact a polynomial.

00:57:19.578 --> 00:57:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you--

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:24.570 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:29.400 align:middle line:84%
so let's write this
out and be precise,

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.670 align:middle line:84%
just so that you're convinced
that it's a polynomial.

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:36.060 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to 1 of f of t times

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.080 align:middle line:90%
c sub n.

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Now we use the binomial theorem.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:46.925 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to j 0
to n, and choose j.

00:57:46.925 --> 00:57:51.320 align:middle line:90%


00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, minus
x minus t squared

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.990 align:middle line:90%
raised to the n minus j.

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Or I could put j, 2j.

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:19.590 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, det. I'm
not sure if this

00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:25.360 align:middle line:90%
is even helping or anything.

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:29.470 align:middle line:84%
But just so that you see this
is actually a polynomial.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:34.300 align:middle line:84%
f of t, c sub n, sum
from j equals 0 to n.

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And now, sum from k equals
0 to 2j, n choose j minus 1

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:42.490 align:middle line:90%
to the j.

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, 2j choose k minus t to
the k times x to the j minus k.

00:58:56.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:middle line:90%


00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.480 align:middle line:90%
And then, dt.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So I have all this
junk integrated dt,

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and then this is x
to the 2j minus k.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:10.800 align:middle line:90%
So that just pops out.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.780 align:middle line:90%
So this is a polynomial.

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a polynomial.

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But then, when it
integrates against f of t,

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.120 align:middle line:84%
this x to the 2j minus k
comes out of the integral.

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.930 align:middle line:90%
And I get that times just all--

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:28.930 align:middle line:84%
this becomes a sum of terms
with x to the 2j minus

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:33.640 align:middle line:84%
k outside this integral,
times f of t, times

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.420 align:middle line:84%
integrated against
minus 2 to the k.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I think I said more
than I needed to there,

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:46.150 align:middle line:84%
but so the point is p sub
n of x is a polynomial.

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can write this
slightly differently.

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:56.440 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So piece sub n of x, this is
equal to just as it was before.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Now this, we change
variables and is equal to--

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.750 align:middle line:90%


01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:18.190 align:middle line:84%
so we do a u substitution now,
where u is equal to x minus t.

01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to change the dt.

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I did here was
a change of variables.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:43.630 align:middle line:90%


01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:47.860 align:middle line:84%
By setting u is
equal to x minus t.

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Or I guess, if you'd
like, t minus x.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.150 align:middle line:90%


01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, I just
recalled-- and then

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.780 align:middle line:90%
I just called ut then again.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%


01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm eventually looking
at these polynomials only

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.490 align:middle line:90%
in the interval 0, 1.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:16.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is what it looks like.

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But now, this f
of x plus t, for t

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
between minus x
and 1 minus x, it's

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:29.930 align:middle line:90%
actually 0 outside of that.

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So I can extend the
integration to minus 1 and 1.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, with the understanding
that I've extended

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:46.220 align:middle line:90%
f to be 0 outside of 0, 1.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.720 align:middle line:90%


01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:59.300 align:middle line:90%
So since fy equals 0--

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.490 align:middle line:90%
or let me write it this way.

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Since f of x plus t equals 0 for
t not n minus x and 1 minus x.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:14.780 align:middle line:90%


01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So that was a lot of
explaining for some stuff.

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But here, let me
get to the point.

01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:25.190 align:middle line:90%
What is p sub n really?

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So why should you expect
this to converge to f?

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.510 align:middle line:90%
So this is a little discussion.

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:36.500 align:middle line:90%


01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So I said that--

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is for those
who understood my comment

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.680 align:middle line:90%
about delta functions.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.420 align:middle line:90%


01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
In q sub n is very concentrated
at 0, at t equals 0.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So this, you should think
of as being approximately

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:07.478 align:middle line:90%
like a delta function at t.

01:03:07.478 --> 01:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what delta
function is or never heard

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
of it, then forget the
rest of this remark.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.830 align:middle line:90%
But and then I'll say something.

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So q sub n kind of looks
like a delta function.

01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, minus 1
of x plus t qn of t dt

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
should look more and more like
f of x plus t delta of t dt.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And what we know about
direct delta functions is

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that when you integrate
them against a function,

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:48.555 align:middle line:84%
you just pick up the function
evaluated at 0, which is--

01:03:48.555 --> 01:03:54.700 align:middle line:90%


01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
why you expect it.

01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look back at
this picture of what the qn's

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
are looking like, they are
concentrating more and more

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.120 align:middle line:90%
at 0.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So all of the contribution
to this integral

01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
here, which defines these
polynomials, is happening at t

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%
equals 0.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.335 align:middle line:84%
At t equals 0, I
just pick up f of x.

01:04:20.335 --> 01:04:23.040 align:middle line:90%


01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you
should kind of expect

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
these polynomials to converge
back to the function.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.663 align:middle line:90%


01:04:37.663 --> 01:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think I can
finish on this board.

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:53.135 align:middle line:90%


01:04:53.135 --> 01:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is a picture you should
have seared in your mind.

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what the q
sub n's look like,

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
that they're concentrating
all of their mass right

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:02.460 align:middle line:90%
at the origin.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I should just
pick up f at the point x.

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
since this is concentrating
at the origin, t equals 0,

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I should just pick
up f of x plus t at t

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:16.440 align:middle line:90%
equals 0, which is f of x.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.560 align:middle line:90%


01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And why f of x plus t, not some
constant times f of x plus t,

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that's because the
integral of q sub n's is 1.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:30.040 align:middle line:90%


01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's prove that the
pn's converge to f uniformly.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:54.740 align:middle line:90%


01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.450 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

01:05:56.450 --> 01:06:00.630 align:middle line:90%


01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Since f is a continuous
function on a closed and bounded

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:09.240 align:middle line:84%
interval, we know that
it's uniformly continuous.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:16.620 align:middle line:90%


01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, there exists
delta positive such that--

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:25.215 align:middle line:90%


01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:26.340 align:middle line:90%
how am I writing this here?

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:32.050 align:middle line:90%


01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Such that if-- let's write
it this way-- for all y,

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
so that z minus y
less than delta,

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
we get that f of z
minus f of y is--

01:06:48.220 --> 01:07:01.730 align:middle line:90%


01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:02.910 align:middle line:90%
actually, we don't need--

01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:03.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, we don't
need so much of about f.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.110 align:middle line:90%
But we'll go with this anyways.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.980 align:middle line:90%


01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.510 align:middle line:90%
We really just know--

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, never mind.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll stop.

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So we know that f is
uniformly continuous

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
so there exists a delta,
so that I have this.

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so less than
epsilon over 2.

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So z and y are within
delta to each other.

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Then f of z and f of y, no
matter what z and y are,

01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:39.330 align:middle line:84%
are within epsilon
over 2 of each other.

01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, since f is continuous, it
has a maximum on this interval.

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, I should say, since
f is a continuous function,

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
it has both a max and
a min on this interval.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:16.899 align:middle line:84%
And m there exist some
number c such that f of x

01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is bounded by c
for all x in 0, 1.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:24.760 align:middle line:90%


01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So now I have this delta coming
from the uniform continuity

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.140 align:middle line:90%
of f.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I have this c
coming from the fact

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:32.689 align:middle line:84%
that it's bounded
on this interval.

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:36.069 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going to choose my
M for the uniform convergence

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:38.020 align:middle line:84%
of the polynomials
just depending

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.590 align:middle line:90%
on these pieces of input.

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:50.689 align:middle line:84%
Then as we showed, since
square root of n 1 minus delta

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
squared and converges
to 0, this implies

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.939 align:middle line:84%
there exists an M
natural number so

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
that for all n bigger
than or equal to M,

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.859 align:middle line:84%
I get that square root of n
1 minus delta squared raised

01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:17.395 align:middle line:84%
to the n is less
than epsilon over 8c.

01:09:17.395 --> 01:09:24.109 align:middle line:90%


01:09:24.109 --> 01:09:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I claim this M works.

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:29.240 align:middle line:84%
That for all n bigger than or
equal to M, for all x in 0, 1,

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.489 align:middle line:90%
pn minus f is less than epsilon.

01:09:31.489 --> 01:09:36.040 align:middle line:90%


01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And for all n bigger than or
equal to M, for all x in 0,

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
1, if we look at p sub
n of x minus f of x,

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going to use
that this thing is

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
an approximation
to the identity,

01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's essentially
that it satisfies those three

01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:07.060 align:middle line:84%
properties that I
wrote a minute ago.

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to
integral from minus 1 to 1

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:21.720 align:middle line:84%
of f of x plus t times
qn of t dt minus f of x.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.070 align:middle line:90%


01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
What's the integral from
minus 1 to 1 of qn sub t?

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:29.150 align:middle line:90%
That's equal to 1.

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:31.920 align:middle line:90%
So f of x is at times--

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
so this is-- all of
analysis is writing

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.840 align:middle line:90%
1 or 0 in a certain way.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Not all, but-- so I can write
this as f of x plus t now

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:53.660 align:middle line:90%
minus f of x times qn of t, dt.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, because the integral
of q sub n of t equals 1.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So again, if you just expand
this out, this is f of x.

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm integrating
with respect to t.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
So I just pick up
what I had before.

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:08.263 align:middle line:90%


01:11:08.263 --> 01:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the triangle
inequality for integrals,

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.510 align:middle line:84%
this is less than or equal to
the integral for minus 1 to 1

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:20.205 align:middle line:84%
of f of x plus t minus f of x
times the absolute value of q

01:11:20.205 --> 01:11:21.010 align:middle line:90%
sub n of t.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But since q sub n of
t is not negative,

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:29.710 align:middle line:90%
that's just q sub n of t.

01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:33.085 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going to split
this integral up into two parts.

01:11:33.085 --> 01:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%


01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to
a part where t is

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.420 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal
to-- so should

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
minus delta, delta
f of x plus t,

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
minus f of x, q sub n of t dt.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And then plus the other
part, which I can write as--

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:10.260 align:middle line:84%
so it's a union of the two
intervals now away from delta

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.240 align:middle line:90%
out to 1.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's the sum of the integral
over these two intervals, which

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write
as the integral over

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
delta less than or equal to
t is less than or equal to 1.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:32.800 align:middle line:90%
And times qn of t.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.970 align:middle line:90%


01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, t is between
minus delta and delta.

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, x plus t
minus x in absolute value

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.460 align:middle line:90%
is less than delta.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.980 align:middle line:90%


01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So in this integral
here, I want to note

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that if t is in this interval
here, x plus t minus x equals

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
t is less than
delta in this here.

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So since this guy minus
this guy is less than delta

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
in absolute value, I can use
this uniform continuity part

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
to say that this is less than
epsilon over 2qn of t dt.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:32.620 align:middle line:90%


01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Plus now the absolute value
of this guy is less than--

01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
by the triangle inequality-- is
less than or equal to the sum

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of the absolute values, which
is less than or equal to c--

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:44.380 align:middle line:90%
2c.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:50.630 align:middle line:90%
So 1, and then 2c.

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:54.430 align:middle line:90%


01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.975 align:middle line:84%
Because that's bounded by
c, that's bounded by c.

01:13:56.975 --> 01:13:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So the absolute value
of the difference

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the sum
of the absolute values, which

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is bounded by each of
those bounded by c.

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:08.560 align:middle line:90%


01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is less than
epsilon over 2 integral

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
from, if I just integrate the
whole thing, from minus 1 to 1,

01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:19.240 align:middle line:90%
that just gives me 1.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Plus 2c times qn of t.

01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:30.500 align:middle line:84%
On this interval is, again, so
I shouldn't put a delta there.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
2c, c sub n, 1 minus delta
squared raised to the n, dt.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:48.940 align:middle line:90%
And so there's no t here.

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal
to epsilon over 2,

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.505 align:middle line:84%
because this integral
is 1 plus this--

01:14:56.505 --> 01:15:00.740 align:middle line:90%


01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.430 align:middle line:84%
c sub n, remember, is less
than the square root of n times

01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
1 minus delta squared
and times the integral

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.950 align:middle line:84%
over this region dt,
which I can make bigger

01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:11.750 align:middle line:90%
by going from minus 1 to 1.

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:12.890 align:middle line:90%
It gives me 2.

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is equal
to epsilon over

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
2 plus 4c square root of
n, 1 minus delta squared n.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is less than epsilon
over 2, plus epsilon over 2,

01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:27.710 align:middle line:90%
equals epsilon.

01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I think I have one
minute to spare.

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:34.872 align:middle line:84%
So this was quite an experience
teaching to an empty room.

01:15:34.872 --> 01:15:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I hope you did get
something out of this class.

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:39.390 align:middle line:90%


01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I wasn't
able to meet a lot of you.

01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the best
parts about teaching and being

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:50.240 align:middle line:84%
able to see you grasp in real
time what I'm talking about.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully this
nightmare will end soon,

01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get to see
each other in the future.

01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:06.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.970
PROFESSOR: So our example
is a well-known one.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.700
But it's important
to understand it.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.760
And it's a good example.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.980
It's a familiar one.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.380
It's the hydrogen
molecule ionized.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.820
And we spoke a little
about it last time.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.240
So let's do that now.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.990
So H2 plus, hydrogen ion.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.540
So what is this system?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:53.125
Well, it is two protons
sharing one electron.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.300
That's basically it.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:10.065
It's the fact that if you
have a hydrogen atom--

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:26.170
this is hydrogen-- you
could bring another proton

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.220
and form a bound state.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.550
That's an important thing
in order to think about it--

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.090
you see, you can ask
what is the bound state

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.880
energy of your system?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.370
It's the energy you need
to dissociate your system.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.220
But this system, if
you have two protons--

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.440
proton, proton--
and one electron,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.020
it can be dissociated
in many ways.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.190
It can be dissociated by
just totally separating

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.410
it and destroying it.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.180
But it can be
dissociated or liberated

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.950
by just removing the proton.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.860
So this is already
a bound state.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.450
So if you think of
energies, you have

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.620
the bound state the energy of
hydrogen here, hydrogen itself,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.420
and the H2 ion--

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.050
H2 plus-- must be lower
because you could imagine

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.670
taking the proton out and
somehow this system is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.480
a configuration in which
this proton is captured here.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.630
So you should get lower energy
than the hydrogen atom energy.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.480
So that's the hydrogen ion.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.620
And that should be
still more energy

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.200
than if you bring
another electron, which

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.740
is the H2 molecule.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.000
You bring another electron.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.890
This should bind this
and the other electron

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.910
and lower its energy even more.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.800
So how does one solve
for this hydrogen ion?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.090
Well, as we discussed, you first
solve for the electronic wave

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.305
function when the protons
are separated at distance r.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.960
So we said fix the lattice.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.860
So here it is.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.810
The lattice is fixed.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.860
It's a separation
capital R. And now

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.290
I'm supposed to find the
electron wave function.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.010
Easy?

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.720
No.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.150
It already is hard.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.920
We spent several lectures--
you've been studying this three

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.760
times already, maybe, in quantum
mechanics, the hydrogen atom,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.980
one proton, one electron.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.590
To protons, one
electron is much harder.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.530
I don't think there's a simple
analytical way to solve it.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.490
So already at this step we
have trouble solving it.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.959
What is the electron,
Hamiltonian in this case?

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.410
The electron Hamiltonian
is just one Laplacian here

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:34.710
minus h squared over 2m
for the electron variable,

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.270
and then the potential
that is the interactions

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.830
of the electron
with the two nuclei.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:52.250
So if we call this distance
r1 and this distance r2,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.860
that is the whole
electron Hamiltonian.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.100
Now, don't think of
r1 and r2 as you have

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.260
two variables, two positions.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.680
No, there is just one position.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.340
The dynamical variables
for this electron, this p

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.820
and r for this electron--

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.570
r is the position
of the electron.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.770
It happens to be that
r is equal to r1.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.350
And if you know--
so r1 is really

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.310
the length of r, the
position of the electron.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.870
And r2 is the
length of capital R,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.720
if we wish, all the
way here, minus r.

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.145
r is the vector here, as well.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.230
So there is r1 and
r2, but it's not

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.750
two electrons or two variables.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.860
It's just two distances that
depend on the single position

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.030
of the electron.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.385
And this is the momentum
operator of the electron.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.360
OK, so you can't solve this.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.250
That's life.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.960
It can't be solved.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.430
But we can do something and we
can do something variational.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.560
We can try to find some
kind of approximation

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.900
for the state of
electrons and use that.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.750
So there is an
[INAUDIBLE] that you

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.990
could try, a variational
wave function,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.430
for even the electron.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.310
You see, in our argument
in this lecture,

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.260
we did the variation
and approximation

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.470
for the nuclear degrees of
freedom or for that thing.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.310
But even for the electron wave
function, I can't solve them.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.240
So I have to do a
variational method.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.510
Now, these variational
methods have

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.690
become extremely sophisticated.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.670
People do this with a
series of Eigenfunctions

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:09.190
and find answers that converge
with 15 digits accuracy.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.610
It's just unbelievable what
people can do by now with this.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.320
It's a very nice
and developed field.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.030
But we'll do a
baby version of it.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.610
So this baby version
is going to stay.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.030
My wave function
for the electron

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:33.840
as a function of position and
as a function of the separation

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.660
is going to be simple.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.355
It's going to be a sum of
ground state wave functions.

00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:40.270
It's going to be a number--

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.670
a, that's just a number--

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.960
times the ground
state wave function

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.430
based on the first proton
plus the ground state wave

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.910
function based on
the second proton.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:04.100
So these psis, or psi0 of r is
the ground state wave function

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:12.140
of hydrogen pi a 0 cubed
e to the minus r over a0.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.450
This is called-- people
have given it a name,

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.930
even though it's--

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.130
you would say it's not that
original to put some wave

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.240
function like that.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.350
This is a simple approximation.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:40.700
And the technique is
called LCAO technique.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:56.140
And this calls for Linear
Combination of Atomic Orbitals.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.800
A big name for a
rather simple thing.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:15.150
It has some nice things
about this wave function.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:20.630
This system is invariant.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.790
This molecule is invariant.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:31.880
And they're taking a reflection
around this thing changing

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.270
the first proton and
the second proton.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.900
So that's the symmetry
of your Hamiltonian.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.700
And it's the symmetry
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.970
with the Hamiltonian.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.290
So you can demand that your wave
functions have that symmetry.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.905
And this is nice here because
if you change r1 and r2,

00:09:52.905 --> 00:09:55.560
the wave function is invariant.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:03.720
So that's a very nice thing
about this wave function.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.110
It shows-- you see, you can
put in the variational method

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.960
anything and it will still
give you some answer.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.180
But if you put something
that mimics the real wave

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.170
functions and the real wave
function of this system

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.140
is going to have a symmetry
under the exchange of the two

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.830
protons.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.310
They're identical.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.850
So this lattice that you've
created has a symmetry.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:30.100
So the electron configuration
has to respect that symmetry.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.410
So that's very nice.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.340
Now, this is electronic
wave function.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:41.050
So I ask you, is this
wave function better

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.000
where the protons are far
away or when the protons

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.220
are very close to each other?

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.680
Give you a minute
to think about it.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.370
When is this approximation
or this wave function better?

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.070
If the distance
between the protons

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.310
is very little or the
distance between the protons

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.210
is very large?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.470
You're right in that when
the two things collapse,

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.850
this looks like a
true wave function

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.430
because this is a
solution when there's

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.070
a single nucleus and
a single electron.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.150
But this is the
solution for hydrogen.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.830
And it gives you the
ground state of hydrogen.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.900
But when the two
protons collapse,

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.630
it has become helium nucleus.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.160
It has two protons.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.780
So it doesn't have
the right decay rate.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.480
It doesn't have the
right Born radius.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.640
On the other hand,
when they're far apart,

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.080
it does have the right thing.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.240
So this is very good.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.750
It's excellent when the
things are far away.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.500
But it's not great when
they're close together.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.040
So here you go.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.590
You have to normalize
this wave function.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.320
Even that takes some effort.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.360
It turns out that the value
of a for normalization--

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:21.360
the value of a is 1 over
2 1 plus a constant i.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.350
And that constant i is
e to the minus capital

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:35.360
R over a not times 1 plus
r over a not plus 1/3

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.330
of r over a not squared.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.140
Wow, so very funny.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.120
It's not so easy to even
calculate the normalization

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.180
of this thing.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.830
But that's the normalization.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.810
And then recall that
what we have to do

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:07.370
is just put the electronic
Hamiltonian inside this wave

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.550
function, this phi of r.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.940
And this is going to
give us an energy which

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:22.080
is approximately the electronic
energy as a function of r.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:28.010
So you have to evaluate
the Hamiltonian--

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.400
I'm sorry, that
Hamiltonian there--

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.280
should have a square here.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.790
And now we evaluate this.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.250
We have to go even
more into gross

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:53.900
and get what is the
potential energy contributed

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.060
by the electronic cloud.

00:14:03.038 --> 00:14:08.580
So here is the
function that you get.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:16.230
So our plot here I'll call--

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.800
this calls for a
variable x, which

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.990
is going to be the
separation divided by a not.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.100
This is the separation between
the protons divided by a not.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.660
So here is going to be
the electronic energy

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.160
as a function of x.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.225
And here is x.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.210
And all right.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:51.520
So as x goes to 0,
means the nuclei

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.480
are going on top of each other.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.760
That's the place where the wave
function is not all that great.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.040
And that's not so good.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:07.980
It turns out that here
you get minus 3 Rydbergs.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:14.360
Remember, the Rydberg was
e squared over 2 a not.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.890
And it's about 13.6 ev.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.620
It's just the ground state
energy of the hydrogen.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:29.130
You do get that the energy due
to the electronic configuration

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.980
is negative and it
goes to this value.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.670
And then it starts to grow
quadratically and goes up.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:44.010
And I want to know, in
your opinion, what's

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.910
going to be the next asymptote?

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.560
So what is it going to
asymptote as x goes to infinity?

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.880
Let let's make the analogy.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.870
The right answer is it
actually stops here.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:10.450
And you'll remember this problem
that you've solved many times,

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.160
probably.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.340
If you have a--

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.400
suppose a square well.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.460
You have a wave function
that is like that.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.670
Now, if you have two
square well-- and it

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.080
has a ground state energy.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.960
If you have two square
wells like that and you ask,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.740
what is the ground state energy?

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.550
The ground state energy is
roughly equal to the ground

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.180
state energy for a single
square well because what happens

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:46.240
is that the wave function
goes like that and then like--

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.060
well, actually, like that.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.210
So yes, the wave function
spends equal time.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.730
But it's the same
energy as if there

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.950
would be a single square well.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.090
So here it is.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:04.511
The protons are very far away in
the symmetric state, the ground

00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:05.010
state.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:09.480
The electron is half the times
here, half the times there.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.940
But the energy is
the same energy

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.400
as if it would be in either one.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.760
So this is an intuition that
you may have from 804 or 805.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.599
So here it is.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.940
That's what it does.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.589
That's good.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:34.410
In fact, if you ride the
ee of x over Rydbergs,

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:39.390
it behaves here
like minus 3 plus x

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.710
squared plus dot, dot, dot.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.520
So it starts growing
and then asymptotes

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.080
with an exponential there.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:54.260
OK, but what did we say was the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation

00:17:54.260 --> 00:18:03.255
was the idea that then you have
dynamics of the nuclei based

00:18:03.255 --> 00:18:03.755
on--

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:13.470
so Born-Oppenheimer tells
you that the Hamiltonian

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:20.010
for the nuclear degrees
of freedom is given by h.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:26.160
This h effective is
capital P over 2m squared

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.440
plus the nuclear
nuclear potential,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.610
plus this electronic energy.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.750
So this electronic energy
we already calculated.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.530
The nuclear nuclear
potential, in this case,

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:55.530
is the proton proton potential,
v m n is e squared over r.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.740
It is repulsive.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.370
You see, this-- if you wanted to
minimize the electronic energy,

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.650
you still don't get anything.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.420
You get a system that
collapses to zero.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.450
That's certainly
not the molecule.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:21.240
But this n n is this, so we can
write it as e squared over 2a0

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:27.810
and then put a 2 over
r over a 0 to get

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.890
all these numbers nicely.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:36.720
So the nvv is a
Rydberg times 2 over x.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:46.680
So in terms of x there,
vnn is a 2 over x--

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:54.560
oops-- a 2 over x
potential like that.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.720
So now you have the possibility
of getting a stable grounding,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.260
so the potential
for the nucleons.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.210
So the total potential
for the nucleons

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.520
is the sum of these
two potentials.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.240
And how does it look?

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.050
Well, some of the
two potential--

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:33.370
so ee of x plus vnn of x.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:41.310
Let's divide by Rydberg
as a function of x, goes--

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.950
here is minus 1.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.990
And it goes more or less like--

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.660
OK.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.910
Let me try to get this right.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:58.490
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.620
OK.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:15.630
It goes up here, down,
crosses the minus 1 line,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:22.571
and moves to a minimum here.

00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:26.680
And then it goes like that.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.250
Pretty much it's
something like that.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:33.820
It's a rather little
quadratic minimum.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.800
It's rather flat.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.970
And these are the
numbers you care for.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.920
This is the minimum.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.350
Maybe it doesn't look like
that in my graph too well.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:49.000
But it's a very flat minimum.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:59.340
And r over a0 at the
minimum is, in fact, 2.49.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:19.680
And e over Rydberg at the
minimum is minus 1.297.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.540
Those are results.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.220
Now, you have a potential.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.710
You could calculate
the quadratic term

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.790
around the potential.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:31.020
And then you get an approximate
oscillation Hamiltonian

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.050
that those would be
the nuclear vibrations.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.760
You could calculate
the frequency

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.580
of the nuclear
vibrations and the energy

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.170
of the nuclear vibration.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.080
It's a very simple
but nice model.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.180
You can calculate everything
pretty much about this molecule

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.920
and compare with experiments.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.450
So how does it do the
comparison with experiment?

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.070
It does OK.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.690
It doesn't do very well.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.670
So let me tell you
what's happening.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:06.630
So again, we do get this system.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.060
Happily, the minimum
was below minus 1.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.270
The minus 1 was the situation
in which you have a hydrogen

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.520
atom and a free proton.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.960
So there is a bound state energy
but the bounds state energy

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:28.450
is not conceptually right to
think of it as this big energy.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.550
It's just this little
part here in which

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.800
this is the extra
binding that you

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.520
can have when you bring a proton
near to the hydrogen atom.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.330
So this extra part--

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.965
so the bound state energy--

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:51.930
I'll write a couple of
words here and we'll stop.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:03.250
The bound state energy is E.
This E that we determined here

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:07.300
at the minimum is
minus 1 Rydberg

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:21.580
minus 0.1297 Rydbergs which is
minus 1 Rydberg minus 1.76 ev.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.340
So this is what you would
call the bound state

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:30.250
energy of this system because
it's the least energy you need

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.410
to start to dissociate it--

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:37.120
not to dissociate it completely,
but to start to dissociate it.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.240
1.76.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:51.070
True value is 2.8
ev, so not great,

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.760
but sort of order of magnitude.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.560
Another thing that
you can ask is,

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:03.100
what is the separation between
the nuclei in this ion?

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.110
How far away are they?

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:11.220
And this gives a prediction
that it's about 2.49 a0.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:24.430
So separation is r equal
2.49 a0, which is 2.49 times

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.910
0.529 angstroms.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.880
It's about 1.32 angstroms.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.600
And through value's 2.8.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:45.600
Experimental value, the
value of r, our experiment

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.550
is not that far.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.590
It's 106 angstroms.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:58.360
So it's 20% there, 25% there.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.750
But it gives you a way to
think about this system.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.190
You get all the physics.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.990
You understand the physics.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.220
The Born-Oppenheimer
physics is that the electron

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:16.770
energy in the fixed lattice is
a potential term for the nuclei.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.150
Added to the nucleus
nucleus repulsion

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.080
gives you the total potential
term for the nuclear degrees

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.620
of freedom.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.810
You can find the
stable situation.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.900
And if you want to do quantum
mechanics and vibrations

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.430
of the nuclei, well, do
the harmonic oscillator

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.460
associated with this thing.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.500
The nice thing is
you can complicate

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.300
these wave functions
a little and get

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.980
better and better answers.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.660
And it's fun.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.570
It's things that can
be done numerically.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.010
And you have a
remarkably powerful tool

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.050
to understand these things.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.590
So with this, we'll
close our whole chapter

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.910
in adiabatic physics.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.220
And next time, we will
begin with scattering.

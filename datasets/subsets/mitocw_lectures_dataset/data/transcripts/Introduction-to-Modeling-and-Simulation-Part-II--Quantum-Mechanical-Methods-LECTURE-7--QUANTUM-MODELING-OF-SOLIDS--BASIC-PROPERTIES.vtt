JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
How's everybody doing?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.740
Good?

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.880
Yeah.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.260
I wanted to start
with some inspiration.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.970
And so because I love
videos, and I think

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.955
that's a way of inspiring.

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:47.080
And sometimes I think if
you feel really passionate

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.880
about something, you
can use song and video

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.160
as a way of
conveying your ideas.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.840
I have a good friend, actually,
who's been doing that.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.350
So I want to show you--
anybody heard of Fog and Smog?

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.220
OK.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:11.590
Let's show you this little
video, just a minute of it.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.410
DJ DAVE: What's crazy to
me is like nobody ever

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.570
talks in person anymore.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.580
Like you got Twitter and
Facebook and everybody

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.250
sending text messages.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.920
Like nobody's ever sitting down
like this and just talking.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.000
You know?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.700
For all these technologies,
we're actually further apart.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.710
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.340
Hello?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.140
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: That's
my good friend DJ Dave.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.060
DJ DAVE: (RAPPING) Would you
please put your phone down?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.368
You're not walking straight.

00:01:35.368 --> 00:01:36.790
You're stumbling around.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.738
You're in public, man.

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:40.420
You're being kinda
rude, and text messages

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.860
are not that important.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.318
Excuse me, lady.

00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:44.860
Could you please
put your phone down?

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.300
You're talking too loud,
like nobody's around.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.380
I'm sure you'll find a way
to hear what you have to say.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.702
I don't want to know
that much about your day.

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:54.960
I'm standing on line
at my favorite cafe,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.415
trying to get my coffee,
like I do every single day.

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.790
This dude in front of me
is texting up a storm.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.950
Thumbs moving like
bees in a damn swarm.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.610
I mean, it's none of my business
how you spend your time,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.050
but pay attention, dude.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.370
You're like next in line.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.210
He finally gets to the
counter and is like, um.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.810
I'm like, man,
you're hella dumb.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.102
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: All right.

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:15.602
Anyway.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.340
DJ DAVE: (RAPPING) Could you
you please put your phone down.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.700
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: All right.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.320
So I won't show all the thing.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.990
That's actually a good
family friend, DJ Dave.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.850
I lived in his room for
a year, awesome guy,

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.960
and he's made some
really nice videos.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.530
The point is-- this is not
quantum mechanics related--

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.650
it is a topic near and dear to
my heart as some of you know.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.840
And I'm sure you're all
closing your laptops

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.010
and putting your phones down,
especially after seeing that.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.350
But the point is,
he's passionate.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.860
So what does he do?

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.460
He conveys his passion in song.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.560
Now, if any of you--

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.200
so this is related to
the class-- if any of you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.150
have an idea that
you're passionate about,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.980
like say for your final
project, and you'd

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.740
like to do something
like that, I would really

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.880
be fully supportive.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.750
I tried to-- some of you
may remember my attempts

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.060
to get you to do that in 3012,
and now guess how many people

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.280
actually did that in 3012?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.470
Right, not so many.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.000
But if somebody wants to
take a crack at conveying

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.050
their project in
this format, there's

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.570
got to be a bonus point
or two in that just alone.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.000
Right?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.520
Are any of you are
juniors, junior lab?

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.380
Are you doing that
in Van Vliet's class?

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we
did it last summer.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.513
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:45.670
So I saw some of those, and
I'm like, man, I want that.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.010
I think that's really
creative and cool.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.800
So I see a lot of
really cool stuff.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
I saw a couple of those.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.980
They were really great.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.460
So if anybody wants to do
that, let me know, and I'd

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.110
be happy to support
however I can,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.000
put you in touch with Dave
if you want or whatever.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.710
OK.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.210
All right.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.400
Any questions about
class products?

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.030
So I've been talking to some
of you about the projects,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.450
and if anyone is still
interested, it's not too late.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.610
But we're getting close
to being too late,

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.162
so please, come talk to me.

00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:21.579
If you still want
to do a project,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.780
this would be like the last week
I think to get something going.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.020
What I want to do today
is-- well, before I start,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.870
here's where we are.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.370
OK?

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.160
So what I want to do is
continue on our march.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.200
We talked about atoms
to solids, laid a little

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.950
of the groundwork.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.520
We'll review some of that and
then go onto some of the things

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.070
you can do once
you model solids.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.020
I want to do some
calculations, assuming

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.880
that it works, using the
nanoHUB interactively together.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.610
Because again, there is nothing
like calculating the behavior

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.300
of electrons with friends.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.460
There's no better way to
create a good group dynamics

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.510
and interactions.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.850
Computing has the
nuts and bolts,

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.110
a lot of which we're talking
about, some of which were not,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.530
and then it has sort
of the philosophy.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.190
Right?

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.580
And I really tend to agree
with some of the things

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.500
that people have said over the
years on how to use computing.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.000
And so I just want
to bring this in,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.720
and I'll come back to this
at the end of the term

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.930
a little bit more.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.830
But Richard Hamming had a number
of very interesting things

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.100
to say about research
and about computing.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.110
The purpose of computing
is insight not numbers.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.610
Right?

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.560
So the computation is only
as good as your creativity

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.920
and your thinking on both sides,
what you put into the computer

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.290
and what you get out.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.837
He also said what are the
most important problems

00:06:01.837 --> 00:06:02.420
in your field?

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.800
Are you working on one of them?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.150
Why not?

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:12.222
I love that, and that's very
much an MIT ecosystem way,

00:06:12.222 --> 00:06:13.430
but it's not true everywhere.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.140
But we should always
remind ourselves,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.410
even if I solve this problem--

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.160
so I'd say, my problem
is I want to change

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.530
the bandgap of silicon
from indirect to direct.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.030
OK?

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.010
I can do that now,
because we've learned how

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.380
to do that using simulation.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.120
So I can probe materials
using a computer.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.210
You should still say, why?

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.490
The point isn't-- you
can't just say, why?

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.380
Well, because it
would be useful.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.770
Or why, well, because it can
make a better solar cell.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.570
That's not enough.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.070
Right?

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.490
It's really how much
impact can you have?

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.400
What is this going to do to the
technology you're working on

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.070
or the science problem
you're trying to answer?

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.500
And taking it those extra
steps goes a long way,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.390
and that applies
to computing, just

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.022
like any other area of research.

00:06:56.022 --> 00:06:57.980
Better to solve the right
problem the wrong way

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.370
than the wrong
problem the right way.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.830
So choosing the problem
that's a related statement.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.760
In research, if you
know what you're doing,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.460
then you shouldn't be doing it.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.160
I like that a lot,
and that's where

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.100
computation is a real enabler.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.610
I love experiments too, but I
love the world of computation,

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.200
especially at this scale.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.150
Where you can design--

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.860
within a limited
number of atoms--

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.510
you can design anything.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.090
You can think up
anything and try it.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.660
Right?

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.260
So there's really the phase
space is just enormous,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.840
and you can really
play around and try

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.630
crazy ideas, random thoughts,
and tangents out as you go.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.530
Those are often where the
best creativity happens.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.680
And then this is it.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.180
Right?

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.200
Machines should work.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.910
People should think.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.803
So as you go after this
class, and you come out,

00:07:52.803 --> 00:07:54.970
one of the most important
things to come out of this

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.970
is it's always a balance.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.460
When you do computation,
it's a balance

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.150
between your time and
the computer's time.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.630
And what you'd like
to do is create

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.340
a balance, such
that the computer is

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.460
solving things for you.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.580
And you're spending most of your
time not solving those things,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.330
not wasting your time on things
that the computer could do,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.550
but rather on thinking
about the kind of problem

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.140
that you're going to make it do.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.250
And you'd be surprised how often
in computation this balance

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.840
is not well kept.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.640
OK?

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.100
And how often you might
spend a lot of your time

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.730
actually spinning your
wheels on something

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.620
that the machine
could actually handle.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.480
Right?

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.580
And how much you might
think the machine

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.500
is actually going
to somehow solve

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.640
a problem that actually you
need to think about to solve.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.130
Or how much more quickly you
could solve it, if you just

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.330
thought for an hour.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.640
You might have saved a million
hours of computer time.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.250
Right?

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.350
Seriously, so that balance
always has to be kept in mind.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.890
And then the one I like to
add is Spider Man's uncle,

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.590
with great power comes
great responsibility,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.610
because you have now power.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.930
You're gaining power.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.120
That's what this
class is doing to you.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.180
You're gaining the power
to calculate things

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.950
like band structures.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:18.700
Right?

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.850
And the responsibility
is that I want

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.460
you to know what you're doing.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.065
In the sense that
you don't just say

00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:29.440
I'm going to do
a bang structure.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.490
Oh, here it is.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.440
You check, and you're
careful about it.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:33.940
Right?

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.820
And you understand how to
validate the calculations

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.720
that you're doing
against experiment,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.020
and you understand how to
converge the calculations.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.670
You understand how to make sure
you understand what they mean.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.250
That's the responsibility.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.240
OK?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.480
So a little bit of
philosophy there.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.232
Anyway, OK.

00:09:54.232 --> 00:09:55.690
We're going to
review a little bit,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.550
and we'll talk about
some properties.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.230
We'll come back to
this band structure

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:05.037
which is so critical to
this part of the class.

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:07.120
And if I have time, I'll
talk about magnetization,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.120
but probably, I'll talk
about magnetization

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.570
on Thursday a little.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.480
All right?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.130
Any questions?

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.490
So we've had a rap
video, some philosophy,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.750
a little bit of an outline.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.660
Where else can we go?

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.160
Right?

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.260
Things are good.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.540
Rondo, what's up with that?

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.400
Was that a good decision?

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.270
No?

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.500
How many people saw that?

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.590
I just want to know.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.290
OK, so a little
more people are--

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.130
But you only saw
it on a highlight.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.360
Oh, you watched the game.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.860
All right.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.890
Good.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:39.650
Yeah.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.720
But they're going to win
without Rondo tonight.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.200
Anyway, OK.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.700
Yeah.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.230
You bump a ref on purpose?

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.010
Come on.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.270
Come on, man.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.070
Anyway, I can't spend
more time on it.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.380
I don't want to do that.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.850
Let's take a walk through
memory lane for just a moment,

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.810
because I want to make sure
we all know where we are.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.650
Right?

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.790
We started with this.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.470
There were some
strange observations

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.330
by some very smart people.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.240
Tell me what those are.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.850
We could ask questions like
about these on the quiz.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:10.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.740
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Those are electrons.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.240
Yeah.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.210
That's an electron.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.043
Those are electrons.

00:11:14.043 --> 00:11:15.132
What's this experiment?

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:16.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.200
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
This one is?

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.190
What's this one?

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.080
AUDIENCE: Collapsing
if that happens.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.830
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Why does it collapse?

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] classical.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.285
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Classical,
then it's got to be what?

00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:30.377
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:30.377 --> 00:11:31.460
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.960
It's giving off
energy, and it's not

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.090
going to hang into its orbit.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.830
But then quantum
mechanics came along

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.660
and said, no, that's not true.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.290
Right?

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.040
Because what?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.430
It just is.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.040
It's the 'It just is" answer.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.290
No, because what it
said is that the levels

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.780
of a quantum mechanical
object are quantized,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.460
and they have to
be in those places.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.700
And there's no in between,
and that's what this is.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.756
What's this?

00:12:00.756 --> 00:12:02.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.400
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Which comes
from that same observation.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.160
You'd think that the
universe, the hydrogen

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.407
might emit colors in any
frequency, but instead only

00:12:11.407 --> 00:12:12.240
certain frequencies.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.090
And it comes from that
quantization of those electron

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.120
levels, and this, somebody
already said this.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.540
Right?

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.510
Photoelectric effect.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:20.890
OK?

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.265
Now, those are
very smart people,

00:12:22.265 --> 00:12:23.500
and the weirdness kept going.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.470
Now, is that guy ordering
two drinks at the bar?

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.770
Why does he have two?

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.610
Double slit experiment, that was
a cool one, and the weirdness

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.850
just kept going.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.670
Right?

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.710
Now, it became very clear that
matter behaved like waves.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.900
If we took this little
10-slide, where we are,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.840
quick, what road if we
come on, and we turned it

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.670
into a music video.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.830
Right?

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.510
Anybody want to do that?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.810
That's exciting.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.720
OK.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.970
It became clear that matter
behave like waves and vice

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.890
versa.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.370
OK?

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.220
And that we had to lose
our classical concepts

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.470
of absolute position
of momentum and instead

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.040
consider a particle as a wave
whose square is the probability

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.110
of finding it, and there it is.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.590
And this became our goal,
our task of finding that.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.090
Right?

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.630
That's what we needed
to do on a computer,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.710
and there's a picture of a wave.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.530
How do we do this?

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.620
How do we describe this?

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.080
Well, we needed our F equals ma.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.270
Right?

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.360
So when matter is just a
particle, we have F equals ma,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.810
but now that it's a wave, we
needed something different.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.500
And from the
elements and the bits

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.350
of pieces of quantum
mechanics, which

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.410
people were putting
together, out comes

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.970
the Schrodinger equation.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.940
And that's our F equals
ma, which tells us

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.750
how to describe the
behavior of waves,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.870
if they're quantum mechanical,
and it was wonderful.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.660
It explained many things.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.490
It gave us atomic orbitals.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.710
It predicted the energy
levels of hydrogen.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.560
Remember how wonderful that was?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.870
It gave us, basically,
the means to understand

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.920
a whole lot of this.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.420
Right?

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.390
But nature does more
than one electron,

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.162
and it was impossible
to solve for more

00:14:29.162 --> 00:14:30.120
than a single electron.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.890
So here's where computational
quantum mechanics comes in.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:33.390
OK?

00:14:37.113 --> 00:14:39.030
But there was still a
problem, and the problem

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.430
is that we don't have
the age of the universe

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.200
to do our calculations.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.980
And so that's how long it
would take to currently solve

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.530
the Schrodinger equation
exactly on a computer

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.220
for like only a
handful of particles.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.008
Right?

00:14:55.008 --> 00:14:56.550
Obviously, you could
solve it for one

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.380
or two particles exactly in
a lot less time than that,

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.610
but once you get up
to 10, you're done.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.750
And so we started to try
to take some inspiration,

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.960
and we looked at
this, a guy's back.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.410
And we said, OK, well, maybe
that's telling us something.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.740
It's telling us a lot,
but it's telling us

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.790
some interesting physics.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.510
It's telling us that the
ions are a whole lot heavier

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.760
and slower than the electrons.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.890
So we can freeze them out.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.070
So we started to peel away
at the Schrodinger equation,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.470
and we made it simpler.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.970
OK?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:35.090
We made some approximations,
and there are basically

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.170
the two paths that I talked
about in those approximations.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:45.560
At the time, it's about
50 years ago, maybe 60,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.130
these two paths were
fairly distinct.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.960
And the chemists mostly
worked on saying, well, here's

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.210
the equation we have to solve.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.990
We can't solve it.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.180
Let's make psi
something simpler.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.590
Let's simplify psi.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.380
And the physicists
mostly said, well,

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.020
let's not think about psi.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.620
Let's just change
the Hamiltonian.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.360
That's h there.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.590
Right?

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.320
And those are two
approaches that

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.130
led to many different models,
many different theories,

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.040
many different theories.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.040
In the theories, in
both sides, the effect

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.600
of these simplifications
led to the picture

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.020
that we call a
mean field picture.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.350
Which is that instead of
having to worry about all

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.960
these quantum mechanical
electrons interacting

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.670
with each other, we
just worry about them

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.720
as if it's each one is in
the field of the others,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.470
an average field of
the others, and that's

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.280
called the mean field method.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.020
OK?

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.150
Those are the methods
we're using in this class.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.800
That's the method we're using.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.440
And then we talked about
density functional theory,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.950
and the breakthrough
there is that trying

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.590
to keep track of a
wave function, let's

00:16:54.590 --> 00:17:01.970
say, on a grid of a 2 by 2
grid or 3 by 3 or whatever.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.190
Well, this is for actually
a 2 by 2 by 2 grid,

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.099
and you have N electrons.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:12.950
Well, if you have N
is 1, so 1 electron,

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:16.640
you have 8 points you
need to keep track of.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.430
But if you had
just 10 electrons,

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.790
then you see that you
get 10 to the 9th points.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.290
OK?

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.750
This is the problem of using
grids to represent things.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.270
And so if you use the density
instead, it's just a constant.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.310
Tracking the density
is much easier,

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.820
and the crux of density
functional theory,

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.030
which was worked out in the
'60s, is that there is a 1 to 1

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.580
correspondence between the
exact density of the system

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.540
and the wave function.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.502
OK?

00:17:46.502 --> 00:17:47.960
And we talked about
this last time,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.670
about how we sit
here, because it's

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:54.260
a nice compromise between
accuracy and applicability.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.720
But I want to come back to
this, because this is not--

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.660
part of the reason I wanted to
remind you of this is that it's

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.300
just always fun to take these
walks through memory lane,

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.920
and it only took
us five minutes.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.160
But another reason
is that I want

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.190
to remind you that we are not
solving for quantum mechanics

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.450
exactly.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.980
We're not.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.210
We cannot.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.710
OK?

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.150
This is what I mean by
the responsibility part.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.190
OK?

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:30.170
There are some things
that DFT can give you,

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.230
can calculate about those
electrons, that are typically

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.300
very accurate, but
there are some things

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.270
where it's actually quite off.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.890
It's an approximation.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.280
Does anybody remember
where it tends to do well?

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.460
I did talk about this in
the third or fourth lecture

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.380
and where it tends to do badly.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.670
Yeah.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.230
Or one of those two.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.362
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
solids, periodic structures.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.640
What about the solids,
what properties?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.323
AUDIENCE: Bandgaps.

00:19:00.323 --> 00:19:01.740
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
That would be

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.310
a case where it falls into
the not so well category.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.440
OK?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.680
So this is pretty important.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.945
AUDIENCE: Lattice parameters?

00:19:11.945 --> 00:19:13.820
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Lattice parameters, yes.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.320
It tends to do very well
for lattice parameters.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.260
So how far apart
should atoms be,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.800
if they come together in a
molecule or solid or a liquid?

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.840
DFT can do very well.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.960
It does very well for
vibrational properties,

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.160
vibrational spectrum, the
phonons in a material.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.040
It tends to do worse
for excited states,

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.290
like looking at,
say, the optical gap

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.680
or the electronic
gap of material.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.000
It tends to the
approximations that we

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.840
had to use to get a method
that's workable, all of these

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.310
have approximations,
except this.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.970
See?

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.710
We're up to two electrons here.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:20:01.820
Those approximations lead to DFT
not doing so well for the gap.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.865
However, as you may have noticed
in your homeworks, that's

00:20:05.865 --> 00:20:07.490
one of the things
you have to calculate

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:08.900
in your second homework.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.410
So here's the point
I want to make.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.440
These methods have
advantages and disadvantages.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.120
They all are approximate.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.230
Some quantum mechanical methods
can describe some things

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:24.950
very accurately and some
things not as accurately,

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.320
and others may have
different balances.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.750
And as you go down to
more accurate methods that

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.180
can describe more
things very accurately,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.650
you tend to be able to do less
and less numbers of electrons.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.250
Right?

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:42.050
Limit your phase space
to 12, 20 electrons,

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.980
and you're pretty limited in how
many materials you can explore.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.480
Right?

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:52.670
Now, why can we still
calculate the gap?

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.520
Well, and this is,
actually, there's

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.530
going to be an addendum
to your homework

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.650
which I'm going to have to--

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.513
I forgot to put this
in there, but if this

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:05.555
is the density of states.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:13.880
OK.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.300
Let's say that's the
density of states.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.130
By the way, if I
asked you what's

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.760
the gap of this material,
what would you say?

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.212
Yeah?

00:21:26.212 --> 00:21:28.572
AUDIENCE: Those are between
the first density of states

00:21:28.572 --> 00:21:29.520
and second density of states.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.853
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Well,
that would be true but I need

00:21:31.853 --> 00:21:34.800
to know one thing very
importantly or I cannot answer

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.590
whether that's the case.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.730
What do I need to know?

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.317
I need to know the
position of something here.

00:21:41.317 --> 00:21:42.382
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:42.382 --> 00:21:44.590
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: The
Fermi energy, who said that?

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.600
Very good.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.800
Fermi energy, came
from over there.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.300
OK?

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.310
Now, if I tell you that
the Fermi energy is here.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.560
Then, you're absolutely right.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.320
It's the difference--
and in the DOS plots

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.860
you get on the nanoHUB,
these are essentially

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.440
levels that come out.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.600
If it's a molecule, they're
levels that come out,

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.308
and then they're spread
out a little bit.

00:22:05.308 --> 00:22:07.830
So it's very likely this
peak height versus that

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.740
is going to give you the gap.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.350
And in the nanoHUB
tool, the Fermi energy

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.820
is always set to 0 for you.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.320
OK?

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.670
But if I don't specify
it, you may not know.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.280
Now, is that a semiconductor
or an insulator?

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:23.910
Is it a metal?

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:28.890
Semiconductor?

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.618
How do you know?

00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:31.410
You have a feeling?

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
between the two bands.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:32.700
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.950
Well, let's say I put it here.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.610
Semiconductor?

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.830
Insulator?

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.710
Wait, why can I not
answer that question?

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.172
What don't you know?

00:22:45.172 --> 00:22:47.220
AUDIENCE: You don't
know the scale.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.310
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: What if
I told you that this was 0.1,

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:56.040
and this was 0.2, and the scale
is in eV, then what is it?

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.490
It's a 0.1 eV gap semiconductor.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.710
Right?

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.320
OK?

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.050
So well, that's
like almost a metal,

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.310
but it's still semiconductor.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.890
It's a very low
bandgap semiconductor,

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.260
where actually
electrons will probably

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.400
populate the conduction
band just thermally

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.300
to an interesting probability.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:26.840
Now, if I told you this was
10 eV, what would it be?

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.710
AUDIENCE: Insulator?

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:28.640
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Insulator.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.140
OK?

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.420
Now, I'm going to go on.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.810
Don't worry, but the
last point is DFT,

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.610
I'm not going to go
into the details of why,

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.820
but DFT tends to
underestimate the bandgap.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.630
OK?

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.040
And so there are now
sophisticated ways

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.920
of correcting that and going
beyond DFT that we're not going

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.450
to talk about in this class.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.130
But what we are
going to do is we're

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.660
going to use an
approximation that

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.630
was used for 20 years in
the scientific literature

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.820
and community to correct
for this problem.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.300
And that is simply
called a scissor shift,

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.320
where basically, you see,
DFT gets the bandgap wrong,

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.110
but it gets qualitatively
very often the picture right.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.240
It just gets the
bandgap too small.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.730
So very often, we just shift
the conduction band states

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.087
by some correction.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.340
OK?

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.960
I will give you that correction.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.240
That will be the
addendum in the homework,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.900
because you'll need that.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.810
So the DOS plots
that you calculate

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.370
for these solar fuels, think
of them as pretty good,

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.500
except you have to
shift these states up.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.010
So qualitatively, these
states are not bad,

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.290
but they're just
too low in energy

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.840
compared to the occupied states.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.530
OK?

00:24:54.530 --> 00:25:01.250
So that's a method that is not
really used very often anymore,

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.710
but it was used heavily
in the '70s and '80s,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:09.680
to use DFT to look at
DOS and band structures.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.480
Nowadays, we do
have methods that

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.870
go further that allow
us to actually calculate

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.080
these things without some
rigid shift approximation,

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.370
but calculate them more
from first principles.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.870
I won't go into
those in this class.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:22.370
OK?

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.970
Any questions?

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.640
So you'll have to
download your DOS plot

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.690
and do the shift that
I give you to the data.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.260
All right?

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.570
Seems like a cheat, and
it actually is a cheat.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.080
But like I said the qualitative
nature of these states

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.120
is still very good often.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.110
OK?

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:46.040
So that's a property DFT
does not do so well on.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.550
OK.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.430
I won't go through the
self-consistent cycle.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.460
What we did on Tuesday is
we talked about solids.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:53.960
OK?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.820
So we talked about
the periodic cell,

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.710
and we talked about
crystal symmetries.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.810
And this was all review,
I think, for most of you,

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.880
and most symmetries are--

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.700
most common lattices are cubic
or hexagonal, close back.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.590
Anybody know why?

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.320
Yeah.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.278
AUDIENCE: Lower energy.

00:26:08.278 --> 00:26:09.362
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:26:09.362 --> 00:26:10.212
Because of what?

00:26:10.212 --> 00:26:11.367
AUDIENCE: More atoms.

00:26:11.367 --> 00:26:12.950
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
You pack them in.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.000
Makes sense.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.890
OK?

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.708
And then, and this
is sort of where

00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:19.250
we spent some time
Tuesday and I want

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:24.920
to make sure we feel our
oneness with this k-space thing.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.760
So associated with each
real space lattice,

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.360
there exists something we
call reciprocal lattice.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.222
It's a set of wave
vectors which are

00:26:31.222 --> 00:26:32.930
commensurate with the
real space lattice.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:37.140
Sometimes, we call
it G. Why not?

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.310
Those are the lattice
vectors in reciprocal space.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:43.290
And we define them as
a star, b star, c star.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:49.080
That's a lattice in real
space, BCC, BCC lattice.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.690
And there's the
reciprocal space lattice.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.740
It's a real lattice.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.560
It has distances
in lattice world,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.810
in reciprocal lattice world.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.040
It just looks different.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.740
And actually, the
inverse of BCC is FCC.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.300
So we talked about all this.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.310
And then we talked
about how you can define

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.660
a zone within reciprocal space.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.990
And the first-- if you take--

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.860
if you draw lines between
neighbors and nearest neighbors

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.950
and you draw bisections,
then you define that zone.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.570
And that's called
the Brillouin zone.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.350
And so you see here in this
square lattice, it's a square.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.080
In here, it's going
to be a hexagon.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.260
And if we define that
zone in three dimensions--

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.680
well, here, it's squares
and hexagons on the edges.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.470
But it's a volume.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.450
Does everybody-- so we're
just defining space, still.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.910
And then came the
Bloch's theorem.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.160
And in Bloch's
theorem, what we said

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.460
is that values of a
function, like the density,

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.730
should be the same
because it's a crystal.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.100
But the wave function
is periodic only when

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.480
multiplied by a phase factor.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.150
And that's-- I didn't
go into a lot of detail.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.740
But that's Bloch's theorem.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.020
So it says that the
wave function picks up

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.870
a phase factor, which depends
on this new quantum number.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:15.390
That's all review
from last week.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.040
And you can see that if the
wave function looks like that--

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.500
so if you add--

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.910
the periodicity
of the lattice is

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.768
big R. R is just
anywhere in real space.

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:25.560
Then you're going to
get this phase factor.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.560
And if you square them,
say, to get the density,

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.780
then you can show that the
densities are the same.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.100
Also, and this is
important, the wave function

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.347
picks up a phase if you
just go by the periodicity

00:28:37.347 --> 00:28:38.430
of the real space lattice.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:44.970
But if I increase k, if I add
an inverse lattice vector to k,

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.740
then they're exactly the same.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.880
So in k-space, I can
also translate around.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.600
And the energies are the same.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.330
We're going somewhere here.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.260
We're going somewhere.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.385
Give me a minute.

00:29:01.385 --> 00:29:02.510
And then I showed you this.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.950
And does anybody have
questions about this?

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.590
The parallel here, I think,
is pretty self-explanatory.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.387
In the hydrogen atom, we
impose this spherical symmetry.

00:29:13.387 --> 00:29:14.220
AUDIENCE: [SNEEZING]

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.940
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Gesundheit.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.610
And we got out of that
quantization-- we solved.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.070
And here, we impose a
translational symmetry.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:26.200
And we get out of
that k-vectorization.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.760
We-- but k is not a--

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.170
k is a quantum number.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.240
But it can be continuous.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.530
It can be continuous.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.350
And you look at it in
the first Brillouin zone.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:43.300
Now, somebody tell me,
given this, why would

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.605
I worry about k only--

00:29:46.605 --> 00:29:47.980
AUDIENCE: Sorry
to interrupt you.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.580
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: No problem.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.210
AUDIENCE: I'm just videotaping.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.420
And we're just hearing
the mic move a lot.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.212
I'm just going to--

00:29:52.212 --> 00:29:53.362
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Oh.

00:29:53.362 --> 00:29:54.320
AUDIENCE: There you go.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.945
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
So I should stop--

00:29:55.945 --> 00:29:56.680
I kind of-- no.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.790
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.570
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: That rap
got me a little bit excited.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.620
So let's go back to slide 1.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.342
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.770
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: So I'm
adding an inverse lattice

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:16.340
vector, a full vector, that
gets me to another lattice

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.570
point in inverse space.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.330
And I say my wave
function is the same.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.560
Now, why is it--

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.000
I also defined a Brillouin zone.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.770
And you can see my definition
of the Brillouin zone

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.400
is, in fact, that
it's a zone that--

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.785
it's a lattice vector.

00:30:32.785 --> 00:30:34.410
You see, those are
the lattice vectors.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.260
Why is it that I only now
care about the variation of k

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.760
within that first
Brillouin zone?

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.503
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah?

00:30:40.503 --> 00:30:42.090
AUDIENCE: Same thing.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.732
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: The same.

00:30:44.732 --> 00:30:46.940
That's why we care so much
about that Brillouin zone.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.340
What is it?

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.760
Well, it's the boundaries
of the variability

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:58.340
of the wave function in
terms of how it depends on k.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.660
So I only need to vary
k in this first zone.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.070
But I do need to
vary it in that zone.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.240
I have to vary it in that zone
because there will be variation

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.050
if it's a solid.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.470
But if I vary it and then go
out here, well, it's just--

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.490
I can translate it back.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.350
And it's the same
thing, you see?

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:23.140
So I need to move k
around in this first zone.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.410
And when I do, and this is
a slide I've showed before--

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.690
when I do, what
you get is, as you

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.170
go-- as you think about a system
going from atoms to molecules

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.410
to bands in your
solid, you see this

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.920
is the energy of that band.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.910
It wiggles.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.550
That's what happens
in that first zone.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.930
You have a new quantum number.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.370
You change it.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.530
And you vary the energy.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.220
It wiggles.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.310
So now these
orbitals are wiggly.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.080
And that's the big--

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.280
the most important thing.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.460
And you can see here--

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.060
so here's my k-space.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.900
And I can vary kx, ky, kz if
it's three-dimensional solid.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.730
And at each point
in k-space, you

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:08.207
are going to get
a set of levels,

00:32:08.207 --> 00:32:10.040
just like you did for
that atom or molecule.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.540
You're going to get
a set of levels.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.840
And they will vary.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.310
But they will be the
same if I translate

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.120
by the inverse lattice vector.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.210
So if I go from here
out some G vector,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.920
then I get exactly
the same levels.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.675
But if I'm inside this Brillouin
zone, they're going to vary.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.360
Any questions?

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.995
K-space is really
important for solids.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.380
Mm-hmm.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.320
And so what do we do?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.020
Well-- so the inverse lattice--

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.700
it's related to the
real space lattice.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:53.160
If I double the real space
lattice so it's periodic,

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.770
but with more
atoms in the cell--

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.200
so it's periodic over
a larger domain--

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.490
then, basically, I'm--
it's like a Fourier series.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:06.150
So if I go to larger
real space lattice, then

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:09.790
I have finer and finer k-space.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:13.570
And so what that
means is that you

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.950
can choose a certain k-mesh.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:19.090
This is a variable in
the input now for solids.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.060
For solids, this is a
new critical variable

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.540
in your calculations of solids.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.917
You need a k-mesh.

00:33:26.917 --> 00:33:28.000
And this is just a number.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.800
You'll enter 8 or 2 or 4.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.900
And it'll just do a cube
because it's simple.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.233
But you don't have to do a cube.

00:33:33.233 --> 00:33:35.650
But the code does a
cube on the nanoHUB.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:40.180
So if I enter 8 by 8 by 8, I
get 512 k-points on a mesh.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:45.760
And what that does
is it allows me to--

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:51.280
it is-- it, effectively, is like
increasing how much real space

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.880
I had because they're related.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.910
If I had a larger unit
cell with more real space,

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.220
I'd have finer
and finer k-space.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.310
And so you can think
about these things

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.900
as being able to
go back and forth.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.449
Now, the reason that you
don't go to-- and now, well,

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:14.710
how many k-points do you need?

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.340
Well, you need to
have enough k-points--

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.780
you need to distribute k-points
in your Brillouin zone such

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.420
that--

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:22.920
what?

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.670
What's the answer?

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.679
How many k-points do I need?

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.775
It's my favorite answer.

00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:28.650
AUDIENCE: It depends.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.840
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It depends.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.010
What does it depend on?

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.600
Did that come from the back?

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.982
I love it.

00:34:34.982 --> 00:34:35.940
What does it depend on?

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.052
AUDIENCE: The
electrons [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:41.052 --> 00:34:43.790
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It might
depend on the electrons.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.409
What else might it depend on?

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.546
How many k-points do I need?

00:34:47.546 --> 00:34:50.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.500
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yes.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.969
Yes.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.659
Look at this picture.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.420
Let's look back at this picture.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.470
Think about this.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.170
And now try to think about
how many k-points do I need.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.142
AUDIENCE: Enough [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:06.142 --> 00:35:07.350
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.330
I need enough.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.440
Now, what's enough?

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.920
Well, enough so that
you can resolve how

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.260
the energy is going to change.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:28.210
So now tell me, if the wiggles
are slow and not so much,

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:32.560
if the wiggles are like this, or
maybe even they're really flat,

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.930
do I need a lot of k-points
or a little bit of k-points?

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.010
How many?

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.390
A lot?

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.060
Just a little bit
because there's just

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.780
not that much variation.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.040
But if the wiggles
looked like this,

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.040
would I need a lot or a little?

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.960
And so this is the
behavior of bands

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.650
that look like this-- are
more sort of metallicy.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.320
And the behavior of bands that
look like this, the flat ones,

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.240
are more "insulatorey."

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.730
And in between-- and
we'll see-- on Thursday,

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:08.210
we'll talk about how you can
actually calculate the mobility

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:09.320
from these bands from this

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:09.820
Wiggle.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.420
But you can-- how
many do you need?

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.300
Well, it depends.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.540
It depends on the
nature of the material.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.010
But you have to converge that.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.080
That's part of that
responsibility.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.620
Spiderman's uncle
knew all about it.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.080
And so this is where we ended.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.950
Oh, man.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:31.580
Come on.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.142
There we go.

00:36:33.142 --> 00:36:34.100
This is where we ended.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:39.800
And so you have energy
levels in the Brillouin zone.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.620
k is a continuous variable.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.393
But you don't actually
continue it everywhere

00:36:45.393 --> 00:36:46.310
because it's too hard.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.840
So you just do--
what the computer

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.750
does is a bunch of calculations
at different k-points

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.810
on the grid you give it.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.670
And what you're
doing then is you're

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.040
moving through-- when you
give it different k-points,

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.360
literally, this is what you do.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.490
You say, compute the--

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.010
what the computer is
doing is it's saying,

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:07.460
compute the energy levels
at k-point 0, 0, 0.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:12.350
Now compute the energy levels
at k-points point 1, point 1,

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:13.820
point 1.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.370
And you literally just give
it coordinates of k-points

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.990
within the Brillouin zone.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.870
And for each of those k-points,
it does the calculations.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:25.800
And it finds a set of energy
levels, which are different.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.800
And those-- and then
you fill that in.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.135
And you get your curvy bands.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:33.810
Who's with me?

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.190
Who's got questions?

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.830
Anyone have questions?

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.620
That's the new-- yeah?

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.727
AUDIENCE: So at each
point, is a distinct number

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:44.420
of energy states
within the electrons?

00:37:45.807 --> 00:37:46.890
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:50.370
Well, each k-point is the
same number of energy states.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.320
But they can move around
depending on where

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.530
you are in that Brillouin zone.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.320
And their "moving-aroundness"
is what gives you the band

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.358
structure.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.482
So in the code, and I did
this on the previous slide--

00:38:07.482 --> 00:38:08.440
I didn't talk about it.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.070
It was the second point.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.200
But on the code, you--
each one of these you

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.320
can think of as
occupied by electrons

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.270
because it's looking at this
k-point and then this k-point.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.040
But when you think
about the full band

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.490
structure of a material, that
is not how you look at it.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:27.132
You don't have-- you would--

00:38:27.132 --> 00:38:28.840
as you keep increasing
your k-point mesh,

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.750
you would have infinite
number of electrons in a band.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.750
That is not the case.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.320
What you have is
the same as before,

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.890
the same exact thing
as molecular states,

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.690
which is that you
can have-- one band

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:44.180
can hold two electrons--
one up, one down.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.600
That's exactly the same
as in a molecular state.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.810
But depending on where you
are in the Brillouin zone,

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.540
the energy of that band now
can change dramatically.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.580
And that changes
everything in terms

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.810
of properties of material.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.610
In particular, what
we're focusing on here

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.190
is optical properties
and electronic properties

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:13.060
because those are very quantum
mechanically, which we like.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.780
Now-- and the Fermi
energy is in the code--

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.080
we talked about the Fermi energy
a little bit for molecules.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:25.060
It's sort of the energy
at which you stop filling.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.417
It's the energy-- so
you fill your bands up

00:39:28.417 --> 00:39:29.250
to the Fermi energy.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.210
You can just think
about it that way.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.947
Don't worry about-- so much
about whether it's in the gap

00:39:33.947 --> 00:39:35.030
or where it is in the gap.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:38.050
We don't need to worry
about that in this class.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.050
But it is the energy at where--
at which you stop filling.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:45.300
And so you can see that if you--

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.020
I have some properties.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.640
I thought I had somebody else.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:58.650
But if you were to fill
these and the bands--

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:02.230
and these bands didn't
stop nicely, like this,

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.598
but they just crossed over
it, what would you have?

00:40:05.598 --> 00:40:07.140
What kind of material
would you have?

00:40:12.047 --> 00:40:13.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.650
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.690
It's a metal.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.700
It's a metal.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.720
And if you have the bands
stop where you stop filling

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.060
and then there's a gap, it's a
semiconductor or an insulator.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.690
Let's do a few calculations.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.110
And then I'll come back
to structural properties.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:41.775
We are on our favorite
place, the HUB of nano.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.580
Come on.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.430
Yes!

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.365
We got to that stage.

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.940
Launch Tool-- it sounds
like a good idea.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.800
And this is where we had
some issues last time--

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.210
not going to kid you.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.730
There it is.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.400
And we go to here.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.600
Now, let's do a few things.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:17.450
And so this is the same as--

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:18.950
so it's not letting
me scroll again.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.143
That's wonderful.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.250
There it is.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:34.400
Now, this is the
same as the tool

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.200
that you're using for
the homework number 2

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.770
to look at molecules.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:44.420
And in looking at molecules,
you just select Molecule.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.380
But all the code is doing
when you look at molecules--

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.470
all the code is
doing is it's saying,

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:55.370
well, whatever you give
me, whatever sort of thing

00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.800
you give me, I'm going to put
space in my periodic cell.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.940
I'm going to put
enough space so that it

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.200
doesn't see its own image.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:12.980
That's all it's doing.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.260
It's still a
periodic calculation.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.500
It's just putting a whole
bunch of space in there.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.940
You could choose Solid and
do molecule calculations

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:28.800
and just make sure that there's
space between what you put in.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:34.020
However, when you
choose Solid, then you

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.390
can see that it's actually
entering the coordinates

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:37.520
in a different way.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.740
It's using a slightly
different language.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:46.850
Has anybody seen this
beautiful non-scrolling thing?

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:48.770
Man.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:49.520
Oh, yeah.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.830
Well, it's good
to be challenged.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:52.580
That's fun.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:43:00.050
So-- you gotta be kidding me.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.632
Did you see that coming?

00:43:04.632 --> 00:43:05.840
Did somebody see that coming?

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.520
Should we go back to the--

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.660
to DJ Dave?

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.160
Wait.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.805
What if I did Firefox?

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.910
Is that better?

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:23.440
It's the same.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.520
That's beautiful.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.480
You get the same thing?

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.440
It did remember me.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.860
Now let's close that.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.944
How often does that happen?

00:43:35.944 --> 00:43:38.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.102
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: But what
percentage, would you say?

00:43:41.102 --> 00:43:43.787
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:44.870
AUDIENCE: 60% of the time.

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.820
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
60% of the time?

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.553
60--

00:43:48.553 --> 00:43:51.803
AUDIENCE: I feel the nanoHub
[INAUDIBLE] are generally not

00:43:51.803 --> 00:43:55.070
stable for the Macintosh
machines and for the Unix--

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.570
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Oh, no, no, no.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.550
You can't be blaming
this on a Mac.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.010
This is-- because
it's not a Mac.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:01.250
AUDIENCE: Not a Macintosh.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.700
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Thank you.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.400
AUDIENCE: I mean the software.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.817
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
That must be.

00:44:03.817 --> 00:44:07.910
AUDIENCE: I think the software
is unfriendly for Windows.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:11.315
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Well,
that's a big problem.

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:11.940
So here we are.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.250
This looks a little bit better.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.350
Now, when you choose Solid--

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:16.910
so now we have-- look at this.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:17.772
[GASPING]

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.078
You can choose your crystal
symmetry because it's a solid.

00:44:22.078 --> 00:44:23.870
And remember those
symmetries that you saw?

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.270
Well, these are those
symmetries except now

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.670
you have to choose
a lattice constant.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:30.890
See, when you did the
molecule, the lattice constant

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:34.190
was simply big.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.200
It was just big so
that the molecule

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.245
didn't fill its periodic image.

00:44:38.245 --> 00:44:39.620
But now that we're
doing a solid,

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.390
the lattice constant
has to be, well,

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.960
like the lattice
constant of the material.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.540
And depending on the
symmetry of the material,

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.610
you're going to get
different lattice constants.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:52.370
So if I-- now--
and have any of you

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.938
seen fractional
coordinates before?

00:44:54.938 --> 00:44:56.230
Does anybody know what this is?

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:03.360
So this is actually an important
language of solids where,

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.590
oftentimes--

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:08.280
so with a solid, you have a
periodically repeating space

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.560
that is set by a
lattice constant.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.820
And so often, it's simpler to
think about the coordinates

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.580
that go inside that space--
the basis, if you want--

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.390
as fractions of the lattice.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.720
So for silicon, actually--

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.180
for silicon, it's an
FCC crystal with a basis

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:34.500
at one corner of the
FCC and another atom

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.140
at a quarter-quarter-quarter
out in terms of the lattice.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.350
This is not at a
quarter-quarter-quarter

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.210
angstroms.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.880
This is a
quarter-quarter-quarter scaled

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.820
by that lattice--

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.400
does everybody see that--

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.995
which is a cubic
face-centered lattice.

00:45:51.995 --> 00:45:53.370
So that's fractional
coordinates.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.550
You can go back and forth.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.980
You can write a 10-line Python
script to go back and forth

00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.700
between the two.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.120
But in solids, often we like to
think about positions in terms

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.420
of the symmetry of the lattice.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.320
And so that's how we write them.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.430
Now, in this case, I
have two silicon atoms.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:20.580
And we're going to ignore
everything and just run it.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.030
Is that how you guys do it,
anyway, you just simulate?

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:28.070
It's fun to do
that, just simulate,

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:32.490
except that you need
to know what you did.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:36.820
Now, that's what I want to ask
you about-- is what did I do?

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.150
Oh, look at that.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:40.410
This is solid.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:42.090
I only gave it two atoms.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.790
And yet, because
it has the symmetry

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:46.415
in the lattice and all that, it
knows how to construct a solid.

00:46:46.415 --> 00:46:48.173
And that's what it looks like.

00:46:48.173 --> 00:46:49.590
When the computer
thinks about it,

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.660
it thinks about it like that.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.160
Uh-oh.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.950
Where's the-- oh, here we go.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:07.020
Now, key outputs-- it's telling
you that it has-- well, these

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.760
should really be 4.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.330
It has four up electrons
and four down electrons.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.350
That doesn't sound like
that many electrons.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:18.060
How come I only have eight
electrons in my simulation

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.700
and I'm simulating
an infinite crystal?

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.687
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:24.687 --> 00:47:25.770
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:26.790
So very good.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.562
But how come-- so
it's only the valence

00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:30.520
because that's where all
the chemistry happens.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.530
We talked about that.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:35.130
But why are the only two atoms?

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.130
How can I simulate a
solid with only two atoms?

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:39.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.850
AUDIENCE: Because
it's symmetric.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:44.100
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Because it's symmetric.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.640
However, because I only
have two atoms, especially,

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.860
and it's symmetric
and it repeats,

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.930
I need to worry about the
convergence of what, which

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:56.686
we just talked about?

00:47:56.686 --> 00:47:59.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.760
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: And
so you saw-- the density

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.333
of states we talked about.

00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:04.250
Oh, this is beautiful.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.940
Look at this.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.320
It's beautiful.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.770
Those are the peaks of the
solid of crystalline silicon.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:11.510
It's just like in the molecules.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:13.580
In the molecules,
we had the levels.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.290
And we turned them
on their side.

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:17.790
We turned the levels
on their side.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.740
And we said that's
the same as the DoS.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.520
But in the solid, it's the band
structure we turn on its side.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.998
Here's the band structure.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:29.980
So those are my levels now.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.850
Those are my levels.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:34.210
They're wiggly in
reciprocal space.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:34.990
But if I turn--

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:36.580
I can still turn
them on their side.

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:40.870
And when I do that, I get
the density of states,

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.770
directly comparable to the
situation of the molecules.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.110
But in the molecules,
what I turned on its side

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.760
didn't wiggle.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.990
Does everybody see that?

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.870
So there's the band structure.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:56.980
Now, this is-- the nanoHUB
has issues with putting

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.060
Greek letters on plots.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.790
So this is the band structure
with the Greek letters.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:03.400
And I'll talk about-- well,
actually, I don't need to wait.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.500
These just correspond
to different points

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.750
in that Brillouin zone.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.660
You cruise through phase
space in the Brillouin zone.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.460
And you plot the energies--

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.700
the code is plotting the
energies along that path.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.450
So you get a sense
of the variation.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.220
Could these energies
vary differently

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.360
than I've plotted here?

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.905
Could they vary differently?

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:35.390
How could they vary differently?

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:36.140
The answer is yes.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.200
This is a cruise
through phase space.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.000
Gamma is always the origin.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.640
Gamma's at k-point 0, 0, 0.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.170
And then I went to
some other k-point.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:54.910
And we called it
X. We like to give

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.460
high-symmetry points
in the Brillouin zone

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:03.250
a letter, a Greek
letter, or not.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.780
And then I went back to gamma.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:08.440
Here, I went to a point
we called L. And I--

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.570
the way you do this is
you just, basically,

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.600
go in a line from this
point to that point.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.470
And you plot the change
in the energy of each band

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.770
as you go from point to
point in the Brillouin zone.

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.770
So now, tell me, are
those the only variations

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.380
that you could have?

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:25.890
Why not?

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:33.108
Tell me why not.

00:50:33.108 --> 00:50:35.400
AUDIENCE: If you choose a
different path, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.800
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: If you
choose a different path.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:43.530
This is just one path going
from L to gamma to X. You see,

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.210
here we are.

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:48.720
I went-- you see,
here they are for FCC,

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.070
I think, or maybe it's BCC.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.700
I went from gamma to
L to X. I went just

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.800
along a line in
this Brillouin zone.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:01.160
But what if I had gone like this
or what if I'd done like this?

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.500
Would I get
different curvatures?

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.830
You better believe it.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:10.520
You are taking paths
through the Brillouin zone

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.900
to get the band structure.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.100
That's how you get
the band structure.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:25.000
Now, what ends up happening is
that the interesting variations

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.390
in these energy bands,
the interesting ones,

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:30.670
the ones that are important
for optical and electronic

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:33.640
properties, tend to happen
between the high-symmetry

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.200
points in the Brillouin zone.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.200
They tend to happen between
the origin and the center

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.770
of this face and the
center of this edge

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.870
and going back to an origin.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:48.640
They tend to happen between the
path of one high-symmetry point

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.760
to another.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:54.250
And so, de facto,
we just don't care

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.800
much about everything
else in the Brillouin zone

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.440
because it doesn't really
give us extra information.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.720
It would give us a
different band structure.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.550
But it's not that--

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:08.660
it's not giving us
something that's

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.540
as relevant to the key
fundamental properties

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.190
we care about.

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:16.170
So that's one thing.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.930
Now-- so that's where those--

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.150
now, the code just
picks the paths.

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:23.170
But in all these codes, you can
enter whatever path you want.

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:24.920
So if you want to
cruise around in k-space

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.560
and get energy
variations, you can do it.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.650
You are not limited.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.680
Now, is this the right
band structure for silicon?

00:52:44.328 --> 00:52:45.808
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:45.808 --> 00:52:47.600
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Let's go back to our--

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.330
not bad-- looks pretty good.

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:51.620
I like that.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.860
That's why I want to-- now,
if we go back to the input,

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.470
what is it that--

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:01.770
of these parameters, what is
it that I might need to check?

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.880
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
What is that?

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.505
Say that again.

00:53:04.505 --> 00:53:05.915
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:05.915 --> 00:53:07.290
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
So I might--

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.630
I have a 4-by-4 grid.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.690
Would I get a-- would I get
curvy band structures if I do

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:13.740
a 1-by-1-by-1?

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:17.140
Let's see.

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:20.340
Let's try it.

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.000
I'll do 14.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.340
This seems to be stable for now.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:33.670
Uh-oh, where's my
Simulate button?

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:47.340
There it is.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:54.290
So I'm doing a
1-by-1-by-1 k-point.

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:56.310
This is another
key concept I want

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:59.000
to make sure we understand.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:53:59.630
There it is.

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:00.740
There's silicon.

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.690
I didn't change anything
about the real space.

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:04.482
I didn't change anything
about the k-space.

00:54:04.482 --> 00:54:09.020
I just only evaluated
the density at one point.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.800
Now, here's what's going
to perhaps surprise

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.200
you, which is that the band
structure still curves.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:23.510
Now-- and it curves
differently, actually,

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:27.410
than it did when
I had 4-by-4-by-4.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:28.610
Why would it still curve?

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:35.400
This is actually something
I didn't talk about yet.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.950
But it is an aside that I
was going to talk about.

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:43.053
But since I have it here,
I'll just talk about it now.

00:54:43.053 --> 00:54:44.970
I probably could have
done all that internally

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:46.980
without voicing it.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:50.220
But here we are.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:56.970
So you see, when you
calculate the band structure,

00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:00.610
what you do is
you do two things.

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:04.620
First, you converge the
wave function in density.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.640
First, you converge the
density at the k-points I input

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.920
into the input.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.130
So if I have a 1-by-1-by-1
k-point density, well,

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.897
that gives me some grid.

00:55:17.897 --> 00:55:19.980
That gives me some density
and some wave function.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:25.900
Now, then to calculate the band
structure, what the code does

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.400
is it does a second step.

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.410
It takes that converged density.

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:31.750
And it cruises
around in k-space.

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:33.880
And that's how it
plots this out.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.830
But it doesn't change
the density anymore.

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:37.747
It doesn't change the
converged wave function.

00:55:37.747 --> 00:55:39.430
It just evaluates
it at all kinds

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:41.540
of different points in k-space.

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.500
So there's two steps.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:48.020
First, you converge the density
at some number of k-points.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.870
Then you cruise around
in the Brillouin zone

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:52.490
with that density.

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:54.710
And you evaluate your functions.

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:59.060
And sure, the wrong
density will still

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:01.820
wiggle as you move
around in k-space.

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.140
It'll still wiggle.

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.700
But it's the wrong
density because I

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.990
didn't have enough k-points in
the first place to converge it.

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.990
Does everybody see that?

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:14.500
So now, how many
k-points do I need?

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.320
Well, the number
of k-points I need

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.110
is when this converges
and doesn't change anymore

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.450
if the band structure--
if properties of the band

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:24.040
structure are what I want.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.050
That's how many k-points I need.

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:29.610
Does everybody see that?

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:30.600
That's the difference.

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:36.240
Now-- no.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.560
That wasn't good.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.310
Here we go.

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:41.410
Oh, yeah.

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:43.390
These so-called web browsers--

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:46.605
Marc Andreessen was my
student, by the way, that--

00:56:46.605 --> 00:56:48.770
does anybody know who he is?

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:50.432
No one knows who he is.

00:56:50.432 --> 00:56:51.800
I'm dated.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.120
No.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.100
He was at Illinois,
where I did my PhD.

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.240
And I was his TA.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:01.300
And he went and
founded Netscape--

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:01.800
good guy.

00:57:04.485 --> 00:57:06.360
That's not one of my
browser options anymore.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.880
So what's up with that?

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.320
Now, what I want to do
now is the following.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.340
I'm going to go to one atom.

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:22.957
And what I want to know is--

00:57:22.957 --> 00:57:23.790
and you can do that.

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:27.450
Just like before,
you can mess around.

00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:32.247
One atom-- we'll just
leave it at one k-point.

00:57:32.247 --> 00:57:34.830
And what I want to know is, am
I going to get a band structure

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:37.560
with one atom in the unit cell?

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.640
Oh, there it is.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.082
They're kind of far apart.

00:57:41.082 --> 00:57:42.040
What do you guys think?

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.520
That's one atom in the
corner of an FCC cell.

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:57.740
Will I get a band structure?

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.173
Just say yes or no.

00:58:00.173 --> 00:58:01.650
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:03.410
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
There it is.

00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:06.578
Now, why is it curving?

00:58:06.578 --> 00:58:07.870
Let me ask it a different way.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.900
How could I get these
bands to stop curving?

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.732
Just stop curving already!

00:58:12.732 --> 00:58:14.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:14.840
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
What is that?

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.250
AUDIENCE: Larger k-mesh space?

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:19.473
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Larger
k-mesh space or other space?

00:58:19.473 --> 00:58:20.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] space.

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.290
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Why
are they curving again?

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:25.700
Why are these things curving?

00:58:30.947 --> 00:58:34.286
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:35.217 --> 00:58:36.300
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:38.860
It has to do with that.

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.880
But why do you get-- we talked
a lot in the last half-hour

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.360
about how you get this variation
in k-space of the band.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.490
Why do you get that, again?

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:52.287
Why do you get that?

00:58:52.287 --> 00:58:53.870
You get it because
of Bloch's theorem.

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:54.662
I'll tell you that.

00:58:54.662 --> 00:58:56.516
But why does that matter?

00:58:56.516 --> 00:58:57.740
AUDIENCE: It's periodic.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.290
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
It's periodic.

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:02.760
You got a periodic potential.

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.000
And so if it's--

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.810
so when would you expect the
curviness to stop curving?

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:17.860
Well-- or if you don't really
have a crystal anymore.

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.780
This looks a little less curvy.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:22.420
What if I actually
made the spacing--

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.650
if I changed the
lattice constant to 10

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:27.333
and then simulated?

00:59:27.333 --> 00:59:28.500
What's going to happen then?

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.640
That was pretty fast.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.390
And look at that.

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:36.670
Now they're far apart.

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:37.840
They sort of look like--

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:42.085
let's see.

00:59:42.085 --> 00:59:43.210
There's the band structure.

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:45.490
Ooh!

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:47.690
I love that reaction there.

00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:50.590
That was-- that had
some meaning in it.

00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:55.330
Whoever that was, thank you,
because I felt a connection.

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:57.080
What just happened?

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.660
What is this?

00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.320
What are these?

01:00:02.962 --> 01:00:03.920
AUDIENCE: Energy bands.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.970
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Energy bands.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:06.320
They are still energy bands--

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.940
varying k-space.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.410
But they don't vary in k-space.

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.285
But you-- doesn't mean
you can't compute them

01:00:11.285 --> 01:00:13.340
at different k-points,
which the code did.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:18.340
But they're flat, which
means they're not really

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.830
interacting in any sort
of periodic way anymore.

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:23.020
They're so far apart that
the periodic potentials

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.740
don't really overlap.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.270
They don't feel each other.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.730
So what do I have left then?

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:28.930
What is it?

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:30.654
What am I staring at?

01:00:30.654 --> 01:00:31.593
AUDIENCE: Silicon.

01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:33.010
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Silicon atom.

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.635
That's all that--
those are the states.

01:00:34.635 --> 01:00:37.624
That's-- which state is that?

01:00:37.624 --> 01:00:39.757
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:39.757 --> 01:00:40.840
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.130
But which state is that?

01:00:45.677 --> 01:00:46.308
AUDIENCE: 4s?

01:00:46.308 --> 01:00:48.850
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It would
be if we had all the electrons.

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:49.850
So it is a little tough.

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:51.720
But we only have the outer four.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.380
So it's actually the 3s.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.660
3s, 3p-- our friend,
silicon atom, is back.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.750
We went from atoms to
molecules to solids.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:04.350
And now we just did an atom.

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:06.480
And you see, as I
bring those atoms,

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.190
as I-- so those are the
atomic levels of silicon.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:12.450
They don't vary in k-space.

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:15.330
A molecule of silicon
wouldn't vary in k-space.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:18.570
But as I start to
make this thing feel

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:26.310
a "repeatiness," then
Bloch's theorem kicks in

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.920
and energies depend on k.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.640
And that changes the
properties of the material.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.340
So that's all really important.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.360
Now, one more thing while
we have the tool up--

01:01:42.982 --> 01:01:44.440
well, so now we're
actually-- we're

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.992
pretty well-equipped to
try a whole bunch of stuff.

01:01:46.992 --> 01:01:48.950
And we're going to
understand what we're doing.

01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:51.140
Let me just ask
you one more thing.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.930
If I look at these inputs--

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:57.150
let's pull up
alpha-quartz, let's say.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:59.940
There's alpha-quartz.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.540
Now, if I look at these
inputs, what else might

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.040
you want to think
about converging?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.610
We talked about the
k-point mesh, something

01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:10.808
not as bad as alpha-quartz.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:19.270
Aluminum-- well,
that's nice, one atom.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:20.950
What else besides
the k-point mesh,

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:25.160
and you better use more
k-points than one for aluminum--

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.260
besides that, what else might--
ooh, I just pointed to it--

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:31.650
might I want to converge
or make sure is right--

01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:32.910
the lattice constant.

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:39.270
You see, I'm just giving this
to you because it's there.

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:40.630
Where did it come from?

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:43.500
Is it the right lattice
constant for this choice

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.950
of theory and basis set?

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:49.060
Is it the right one?

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.110
Well, you should make sure there
are no forces in the system.

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:54.420
You should relax your system.

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.170
And that gets to the
point I want to make.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.030
How do you relax a
solid, because there's

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:01.557
now two things, not one,
that you need to care about?

01:03:01.557 --> 01:03:02.890
Tell me what the two things are.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.220
Well, how do you
relax a molecule?

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.650
When you say optimize
structure, what's it doing?

01:03:12.452 --> 01:03:14.210
AUDIENCE: Minimizing
free energy.

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:17.143
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
By doing what?

01:03:17.143 --> 01:03:18.060
What's it calculating?

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:18.768
AUDIENCE: Energy.

01:03:21.142 --> 01:03:23.100
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Which is also called what?

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:23.767
AUDIENCE: Force.

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:26.250
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
The force on each atom.

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:27.780
And it pushes them
along the force

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.240
until they get to some minimum.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.550
Now, when I have a
solid, I have two things.

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:36.210
I have the force on each
atom, same as the molecule,

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:39.150
the force on each atom in
the basis, as well as what?

01:03:42.608 --> 01:03:43.353
AUDIENCE: Volume.

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:45.770
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: The volume,
which is set by the what?

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:46.510
AUDIENCE: Lattice constant.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.700
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: By
the lattice constant.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:53.260
So you need to
converge both of those.

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:57.340
And, well, in aluminum, there's
only one atom in the basis

01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:02.390
because, you see,
aluminum is an FCC metal.

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:06.190
So all I need is one atom in
the corner of an FCC unit cell.

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:07.360
And I can simulate it.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.940
But there is the
lattice constant

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:11.050
that I need to play with.

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:13.660
Now, if I had a
more complex solid,

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:17.110
like alpha-quartz, which has a
number of atoms in the basis,

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:20.733
then the relative positions of
those atoms may be important.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.520
And you may need to relax that.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.818
You may not.

01:04:26.818 --> 01:04:28.610
But it's something you
need to be aware of.

01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:29.390
And you can go in.

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:31.473
And you can look at the
forces on these materials.

01:04:31.473 --> 01:04:35.060
And you definitely have
to know whether you're

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:38.360
at the minimum in terms
of the lattice constant.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.210
So let's do aluminum
just because it's here.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:45.440
We'll do four k-points, which is
not enough to look at a metal.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.515
But we'll do it because
it should be fairly fast.

01:04:52.613 --> 01:04:53.405
There's the energy.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:05.700
And-- oh, look at that.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.010
Isn't that beautiful?

01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:09.530
It knew to change the
color and everything--

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:12.440
very smart, smart tool.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.102
And here we go back.

01:05:14.102 --> 01:05:15.560
And tell me--
somebody tell me what

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.143
they think the band
structure is going

01:05:17.143 --> 01:05:19.220
to look like for aluminum.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.373
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Is it going to be what?

01:05:22.373 --> 01:05:23.120
Flat?

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:23.480
AUDIENCE: Curved.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.647
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Curved.

01:05:24.647 --> 01:05:26.130
How many say curved?

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:26.930
How many say flat?

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.180
Good.

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:31.810
Look at that.

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.500
That's curved.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.690
That's seriously curved.

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:40.870
And if we include-- if we
looked at different energies,

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:46.510
we'd see even more
spaghetti, lots of curvy--

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.340
Oh, and look at this.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.020
Oh, let's get the DoS.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.250
This is so exciting.

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:53.980
I forgot about the DoS.

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:57.580
There's the DoS near
the Fermi energy.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.290
Fermi energy is right here.

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.570
Is there a gap in this material?

01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:02.470
No.

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:04.330
Should there have been?

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:07.210
No because,
remember, in a metal,

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:11.110
you've got states coming
in all over the place

01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:14.790
from below the Fermi energy and
above-- continues across it.

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:18.610
That's what tells
you it's a metal.

01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.950
Now, is alpha-quartz-- let's--

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:23.330
that's a nice material.

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:26.170
Mostly, I want to
simulate it because I

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:29.480
think it'll be pretty-looking.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.910
And there it is.

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:39.580
Now, is alpha-quartz-- I'm
going to go down to 2 by 2.

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:48.494
Is alpha-quartz a metal or a
semiconductor, or what is it?

01:06:48.494 --> 01:06:49.790
AUDIENCE: Insulator?

01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:51.570
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Insulator?

01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:52.070
Yeah.

01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:56.120
What's one clue to the fact
that it's an insulator?

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:56.790
What is that?

01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:58.796
AUDIENCE: The inflection
in your voice.

01:06:58.796 --> 01:07:00.500
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.420
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
I'm that easy to read?

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.820
Man, I got to work on that.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:09.150
Is it an insulator or a metal?

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.950
I'll try.

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:12.890
Well, besides the
inflection in my voice,

01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:14.880
what else could give you a clue?

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:20.710
Well, look at it.

01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:21.955
Is it a transparent material?

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:23.080
Well, you can't tell there.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:23.990
Ooh, it is pretty.

01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:25.440
Look at this.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.580
Isn't that cool?

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.550
See, this is a periodically
repeating structure.

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:31.910
But the basis has
nine atoms in it.

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:33.745
It's a more complex structure.

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.240
And let's look.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.520
Now, it's an insulator.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.190
I'm going to totally
agree with that.

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.590
You see right through it.

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:49.680
So you know it's not what?

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.700
Absorbing in the
visible, at least.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.720
But since it's an insulator
and it has a large band gap,

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.730
even though it's
a solid, what do

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.520
you think the bands are going
to look like, curvy or not

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.894
so curvy?

01:08:04.894 --> 01:08:07.230
AUDIENCE: Not so curvy.

01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:08.760
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Not as curvy.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.800
They're not usually as curvy.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.100
So here's the DoS.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.360
Look at that beautiful band gap.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.439
This is a band gap
only a mother could--

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:20.970
a father or mother--

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:24.000
that's the beautiful--
and look at this.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.970
There's the band structure.

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:33.160
And you can see that--
look at all those bands.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.319
Look at all those levels.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:35.399
And they do curve.

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:36.359
They do curve.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:37.986
But they're not as crazy--

01:08:37.986 --> 01:08:39.569
well, they are kind
of spaghetti-like.

01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:42.569
But they're not spaghetti-like
near the Fermi energy

01:08:42.569 --> 01:08:44.100
or near the gap.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.120
So you look at that.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.910
And you're like,
insulator, first of all,

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:49.649
just because of
how big the gap is.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:51.359
And then what
we're going to do--

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.310
and I still have just
10 minutes for today.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:55.200
But on Thursday, what
we're going to do

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.490
is we're going to show
how, when you look at this,

01:08:57.490 --> 01:09:00.899
you can say, not a very
good conductor, certainly

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:03.271
not a good hole conductor.

01:09:03.271 --> 01:09:04.729
This is where the
holes would move.

01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:05.689
This is where the
electrons would

01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:08.050
move because we're going
to get to that a little bit

01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:08.550
on Thursday.

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:12.260
Band structure is so
rich with information.

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.279
It's a beautiful thing.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:16.120
It's emotional.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.194
And if any of you are
feeling that, it's OK.

01:09:19.194 --> 01:09:20.319
I'm touching the mic again.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.279
Sorry.

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:21.819
It's OK.

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:23.540
We're good.

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.400
Check that.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:24.900
Roger.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:33.069
So we're simulating solids.

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:34.660
You understand about
band structures.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:41.620
We've talked about silicon
and occupied, unoccupied--

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:45.170
you can get the densities,
just like you can in molecules.

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:51.439
And as I said, you
can calculate the--

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:51.939
you what?

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:54.580
You need to find the
equilibrium lattice constant.

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:58.437
And so if you just
do the calculation

01:09:58.437 --> 01:10:00.020
at different lattice
constants, you'll

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.860
get a variation in energy.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:03.860
That's what will happen.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.420
And you'll get a minimum.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.340
And that'll be the
lattice constant

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.800
that you should run at
for your simulations.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.035
And that's pretty important.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.830
But if you had that
curve already, well,

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:19.530
then you've also got the bulk
modulus, which is pretty cool.

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:22.040
Now, I think that you
probably did this calculation

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.470
using classical potentials.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.990
Is that right?

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:28.130
You calculated the bulk modulus?

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:29.920
So this isn't any different.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.250
It's just the-- did you do--

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:35.200
you did periodically
repeating structures,

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.840
right, using classical
force fields?

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:46.570
I'm seeing a whole
lot of "I'm not sure."

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:48.630
Yeah?

01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:50.695
It's a very "I'm not
sure" kind of moment.

01:10:50.695 --> 01:10:52.392
It's OK.

01:10:52.392 --> 01:10:53.620
It's OK.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:58.426
Is it-- did you look at solid
materials in your homeworks?

01:10:58.426 --> 01:11:01.270
It's still no, not so sure.

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:03.340
Silicon?

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:04.510
Carbon?

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.068
Not so much.

01:11:07.068 --> 01:11:08.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] proteins.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:09.750
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Proteins?

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:15.810
So proteins are a bit
more complex of a beast,

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:18.390
by the way, which you
can't really do using--

01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:21.520
you can do parts of proteins
using quantum mechanics.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.510
But it's just too hard.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:24.420
It's too big.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:29.950
You can't do that many atoms
to do most full-sized proteins.

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:35.400
So that's a great problem to
study with classical models.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.220
For crystals, like
the two-atom silicon,

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.110
eight electrons-- are
all those crystals

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:43.140
in there-- and not to
say 1,000 electrons.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.290
You can do things like calculate
the change in the lattice

01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:46.883
with--

01:11:46.883 --> 01:11:48.300
change in energy
with the lattice.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:51.440
And from that-- well,
this is the volume.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.780
But that's just the same as
the change in the lattice.

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.280
And from that second
derivative, you

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.822
can get the bulk modulus, which
is a very important property.

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.130
And this is something
I just went through.

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:05.797
This was that slide
that I talked about.

01:12:05.797 --> 01:12:10.460
But it was-- really should have
been an internal discussion.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:14.840
And where you find the
converged ground state density

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.960
and potential with some
k-point mesh that you gave it--

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.340
that's what you input--

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.250
is the k-points that go
into that calculation.

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:25.700
And then for that, you calculate
the energies at k-points

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.110
along all the lines.

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:30.380
And some software-- well,
step 3 is not really a step.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.440
But use some
software to plot it.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.875
And you can download the data
for this from the nanoHUB.

01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:37.250
There's a-- I've
been showing you

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:39.750
the version of the plot that
gives you the Greek characters,

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:40.550
which is an image.

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:42.883
But there's another version
that gives you the raw data.

01:12:42.883 --> 01:12:44.822
It just doesn't put
the characters on it.

01:12:44.822 --> 01:12:47.030
But that will allow you to
compare one run to another

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:50.570
and download the raw data.

01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:57.030
And then calculating the DoS
is also a two-step process.

01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:59.030
You converge the ground
state density potential.

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:01.510
And then you use that potential
to calculate the energies.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:04.570
And usually, you want to
do this at a dense k-mesh

01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:10.840
because the subtle variations--
see, in a molecule, oftentimes,

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.520
the DoS is pretty clear.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:22.340
If I turn-- well, I guess
I could've just done this.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.260
If I turn, say, an atom
or a molecule on its side,

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.100
then I have this.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.540
And you use some kind
of smearing function.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.970
And so your-- well, that
was a bad centering.

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:40.405
And so your DoS
would look like that.

01:13:40.405 --> 01:13:41.780
But there'd be
bigger peaks where

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.910
you have lots of states
and smaller peaks

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:45.330
where you don't have many.

01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:49.760
But, you see, now, I'm
turning a band structure,

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.770
and you saw alpha-quartz--
so now I'm turning--

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:58.080
see if I can just show
it one more time--

01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.050
oh, man.

01:13:59.050 --> 01:13:59.550
Seriously?

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:00.690
Oh, it was in another--

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:06.010
I'm turning this
on its side now.

01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:08.920
And that's not as easy.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.820
That's trickier.

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.460
So there's different
weights of a band

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.140
at different parts in energy.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:19.660
And when I turn this on this
side, you can get DoS shapes,

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:23.170
Density of States, that
are-- that have a--

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:25.360
more features in them.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.200
And to get all those
features just right,

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.210
you need to use a dense
k-point mesh, which

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:34.240
is what the code does.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.150
This can be measured.

01:14:35.150 --> 01:14:38.770
The DoS can be measured
experimentally--

01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:42.220
can use STM to actually
directly measure the DoS.

01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:47.020
And we talked
about this already.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.320
You fill up your electrons
to the Fermi level.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.280
If there's any bands
crossing, it's a metal.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.580
If not, it's an insulator
or a semiconductor.

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:58.930
If you have an odd number of
electrons in the unit cell,

01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:01.740
it has to be a metal
because the Fermi level is

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:04.590
going to come in in the middle.

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:07.030
Each band takes two electrons.

01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:08.650
So if you fill up
to the Fermi level

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:11.070
and the Fermi level is
in the middle of a band,

01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:12.750
by definition, it's a metal--

01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:20.270
sodium.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:23.540
And then here is a
picture of diamond.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:26.270
And the thing that I
want to, again, emphasize

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:33.590
is that from DFT, these
characters of these wiggles

01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:36.740
and of these features
are pretty darn good,

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:40.680
but this distance is not.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:45.000
And so what we-- what we're
going to do in this class,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.030
and we're going to
be proud about it,

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:49.190
is we're going to just
shift these bands up

01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:51.975
by a rigid amount
to fix the gap.

01:15:51.975 --> 01:15:52.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:55.058
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: That
was probably electronvolts.

01:15:55.058 --> 01:15:56.990
Yeah, it says it
here, electronvolts.

01:15:56.990 --> 01:16:02.440
And here, it looks like--
what do we have, like,

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.270
a 3-eV gap from DFT?

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.040
And so that's about half.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.780
Very often, DFT gives you
a gap that's about half

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:16.230
of the experimental gap,
very often, not at--

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:18.750
always, but very often.

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:22.920
For germanium, it makes it
a semimetal, which it's not.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.134
Does anybody know
what a semimetal is?

01:16:25.134 --> 01:16:26.398
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:26.398 --> 01:16:27.690
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Not quite.

01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.280
Here's an indirect band gap.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.350
A semimetal is a cool material.

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:37.080
Germanium is not a
semimetal, but DFT

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.650
will tell you it is
because of the gap problem.

01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:42.570
Here's an indirect
band gap material.

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:43.980
Which one is it?

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:44.730
AUDIENCE: Silicon.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:45.120
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:45.620
Sure.

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.880
Why not?

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:52.770
And if it's silicon, this
will be 1.1 eV in experiment

01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:55.995
and about 0.6 eV in DFT.

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.760
And that's the band gap error.

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.983
But again, you can shift it.

01:17:02.983 --> 01:17:04.400
And that's what
we're going to do.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.130
We're going to be OK with that.

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:10.430
In-- if you switch to germanium,
experiment says it's about

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:13.550
a 0.6- or 0.7-eV gap,
something around there.

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:17.720
But DFT-- that's silicon.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.210
But DFT will put it here.

01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:22.295
It'll put this
conduction band below.

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:26.650
It has to actually--

01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:29.440
it's-- why didn't
I draw that right?

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.390
It's actually-- comes below.

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:39.250
So that is a semimetal
when you have,

01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:43.630
basically, its crossings
across the Fermi level,

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:46.660
but in an indirect--
from indirect states.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:47.890
That's called a semimetal.

01:17:47.890 --> 01:17:50.980
And DFT will tell you germanium
is that, which is not--

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.510
but you can still shift all
those states up, which we do.

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:56.350
Oh, there's a metal.

01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:57.790
Oh, look at that, spaghetti.

01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:59.530
You now know-- oh,
and there it is.

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:02.477
See, often in papers, you'll
see in the literature--

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:04.060
so you're now becoming
sort of experts

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:09.220
at seeing a band structure and
seeing it, really seeing it.

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.350
And it's a powerful thing.

01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:13.263
And there it is with
the DoS next to it,

01:18:13.263 --> 01:18:15.430
you see, because that's
just this on the side, which

01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:22.190
is why you then plot
the DoS sideways, often,

01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:24.290
except that doesn't
quite look right.

01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:28.100
But anyway-- oh, maybe this--

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.528
yeah.

01:18:30.528 --> 01:18:31.570
That's what it should be.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:37.080
And then we've
talked about this.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.538
And we're going to
talk about this.

01:18:38.538 --> 01:18:40.413
We're going to come back
to this a little bit

01:18:40.413 --> 01:18:42.390
when we talk about solar cells.

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:44.070
But I have mentioned
this a bunch.

01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:47.670
Certainly, this would be a
good third homework set--

01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:51.750
is to think about this indirect
versus direct band gap problem.

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:54.720
Somebody tell me, again,
why silicon solar cells

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.690
are expensive just so I
can go home today and feel

01:18:57.690 --> 01:19:01.240
really good or really bad
because it's bad news?

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] bandgap.

01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:02.730
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:05.280
But why is that-- why does
that make silicon solar cells

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.083
expensive?

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:08.683
AUDIENCE: You have
to make them thick.

01:19:08.683 --> 01:19:11.016
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Why do
you have to make them thick?

01:19:11.016 --> 01:19:14.502
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.910
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah,
because you've got to get--

01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:23.160
you see, you got to get--

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.710
I think I had it shown here.

01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:25.240
Yeah.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.867
See, that's easy
for a photon to do.

01:19:27.867 --> 01:19:28.700
I talked about this.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.310
Now, here it is in the cartoon.

01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:34.120
That's easy for a photon to do.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.990
That's easy for a photon to do
at different places in energy.

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:40.000
And this would be
absorbing light.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.500
These blue arrows
would be the light

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.540
that come from the
solar flux that you're

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:46.270
downloading in your homework.

01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:48.820
That's where these
blue arrows come.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.980
And it's easy for those
blue arrows to do this.

01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:55.540
But to see-- the thing that
matters is this minimum amount

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:59.470
of energy, the band gap of the
material that is the lowest

01:19:59.470 --> 01:20:02.290
amount of energy that it would
take to get an electron up

01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:04.630
from the valence into
the conduction bands.

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:08.080
And that, in this
case, is not vertical.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.890
It's not vertical.

01:20:08.890 --> 01:20:10.577
It's an indirect gap.

01:20:10.577 --> 01:20:11.410
Did I have it there?

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.460
And because of that, it's not
very good at absorbing light.

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:21.360
Those photons,
those blue lines--

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.130
let's get them back here.

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:26.300
Those blue lines--
they need help.

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:28.120
They can do this.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.160
But they can't do this.

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.770
And to do this, you need help.

01:20:32.770 --> 01:20:35.710
So you need some kind of kick.

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:38.620
And that means it's a much
less efficient process.

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:43.420
And absorbing light in that
whole region of the spectrum

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:46.150
where a photon would need to
do this-- that whole region

01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:47.260
is very inefficient.

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.910
And yet that's where the sun is.

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:50.230
That's where the sun is.

01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:52.510
And so you've got to
make them really thick.

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:54.320
It's inefficient, but not zero.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.570
So you make them really thick.

01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:57.310
So you get that
region of the sun.

01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:59.980
But to make them
really thick, you see,

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.763
you're generating
electrons and holes.

01:21:02.763 --> 01:21:05.180
And those-- that generation
of electrons and holes-- well,

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.450
that-- then you've
got to get them out.

01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:10.690
You can't just let
them stay there.

01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:14.970
And to get them out, well,
you need a good material.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:19.080
And if they have to go
a long ways to get out,

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.230
which they do because you have
to make it so thick because it

01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:25.520
doesn't absorb light well
because of the band structure,

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.978
then--

01:21:26.978 --> 01:21:27.770
where was I, again?

01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:28.395
No.

01:21:28.395 --> 01:21:32.030
Then you need it to be
a really pure material.

01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:34.530
That costs money.

01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:37.900
Otherwise, they'll run into
traps and other things.

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:40.410
So what we're going
to do is, on Thursday,

01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:43.660
we'll talk a little bit more
about some other properties.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:46.470
We'll talk about
magnetism, very briefly

01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:49.303
show you that you can
do molecular dynamics,

01:21:49.303 --> 01:21:50.220
a couple other things.

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.690
And then we'll start turning
our attention to solar cells.

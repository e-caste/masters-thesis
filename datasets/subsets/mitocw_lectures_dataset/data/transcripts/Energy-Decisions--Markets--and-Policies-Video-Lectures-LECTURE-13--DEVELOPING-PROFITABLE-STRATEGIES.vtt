RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So today what

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:29.290
we're going to talk
about, we're going

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.240
to move from the
descriptive discussions

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.030
of organizational
decision-making

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.430
to a couple of prescriptive
sessions, which

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.730
is if you're running an energy
business, how do you do it?

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.790
One of the things,
as this indicates

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.500
that we talked
about you should do,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.630
you should be doing
present value analysis,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.440
net present value analysis
of investment opportunities.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.470
But that's not strategy.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.430
So today and next
time, we're going

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.070
to be talking about strategy.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.580
We'll talk about industry
attractiveness briefly,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.270
kinds of strategies and niches
within industries, and then

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.700
the Husky case.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.990
Wednesday, Don Lessard's going
to be here and explore with you

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.340
business models, particularly
in innovative segments.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.740
So project by project, net
present value isn't strategy.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.510
If a firm accepts every proposal
with a net present value,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.840
a positive net present
value, the result

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.460
is likely to be very
incoherent and unmanageable.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.300
The Brealey piece is sort of
a finance person's skepticism.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.490
The first thing you
note is you only

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.450
see proposals with
positive net present value.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.430
If someone likes a
project, it turns out

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.110
it has a positive
net present value.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.060
So what they propose, and
we'll explore a little bit,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.180
is thinking about disequilibria,
thinking about will it last.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.430
It has a net present
value because we're

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.600
cheaper than they are.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.180
OK, why are we
cheaper than they are?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.340
We can buy materials
more cheaply than they.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.970
Why?

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.960
Will it last?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.520
Will it last?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.660
Annika and I saw,
before vacation,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.900
a very detailed analysis
of US versus Chinese

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.510
photovoltaic
manufacturing costs.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.400
It concluded that the
big Chinese advantage

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.210
was they could get materials
and supplies 25% cheaper.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.090
And the first question is, why?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.827
Is that going to last?

00:02:37.827 --> 00:02:39.660
The people who'd done
the study hadn't quite

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.430
inquired into that, and said it
was superior bargaining power.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.160
Superior bargaining
power doesn't last.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.970
So first point in the
Brealey et al. piece

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.180
is skepticism about
present value.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.570
Porter's paper is in
a way more profound,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.020
and really does
deserve a serious read.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.160
Strategy is what you won't do.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.010
What is it you won't
do as a company?

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.050
Someone walks in the
door with a project

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.810
with a positive
net present value.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.540
When do you just say,
no, you're right,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.100
that's a positive
net present value.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.142
We're not going to do it.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.120
The argument is this--

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.480
if you're doing the same thing
your competitors are, and there

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480
are a bunch of them,
you're in a wonderful world

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.530
of perfect competition.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.090
We all enjoy that.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.350
It's in the textbooks.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.730
It's easy to analyze.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.800
And it's no fun.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.740
You don't make any money,
particularly if there

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.300
are opportunities to innovate.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.010
You have to innovate just to
cover your cost of capital.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.670
There's a little quote
from Warren Buffett, which

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.000
I think still holds true, that
since the dawn of aviation

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.650
the total profits earned by
airlines adds up to zero.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.080
Airlines have gotten
enormously more efficient.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.830
They've done enormous
things for transportation

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.600
for the country as
a whole, but they

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.110
haven't made any money,
because mostly they're

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.330
all doing the same thing.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.830
And there are a bunch of them.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.490
And there's no
differentiation or stickiness.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.540
So the first lesson
is, if you're

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.710
running a company you
don't want to be there.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.010
As Porter points out, if
you're in that situation--

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.230
I mean, airlines have
improved efficiency enormously

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.370
over the years.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.570
Fuel costs are down.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.790
Electronic reservation
systems, baggage

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.167
handling-- much more efficient
than they used to be,

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:39.750
and they're still
not making any money

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.250
because they're all doing it.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.790
And if you don't innovate
and improve, you lose.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.752
Andrew?

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.110
AUDIENCE: I was just--

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.210
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Just
drying your nail polish?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.760
OK, good.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.610
It's important to have it dry.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.810
So lesson one is you
don't want to do that.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.900
Lesson two is sort of the
obvious counterpoint, which

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.000
is when you set up
a business, you'd

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.990
like to be doing something
that's of value to somebody

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.690
that can't be easily imitated.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.060
The buzzword is
"sustainable advantage."

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.770
So the notion that Chinese
photovoltaics will always

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.740
be cheaper because
Chinese bargaining power

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.000
enables them to get silicon
25% cheaper than US firms--

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.920
that doesn't wash.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.320
If that's what's going on,
that's not sustainable.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.400
If there is some cost advantage
in silicon production,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.570
that's more interesting.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.030
But if all you know
is it's cheaper,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.170
and all you hear is "bargaining
power," that's not sustainable.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.640
So if strategy is
what you don't do,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.640
and it needs to be something
that can't easily be imitated,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.250
how about the question
I posed there--

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.420
does MIT have a strategy?

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.170
If so, what is it?

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.020
Or what are elements of it?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.875
Yeah.

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:05.180
AUDIENCE: Hands-on learning.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.980
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Hands-on learning.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.270
OK, what does that rule out?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.702
It's an element of what
MIT is about, absolutely.

00:06:14.702 --> 00:06:19.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] You have
to limit the amount of people

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.530
that you let in,
because you can't

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.400
have 50,000 people [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.280
So it's a high cost strategy.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.560
What does it say about the
kinds of things you teach?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.877
Medical school has
hands-on learning.

00:06:34.877 --> 00:06:36.460
And MIT doesn't have
a medical school.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.090
Simpler question-- Caroline,
what's Wellesley's strategy?

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.120
Does Wellesley have a strategy?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
to educate women.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.050
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Educate women in everything?

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.230
Does Wellesley have a
big engineering school?

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.920
Liberal arts-- focuses on
women, focuses on liberal arts,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.540
doesn't offer graduate
degrees, stay small.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.510
That's pretty easy.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.500
What about MIT?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.780
It's more than just
hands-on learning.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.760
MIT doesn't have a law school.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.010
Harvard has a law school.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.070
Harvard has had a law
school for a long time.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.110
Presumably those are
strategic differences.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.070
Yes, somebody actually
sat down and said,

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.480
should MIT have a law school?

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.340
No, MIT shouldn't.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.000
That decision has been looked
at several times in history.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.720
Why do you think?

00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:37.795
AUDIENCE: So they can focus
on being the best in science

00:07:37.795 --> 00:07:38.772
and engineering.

00:07:38.772 --> 00:07:41.230
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It focuses
on science and engineering,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.840
and things that complement
and work with it.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.810
So does economics make sense?

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.260
Yeah, it does,
historically it does.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
One of the early
presidents of MIT

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.630
was the founder of the
American Economic Association,

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.990
so somebody thought
it made sense.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.080
We've done business
for a long time,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.080
almost since the start
of the institute.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.090
How about linguistics?

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.410
Why do we do linguistics?

00:08:14.012 --> 00:08:15.387
AUDIENCE: I've
heard it's largely

00:08:15.387 --> 00:08:18.492
because of Noam Chomsky, because
he developed the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:18.492 --> 00:08:20.950
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah, I
think that's the right answer.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.700
I mean, my sense is a
whole bunch of decisions

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.830
have been made that a
whole bunch of areas

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.750
will be basically
service departments,

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.049
so that we can actually
give a rounded education.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:36.490
And into that-- history, we
don't do advanced degrees

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.900
in history.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.120
And sociology we don't have.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.070
Psychology is very focused.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.803
But into languages and
linguistics stumbles

00:08:45.803 --> 00:08:48.220
Noam Chomsky, and you say, oh,
my god, what an opportunity

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.100
this is, and so you build on it.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.620
But it's not a big department,
and it's pretty focused.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.533
And we don't have a lot
of modern languages.

00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:56.950
We don't have a
French department.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.690
We don't have a
Spanish department.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.120
There's probably a French
department at Wellesley, yes?

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.840
Yeah.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.520
We don't have one.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.710
So MIT does have a strategy.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.880
It's not perfectly--
not easily written down,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.090
but the strategic
descriptions have

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.270
to do with science,
engineering, and related fields,

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.310
and complementary fields.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.470
Wellesley's is pretty clear.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.790
Harvard's is we do
almost everything.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.793
We're a full-service supplier.

00:09:26.793 --> 00:09:28.210
It is interesting,
Harvard doesn't

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.252
have a veterinary school.

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:32.890
I'm not quite sure why, but they
have just about everything else

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.260
you could think about.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.590
I don't think they have
Library Science, but just about

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.740
everything else.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.920
So those are strategies.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.370
MIT has faced the
possibility of a law school.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.260
MIT could make money
with a law school,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.780
has decided not to
do it, has decided

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.120
not to have a medical school.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.200
That's a harder call.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.870
That's a more interesting
call, but has decided

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.270
not to do a medical school.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.050
Strategy is, to an important
extent, what you won't do.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.080
And you could certainly do a
net present value calculation

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.280
for the MIT Medical
School and come out

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.190
with a positive and
also social impact.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.190
You could also talk
about a law school

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.760
with heavy focus on patent
law and related intellectual

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.350
property fields, which
does, to a certain extent,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.890
complement, but also distracts.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.660
And that's a strategic choice.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.840
So universities, like all
kinds of other organizations,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.550
need to make strategic choices.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.010
Another strategy might be
we'll do almost anything that

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.210
will turn a profit.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.900
And you see some
places look like that.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.380
MIT very much doesn't.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.900
So if you're really thinking
about a sustainable advantage

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.120
of some sort, a
coherent strategy,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:11:03.880
you have to consider
the next bullet, or not.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.420
What the next bullet says
is, when the slide works,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.300
you have to think
about complementarities

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.905
or fit among
investment projects.

00:11:13.905 --> 00:11:15.280
Meantime, I'm
going to figure out

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.040
why this works or
this doesn't work.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.000
The nice piece that we had--

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.630
tech support, please.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.960
I have a frozen
machine at the moment.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.850
There are nice examples
in Porter about IKEA

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.150
and about Southwest
Airlines, and they're

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:39.510
great examples of taking on
things that fit together.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.060
Southwest Airlines
doesn't offer food.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.690
Southwest Airlines flies
out of small airports.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.770
Southwest Airlines flies
one kind of airplane.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:56.080
All those things fit together--
low cost, convenient.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.280
You could make a case
that gee, if we had more--

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.570
oh, and you don't book
through online services.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.748
You had a hammer?

00:12:05.748 --> 00:12:07.580
AUDIENCE: No, I
have to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.277
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
OK, thank you.

00:12:10.277 --> 00:12:12.610
All right, we're going to try
to do this without slides.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.527
It's going to be good.

00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:21.970
The examples there are
things that fit together.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.030
You could imagine Southwest
doing a calculation,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.750
and saying, well, if we used
online booking services,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.490
we'd get more volume.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.470
And that'll cost us x percent.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.110
And you could imagine
saying, well, it'll

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.410
increase our costs a little
bit, but it'll pay off.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.960
They have a relentless
focus on costs.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.525
We're not going to do it.

00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:44.650
We're not going to have
assigned seats-- that takes

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.000
time and extra gate personnel.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.670
We're not going to do online
reservations, because that'll

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.630
increase our costs.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.580
We're going to be
low cost, convenient.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.670
We're not going to have
different kinds of planes,

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.320
even though on some
routes we might

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.180
want to fly larger
planes, because that'll

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.190
increase our costs.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:09.830
So Southwest thinks about how
its decisions fit together.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.780
Similarly, the example of
IKEA, which you all probably

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.080
know better than I do, but you
go into a traditional furniture

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.900
store, you can get all
kinds of different things.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.810
You order them-- many
fabrics, many styles.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.610
It takes six to eight weeks.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.900
Some slave in North Carolina
makes it, and it's shipped up.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.470
IKEA doesn't offer that,
doesn't offer the customization.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.100
It offers cost, convenience,
and a certain look.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.840
That's what it focuses on.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.390
All of its decisions
aim for that.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.660
So that's a coherent strategy.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.610
You don't just
take anything with

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.110
a positive net present value.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.470
You ask how does it fit with
what we're trying to do?

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.800
How does it fit with
what we're trying to do?

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.980
An MIT law school might
have positive benefits.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.590
How does it fit
with the main focus?

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.860
How would the law school faculty
interact with other faculty?

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.450
Would it be the
kinds of people who

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.860
will fit well on the campus?

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.076
How would law students relate?

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:15.510
That's not to say that
that's an obvious question.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.720
I always think a more
interesting strategic choice

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.870
is, should MIT invest
more in public policy?

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.450
We have STS and so forth.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.250
We don't have the
Kennedy School.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.110
You could imagine
a case being made

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.510
for a serious public
policy school focused

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.520
on science and technology.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.410
That case hasn't been made.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.810
And that's a money
loser, by the way,

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.360
but it might have
other strategic value.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.513
Any hope?

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:42.830
AUDIENCE: They have to reboot
the machine [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.830
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: They
have to reboot the machine.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.690
OK.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.290
We now go to blackboard
for the next slide.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.510
The next slide has to do with--

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.890
and I can't do blackboard
with a jacket on.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:03.370
So the next slide has to do
with industry attractiveness.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:14.810
So as I said, this is about
thinking about what activities

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.560
you are doing.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.420
What are you offering customers?

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.970
If you're offering
customers the same things

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.510
as a lot of competitors,
then you can be really good,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.040
but unless there's
some way you're

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.890
better that can't be imitated,
you've got a problem.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:33.800
So if you look at
an industry and you

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:40.100
ask what things affect
profits, one thing

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.780
is the intensity of competition.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.020
Another thing is
pressure from suppliers--

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.490
I'll give you
examples in a minute.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:10.640
Another thing is pressure from
buyers, substitutes, and entry.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:24.860
This is an ugly version of the
famous Mike Porter Five Forces.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.100
If you understand this fully,
you're a third of the way

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.648
through the MBA
course in strategy.

00:16:36.648 --> 00:16:37.940
So let me try to do it quickly.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.810
It's not very hard--

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.160
maybe only a quarter
of the way through.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.480
Regardless of what the
supply conditions are,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.670
and whether they're
entrants or not,

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.980
if the industry is
perfectly competitive,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.970
nobody makes any money.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.190
That's sort of the definition.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:02.330
And obviously, competition runs
along some sort of spectrum

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.900
between a lot of small firms
beating each other's brains out

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.740
and one monopoly taking
everything there is to be had.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.740
So this is one force that
can affect competition,

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.890
can affect profits, is the
intensity of competition

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.290
within the industry.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:24.020
Another force is the existence
of close substitutes.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.109
We all make wax paper, and we're
great wax paper manufacturers,

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.320
but plastic wrap is
eating our lunch.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.030
And so there may be only two or
three of us making wax paper,

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:40.070
but with the availability
of cheap plastic wrap,

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.830
it means we have probably
declining demand.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.490
It means we probably have a
highly elastic demand curve.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.530
And even with a monopoly,
we can't make any money,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.400
so close, good
substitutes erode profits.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.120
Please have at it.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.010
I'm a wax paper manufacturer.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.610
There's only one of me, but
anybody and his kid sister

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.550
can make wax paper.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.002
That's not quite right, and
it could be his kid brother,

00:18:09.002 --> 00:18:10.210
too, don't mean to be sexist.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.720
But if it's really
easy for competitors

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.240
to come in if anybody's
making any money,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.170
nobody can sustain high profits.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.630
So you look at entry when
you do an industry analysis,

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.390
is it easy for
outsiders to come in?

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.316
What are the obstacles?

00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:29.300
Do you need
specialized knowledge?

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.450
Do you need huge capital?

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.320
What are the problems?

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.550
If there aren't any
obvious barriers--

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.682
we're making furniture
in North Carolina.

00:18:39.682 --> 00:18:41.890
What do you need to make
furniture in North Carolina?

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.270
You need to hire
good carpenters,

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.945
and get a supply of wood,
and have some design skill.

00:18:46.945 --> 00:18:48.580
Are those high
barriers to entry?

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.080
Probably not.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.420
So would you expect,
even if there are only

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.310
a small number of
furniture manufacturers,

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.185
would you expect them
to make a lot of money?

00:18:56.185 --> 00:18:58.840
Probably not.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:05.560
OK, suppliers-- my
favorite example

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.780
here really is
airlines, because one

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.360
of the things that characterized
airlines, particularly

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.190
under regulation, is
very strong unions.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.910
So while the airlines
didn't make any money,

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.590
airline employees did.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.752
Pilots earn very high salary
for relatively little work.

00:19:27.752 --> 00:19:29.210
Flight attendants--
this is, again,

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.180
in the days of regulation--
flight attendants

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.100
earned very high salaries.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.960
The regulators pushed prices
up, and most of the rent,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.200
most of the profit, went down
here to the unionized suppliers

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.470
because there was pretty
heavy competition up here.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:50.030
So we had competition here,
the ability here to earn rent.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.010
You see this in a
lot of industries

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.240
where there's relatively little
competition in the industry--

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.250
competition within the industry,
substitutes, buyers, entrants,

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.560
suppliers.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.000
Is injection molding a good
business to be in in 1995?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.436
Julian, why not?

00:20:10.436 --> 00:20:13.610
AUDIENCE: Because
China does it cheaper.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.840
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
not in 1995, they didn't.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.130
Let's stay within the bounds
of the case if we can.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.570
Anybody else?

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.650
Charlotte.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.570
AUDIENCE: No, because
at that point,

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.440
competitors are thinking
of ways to do things

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.034
cheaper to [INAUDIBLE]
money and also

00:20:33.034 --> 00:20:36.620
because the buyers
were these people using

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.120
the machines that
they were making,

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.114
and the materials they
needed were in high demand,

00:20:43.114 --> 00:20:44.757
so prices are going up.

00:20:44.757 --> 00:20:46.340
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's the resin.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.270
We'll come to that.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.350
But this thing, you're
saying there's just a lot

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.320
going on here within
the industry-- very

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.450
intense computation.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.480
What's interesting about
this is that's right.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.700
It doesn't look like
most of that industry

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.780
is very attractive, even
though it's growing like crazy.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.340
The industry is
growing like crazy--

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.080
it's a great
example of everybody

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.380
having to run fast to
stay in the same place,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.140
because there's a lot of
innovation, as Charlotte says,

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.800
and if you're not
doing it, you lose.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.725
So industries that look
like that are not uncommon.

00:21:22.725 --> 00:21:24.350
You think about the
early days-- again,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.200
Warren Buffett-- the
early days of automobiles.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.260
There were hundreds of
people making automobiles.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.150
And they were all
making great progress,

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.242
and innovating like crazy,
and automobile sales

00:21:34.242 --> 00:21:36.200
were taking off like a
rocket, and most of them

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.790
died because they were offering
more or less the same kind

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.570
of product, doing more or less
the same things as everybody

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.880
else, and had to run
to keep in place.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:56.870
So I think in terms of we hear
a little bit about buyers--

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:57.800
only a little bit.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.390
One of the big bottle makers is
mentioned as a powerful buyer.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.890
We don't know much about that.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.740
Substitutes, we seem
to be pretty good.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.800
This looks like an
industry people can enter.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.977
This does not look like
a high barrier industry.

00:22:13.977 --> 00:22:15.810
We're not told much
about that, but we don't

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.000
see much of a problem there.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.190
There seem to be lots
of mold makers and lots

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.730
of suppliers of components.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.460
So we don't seem to
have a problem here.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.000
The real problem
in this industry

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.450
is here, where there's just
very intense competition,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.750
even though there's high growth,
even though there's innovation.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.520
Everybody is innovating.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.350
Everybody is moving.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.350
And everybody's running very
fast to stay in the same place.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.140
So how do you beat this?

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.610
Well, let me talk generically,
and then we'll go to Husky.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:55.240
So generically,
stepping way back,

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.260
you've got to both create
value and capture it.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:04.530
So if you think
about suppliers, what

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:12.900
would you get for airplanes
and airline personnel?

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.700
What would you have
to pay to get a pilot

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.060
to fly as opposed to what you
do pay to get a pilot to fly--

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:23.610
again, in the great old
days of limited competition.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.670
There may well be a gap between
the suppliers' opportunity

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.280
costs-- what else could they do
with their capital and labor--

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.810
and what they sell for.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.840
That's captured by the supplier.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:42.820
There better be some gap between
what buyers are willing to pay

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.620
and what they actually pay.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.300
And the difference
is what you get

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.780
to take home, the difference
between what it actually costs

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.400
you and what you can sell.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.890
And this is, like, yeah.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.250
This is pretty straightforward
and pretty obvious.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.320
But you really do need
to think through--

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.020
and I love the
animation-- you do

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.523
need to think through
who captures it.

00:24:06.523 --> 00:24:07.940
If you go to the
airlines, there's

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:14.150
anomalous value created by the
airline industry, historically.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.890
Imagine it going away.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:20.750
It's not captured, by and
large, by the airline companies.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.770
Where does it go?

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.250
Well, with the decline of
airline unions, less of it

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:32.350
gets captured by suppliers, and
more of it's captured by us.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.470
If you think about the
alternative way of--

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:36.850
I was in Florida last week.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.580
And driving to Florida, which
I have done, is not much fun.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.490
So I would have been willing
to spend a lot more than it

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.040
cost me to fly.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.220
I got a huge surplus.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.113
I don't have the impression that
the folks supplying the airline

00:24:51.113 --> 00:24:52.280
were getting a lot of money.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.370
And I know the airline
wasn't getting much

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.210
in terms of captured surplus.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.310
So the basic strategic question
is, in any kind of industry--

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.650
attractive or unattractive--

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.140
can you do this?

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:10.300
So where Porter is pointing,
and where this case points us,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.450
is to ways to not
do the same thing

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.310
your competitors are doing.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.950
What can we do differently?

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:24.040
Well, the first basic-- this is
sort of the Southwest strategy.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:30.730
This says, we are going to drive
down costs and in a way that's

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.380
hard to imitate.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.260
We'll talk about what
makes it hard to imitate.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.230
We're going to drive
down costs, and maybe we

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.960
supply a somewhat
different product.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.318
Southwest's product is not
very useful for somebody

00:25:43.318 --> 00:25:45.610
who-- not very interesting
to somebody who always flies

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.620
first class and cares about it.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.540
They don't do first class.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.160
They've written that off.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.020
They don't do frequent
flyer, I don't think.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.490
Maybe they do.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.250
But for a whole set
of business travelers,

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.962
they're not that attractive.

00:25:58.962 --> 00:26:00.670
They're cheap, yeah,
but if somebody else

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.825
is paying my airfare,
that's not too attractive.

00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:04.950
They're not convenient
because I can't book online.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:05.810
I think about my own travel.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.352
Usually somebody
else is paying and I

00:26:07.352 --> 00:26:09.340
book online for simplicity.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.610
I never fly Southwest because
the fare difference doesn't

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.620
bother the people who
are paying my airfare,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.370
and online booking is
so enormously convenient

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.030
that I just do it.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:27.740
So I'm not in the set of
consumers they're aiming at.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.760
So what?

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.230
There are enough of them.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.600
There are enough people and
enough travel occasions--

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.870
and I can imagine occasions when
I would check Southwest just

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.050
to see if they're cheaper.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.340
That's a strategy.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:47.160
That issue there is what
makes it hard to imitate.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.620
What makes it hard to imitate?

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.060
As Charlotte pointed out in
the injection molding business,

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:58.170
everybody's innovating,
and in the airline

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.650
business everybody does
electronic reservations,

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.080
and everybody does this,
and everybody does that--

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.600
lots of innovation,
everybody driving down

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.180
costs-- more fuel
efficient engines,

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.270
no barriers to imitation.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.370
United can copy
what American does.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.220
American can copy
what United does.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.740
There are seminars on
industry best practice.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.480
Everybody does
industry best practice.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.360
You don't make any money
doing industry best practice.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.810
You may avoid losing money.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.750
So that's strategy one.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.330
Can I somehow get low costs?

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.690
And I highlight this
"some consumers,"

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:40.430
because Southwest and IKEA
are nice examples of picking

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.490
a piece of the market which a
low-cost strategy makes sense.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.610
Not everybody goes to IKEA.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.060
I've never been in an
IKEA, as it happens.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.600
But lots of people
do, and that's

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.330
enough to make them
a lot of money.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.120
The other strategy,
not too surprisingly,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.900
is to go the other
direction, is to find a way

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.300
to increase perceived
quality, willingness

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:12.990
to pay for some buyers
to justify higher prices.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.650
What can we do to
justify higher prices?

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:21.430
And again, there are examples--

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.910
Mercedes Benz is a high quality.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.950
They don't do the same
thing that everybody else

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.830
does, not the same kind of car.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:30.670
It costs more.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.900
It absolutely costs more.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.600
In this example, the
cost is the same,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.227
but you could still
make a lot of money

00:28:36.227 --> 00:28:37.810
if those costs were
a little higher as

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:44.180
long as the differentiation
is effective.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:49.030
So this kind of strategy,
you pick something

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:49.945
that somebody values.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.870
Actually, the online
bookings-- well, not quite.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.390
That's an interesting story.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:59.740
You meet the needs.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.360
You add costs.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.160
You get premium prices--

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:09.760
terrific story, but it
has to be cost effective.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.350
That is to say, you
can raise the price,

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.060
but if your costs go up by
more than the price, you lose.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.230
And you come down
to the same issue--

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.840
is imitation difficult?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.550
Is imitation difficult?

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.730
Again, we're going to
see this in Husky--

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.530
is imitation difficult?

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:37.600
There's sort of-- nice diagram--

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.850
there's sort of three
kinds of stories about ways

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:47.740
that imitation can be
difficult. The first

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:52.360
is sort of the IKEA/Southwest
up on top, the integration,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.360
that if you have to
build the company

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.200
to deliver on a
strategy effectively,

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.860
that's, again in Porter, the
Southwest Airlines versus--

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.470
what was it, Continental Light.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.472
So Continental decides
they can compete

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:08.680
with these low-cost carriers.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.510
They'll offer a
low-cost carrier.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:15.100
They won't serve meals and
they won't do assigned seats,

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.560
but they do baggage
interchange with other airlines

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.660
because they're Continental.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.860
They do online booking
because they're Continental.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.600
They do a variety
of other things

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.890
because they're Continental.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:31.970
And they can't get the
cost down that low.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.800
To get the cost down
that low, you've

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.330
got to integrate
the whole thing.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:41.030
You've got to build an
IKEA to deliver IKEA.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:45.590
You can't have an IKEA tacked
on to something else, which

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.770
means it's hard for an
existing firm to copy--

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.875
the notion that you have to
integrate the whole system.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.800
I guess another sort
of example like that

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.820
would be Jiffy Lube or one
of the quick lube places

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.200
that used to--
you don't see them

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.780
as much as you used to--
that offers cheap oil change.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.210
That's all they do
or all they did.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.715
And could you imitate that?

00:31:12.715 --> 00:31:14.090
Yeah, you could,
but you'd really

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:17.060
have to have the company
focused on doing just that.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:21.830
You can't do cheap oil change
as part of a full service repair

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.870
shop that does other
things because you've

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:27.830
got all that overhead
and all of the systems

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.820
to handle everything.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.490
If you just do oil change,
it's a simple business.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.080
You could do it very cheaply.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.300
If you do more, you've got
to hire different people,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.842
you've got to have
different systems,

00:31:36.842 --> 00:31:38.510
you've got to have
different inventory.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.940
So one reason it
could be hard is

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.220
that everything is integrated.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.810
Everything is integrated.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:47.180
It would be hard--

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:52.100
well, interestingly enough, if
you think about General Motors,

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.570
historically, Cadillac
was focused on luxury cars

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.650
and was sort of kept
separate from the rest of GM.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:05.120
In the glory years, Cadillac
delivered luxury cars.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.260
You couldn't have the Cadillac
operation closely integrated

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.440
with the Chevrolet operation.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.770
You have different philosophies,
you have different purchasing,

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.050
you have different
design approaches.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:22.980
Cadillac, everything was focused
on a certain kind of car--

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.070
integrated, built to deliver.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.050
You have to build a system--

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.750
as many people
did, it turns out--

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.450
to compete.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.780
The second-- there
on the right--

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.910
capture model is cost.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.560
You have a cost advantage.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.630
How can you have
a cost advantage?

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.480
Well, there might be
economies of scale.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.070
You might have
learning advantages.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.990
You might have other
kinds of advantages.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:52.350
There are lots of ways you
could have an advantage in cost.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.370
Yeah, Andrew.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.620
AUDIENCE: I just had a
question regarding integration.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.450
These might be
really bad examples.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.620
I'm just curious
where they fit in.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.140
Like, a company like
Walmart or like Toyota that

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.670
are quite large scale,
but then again, I've

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:10.002
heard many things about the way
they, for example, figured out

00:33:10.002 --> 00:33:13.660
how to have a really
integrated system

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.044
from the supplier to the end
product and all that thing.

00:33:16.044 --> 00:33:21.790
I'm just curious, are
they simply exceptions?

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.190
Or are they doing some other
things also that I've not seen?

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.590
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
Toyota is a great case.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.050
And others may know that
system better than I do.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:36.250
They combine a number
of things, but it

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:40.600
is an example of a system built
to do a couple of things well.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:47.500
First, they built a
product development system.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.962
It was much quicker than
American manufacturers,

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:53.170
and indeed, much quicker
than European manufacturers.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:57.380
So they could go from concept
to model on the street quicker.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:03.190
So that's the innovation
speed down there in the left.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.600
Could you imitate it?

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.770
A lot of people tried.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.429
There were no obvious
barriers to imitating that.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:14.050
They also had some clever
ways they did manufacturing--

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.440
just in time, and the whole
Kanban and quality circles.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.000
There was a whole
manufacturing system.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.900
Could you copy it?

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.090
Well, a lot of people tried.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.159
And that's what's interesting.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:29.650
There was the Toyota-General
Motors joint venture

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:33.250
that produced-- what was it that
they produced in California?

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.760
NUMMI, yes.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.929
And General Motors was going
to learn the Toyota system

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:40.270
and copy it.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:43.270
Well, the cultures
were different.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.886
And the GM workforce--

00:34:46.886 --> 00:34:48.969
you've been doing something
some way for 30 years,

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.761
and somebody says, now
we're going to do it

00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:54.190
this other way, that's hard.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.940
And you have to change the
inventory control system

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.222
and your purchasing system.

00:35:00.222 --> 00:35:01.930
Then you go to your
designers, and you've

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.800
got to change the speed at
which you produce new products

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.170
by changing that system.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:10.390
I mean, I'd say Toyota
was successfully

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:14.180
copied over a long time.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.510
I wouldn't say GM has
successfully copied them.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:20.180
It wasn't that Toyota was
bigger than anybody else.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.880
They were doing
a better job when

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.950
they were smaller,
certainly smaller

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.660
than the American companies.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:34.080
So they got cost by developing
a manufacturing and design

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:39.030
system that was simply
better, and the advantage held

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.060
because even though it looked
like you could copy it,

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.090
and there were articles and
books written on how you do

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.580
the Toyota, the Japanese
system, it turned out

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:52.605
to be harder to put it in place
because you had to do it all.

00:35:52.605 --> 00:35:56.280
And again, over
time, there are lots

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.710
of studies where you
see companies now

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.870
that have that approach.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.490
But it was sustainable.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.130
And Toyota's not in great shape.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:10.230
It was sustainable in
part because of the fact

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.030
that it was a system.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.950
You had to do the whole thing.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.570
You couldn't just
change inventory.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.280
You couldn't just change design.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.490
You had to take the
whole thing, and that

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:22.770
meant bringing people along.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.340
Could you do a startup that way?

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.510
Yeah, much easier to do
a startup, much easier

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.180
to take people who've never
built or designed automobiles,

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.375
and say, here's how
we're going to do it,

00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:33.750
but then you've
got a whole bunch

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.280
of people who've never built
or designed automobiles.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.680
So it's a nice example.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.610
Thank you.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.710
Anything else?

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.460
Any other comments?

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:50.770
OK, let's do Husky.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:51.770
What's Husky's strategy?

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.850
What is it that-- we're '95--

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.600
what is it historically
Husky wouldn't do?

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.950
Mary.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.375
AUDIENCE: So they stuck to
some of the core values,

00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:04.770
like professionalism
and dedicated hard work.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:10.228
They also devoted a lot of
stuff to the health and--

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.270
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
that's a good description

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:18.060
of the culture, of how they
went about doing what they did.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.320
What did they do?

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.940
What were their activities?

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.200
Did they focus?

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.260
Were they trying to do all
kinds of injection molding,

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.710
some kinds of injection
molding, low end, high end,

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.606
middle of the market?

00:37:30.606 --> 00:37:32.583
AUDIENCE: They focused
on the PET system.

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: PET
and the thin-wall business,

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.630
so they focused on two segments.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.220
They didn't do everything.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.595
And as you say, they had this
very interesting culture.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.450
So we got that one.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.180
Don't freeze again.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:53.530
What distinguished those
segments from other segments?

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:57.730
How were the PET and
the thin-wall segments

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:02.840
different from other parts of
the business, other segments?

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.040
Any obvious way?

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.603
Yeah.

00:38:04.603 --> 00:38:06.520
AUDIENCE: I think they
were trying to-- sorry,

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.395
I forgot my name tag.

00:38:07.395 --> 00:38:09.982
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah, but
you do remember who you are.

00:38:09.982 --> 00:38:10.690
We're good there.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.140
OK.

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.410
Yes.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:13.535
AUDIENCE: I think they were
trying to find segments

00:38:13.535 --> 00:38:17.062
where a technological
advantage is sustainable,

00:38:17.062 --> 00:38:18.520
but it actually
makes a difference.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.010
Like the thin-wall
business, it's

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.602
like there's probably more
technological know-how

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:26.810
to make it, and allows you
to make the walls thinner,

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.010
and you can machine
it faster and stuff

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.680
like that, where it hadn't
been really monetized yet,

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.660
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.600
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: What
about the PET bottle business?

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.600
How is that different?

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.760
AUDIENCE: It seemed like--

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.730
I wasn't really sure.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.230
It seemed like they
kind of wound up

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.745
in that by accident sort of.

00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:48.370
They're, like--

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.995
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, think about.

00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:52.660
I mean there's some
nice description of--

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.180
suppose you're
doing Coke bottles,

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.930
and you're running this
incredibly rapid bottling

00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:59.560
apparatus.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.727
And you produce the bottles
and you fill the bottles

00:39:01.727 --> 00:39:02.380
under pressure.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.990
What matters a lot?

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:09.560
Quality, maybe, defects,
maybe, because when

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.530
a bottle explodes and
you've got to stop the line,

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.390
that's terrible.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:18.095
So performance and technology
matter in those segments.

00:39:18.095 --> 00:39:20.553
AUDIENCE: They're not making
the blow molded machines, only

00:39:20.553 --> 00:39:21.443
the preformed.

00:39:21.443 --> 00:39:22.860
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, but you

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.392
want to make those
free of defects.

00:39:24.392 --> 00:39:26.100
AUDIENCE: Because when
you blow them up--

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.222
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: When
you blow them up, yeah.

00:39:28.222 --> 00:39:30.180
I think there's a number
in the case about sort

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.800
of typical defects
in one of theirs

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.690
versus typical defects
in competitors.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.410
And it's a big difference.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.640
And the story is when
you blow them up,

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.640
and then you fill
them under pressure,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.570
and they explode and stop a
bottling line, that's terrible.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.270
So if you can deliver
product that won't do that,

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.590
you've got an advantage.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.580
OK.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.840
So it's segments where
performance matters,

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.400
where technology is useful.

00:39:59.533 --> 00:40:01.450
One of the things that
comes out in the case--

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.450
you have to read it kind
of closely to get this,

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:07.800
but it buys a lot of stuff.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.910
It makes the molds, but
it buys a lot of inputs,

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.290
more than its competitors.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:14.340
Any obvious reason?

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:21.970
Catherine.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.320
AUDIENCE: Well, doesn't the
case that their campuses

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.640
are very centralized.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.960
And it goes back to the
culture, their employees

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.560
are generally very happy there.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.040
So it said that they
buy a lot of their molds

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.060
from people who generally
were former employees so

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.888
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:39.888 --> 00:40:42.430
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So they
buy a lot from former employees,

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.020
yeah.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.650
So that's part of the
ecosystem, as the phrase goes.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.170
But as focused as they are
on technical excellence

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:55.750
of their machines,
could they do that

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.520
for everything, all the inputs?

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.890
AUDIENCE: Instead of trying
to just manufacture products,

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:08.780
they have a focus on
service and the entire--

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.280
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
They focus on--

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.530
AUDIENCE: --package, basically.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.709
So they try to specialize
more because then they

00:41:15.709 --> 00:41:18.042
can provide more services
throughout the company so that

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:19.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.260
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
they have technical people

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:20.990
out in the field.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.530
So they can provide a
great deal of service,

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.320
and sort of co-engineering
with their clients.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.040
And they're in segments
where that matters.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:35.500
And trying to do that for
all of the components,

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.920
and trying to hyper-engineer
all of their components

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.930
would spread them a
little thin, I think.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:44.920
And I think that's
one reason why

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.980
they make fewer inputs
than their competitors,

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.450
because they've decided to focus
on the parts of the business

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.120
where performance and quality
and technology matter.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.650
What's the answer to that?

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:04.890
They make some molds,
particularly for PET.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.520
They offer hot runners, and a
variety of other things that

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.270
competitors don't.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.780
Any reasons why?

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.540
Wyatt.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.320
AUDIENCE: It said in the
reading with the hot runners was

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.270
they were selling the
hot runners to Gillette

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:22.770
or whatever, but Gillette
wasn't using their actual mold

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:23.517
machines.

00:42:23.517 --> 00:42:24.600
They're using hot runners.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.070
And then later on,
they were able to grab

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.770
a contract with Gillette
before the actual [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.770
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
it's part of the system.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.860
Being good at that
adds to performance

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.330
and gives you a business edge.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:39.900
And they're very tightly
focused on these two segments.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.620
So you want to make everything
you can for those segments.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.580
You want to not worry
about the inputs.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.390
And it's made a lot of money.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.970
The case makes it clear--
it's grown like gangbusters.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.720
It's got a return on equity
of something like 40%.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.220
Why, at least until recently,
hasn't anybody copied them?

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.930
What are the barriers
to imitation?

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:10.470
What has made this
strategy sustainable,

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:11.370
at least for a while.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:12.210
Nothing's forever.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:13.320
Brendan.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.478
AUDIENCE: They have a huge
technological advantage.

00:43:16.478 --> 00:43:18.145
Their machines are a
lot more expensive.

00:43:18.145 --> 00:43:20.140
There's a deep
knowledge base there.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.555
So it's hard to copy the
kind of quality machines

00:43:22.555 --> 00:43:23.780
that they produce.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.072
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But you
could imagine they don't--

00:43:26.072 --> 00:43:27.590
nobody talks about
patents, though.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.570
We don't hear patent barriers.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.990
So you could imagine they have
the only advanced manufacturing

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.740
center.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.670
They've set up a
little think tank--

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.920
I don't know how little it is.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.400
They set up a think
tank to do R&D. Why

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.920
don't other people do that?

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.837
AUDIENCE: They don't
want to invest the money.

00:43:43.837 --> 00:43:47.920
They'd rather spend the money
elsewhere, not have that cost.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.770
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So this is part of--

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.990
well, let me push you
on that a little bit,

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:58.810
because they're
making so much money.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.610
They're growing
like gangbusters.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.830
They're making so much money.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.020
Wouldn't you imitate
them if you could?

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.710
I mean, so yeah, you got to
set up a manufacturing center.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.750
These are big companies.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.670
Mannesmann is a big company.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.740
AUDIENCE: That's why
companies eventually

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.710
did kind of get into the
markets that they were selling.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.370
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
They saw it, yeah.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:20.870
AUDIENCE: They sold
cheaper machines

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:23.162
that can do the same job,
maybe not to the same quality

00:44:23.162 --> 00:44:23.718
but close.

00:44:23.718 --> 00:44:25.760
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And
try to come in on price.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.438
Yeah.

00:44:26.438 --> 00:44:27.980
AUDIENCE: Isn't the
kind of customer,

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.320
though, that's
concerned about quality

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.300
and is willing to pay more
for it, like it would make

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.883
more sense it would go with the
company that had been doing it

00:44:33.883 --> 00:44:36.670
for longer and kind of has the
history and reputation, rather

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.940
than a company that has
just copied their technology

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.930
and is getting that
niche of the market

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.507
and doesn't have the reputation.

00:44:44.507 --> 00:44:46.590
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And
they really sort of built

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.820
the company to do
this, haven't they?

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.140
AUDIENCE: Well, my guess would
be that if you try to imitate,

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.080
you're effectively
increasing competition

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.110
that does make the business
not as profitable as it

00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.680
would be otherwise.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.387
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So the
segment may not be that big,

00:45:02.387 --> 00:45:02.970
you're saying.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.770
And so you'd have to
do the numbers to say,

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.930
is there room for two
of us to play this game?

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:07.560
Maxwell.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.060
AUDIENCE: I think
also it has a lot

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.602
to do with the
culture of the company

00:45:10.602 --> 00:45:13.060
and you needed that
culture to make machines.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.077
It's hard to switch
an entire culture.

00:45:15.077 --> 00:45:16.660
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, the culture

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.160
is sort of part of it, is
an intriguing part of it,

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:19.660
isn't it?

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.073
They've got a peculiar culture.

00:45:21.073 --> 00:45:22.240
I want to come back to that.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.020
Charlotte.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.660
AUDIENCE: Also, the
fact that we said

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.370
they're only focusing
on this one thing,

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.320
whereas other companies
that were also

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.990
in the mold-making business
focused more widely.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:35.830
Even when they started
to come into this area,

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.530
they sort of added onto
machines they already had,

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:43.030
instead of actually changing
into the same company.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:45.550
Nobody shut down all
their other manufacturing

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.220
and focused specifically
on these two things.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.100
They just incorporated it into
what they were already doing.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.110
Maybe companies
[INAUDIBLE] they calculated

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:55.870
what it would take for
them to get to the point

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:56.860
where Husky was.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.970
It would just have
changed their [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.720
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So this would sort of

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.920
be a little bit of the
reverse of Continental

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.150
versus Continental Light.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.450
This would be like,
well, they tried it.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.850
This would be like
grafting a luxury car

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.490
business onto
Volkswagen, or as Toyota

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:17.148
did, doing Lexus, which
they set off to one side

00:46:17.148 --> 00:46:19.690
because you really couldn't do
the mainstream Toyota business

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:23.170
and the Lexus business
under the same management.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:27.370
So part of it is they
really built it for this.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.680
Do you think it has higher
or lower than average costs?

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.888
That's pretty clear, I think.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.650
Matthew, what do you think?

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.020
You think Husky's a high
cost operation or a low cost

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.150
operation?

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:44.985
AUDIENCE: Well, they're high
in the sense of charging--

00:46:44.985 --> 00:46:47.110
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No,
not in terms of high price

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:50.530
but in terms of their cost.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:53.140
Even though they've got
this lab on the side,

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:55.360
they've got this advanced
manufacturing center.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.740
They've got day care.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.660
They're very ecologically good.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:03.310
AUDIENCE: They're charging high
scores that nobody can produce.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:07.968
[INAUDIBLE] So I'm
saying low in comparison

00:47:07.968 --> 00:47:09.010
to what they're charging.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.135
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That
may be, but in comparison

00:47:11.135 --> 00:47:12.550
to their competitors?

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:13.390
AUDIENCE: They're
higher, because they're

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:14.530
producing higher quality.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.780
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: They're
producing higher quality.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.540
And if you think about the
culture and everything else,

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.410
this is not a
company that skimps.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.570
This is not a
company that skimps.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.933
They invest in R&D. They
invest in technology.

00:47:28.933 --> 00:47:30.100
They invest in their people.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.850
Do you think that's
important, the culture?

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.555
Is that a key part of
the story, do you think?

00:47:41.555 --> 00:47:43.430
Not sure I know the
answer to this, but yeah.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:44.892
AUDIENCE: I think it is.

00:47:44.892 --> 00:47:46.600
Just you mentioned
before, it's something

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.642
you can get up in the
morning and go to work for.

00:47:48.642 --> 00:47:51.720
It keeps people motivated, keeps
your workforce working hard.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.070
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Even
getting your T-square--

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.528
imagine T-squares-- even getting
your T-square straightened

00:47:55.528 --> 00:47:57.510
on your desk, you think?

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:03.540
I mean, neatening your
code when you're gone.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.583
It's an interesting
culture, I have to say.

00:48:05.583 --> 00:48:07.000
Matthew, you're
raising your hand.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.960
Yeah.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.540
AUDIENCE: I mean,
they said in there

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.360
that whenever they
extended day care hours,

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.070
it was a kind of thing
to make them work harder,

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.892
not just for extended day
care hours for the kids.

00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:21.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
they're not doing charity,

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.600
are they?

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.290
But they have a particular
culture of we value our people.

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:27.610
We value the environment.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:32.150
We value excellence, which
would be a tough culture

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:37.400
to sustain if they were aiming
for the low end of the market.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.850
If you're aiming for the
low end, that's tough.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:43.880
If you're aiming
for the high end,

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:48.200
it's like Ritz-Carlton Hotels
aim for a particular kind

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.880
of service.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.150
And their code is
ladies and gentlemen

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.250
served by ladies and gentlemen.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.770
If you're going to treat
your people like ladies

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:02.130
and gentlemen, you're going to
have higher costs than if you

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.770
treat them like pond scum.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:07.780
You will also, with some
luck, get better service.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.600
So this is a culture that
really does aim high.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.820
Would you like to work there?

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:20.730
Show of hands-- who'd like
to work for this company.

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:25.590
OK, who would find
it really awful?

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:28.260
Charlotte would not like
her T-square straightened.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.330
Neither would Maxwell.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.090
I mean, it's for some
people and not for others.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:35.570
It's autocratic.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:37.573
The boss runs it.

00:49:37.573 --> 00:49:39.740
One of the questions that's
suggested for discussion

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:46.400
is, could you do this
company without Shapp

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.740
in charge, Schad, rather.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.470
Could you do this
without an autocrat

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:57.040
in charge, such a strong
culture, such a tight focus?

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.745
Not obvious.

00:49:59.745 --> 00:50:00.245
OK.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.020
What else do I want to do?

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.415
This is some numbers, which I
don't expect you to have done.

00:50:08.415 --> 00:50:09.790
And I should have
made this clear

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:13.660
because you can do a fair
amount of work on the numbers.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.810
And I'll illustrate
this kind of analysis.

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:24.010
For products like this,
it is often useful--

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:27.250
and energy products, a lot of
them come into this category,

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:28.420
like light bulbs--

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:32.770
you can do the demand analysis
by simply turning yourself

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:35.800
around and thinking
about this as a buyer.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.290
If you were a buyer
producing bottles,

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.480
what would you be willing
to pay for a Husky

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.540
system versus some other
system, given the parameters?

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.090
And that gives you a sense
of what Husky can charge,

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.800
given other people's.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:54.520
It's easier when it's something
like we're making bottles.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.538
It's a little harder when
we're making Priuses,

00:50:56.538 --> 00:50:58.330
because you don't know
what the willingness

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:04.390
to pay for intangibles is, or
hardwood interiors in a car.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:08.440
That you can't sort of read
off the process figures.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.070
But for something
like light bulbs,

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:15.550
for something like injection
molding machines, you can say,

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.200
OK, I'm running a factory.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.810
What would I buy at
different prices,

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.170
and turn the analysis around.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:26.472
And I'll just show
you the results.

00:51:26.472 --> 00:51:28.930
These aren't my numbers, these
are somebody else's numbers,

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:32.230
but it's useful for
this kind of analysis.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:37.060
You basically want to
say, start with the rival.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:43.270
What would it cost in terms
of the machine, maybe the fact

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:45.490
that you've got to get more
machines because it's not

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:47.410
as productive, the
fact that maybe it

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:50.680
takes more energy, the fact that
it takes more raw materials--

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.770
what would it cost you--
this is called p star--

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:58.150
to do what you'd get out of
a Husky system for price p?

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.550
There's enough in the
case you can do this,

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:06.010
if you're very ambitious, for
thin walls and for PET systems.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:11.140
This is a calculation
for thin wall.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:15.880
The competitors-- use
margarine containers--

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.020
the competitor's system
has a longer cycle time,

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:25.660
it produces heavier components,
a heavier weight container.

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.910
It costs less.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:30.980
So to get the same
output, again,

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.010
this assumes you
have a large factory,

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:38.320
you'd need 1 and 2/3 competitor
machines to get as much

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.990
as out of a Husky machine.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:46.600
That means 1 and 2/3
times 350 is 408.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:51.310
There's also a resin saving,
because the Husky container

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:53.020
is lighter.

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:58.240
So to replace a
$400,000 Husky machine,

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:04.720
you'd have to do $408,000
worth of competitor equipment

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.230
plus extra resin per year.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:10.630
That's a willingness
to pay analysis.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:13.660
So that says Husky
could, depending

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:17.050
on how the competitor
discounted, and depending

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.420
on how much the
competitor produced,

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.660
Husky could charge
even more than $400,000

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.960
and would still be
the machine of choice.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.000
This is the kind of
analysis you would

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.770
expect a buyer to do, deciding
what kind of machine to buy.

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:35.560
And it's the kind of
analysis you'd expect Husky

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.975
to do in thinking about price.

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:44.230
In the past, I've taught a
pricing course here at Sloan.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:49.120
And my favorite case is a
case about contact lenses

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.160
for chickens.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.660
And it's a great pricing case
because the contact lenses

00:53:55.660 --> 00:54:00.340
for chickens cost nothing.

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.250
You put them in the chicken
for about $0.25 a chicken.

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:05.080
They cost about a penny.

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.060
And they keep the
chickens, if they work,

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.630
from pecking each
other to death.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:11.710
And if you do the
calculation, you

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:15.130
find those lenses are
worth about $4 apiece--

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:18.490
made up number, but
very, very high.

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:21.640
And most people in the
class immediately say, well,

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.560
it cost $0.25, so what we'll
do is we'll market up to $0.30.

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.803
And the answer is no.

00:54:27.803 --> 00:54:29.470
If you do the willingness
to pay answer,

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:32.830
you can mark it up to
$3 as long as you've

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:35.080
got the patent monopoly on it.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.030
The buyer would be
willing to pay $3

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.170
rather than do without it.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:42.550
And in fact, if it's worth
$4 on this kind of analysis,

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:46.510
you charge $3 and they're happy.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:48.160
So this is a kind
of analysis you

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.787
can do for industrial products.

00:54:51.787 --> 00:54:53.620
That's a great case,
except as it turns out,

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:55.420
the contact lenses fell
out of the chickens.

00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.640
The chickens plucked each
other to death and the firm

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.140
went broke.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.520
But still, it's a
great case to teach.

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.550
It fails only the
realistic test.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:11.620
This says the more containers
somebody wants to produce,

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.240
and the lower their
discount rate,

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.990
the better the Husky system is.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:21.250
This is a similar analysis, a
willingness to pay analysis,

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:24.080
for a PET preform system.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:31.450
And again, the Husky
container weight is lower.

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:37.680
The cost is lower,
takes up-- well,

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.180
I'm going to have to go back.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.880
The key things you
see will turn out

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:50.070
to be the energy savings
and the resin savings.

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:54.170
So what you get here is it
produces a lighter container,

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:55.460
so there's a resin saving.

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.860
It's more efficient, so
there's an energy saving.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:00.440
There's also a little
floor space saving.

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.480
So it's the same thing--

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:06.680
to replace a Husky system
costing $1.2 million,

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:13.220
you'd need to spend more
capacity and more yearly cost.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:20.230
So again, when you think
about an industrial product,

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:24.190
this is the sort of
analysis you go through.

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.830
When you're a buyer you do
it, and when you're a seller

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:27.520
you do it.

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.340
Now again, the analysis
may be different

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.330
for different customers.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:39.530
This is a case where you're
assuming that, again, I can--

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:40.490
where have I got it?

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:46.040
Yeah, I need 1.34 rival systems
to replace a Husky system

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.590
because the Husky system
is more productive.

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:51.380
Well, depending on how
big the factory is,

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.940
that may or may
not make any sense

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.370
because they don't
come in fractions.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.500
If it's a large thing, yeah.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:01.010
If the typical customer
has one system,

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:03.980
then the analysis is
going to be different.

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:10.040
OK, any questions about
this kind of analysis?

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.200
Folks with an
engineering background,

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.180
this sort of ought to
come pretty naturally,

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.900
just working out
on a spreadsheet.

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:21.640
What would you do if
you didn't buy ours?

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.480
How would you do it?

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.970
What would it cost?

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:27.500
Is there a gap?

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:33.460
So the answer to this
is, at least as of 1995

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:40.600
before troubles begin,
Husky systems are worth--

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:44.020
I mean, we're charging $1.2
million for the system,

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.420
but to replace it,
you'd have to spend

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.210
$1.3 plus $500,000 a year.

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:54.897
So in one sense, we are leaving
a little money on the table.

00:57:54.897 --> 00:57:56.980
In another sense, you have
to leave a little money

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.350
on the table because these
are approximate calculations.

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:05.650
But the answer is, Husky's
systems justified their premium

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:09.430
price going into 1995.

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.940
The electricity savings
were not a trivial part

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.360
of the reason, at
least for PET preform.

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.580
Is this reasonably
straightforward,

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.860
how you would think
about doing it--

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.500
just engineer it one way,
engineer it the other way,

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.755
and check the costs,
all the costs?

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.320
We're now in 1995.

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.180
What's gone wrong?

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:39.333
It's the summer of '95.

00:58:39.333 --> 00:58:40.250
They had a great year.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.230
They're depressed.

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:42.180
Yes.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:44.643
AUDIENCE: Resin
costs are increasing.

00:58:44.643 --> 00:58:46.810
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK,
resin costs are increasing.

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:50.110
That's leading to a
decrease in demand.

00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:52.720
Is that likely to be a temporary
or a permanent situation,

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.770
do you think?

00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:54.947
Temporary, yeah.

00:58:54.947 --> 00:58:56.280
It's going to be disequilibrium.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.310
We've seen it before.

00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:58.900
It's a commodity chemical.

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.560
They just have a
capacity shortage.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.430
So we wouldn't get too
twitchy about that.

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:05.937
Anything else, Matthew?

00:59:05.937 --> 00:59:07.520
AUDIENCE: A lot of
competing companies

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.100
have noticed their
success and are

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.350
starting to step in and try
to take some market share.

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:13.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Now we got a problem.

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.575
That's more serious.

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:22.750
And these guys have been
through resin shortages,

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:24.190
and they don't
have a lot of debt,

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:26.590
and they'll probably
get through this one.

00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:30.700
In fact, I think it fixed
itself within a year, maybe two.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.620
But the lower cost
competitors going

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:37.630
after your prime customers
with lower costs--

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:39.970
that's troublesome.

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:43.550
So let's look at this two ways.

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:47.500
Let's look at it from the point
of view first of a competitor.

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.950
Suppose you're one of
those low cost competitors.

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:53.890
You know Husky's
going to do something.

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:57.590
What do you think
Husky is going to do?

00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.450
One question is
what will they do,

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.750
and what would you think they
would do as a competitor?

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:05.720
And the other is what would
you recommend they do?

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.740
Those may be the same if
they're as smart as you are.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.860
But they may not be.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.970
Any thoughts about
you're a competitor.

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:18.610
What do you think Husky does?

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:19.460
Sam.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.860
AUDIENCE: Talk to
their customers

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.720
and stress the quality
of the product.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.800
Because these guys
are new, and they're

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.130
doing low cost, but
the only way they

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:26.290
do that is they're
cutting corners.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.640
Like, our product's
more expensive,

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.140
but you've worked
with us for years.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.570
You know it's trustworthy,
and just [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.910
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you think what

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:35.590
they would do would be to--

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:39.400
because they've always
been about technology,

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.590
and technological
leadership, and quality,

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.835
they're just going to
double down on that.

01:00:43.835 --> 01:00:45.460
They're going to do
more communication.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.135
They're going to
do more innovation.

01:00:47.135 --> 01:00:48.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:49.210
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: They're
going to ride the same horse.

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.220
AUDIENCE: That's what
I think they should do.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: What
do you think they will do?

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.408
AUDIENCE: Probably, I
feel like the first thing

01:00:55.408 --> 01:00:57.670
they may try and do
is lower their costs,

01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:59.054
drop their prices a little bit.

01:00:59.054 --> 01:01:01.535
I don't think that's
what they should do,

01:01:01.535 --> 01:01:02.960
but that's what [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.200
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Why do
you think they will do it?

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.160
You had me sold.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.650
You had me sold that
given their whole culture,

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:12.680
and given the way the company's
been built, that they would

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.615
double down on innovation.

01:01:16.615 --> 01:01:20.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I feel like it's
easier to lower [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.530
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It's easier
to lower price in response.

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:24.090
AUDIENCE: I don't think
that's the right thing at all.

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:25.470
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Philip,
what do you think they will do?

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:27.710
AUDIENCE: They'll
probably lower the price,

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:34.370
because [INAUDIBLE] willingness
to pay of the buyers is

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:36.620
probably going to decrease
because of these low-cost

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.583
competitors--

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:39.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Because what?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.310
AUDIENCE: Because the
low-cost competitors arising.

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:47.970
So the cost of replacing their
product is less of an issue.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:54.200
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So you
think if you're a competitor,

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.944
the first thing you expect
them to do is a price cut.

01:01:57.944 --> 01:01:58.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:59.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:00.380
OK.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.620
Anybody else have any
expec-- because that's

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.500
the natural response to a
low-cost entrant is to come

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.820
down a bit anybody else?

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:10.490
David.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.012
AUDIENCE: I would not expect
them to cut their prices,

01:02:13.012 --> 01:02:14.220
just because that kills them.

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.332
That's like a
slippery slope thing,

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:18.790
where their customers will not
be willing to pay the higher

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:19.290
prices.

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:23.260
And they can't afford to sustain
their competitive advantage.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.795
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, are
you saying what they should do

01:02:26.795 --> 01:02:27.670
or what they will do?

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:31.215
AUDIENCE: I'm saying as someone,
as a competitor, especially

01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:33.340
if I'm part of the larger
corporation like the Mann

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.410
Group, I would not expect
them to come down to my price,

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:41.233
rather they try to stay
high, maybe that person will

01:02:41.233 --> 01:02:42.460
buy a little into--

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.300
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So you
think that Schad would say,

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.420
I can't play a price
game with these guys.

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.580
I'm going to play my long suit.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.770
I'm going to stick with
technology, and high price,

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.170
and communication, and
all of those good things.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.240
OK, we're going to get--

01:03:02.004 --> 01:03:04.990
at least the analysis in the
teaching note on this case

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:08.350
says, given what Schad did
to get through the '70s,

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:11.440
you might expect him to
double down on technology,

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.090
to keep innovating.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.160
But what should he do?

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:19.250
I mean, there are a whole
set of things he could do.

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:21.053
He could cut prices.

01:03:21.053 --> 01:03:22.220
He could cut them generally.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.560
He could cut them selectively.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.480
He could cut them in
different markets.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.670
He could cut them in
different segments.

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:30.630
He could enter their segments.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.460
Husky is a little small in
terms of production capacity.

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.910
They might try to get
scaled by counterattacking.

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:41.350
They could cut
costs given they're

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.780
facing low-price
competition, but they've

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.410
got this culture that's
not a cost-focused culture.

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:51.650
It's a quality-focused,
people-focused culture.

01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:58.910
So if you do that,
then for sure Charlotte

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:01.190
won't want to work
there, because not only

01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:04.040
do they straighten your T,
they cut out child care.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.460
They do all kinds of
other things to cut costs.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:11.120
You could either raise or lower
all this stuff-- the service,

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.633
the technical
people in the field.

01:04:12.633 --> 01:04:14.300
They've got probably
a high-priced sales

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.430
force because they're
all technical people.

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:19.460
You could go back to
plain, old salespeople.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.730
You could cut out this
advanced manufacturing center,

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:24.140
which nobody else has got.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.640
You could stop
working on research,

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.120
or you could do more
of all of those.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.260
Whoa, that was cute--

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:33.860
bad button.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:37.190
You could decide
that there really

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:40.222
are scale economies in
building your own inputs

01:04:40.222 --> 01:04:41.180
instead of buying them.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.330
You could try to
integrate upstream.

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:47.450
Or you could do things
I haven't thought of.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:51.410
So instead of what would
they do, what should they do?

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.780
Sam, you had were
doing a should.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.765
You were saying--

01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:57.140
AUDIENCE: I was saying they
should focus on communicating

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.770
advantage to customers.

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:04.770
And I also think they
probably should raise spending

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.323
on technology.

01:05:06.323 --> 01:05:08.240
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And
quality and all that.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:08.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:11.125
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Because
that's what they're good at.

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:11.660
OK.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.270
Max, where are you going?

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:15.395
AUDIENCE: I think they
should do an analysis of who

01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:16.520
their main customers are.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.410
And they only make a
couple 100 machines a year.

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:19.952
So if all of those
machines are going

01:05:19.952 --> 01:05:21.917
to the same customers
or similar customers

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:23.500
and they can probably
bank on loyalty,

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.780
then they should focus on
communicating the advantages

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.110
because they can sell that.

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:29.990
But if a lot of
those machines are

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:33.410
going to new companies that are
trying to look to reduce costs

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:35.510
initially, then they
might want to think

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:38.490
about cutting costs to stay
competitive in that market.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:40.282
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So that's interesting.

01:05:40.282 --> 01:05:42.230
So if it's the same
customers, then it's

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:46.010
an advantage to the customer
to have only one supplier,

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:48.720
to have Husky
machines throughout.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.340
So if the growth is coming from
sales to customers that already

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:56.660
have Husky machines, you could
stress the fact that look,

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.732
you've got one supplier.

01:05:57.732 --> 01:05:59.690
You've only got to have
one set of spare ports.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:02.700
You've only got to call one
person when it breaks down.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.383
Be a Husky shop.

01:06:04.383 --> 01:06:06.050
But you're right--
it might be different

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:09.890
if they were new people and they
worry more about upfront cost.

01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:10.940
OK.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:11.720
Anybody else?

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.100
Any other approaches?

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.558
Erica.

01:06:14.558 --> 01:06:17.780
AUDIENCE: Would it be unusual
to look into cutting costs

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.460
while maintaining quality?

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.740
So I guess investing
research into cutting cost

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.400
but maintaining high quality.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.870
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, can you

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:32.045
cut manufacturing costs or you
cut out the daycare center?

01:06:32.045 --> 01:06:33.420
You wouldn't cut
out the daycare.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.128
AUDIENCE: No, no.

01:06:34.128 --> 01:06:36.750
[INAUDIBLE] manufacturing costs,
like how to produce things

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.250
more efficiently.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:41.160
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So you'd
focus on manufacturing costs.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.190
Would you also raise--

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:47.130
this is a fair amount
of cost in here,

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.170
having this high-priced
field force,

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.810
this advanced manufacturing
center, the spending

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:52.900
on innovation.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.070
That's a cost.

01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:57.300
Would you cut costs
there or would you

01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.480
cut costs to focus on
manufacturing cost?

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.700
AUDIENCE: I mean, I
guess I was focusing

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.910
on manufacturing costs.

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:08.570
I mean, those--

01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:10.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Daycare center stays,

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.160
but we're going to really
try to get these things built

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.075
more cheaply.

01:07:15.075 --> 01:07:15.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.700
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:22.560
And then would you use
that to cut prices?

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.570
AUDIENCE: You could.

01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:28.515
I mean, if cutting prices
reflects lower quality--

01:07:28.515 --> 01:07:30.140
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That would be bad.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:30.765
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:30.765 --> 01:07:34.380
But you could also
stress that you have

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:37.767
better quality machines or--

01:07:37.767 --> 01:07:39.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Jacqueline.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.860
AUDIENCE: I was going to say I
agree with that, that you could

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.320
use that to cut prices,
but at the same time still

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.360
highlight the quality of the
product and that advantage.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.520
You could do both strategies.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.200
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.840
Anybody has-- yeah.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.830
AUDIENCE: I'd say increased
services at point of purchase,

01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:01.520
so they offer free installation
or servicing of full Husky

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.415
machines or whenever you buy new
ones, or something like that,

01:08:04.415 --> 01:08:06.290
to focus when they're
going to buy a machine,

01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:07.832
they're going to
have it for a while.

01:08:07.832 --> 01:08:09.530
So focus right on that point.

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.140
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
that's costing me money.

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:13.910
So how am I going
to get it back?

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:15.606
Or am I not?

01:08:15.606 --> 01:08:17.532
AUDIENCE: Customer
loyalty-- you're

01:08:17.532 --> 01:08:18.740
going to sell those machines.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.990
I guess you have to weigh
that kind of back and forth,

01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:22.115
but hopefully end positive.

01:08:22.115 --> 01:08:24.282
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
I mean, one approach here

01:08:24.282 --> 01:08:25.490
is to say, "Game over."

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:28.470
I made a lot of money before
people came into my segment,

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.170
and I'm not going to make
that kind of money again.

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:33.410
So what I want to
make sure is that I

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:36.590
maintain a position through
high service and whatever,

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:37.830
and don't get swamped.

01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:40.850
I kind of niche myself
even a little more.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.950
Charlotte.

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:44.120
AUDIENCE: Well,
I think that they

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.680
are a very different company
than their competitors.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.619
They're focusing on this kind
of assembly line manufacturing

01:08:49.619 --> 01:08:51.500
that allows them to
specialize products

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.862
for what their consumer wants.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:55.279
So they can focus on that, and
even take that a little bit

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:55.779
further.

01:08:55.779 --> 01:08:58.580
And maybe if there's a
huge price difference

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:00.680
than what their competitors
are now charging

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.870
to modify their machines.

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:04.463
And what they have
been charging,

01:09:04.463 --> 01:09:06.380
they could cut price a
little so they're still

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:13.407
a high quality company, higher,
more luxury, but not as much.

01:09:13.407 --> 01:09:15.740
Because they were charging
really, really high premiums,

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:16.240
too.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.779
They could just change that.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:18.870
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: They
could come down a bit.

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:20.490
I mean, although
the premiums seem

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:23.007
to be justified based
on that analysis.

01:09:23.007 --> 01:09:23.840
Everybody over here?

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.010
Pedro.

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:26.479
I tend to look left.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:29.696
So you need to wave your hand.

01:09:29.696 --> 01:09:31.279
AUDIENCE: At the
beginning, I was also

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:34.279
thinking of the manufacturing
costs of the machines.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:38.790
Are those more energy efficient?

01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:41.084
So that's [INAUDIBLE]
production costs.

01:09:41.084 --> 01:09:42.359
That's what I was thinking.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:45.040
But then I was also
thinking, just thought

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.200
of maybe expanding the
market a little bit.

01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:57.220
Because the other companies
produce more types of plastics.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:00.220
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So maybe
go into some other segments, OK.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.880
Let me give you a few thoughts.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.850
They have a lot of choices here.

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:10.360
And it's interesting.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.120
Looking at this whole menu,
one of the things I must

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.730
say that struck
me is before 1995,

01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:21.580
this is a great example of how
all the pieces fit together.

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.230
They focused on a segment.

01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:25.090
They figured out
that that segment

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.860
cares about performance.

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.800
They're all about performance
and technical excellence.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.620
They got a culture
that fits with that.

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.360
All the pieces fit together.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.800
It's IKEA.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.550
It's Southwest Airlines.

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:43.490
And comes now this
difficult time.

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:45.800
Can you make the
things fit together?

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.280
So a couple of choices--

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.400
their basic options-- I
mean, you can try to can try

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.870
to increase--

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:54.970
Netstal is one of the
entrants, you will recall.

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:58.870
You can try to increase
willingness to pay.

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:02.740
You can think
about more service,

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:06.580
more R&D. The question
Schad has to ask himself,

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:11.020
one of the questions, is,
is there room for that?

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:16.220
Differentiation makes you
money if it's cost effective.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.730
So the question is,
how much more service--

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:21.010
what would you get
from increased service?

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:25.000
The question of thinking
about who your customers are--

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.230
are they repeat?

01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:27.850
Is this the same
people expanding?

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.440
Is it new people?

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.080
What's the return to that?

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.240
You could improve
the cost position.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.040
Remember these two
basic approaches--

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.080
you can differentiate,
you can lower cost.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.590
Can you cut cost
and still deliver?

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:47.170
If you cut the perks,
cut the sales force,

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:48.670
will you affect the culture?

01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:52.870
Can you continue to deliver if
you do an aggressive cost cut?

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:53.997
And you can cut margins.

01:11:53.997 --> 01:11:55.330
They've got pretty good margins.

01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:56.663
They've got room to cut margins.

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:05.950
But to become the low-cost
producer-- probably not.

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:08.050
They could go after
other segments.

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:09.790
They only serve part
of the business.

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:12.430
They could grow by
going to other segments.

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:14.200
But given that they're
a high-cost company

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.990
and have a particular culture,
the question you'd have to ask

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:19.060
is, does that fit?

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.320
Can we do that?

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:28.390
And then you'd like the
whole package to fit.

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:31.510
And at this point,
how old was Schad?

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:35.080
Schad was 67 in 1995.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.710
So someone in that age
bracket, let me just say--

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:42.460
he obviously has to think
about what am I handing off?

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.843
Am I going to create something
that's going to go on?

01:12:44.843 --> 01:12:46.510
Because he's not going
to be leading it.

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:49.600
Well, one assumes he's not going
to be an active participant

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.130
for another 20 years.

01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:59.320
So what he did was
actually quite drastic.

01:13:02.347 --> 01:13:04.180
I don't know whether
this is right or wrong,

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.740
but this is what he did.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:08.470
They went into other niches.

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:09.730
They moved out.

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:12.040
They increased their
manufacturing capacity

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:12.850
substantially.

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:15.160
They thought they were
too small for scale,

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.050
so they added capacity.

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:22.760
They cut prices dramatically in
response to low-price entrants.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.380
Probably isn't going
to keep them out.

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.260
They worked to cut costs.

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.720
Cutting prices, it
was argued, was a way

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:34.590
to put pressure on costs and
hope you can keep the culture.

01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:36.480
You basically say to
your people, look,

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.400
we're getting killed on price.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.482
We've got a match,
and the only way

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.690
we're going to make any
money is if we can find a way

01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:44.070
to get the cost down.

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:48.540
But they didn't decrease
R&D. They didn't decrease

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.760
the manufacturing center.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.680
They didn't decrease
the sales force.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.300
They began to build
more in-house.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:03.960
And they had an IPO, sold
off the company in 1968.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.850
How well do you think
this package worked?

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:11.455
Say in words-- not so well.

01:14:11.455 --> 01:14:12.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.150
I mean, also in
hindsight, I would

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:18.970
argue that if you'd have an
organization in the [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:20.000
as well.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So I would argue that the
low-cost manufacturers

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.560
in the US get undercut
by Chinese manufacturers.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.610
And the best way
to stay competitive

01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:31.607
was to stay high
cost, high quality.

01:14:31.607 --> 01:14:32.690
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:35.420
I mean, it's a curious
mixture, isn't it?

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:39.860
Because the company was built
for high cost, high quality.

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:45.140
And they tried to
position themselves

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:51.740
as the high cost, high quality
firm across the market in all

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:55.220
of these niches, even though
in a bunch of the niches,

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.770
quality wasn't that important.

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:04.920
So I've seen numbers
through 1999,

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.500
and they continue to grow
because the business grew.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.680
Their profitability
was not terrific.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.190
It was pretty erratic because
they're changing the company

01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:16.180
rather dramatically.

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.940
And you can't get
any more numbers

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.560
because they went
private last year.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.760
So their website now is
just an advertisement

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.693
for their technology.

01:15:24.693 --> 01:15:26.610
There are no numbers
available because they're

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:29.350
a privately held company.

01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:32.370
They're still in
Bolton, Ontario.

01:15:32.370 --> 01:15:36.320
Questions, comments,
reactions, thoughts?

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.040
Yeah.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.560
AUDIENCE: Did they go private
by some sort of buyout

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:42.552
because of poor performance?

01:15:42.552 --> 01:15:44.510
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Their website doesn't say,

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:48.080
we went private because
we were performing poorly.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.720
The website just says, such
and such a private equity firm

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.550
bought them.

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:56.000
I don't think that's
implausible, but I don't know.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.790
It's not implausible
that this strategy--

01:15:58.790 --> 01:16:03.590
that a private equity firm
said this strategy is a loser,

01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:05.420
and we can make this
firm more profitable

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:06.540
by changing strategy.

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:08.180
But I don't know that.

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:10.840
OK, see you all next time.

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:30.710
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: So we're here,
but don't forget about this.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.750
And so the quiz
is next Thursday.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.500
I'm going to send an
email out with office

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.050
hours for extra time.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.000
But if anyone wants
to meet anytime,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.370
just send me an email, please.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.520
This PSET 2, we decided
is going to be due

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.230
the day before on May 9.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.550
And that's when your PSET
3 will be posted as well.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.610
And PSET 3 will have to do with
the things we've been talking

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.510
about the last two
lectures and today, which

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.010
is what you can do with solids.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.890
Any questions about
the plan, the schedule?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.675
OK.

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:17.175
Right.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.810
Now, there are other
practice problems.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.100
I'll throw one out
from last year's quiz.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.270
So that's a practice
quiz that I gave out

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.303
maybe a year ago or two.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:36.720
And then there's
last year's quiz,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.670
and I'll pull a problem
or two out from that,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.800
and we'll do one today,
and then maybe we'll

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.600
look at another one on Tuesday.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.310
What I want to cover in terms
of the lecture material today

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.270
is, I want to briefly start
with that band structure

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.320
and caspase, and make sure
we're feeling good about it,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.810
and then tell you a few
of the things you can do.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.270
We talked about
the band structure,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.461
we've talked about how it
has so much information.

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.419
Well, what other kinds
of information is there?

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.750
What can you do with these
sorts of properties of solids?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.360
I love this cartoon.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.340
"At some point, his theory
becomes so abstract,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.830
it can only be conveyed
using interpretive dance."

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.450
And mostly it's
because of the visuals

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.350
that I get on my colleagues
here at MIT just dancing.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.380
But we're not going to get
this complicated, right?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.730
So the point isn't for me to do
a lecture on transport theory,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.122
and tell you all about phonons
and go into great detail

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.330
about these different things.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.040
That is, again, not
been our point here.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.515
The point is to keep relevant
and keep pretty applied

00:02:52.515 --> 00:02:54.090
in this class.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.890
So I'm going to give you
just a little hint as to what

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.730
you can do with the DOS
and the band structure.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.750
But we're not going to
go into great detail.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.850
But you can find those
details in many places online

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.430
and in books.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.140
And if you come to me, I'm happy
to talk about these concepts

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.785
that we'll talk about.

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:17.160
So the plan is,
we're going to do

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.560
a little bit of review,
caspase, feeling good

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.270
about oneness, all that.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.073
And then I want to
show you that problem.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.740
We'll talk about just
one band structure

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.840
problem that I happened to
give last year on the exam.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.530
And then we'll talk a little
bit about some properties,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.193
electron transport
a couple of minutes.

00:03:39.193 --> 00:03:40.860
And then we'll talk
about magnetization,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.960
and then we'll do some
calculations together again,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.835
because I think that's
been really enjoyable.

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:49.470
Actually, seriously, I always
enjoy calculating together.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.620
But how many of you
feel like that's useful,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.320
to do some simulations
here in class?

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.360
One, two, more?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.620
OK.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.320
Because please ask questions.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.250
This is the time.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.110
Because this is where we can, if
you have any questions, please

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.040
stop.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.060
And say, I got no idea
what you're talking about.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.150
That's OK.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.770
I love those.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.930
That's what I want to hear.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.222
[LAUGHS] Well, that's actually
not what I want to hear.

00:04:19.222 --> 00:04:21.490
But if I hear it, it's fine.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.760
That helps me to
know where we need

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.170
to have a little discussion.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.060
Now, this is the
concept that we have

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.190
to be really good in
our understanding.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.090
But this is really the
key of this second part

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.650
of the second part, if
you want, of the class.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.290
Which is, we did quantum,
we did quantum for atoms,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.980
we did quantum for molecules,
and now it's all about solids.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.600
And the big difference is
that when you have a solid,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.350
you have over and
over and over again,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.850
the same atom, or same couple
of atoms in your basis.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.820
And therefore, the same
potential that the electron

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.380
feels.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.430
And over and over
again, how many times?

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] 2?

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.481
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: If I
had to give a number.

00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:19.710
AUDIENCE: Oh my god,
there's a couple thousand.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.070
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well, I'd
say more like a couple of 10

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.150
to the 23rd thousands.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.500
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.917
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
10 to the 23rds.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:35.120
If I take a piece of material,
this big, this big, even

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.930
this big.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.040
Even really tiny.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.060
You got like, 10 23rd
repeats of this potential.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.990
That's a lot.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.650
So it's almost infinite.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.770
And when you have that
periodically repeating

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.950
well that the electron
feels, something happens.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.120
And the something
that happens was

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.960
this mathematical
thing that, who

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.990
can remember what it's called?

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.940
It was a theorem, I believe.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.440
AUDIENCE: Bloch's theorem?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.960
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Bloch's theorem.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.620
And we don't need to know
much about Bloch's theorem

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.130
except the endgame.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.020
The key is what it means.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.050
And it's a mathematical
consequence.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.620
It's a consequence of having
an electron, and therefore

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.620
its solution being a
wave function that solves

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.790
the Schrodinger equation.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.430
It's a consequence
of having that

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.730
in the context of a
periodic potential.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.010
You can't get around it.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.970
It's a theorem.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.500
So because of
Bloch's theorem, you

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.523
got to have this
requirement, if you

00:06:52.523 --> 00:06:54.190
want to think about
it as a requirement,

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.090
that when the wave
function repeats,

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.440
the properties just repeat.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.180
The density's the same
here as it is here

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.190
as it is here, 10
to the 23rd out.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.960
But when the wave
function repeats,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.260
it picks up this phase.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.770
And that phase is a number
that lives in k-space, that

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.898
lives in the inverse space.

00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:17.440
And that's why we
spent all that time

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.790
talking about what inverse space
is, what reciprocal space is,

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.680
what k-space is.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:30.490
And that phase is, you can think
about it as another quantum

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.970
number.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.940
So the result of solving
the Schrodinger equation

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.920
and getting psi in
a periodic potential

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.190
gives you a new number.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.850
But it's very different
than these numbers.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.880
How is it different?

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.380
Yeah.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.490
AUDIENCE: The vector.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.970
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, yeah.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:52.470
Right.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:59.790
These are like 1 or 2
or 1, 2, 0, minus 1,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.570
whereas this is
a place in space.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.820
And what else is really
interesting about that vector?

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.920
AUDIENCE: It's in
reciprocal space.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.230
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It's
a reciprocal space.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.670
Absolutely.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.810
Nice job.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.550
You guys did that
together, totally.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.510
Team effort, man.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.380
I love it.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.840
And what else?

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.290
It's a vector in
reciprocal space.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.790
What else?

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:25.981
AUDIENCE: Kind of in
the Brillouin zone.

00:08:25.981 --> 00:08:28.030
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, well,
it doesn't have to be.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.980
But we said it doesn't really
matter if you go outside of it,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.540
because you just loop back.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.780
But what about its variation
in the Brillouin zone?

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.680
How can it vary?

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.590
AUDIENCE: Anything.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.360
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.590
This is a vector
that can be anything.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.210
This thing can be anything.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.100
These things, can
they be anything?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.733
Can l be pi?

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:49.660
AUDIENCE: No.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.540
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Or
square root of 2, right?

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.560
So it's a different
kind of quantum number.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.125
But you see, it has
the same impact.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.560
Because, what do
these things do?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.670
What does this do, anyway?

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.130
What's one of the
things that this does?

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.820
Or this?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.570
What does l do?

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.700
When I change l
from 0 to 1, what's

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.250
one of the things that happens?

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.505
AUDIENCE: Moving
from, like, s to p?

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:24.880
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Yeah, yeah, OK.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.750
So let's write that down.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.760
Well, let's change n up
to here to s, 1s, 2s.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.480
And now you just
said I'm moving to p.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.660
Now, what is this that I'm
always just assuming you know,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.130
is what that vertical axis is?

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.630
What is it?

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.785
AUDIENCE: Fill energy
from lowest to highest.

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:45.790
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.060
So this is the energy going
from lowest to highest, exactly.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.820
And so what did changing the
quantum number, l, from 0 to 1

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.320
do?

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.655
AUDIENCE: It moved from s to p.

00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:59.990
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
it moves it around.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.570
It moves it around.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.150
OK, so you can
change the energy,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.460
and actually, you can also
not change the energy.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.570
m doesn't change the energy.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.660
It gives degeneracy.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.500
But certainly you
can change the energy

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.925
by changing these
quantum numbers.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.910
That's what you can do with k.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.590
That's what k does.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:29.840
k, which is a result of living
in a periodically repeating

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.890
world, k changes the levels.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.570
It's the same idea.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.120
It's very different, but
it has the same impact.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.540
It changes these levels around.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:47.900
And it's very different because
it can do it continuously,

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:55.220
as opposed to these big leaps
that we have in the atom.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.110
Or in the molecule.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.560
In the molecule, there
are also discrete levels.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.050
And so we got this picture
that we came to last time,

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.100
where you see, k
can be a vector.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.265
And it can live anywhere
in this inverse space.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.390
And anytime you change it, you
may change the energy levels.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.350
You may change them.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.940
So it's a really important
thing when you have a solid.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:39.380
Now, again, if I have a
periodically repeating atom,

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.080
but the distance between
them is like, 100 angstroms.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.010
What's the impact
of k going to be?

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.887
We did it in class.

00:11:50.887 --> 00:11:52.720
AUDIENCE: It's going
to be relatively small.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.540
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Relatively small.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.670
Like, almost nothing.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.230
Because the whole effect
comes from the fact

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:08.490
that you have an electron in a
lattice of periodic potentials,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.250
where they're sort
of interacting,

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.190
where they're close enough
that there's some interaction.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.350
If there's no interaction,
and your atoms are really,

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:23.270
really far apart,
then it's basically

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.730
like you just have
isolated atoms,

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.520
sitting in their potentials.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.960
And a whole lot of
empty space in between.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.260
And then the levels
will just look flat

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.670
as a function of k-space.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.440
Doesn't mean you can't vary k.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.910
You could still vary k.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.600
But the bands that you get
will be completely flat.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.290
They'll go back to your
molecular level description.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.970
So does everybody see that?

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.720
All right.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.420
And we talked about that.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.220
And so then the question was,
well, what playground of k

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.530
matters?

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.307
And this is something
we talked about,

00:13:06.307 --> 00:13:07.390
but it's really important.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.900
So I want to review it here.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.670
So we just said that k
is this new index that

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.700
is a continuous variable, that
changes the energy levels.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.300
It moves them around.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.970
OK, so what does that mean
for a calculation, right?

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:28.400
Well, one thing that
it means is that when

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:43.820
I do a calculation, if an
energy level can now do this,

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.520
as a function of
k, then that means

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.380
I need to actually
do my calculation

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.660
with a mesh of k-points.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.160
How fine a mesh do I need?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.397
What's the answer to that?

00:13:57.397 --> 00:13:58.151
AUDIENCE: Depends.

00:13:58.151 --> 00:13:59.640
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Thank you.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.646
On what?

00:14:00.646 --> 00:14:03.130
AUDIENCE: How curvy
the bands are.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.630
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.343
How curvy are my bands?

00:14:06.343 --> 00:14:07.665
AUDIENCE: Pretty curvy.

00:14:07.665 --> 00:14:09.290
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
This is pretty curvy.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.760
So maybe I need a lot of
k-points to capture this.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.170
You got a grid.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.710
I'm solving for this problem on
a grid of k-points, basically.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:23.420
And if I only have a
k-point here and here, well,

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.140
let's say I have it actually
even worse, I have it here

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.900
and here, I'm not
going to really capture

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.480
the right physics here.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.090
So the density of
k-points has to be such

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.770
that you capture the
features, in terms of how

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.790
much these energy levels vary.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.870
So let's go back to these two
atoms that are very far apart.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.760
How many k-points
do I need for those?

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.460
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.602
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: What if
they're really far apart?

00:14:56.602 --> 00:14:57.780
AUDIENCE: One.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.720
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: One.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.220
Whoa.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.520
All the calculations you've been
doing, until we did the solids,

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.950
everything before that
was actually 1 k-point.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.780
It was at 000.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.370
We never varied it.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.670
We never worried about it.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.620
It was never an index.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.760
OK, so now, if the
bands are flat,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.890
you could just have
one k-point, and you've

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:25.120
got the variation of the bands
nailed, since they don't vary.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.400
So you just need the one.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.580
But if they vary a lot, like
if I bring atoms together,

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.340
and they vary a lot, and
there's a lot of interaction,

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.730
then I just need more and more
k-points to represent that

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.690
correctly.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.470
OK, so the k-point
is something that's

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.830
now an essential part
of your calculation.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.310
Now, that's talking
about what you

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.380
need to get the
density right, which

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.270
is to get the wave
function right, which is

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.550
to get the energy levels right.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:01.100
That's a new component of a
quantum mechanical simulation.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.900
But then there was
this other thing

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.150
that's actually a little
bit separate in a way, which

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.980
is to visualize that variation.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.760
Now, visualizing this
variation leads to these plots,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.883
which are called

00:16:19.883 --> 00:16:21.690
AUDIENCE: Band structures.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.230
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Band structures.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.050
This is the band
structure of the material.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.800
Ooh, it's another
kind of phase map,

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.410
for those of you who felt the
excitement of phase diagrams

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.400
in 301-2.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.260
This is like a phase
map for that electron.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:50.160
It's a really
important description

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.290
of how electrons
behave in materials.

00:16:58.948 --> 00:17:00.240
Everything going OK over there?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.865
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:03.003 --> 00:17:04.920
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It
looked like you got hurt.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.190
No, you're good.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:06.690
OK.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.440
All right, I got a little
concerned, but we're over it.

00:17:12.904 --> 00:17:16.410
[LAUGHS] Sorry.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:23.750
The phase map is a
walkthrough k-space.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.530
Now, I just mentioned that
you have a grid that you just

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.220
have to put on here
to do the calculation

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.467
to get the wiggles that
may or may not be there.

00:17:33.467 --> 00:17:35.300
Well, you should take
a guess it whether you

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.190
think they're there,
and then you should see,

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:40.010
and then you should converge it.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:45.797
But now I'm taking a
walk around in that zone.

00:17:45.797 --> 00:17:47.630
And the question is,
where am I going to go?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.330
Well, I'm using 4
by 4 by 4 k-points.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.080
So I'm using a
grid of 64 points.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.860
And I'm plopping it down
into this Brillouin zone.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.510
Should I just look
at the energies

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.290
at each of those points?

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.270
Well, you could do that, right?

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.970
Ideally, you'd like to
be able to visualize

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:19.490
this variation all over
k-space, at every single point.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.800
But why don't we do that?

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.480
Tell me why we don't
usually do that.

00:18:29.264 --> 00:18:32.496
AUDIENCE: Would we be more
interested in isosurfaces?

00:18:32.496 --> 00:18:35.460
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Well, that is true,

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.960
but that's more of
a density thing.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.710
So that's where you'd want
to know the isosurfaces

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.880
of the charged density.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.380
Yeah?

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.691
AUDIENCE: Once you
know a certain amount,

00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:46.441
it's repetitive
throughout this direction.

00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:48.372
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK,
that's definitely true.

00:18:48.372 --> 00:18:49.830
But let's say you
didn't know that.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.450
I'd like to do the most
accurate calculation possible.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.440
Let's say I put a grid over
this k-space of a million

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.760
by a million by a million.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.500
Don't do that on the nanoHUB.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.880
We'll get calls.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.410
[LAUGHS] But let's
say I did that.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.120
Now, I've got a
million by a million

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.040
by a million points
in here, where

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.110
each point has a new set
of energy eigenvalues.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.910
Why can't I just visualize that?

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.190
Yeah.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.451
AUDIENCE: Would it just
take too long to simulate?

00:19:29.451 --> 00:19:31.980
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well, it
would take a whole lot of time

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.330
to simulate.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.070
What about visualizing
it, though?

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.310
How would you visualize that?

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
3D [INAUDIBLE],, right?

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.540
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: But see, it's
not even really just 3D, right?

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.310
Because at each one
of these points,

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.215
I've got a spectrum of energies.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:58.730
So it would be making
your eigenvalues,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.640
each one into a 3D curve.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.850
And I want to look at them all.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.040
You could do that.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:13.730
But you got to remember,
if I go down to here,

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.360
you can't just do it within
this volume element, right?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:24.470
My eigenvalues might shift
up, down in different ways,

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.950
depending on where I am.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.060
How am I actually
going to see that?

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.470
So in a way, what we have is
actually a strong visualization

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.310
challenge.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.780
There's sort of a
good story here,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.440
because luckily,
we can just look

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.440
at a 2D map of this variation
and get all the information we

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.920
need, for almost all materials.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.510
And so, how do you
get it a 2D map?

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.760
Well then, instead of
doing the whole of volume,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.820
you just walk through
the volume along lines.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.840
You literally just walk along
this line, and then this line,

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.510
and then down, and
then back, and then up.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.900
And as you're doing this
walk through k-space,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.590
you plot the energy bands,
and you connect them together.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.870
And you draw lines
between those connections.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.480
This is the same
energy level just

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.730
moving around, along that walk.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:34.370
So that seems like an
oversimplification,

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.910
because I'm not going through
the whole Brillouin zone

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:38.780
by any means.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:43.110
I'm just going through very
particular lines in there.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.510
And yet it's all we need.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.970
And the reason is that
most of the things

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.070
I want to know about a
material, most of the things

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.430
I want to know,
are going to come

00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:00.950
from the variation in these
bands between high symmetry

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.670
points in k-space.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.390
So I can go to other points
in the Brillouin zone,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.860
and I'll get other levels.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.970
I'll get a different
set of levels.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.680
But it's probably
not going to add

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.960
to my knowledge of the
material and the properties

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.220
that I can get.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.850
So for example, I'm
very interested in this

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.300
where this has a maximum,
the valence band, and where

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.240
the conduction band
has a minimum, right?

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.670
And you'll notice, the
minimum for silicon

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.730
is actually not at this
high symmetry point x.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.420
But it does come along the path
to x from another high symmetry

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.110
point, gamma.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.470
It came along that path.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.850
And there's no place in k-space
that gives me a lower point,

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:47.570
you see.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.540
So I nailed the thing
I needed I nailed it

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.010
by going from one high
symmetry point to another.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.325
And that's what a
band diagram is.

00:22:55.325 --> 00:22:58.730
It's a walk through
k-space along lines

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.260
between high symmetry points.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.390
And that gives you
the map that you need.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:07.220
And these sometimes look really
complicated, but just think,

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.070
it's saving you a
whole lot of trouble

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.310
compared to all the data
you actually could have.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.080
But it's giving
you what you need.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.780
Are there any
questions about that?

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.546
That's sort of the key point
here from this band structure.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:37.000
And we've talked about this,
how you get your bands,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.940
just like in an
atom or a molecule.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.370
You get your energy levels
from solving the Schrodinger

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:42.980
equation.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.830
And then you fill them up,
using the Pauli exclusion rule,

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.810
right?

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.070
Add a little bit of
Hund's rule to it,

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.440
although that can be violated.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.250
Don't tell anyone.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.630
And you fill them up
and then you're done.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.820
And when you're done, you've
got your Fermi energy.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.510
Now, it's the same exact thing
here in the band structure.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:12.470
You fill your bands up,
until you've filled them

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.780
up with the number
of electrons that you

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.210
had in your simulation.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.520
And then you've got
your Fermi energy,

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.380
and then if there's a small gap
there, and no bands cross it,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.730
it cannot be a what?

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.087
It cannot be a--

00:24:30.087 --> 00:24:31.037
AUDIENCE: Conductor.

00:24:31.037 --> 00:24:32.120
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: A metal.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.432
It can be a conductor.

00:24:33.432 --> 00:24:34.580
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.070
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It can be
a conductor, a semiconductor,

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:42.740
or a really bad insulating
conductor, also known

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.180
as an insulator.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.790
But it can't be a metal.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.480
Because if no bands cross,
if there's a gap here

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.650
between where you filled
to and the next place,

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.770
then it's not a metal.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.230
So we talked about that.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.438
And that's,
certainly if you have

00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:07.480
an odd number of electrons,
it has to be a metal.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.570
And there's a calculation,
I showed this last time

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.470
of an insulator.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:22.240
And we also talked about
how this density of states

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.680
is another really
important thing here.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.340
And since this is in
your homework as well,

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:32.560
in your current PSET, I'll
get to transport in a sec.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.810
I want to make sure we know
what density of states is.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:48.085
Somebody tell me what the
density of states of the carbon

00:25:48.085 --> 00:25:48.960
atom would look like.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.235
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:53.235 --> 00:25:55.090
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
OK, so let's draw.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:26:01.930
So we had the carbon atom
would have 1s and 2s and 2p.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.460
And how many would I put here?

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.287
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:26:04.287 --> 00:26:06.370
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, and
what about the next one?

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:06.745
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:26:06.745 --> 00:26:08.350
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
OK, I'm liking it.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.036
And here?

00:26:10.036 --> 00:26:10.900
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.920
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: 2?

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.700
OK, like that.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.330
AUDIENCE: Aw.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.830
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Oh, wait, hold on.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.280
OK, thank you, like this.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.750
Oh, sorry.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.860
All right.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.300
That would be an
open shell singlet.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.610
Thank you very much.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.770
OK, now.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.450
OK, so what's my density
of states over this?

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.030
How do I do it?

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.760
OK, yeah.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.320
So I'm seeing
people go like this.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.990
So this was energy here.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.060
And now this is going
to be energy here.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.107
OK, what's my next step?

00:26:47.107 --> 00:26:48.190
AUDIENCE: Drawing a curve.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.060
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Drawing a curve.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.650
OK, I'm going to draw a curve.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.700
What is that?

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.047
AUDIENCE: 1s.

00:26:53.047 --> 00:26:54.130
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It's 1s.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.750
Why not?

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.070
I've just broadened it.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.720
We'll make that 1s.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.330
And what's my next
curve I want to draw?

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.410
OK, sure.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:08.140
And it should be
spaced such that it

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.910
should be the right
energy spacing

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.360
that I get from my quantum
mechanical simulations.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.680
OK.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.110
And what's next?

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.000
2p.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.640
Let's make this go out further.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.810
OK, now 2p.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.127
Now, how should I do this?

00:27:24.127 --> 00:27:25.210
Should I make it the same?

00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:31.370
AUDIENCE: Or shift it
down [INAUDIBLE] energy.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.160
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Shift it down.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.785
AUDIENCE: Same.

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:35.250
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Same.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.110
Is it different than 2s?

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.670
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Well, let's see.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.400
I had two electrons
in each of these.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.686
How many electrons
could go into 2p?

00:27:46.686 --> 00:27:47.500
AUDIENCE: 6.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.030
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: 6.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:51.190
So I actually have
more states there.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.520
I have 3 times as many as here.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.770
So in a way, if you're
thinking about these

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:03.910
as sort of a vertical
line, that is spread out

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.310
by some smoothing
function, just to make it

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:10.600
into a nice, pretty curve, if
it's an atom, if it's really

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.730
an atom, then it's
really just a line.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:13.760
It's a delta function.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.870
But then this should have three
lines all on top of each other,

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.420
right?

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.430
And so if I look
at that, it's going

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:32.390
to lead to a bigger peak,
that has more area under it.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:33.473
Three times as much, yeah.

00:28:33.473 --> 00:28:34.348
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:34.348 --> 00:28:35.360
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.880
So you can fit 6
electrons into this peak.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.720
This is what the density
of states is, right?

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.340
It is the density of states.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.950
[LAUGHS] It is these levels.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.520
It's these levels.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.020
OK.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.020
Does everybody see that?

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.290
Now, where's my Fermi
energy for the carbon atom?

00:29:03.748 --> 00:29:06.453
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:06.453 --> 00:29:07.870
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Is it over here?

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.690
AUDIENCE: No.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.877
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:11.877 --> 00:29:12.835
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Here?

00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:14.735
AUDIENCE: No.

00:29:14.735 --> 00:29:17.630
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It feels
like it should be here, right?

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.260
We like Fermi energies
between peaks,

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.240
but that's just because
we like semiconductors.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.030
No, we like metals
too, and insulators.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.863
They're all good.

00:29:25.863 --> 00:29:26.780
So where should it be?

00:29:29.405 --> 00:29:30.280
Does this sound good?

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.495
AUDIENCE: No.

00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:34.294
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Over here?

00:29:34.294 --> 00:29:35.710
Hmm?

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.200
Somebody tell me when to stop.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.000
Somebody say stop.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.752
AUDIENCE: Stop.

00:29:40.752 --> 00:29:41.710
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.080
OK, now why am I stopping here?

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.530
So that's my Fermi energy
for the carbon atom.

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:49.688
Why is it there?

00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:53.104
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:53.104 --> 00:29:54.730
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Well, it's an atom.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.170
So let's not think about it
necessarily as conducting.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.650
AUDIENCE: It's where
you stop filling.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.740
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: That's
the definition, right?

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.755
Here I filled and I stopped.

00:30:07.755 --> 00:30:08.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:09.588
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:30:09.588 --> 00:30:11.777
So here I filled and I
stopped, and here I filled

00:30:11.777 --> 00:30:12.360
and I stopped.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.270
And what the gentleman
over there said is,

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.760
it's where you stop
filling, right?

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.040
And so here is where
I stop filling,

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.850
because I had this
peak of states, right?

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:28.310
It's a peak of states, the
density of states, that is only

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:32.100
filled by 2 electrons, right?

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.650
Does everybody see that?

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:41.610
So if I had something
else, like say, neon,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.456
would my Fermi energy
be inside the peak?

00:30:44.456 --> 00:30:45.345
AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:45.345 --> 00:30:46.220
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: No.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:46.920
AUDIENCE: It would be just out.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.040
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Just
outside of it, because I

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.010
would have filled it, right?

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:50.510
Yeah.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.000
AUDIENCE: Besides the change
in the location of the Fermi

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.358
energy, would the density states
look the same for nitrogen?

00:30:58.358 --> 00:30:59.900
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Very good question.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.770
It would, actually.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:05.630
In the sense that if
you're looking at atoms,

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.250
a density of states
is a little bit

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.080
of an odd thing for an atom.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.650
But I'm trying to explain
it in the context of atoms,

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:15.650
because I really want you
guys to see the connection,

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.330
and really what it is.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.090
But if you look
at atoms, they're

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.770
nothing more than levels.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:27.200
And those discrete levels
become little shapes

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.520
that you broaden a little.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.290
So it would look the
same as nitrogen,

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.080
because in nitrogen,
you would have that.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.620
Now, what does that do?

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.390
Well, it'll change these
energy level positions.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:39.770
It'll shift them around.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:40.850
This may even change.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.820
The 1s may go down or up,
this may change a little.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.240
And then here, you're going
to change not the peak,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.400
because you still got
6 states, and you still

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.010
got 6 electrons you
can put in there.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.410
But you will change the
Fermi energy within the peak,

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.100
because you can
fill it by one more.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:09.130
And just like going all
the way back to our first

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:14.470
or second lecture, where we had
the orbitals of the hydrogen

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:15.700
atom.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.710
So we had the nucleus
and we had this electron

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.140
that does not orbit.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.060
But there it is orbiting.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:29.110
And then we had the 1s,
and then we had the 2s.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.090
And remember how
we talked about,

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.250
it can actually make
transitions between the two

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.798
without actually
existing between the two.

00:32:36.798 --> 00:32:38.590
There are some times
it has to cross paths,

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.600
which are totally forbidden.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.700
It's sort of exciting,
it's like some sort

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.960
of interesting fiction.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.270
That this electron is
going on an adventure.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.470
And well, that's
what this is, right?

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.940
There is no state in
here, in this energy.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.670
So the DOS tells you that too.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:58.840
That is what's in the DOS.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.820
That information is
contained in the DOS.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:08.230
There cannot be an electron with
an energy where there's no DOS,

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:12.470
there's no states
to support it there.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:17.570
So for an atom, like the
hydrogen atom or the carbon

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.217
atom as well, that's
fairly obvious,

00:33:19.217 --> 00:33:21.050
because you had your
levels and you knew it.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.710
Couldn't be in
between those levels.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:25.340
That's the quantization
stuff we talked about.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:31.920
But now when you get to solids,
and it's a more messy picture.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.070
But it's the same understanding
that you get out of it.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.630
It's the same exact
understanding.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:43.680
So what you do for
atom, molecule, or solid

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:49.380
is you take your levels
and you turn them over,

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.470
and you count up the
number of states,

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:56.050
and that has to be the same.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.440
And you get shapes to the DOS.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.720
If it was an atom, I just
had these little lines

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.820
here from the levels,
and I broaden them.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.530
Now, the levels
are no longer flat.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.590
If it's a solid, they can vary.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.739
And when you turn
that on its side,

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:16.860
it can be really
different, right?

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.523
But it's telling
you the same thing.

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.190
It's telling you
exactly the same thing.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.083
You're filling your
electrons up through here.

00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:24.750
And you're stopping,
well, I don't know,

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.792
is that the Fermi energy?

00:34:25.792 --> 00:34:27.239
I didn't tell you.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.639
But if it is, then
you're stopping there.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.745
And those are your unoccupied
bands, and so forth.

00:34:32.745 --> 00:34:34.320
Does everybody see that?

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.710
It's the same idea.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:42.830
But it's more complicated when
you have these curvinesses.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.330
Yeah.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.045
Right?

00:34:46.045 --> 00:34:48.409
We good?

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:49.310
Sort of?

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.219
Any questions?

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.420
Thoughts?

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:54.920
Yeah.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.418
AUDIENCE: So when you're
looking at allotropic systems--

00:34:58.418 --> 00:34:59.780
so in this case, you have done--

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.380
I'm assuming that
the graphite, this

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.630
would be completely different.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.260
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Completely different.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.411
AUDIENCE: And so
how does that tie

00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:08.248
to solving the
density of states?

00:35:08.248 --> 00:35:10.040
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: You
can write the density

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.110
of states for any material.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:16.130
And the same concept
always holds, right?

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.950
That you have these
accessible places where

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:24.050
the electron can be,
with some probability

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.960
of them being there, right?

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.510
In other words, it's
all about how many

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:33.460
possible energy levels you
have as a function of energy.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.550
That's really what it is.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:39.590
And so, whatever material you
have, the density of states

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:43.310
simply has the same meaning,
but it will look very different.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.600
And in diamond, you're
going to get a big bandgap,

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.780
and in graphite,
well, it's a metal.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.350
In graphene, you have
a crossing at one

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.560
part in the band structure,
goes right through what

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.510
would have been the gap.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.010
OK?

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:11.865
And that's why when you do your
homework, when you do PSET 5,

00:36:11.865 --> 00:36:15.030
there are two ways I want
you to think about how

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.920
these molecules absorb light.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.450
One way is that they
just have some cutoff,

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:25.090
below which in energy or
above which in wavelength,

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.740
they cannot absorb light.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.840
So that's just a single cutoff.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.020
But the other way
is to actually use

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:37.380
the features in
this plot of levels,

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.780
of accessible states
for the electrons,

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.460
to use this information
and weight the absorption

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.480
of the sun by this.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.220
Because that's actually what's
really going on, is that

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.720
the molecule cannot absorb the
same at all the wavelengths

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.680
of light.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.730
Because in some places it
can't absorb any light.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.890
In some parts of the DOS,
there's no probability.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:06.780
So that turns out to
have a really big impact.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.000
OK.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.310
Questions, thoughts?

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.765
Now, let me, before
I go on, it's OK.

00:37:17.765 --> 00:37:22.970
I thought maybe we'd have time
to look at Intro to Solar,

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.340
but that would have
been ahead anyway.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.770
Oh wait, no.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:32.695
Where is the view?

00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:40.600
Huh.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.950
That's not looking very good.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:54.585
I had what I thought was a
nice example of a problem.

00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:55.085
No.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.240
Hang on one second.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:11.980
Oh boy.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.160
Never show anyone your
desktop in a presentation.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.375
That's a bad idea.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.160
But anyway, oh, final quiz.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.483
AUDIENCE: That's last year.

00:38:23.483 --> 00:38:25.400
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
that's from last year.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.735
Yeah, don't worry.

00:38:26.735 --> 00:38:29.360
It's in a very safe
location for this year.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.712
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:38:30.712 --> 00:38:33.170
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Actually,
it's very unsafe, it's up here.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.850
Anyway, wait.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:35.845
Where did it go?

00:38:35.845 --> 00:38:37.570
Ah.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:38.500
Why can't I see it?

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.530
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.203
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Here we go.

00:38:41.203 --> 00:38:43.120
OK, that's the problem
I wanted to talk about.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.250
OK, so this was a problem
from last year's quiz.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:50.261
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:54.810
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, so your
advisor has just spilled coffee

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.210
on the culmination of your
entire summer UROP work.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.090
This is not a true story.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.590
The prediction of
the band structure

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.710
and of an amazing new
material for solar cells.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.290
Unfortunately, in your
excitement to show your work,

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.757
you forgot to back up your data.

00:39:10.757 --> 00:39:12.340
You dropped your
computer in a hot tub

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.050
and you forgot
everything you did.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.003
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:39:15.003 --> 00:39:17.170
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: So you
only have that one printout

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:20.290
now stained with coffee.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:21.880
Can you believe it?

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.960
This is what you got.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.510
Nothing else.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.230
OK?

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.750
Was this material-- you want
to put it back together,

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.330
because you know-- it
was 4:00 in the morning,

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.255
you had had a lot of NoDoz.

00:39:35.255 --> 00:39:36.630
But still, you're
pretty sure you

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:41.160
remember it was going to change
the whole field of solar, OK?

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.490
Now, from this, was
this material metal,

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.796
a semiconductor,
or an insulator?

00:39:46.796 --> 00:39:50.246
AUDIENCE: Semiconductor.

00:39:50.246 --> 00:39:52.720
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Tell me why.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.130
Really?

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.180
Seriously?

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:56.680
Yeah.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.650
AUDIENCE: Doesn't look like
The bands are crossing.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.600
Looks like the tallest
bandgap is just under the 0.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.670
I can't really tell.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.412
And then it doesn't
seem like the bandgap

00:40:06.412 --> 00:40:08.710
for the bands is
crossing, either.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.215
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It
doesn't look like it?

00:40:11.215 --> 00:40:12.415
Can you be certain?

00:40:12.415 --> 00:40:12.970
AUDIENCE: No.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:20.290
It's also a fuller cell.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.040
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well,
you do need metal,

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.700
and maybe it was a revolution
in the metal contact.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.600
That wouldn't revolutionize
solar PV, but still.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.850
Again, see, we're
inclined to want

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.630
to connect these things up.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.670
We're sort of used to
staring at silicon,

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.570
and we think that's
going to do that.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:47.110
But I don't know that you
have enough information here.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.070
I'm not sure you know
enough about this

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:56.040
to know that this band didn't
actually split, and one of them

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.190
crossed up and went this way.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.830
How do you know?

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.200
There is one thing
you know it's not.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.407
There's one of those
three you know it's not.

00:41:05.407 --> 00:41:06.740
AUDIENCE: It's not an insulator.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.198
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Not an insulator.

00:41:08.198 --> 00:41:09.038
Why not?

00:41:09.038 --> 00:41:10.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.910
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Because you can make out

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.730
at least that much,
that these bands,

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.800
they're about an
EV or two apart.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.990
They may be closer,
they may overlap.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.970
But it is not going to
be an insulator, right?

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.275
But you can't tell.

00:41:23.275 --> 00:41:27.550
So this a little bit
of a tricky question.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:30.030
You seem to remember that the
material would absorb light

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.780
very efficiently.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.340
Reconstruct the
band structure plot

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.575
that would correspond
to such a material.

00:41:37.435 --> 00:41:38.810
What are you
supposed to do here?

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.705
Yeah.

00:41:44.705 --> 00:41:47.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
associated with some wavelength

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.552
or a region of
wavelengths alike.

00:41:49.552 --> 00:41:51.635
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, you
could certainly do that.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:42:02.170
And in a way, any band
structure above the bandgap

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.050
is associated with
the region of light.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:09.400
Because except for the bandgap,
below which you cannot absorb

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.090
light, as soon as you
start having states,

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:14.740
you can absorb light.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.000
But the key is here.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.050
It absorbs light
very efficiently.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.980
So what do I need to do in here?

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.300
AUDIENCE: Put a direct bandgap.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.258
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:42:22.258 --> 00:42:25.860
You got to put a direct
bandgap in there somehow.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.610
That's the key.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.350
So you got to reconstruct this.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.540
And it didn't
matter to me where.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.880
And there were all kinds
of really creative curves

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.100
people drew.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.630
But somewhere in
here, maybe this

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:41.440
is going to come down a
little and then go down here.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.810
And then maybe come in like
here, where you can't see.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:50.500
But somehow, you got to try
to make this a direct bandgap

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.210
material.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.100
It's actually pretty
hard, because the stain

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.670
doesn't give you a lot of room.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.910
But it's actually, that
mirrors how hard it

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.490
is to do that for
silicon in real life.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:07.362
The stain and silicon
are deeply connected.

00:43:07.362 --> 00:43:09.320
One minute later, you
realize that actually, it

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.780
didn't absorb light
efficiently at all,

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.210
but instead it was a
revolutionary metal electrode.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.250
Now what would you draw?

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.180
AUDIENCE: Overlapping.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.180
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Right.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.340
You'd cross it up.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.620
Maybe you'd try to get
a lot of wiggles in here

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.770
if you could, or just
certainly several crossings,

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:30.140
so that the electrons
don't really see any gap.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.970
You can't see a gap.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:37.490
So that's kind of
a nice problem.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.670
And you can see, there's
not a very long problem.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.520
But you've got to know a few
things to answer the question

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.310
about these sorts of topics.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.400
OK, so we'll do another one
of those next Tuesday, or two.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:55.040
Wait, where am I here?

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.860
Let's talk about a
few other properties

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.780
that you can calculate.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.480
Again, I'm not going to go
into the details of transport.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:14.340
But this is sort of basic
double E or basic physics stuff.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.560
If you put an
electron in a field,

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.370
it's going to push
it with a force.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:19.960
And so the F equals ma of that.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.460
Yeah?

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.790
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:22.290
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:23.332
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Please.

00:44:23.332 --> 00:44:26.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] absorb
things that are greater here.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.550
It absorbs light that has
energy greater than the gap.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.710
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Greater than the gap.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.500
AUDIENCE: But don't you
want a very small gap

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.000
for a semiconductor?

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.160
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
For what application?

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.000
For solar cells?

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.550
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah, sure.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.230
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: So
that's a very good point.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:46.600
And who can tell me why you
can't have too low of a gap?

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.477
And I'll talk about this
as we move into solar PV.

00:44:50.477 --> 00:44:52.810
AUDIENCE: Because I think the
barrier's not high enough,

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:54.820
and they keep hopping over.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.990
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.460
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: That wouldn't
necessarily be a problem.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:58.960
Yeah.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.942
AUDIENCE: It would probably get
saturated with lower energy.

00:45:02.942 --> 00:45:06.336
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: And what's
wrong with that, though?

00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:08.232
AUDIENCE: You're not
going to be able to use

00:45:08.232 --> 00:45:09.760
the full potential of the cell.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.150
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well,
that's what it is, is it

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.320
actually is what sets the
potential of the cell.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.940
So this goes back to, and it's
a very good question, right?

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.700
Why not just use the
lowest gap possible?

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.280
And then you'll absorb all the
light, or most of the light.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.130
Well, the reason is that it
goes back to this picture

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:30.420
that when you're taking photons
and making them into electrons,

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.630
what you're really
doing is it's again,

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.190
it's that pumping water analogy.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.840
You're giving the
electrons energy

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.830
and pushing them up a hill.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:42.120
Now, in the solar
fuel's case, we're

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.420
using that push to change
the molecule's configuration

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.830
to store energy.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.340
In the solar cell case,
we're using that push

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.830
to get just energy,
voltage out, right?

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.010
So I'd like to not get just a
teeny, teeny bit of voltage.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.930
I'd like to get it up a hill.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:12.800
Now, if I make my band gap such
that I can only push it really,

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.980
really high, you might
think you want that.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.897
But then what happens?

00:46:15.897 --> 00:46:17.355
AUDIENCE: Doesn't
absorb any light.

00:46:17.355 --> 00:46:19.310
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Doesn't absorb any light.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.320
So now you have these
two competing effects.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.840
AUDIENCE: Small bandgap.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.830
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
To absorb the light.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:28.610
Larger bandgap to give you
more potential for yourself.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:32.925
AUDIENCE: And large bandgap,
more potential, small bandgap,

00:46:32.925 --> 00:46:34.140
small potential.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.520
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
But more light.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.700
And there's a sweet spot.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.500
And I'll talk about that.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.440
I'll talk about that a
little bit on Tuesday.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:49.020
That that is two competing
attributes of solar PV

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:54.060
that limit how much energy
you can get from the sun.

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.390
So if you put an
electron in a field,

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:05.430
it's going to move until you
hit this equilibrium point where

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:11.880
the acceleration is 0,
because the force it feels

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.710
is balanced by the scattering.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:18.870
That's sort of basic transport,
electron transport equations.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.410
And so you can get an equation
for the drift velocity

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:23.190
of the electron.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.050
Or the thing that
we care about a lot

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.740
is this electrical conductivity,
something that you can measure,

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.430
which is nothing more than the
drift velocity times the number

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:32.565
density.

00:47:32.565 --> 00:47:34.440
That's actually a hard
thing to separate out,

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.680
but it can be done
in experiment.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.530
And so the current
is that, and it's

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:43.720
equal to the electrical
connectivity times the field.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.540
Now, here's the thing.

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:53.040
That equation, then, if you
just look at these very simple F

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.020
equals ma for an
electron in a field,

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:58.060
that very simply comes
down to this equation.

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.450
And here's the thing.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:05.290
That mass, what we
want now is, well,

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:10.080
what's the electron
conductivity in the solid?

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.180
What's the electron
conductivity in the solid?

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.790
And it turns out
that that mass that's

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:19.530
on the previous page,
that m, it becomes

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:25.890
a kind of effective mass
of the electron that

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:28.955
can be different
than just the mass

00:48:28.955 --> 00:48:31.080
of the electron, the standard
mass of the electron.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.550
The reason is that it's
in this periodic crystal.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.920
Remember, the electron
is going to feel

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.595
this very strange
environment when

00:48:41.595 --> 00:48:42.720
it's in a periodic crystal.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.180
And it's going to feel
differences in its energy band.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.820
And what that does
is it changes,

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.800
actually the effective
mass of the electron,

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.180
as it's in different
parts of k-space.

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.090
Well, it turns out that that
effective mass is directly

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:01.960
related to this curvature.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.400
I'm just rewriting
the previous equation,

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.770
but now I'm putting in
the band structure here.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:13.690
These little v's are nothing
more than the slope of E

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:16.180
in the band structure,
the slope of the energy

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.730
in the band structure versus k.

00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:25.210
So this is called effective
mass approximation.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.540
It's an approximation, but
it's a pretty good one.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:33.197
The electron feels a
different weight to it.

00:49:33.197 --> 00:49:34.030
It's heavy or light.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.410
Think about it that way.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.130
Depending on whether it's in
a flat part of the band, where

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.720
it's really heavy,
or whether it's

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.420
in a curvy part of
the band, where it's

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.060
feeling more light and bouncy.

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:51.830
And that changes
the connectivity

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.220
that can be measured.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.755
So just from the
curvature of these bands,

00:49:56.755 --> 00:49:58.130
it's a really nice
way of getting

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:01.910
a sense of how mobile
an electron or hole is

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.340
in a material.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.380
All you have to do
is you just take

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:15.230
an integral over the
derivative of the slope,

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:19.850
basically, as you go
along k-space there.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.040
So does anybody know
what a Fermi function is?

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.420
It's just a wait.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.060
But-- yeah?

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.070
How many of you don't know
what a Fermi function is?

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:29.570
OK.

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:33.350
So this comes from
Fermi-Dirac statistics.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.770
It's not in any
way critical here.

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.470
But it's an occupation function.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.110
It's saying that at
a given temperature,

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:50.080
you're likely to have electrons
or not at a certain energy.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.540
And so the Fermi function
at 0 temperature,

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.040
F is going to look like this.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.620
Where this would be 1,
and this would be 0.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:14.560
And the Fermi
function is 1 over e

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:26.030
to the E minus EF
divided by KT, plus 1.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.770
Where e is where
you are in the band

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:30.110
structure. e is where you
are in the band structure,

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:34.310
and you're looking at this as
you go above the Fermi energy.

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:35.570
Can electrons be there?

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:38.900
Well, at 0 temperature, no.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.440
But actually, when you go
to some finite temperature,

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.980
just temperature alone
can kick electrons up.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:51.620
OK, that's what the Fermi
function is in that equation

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:52.790
for.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:55.580
Because at some temperature,
you can actually

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.250
have a distribution that
looks more like this.

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:05.790
T equals 0, T equals something.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.120
Now, what's important here?

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.360
Well, what's
important is that when

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:22.410
you think about conductivity,
you want to know, you see.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:28.320
The difference here between
drift velocity and current

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.290
or connectivity is that you
got to know something about how

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:32.640
many carriers you have.

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:40.680
And that's going to be
temperature-dependent.

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.872
Does everybody see that?

00:52:41.872 --> 00:52:43.080
That's why this is important.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.480
Now, but what if my Fermi
function is like this?

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.550
And OK, let's say
I have silicon,

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.390
and I'm going to now
plot on top of this,

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:55.170
I'm going to use a different
color, and plot on top of this

00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:56.640
the density of states.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.610
And let's say my density
of states was like this.

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.130
OK, I don't know
if it is or not.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:07.220
And then here's the bandgap.

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.630
This is my DOS.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.630
That doesn't look like a
different color at all.

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:12.380
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.970
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It's not even close.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.180
It's like they painted
it yellow on the outside.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.130
And seriously,
it's totally white.

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:20.000
All right, anyway.

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.120
So here's my Fermi function.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.460
I'm at room
temperature, and this is

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:30.120
my distribution of electrons.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.690
This is the gap.

00:53:39.682 --> 00:53:40.890
Tell me what's going on here.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:45.150
Somebody explain this to me.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.900
Yeah, Sam?

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.505
AUDIENCE: Even though
there's probability

00:53:52.505 --> 00:53:55.060
that you can have electrons
in that space, because there's

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.646
no space for them to go,
you still [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:56.646 --> 00:53:57.930
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: I love it.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.700
That's absolutely right.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.010
You cannot have electrons there.

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.770
The Fermi function says I can.

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:07.980
In your face, Fermi
function, says the DOS.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.240
I didn't say that.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.160
I would never say that
to a Fermi function.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.020
But the DOS said it.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.902
The DOS said, uh-uh!

00:54:14.902 --> 00:54:17.741
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:54:17.741 --> 00:54:20.070
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: We got
zero probability here, man!

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:22.150
You can't be here.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:26.550
So the DOS said,
no states, no deal.

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:27.570
Go away.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:28.860
So the Fermi function tried.

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.053
It said, hey, I got enough
energy from temperature

00:54:31.053 --> 00:54:32.220
to give you a few electrons.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.720
And the DOS says,
I don't want them.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.510
Because they're not at
the energy where I've got

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.120
any states.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.390
Now, what can I do,
then, to populate

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.010
the conduction band of silicon?

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.975
What can I do?

00:54:47.975 --> 00:54:49.780
AUDIENCE: More thermal energy.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.450
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
More thermal energy.

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:55.810
I'm going to run my solar
cell at 10,000 degrees.

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:59.740
Well, you'll get more and more.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.320
And you will start to
get electrons in there.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.570
But actually, that's
not always practical.

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:05.836
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:55:05.836 --> 00:55:10.617
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: So how do
we get electrons into there?

00:55:10.617 --> 00:55:12.200
Then there are other
reasons electrons

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:18.830
come into those states,
not just from thermal.

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:23.460
But what's one way that we
can get electrons in there?

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.390
AUDIENCE: Doping.

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.348
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:55:25.348 --> 00:55:26.476
What does doping do?

00:55:26.476 --> 00:55:29.385
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
changes it from energy.

00:55:29.385 --> 00:55:31.760
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well, it
can change it from the energy.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.571
But what might I
dope silicon with?

00:55:35.571 --> 00:55:37.375
AUDIENCE: Phosphorus.

00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:38.610
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Phosphorus.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:39.547
Why?

00:55:39.547 --> 00:55:40.673
AUDIENCE: Excess electron.

00:55:40.673 --> 00:55:42.090
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Excess electron,

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.400
but compared to silicon.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:51.360
Now, if I have an excess
electron sitting in my crystal,

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.093
but really the crystal is
still kind of silicony,

00:55:55.093 --> 00:55:57.260
because I don't have many
of these excess electrons.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.720
I just have one phosphorus
atom every 1000.

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.880
So it's really still silicon.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.850
But I filled all my
electrons up to here.

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:06.200
And now I've got one extra.

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.204
Where does it go?

00:56:07.204 --> 00:56:08.820
AUDIENCE: It goes in there.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.580
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Goes in there.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:15.200
And now I'm populating it
without thermal energy, right?

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.990
I don't need to work
with my Fermi function,

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:20.180
I did it chemically.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:23.750
I put an atom in there that
had a spare electron, right?

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:26.030
And that is actually,
in fact, exactly what

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:29.630
happens in real materials.

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:32.670
Who knows what it's called when
you have an extra electron,

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:34.410
or an excess of electrons?

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:35.490
AUDIENCE: N-type?

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.690
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: N-type.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.272
Now, what if I wanted holes?

00:56:39.272 --> 00:56:40.480
What if I wanted extra holes?

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.466
AUDIENCE: B-type.

00:56:41.466 --> 00:56:43.880
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: B-type.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.436
And what would I put in there?

00:56:45.436 --> 00:56:46.744
AUDIENCE: Boron.

00:56:46.744 --> 00:56:47.810
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Boron.

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:49.364
Because?

00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:50.915
AUDIENCE: It's an electron.

00:56:50.915 --> 00:56:52.373
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It's an electron.

00:56:52.373 --> 00:56:54.320
Now, you could dope it
with many other things.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.540
You don't have to dope silicon
with just phosphorus or boron.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.210
It turns out that those
are easy and there

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:04.490
are some advantages in
terms of their processing,

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:06.890
and chemically,
they can be happy.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.530
But there are many ways
of doping materials.

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.150
Many, many ways of
doping materials.

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:14.272
And one of the things
you do with doping,

00:57:14.272 --> 00:57:15.980
there are many things
you do with doping.

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:19.940
But one of the things you do
is you get electrons or holes

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.530
into these bands.

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:23.750
You populate them, right?

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.460
But this expression
is ignoring that.

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:28.010
This is just saying,
well, we're going

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:31.460
to see if there's some
thermal energy there,

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.100
and we'll use that.

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.620
OK?

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.120
Yeah.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.000
Any questions about that?

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.170
Now, we talked about this a lot.

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:44.790
So I'm not going to
go over this again,

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:49.570
that the direct transitions
are easy for photons.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:53.710
The indirect ones where you
shift where you are in k-space

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:56.860
are hard, OK?

00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:01.870
And that is why silicon is
an expensive solar cell.

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.370
So we talked about
this, and I don't

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:05.530
want to belabor the
point, because I

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:09.010
want to try to get to some
simulations, if possible.

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.500
Any questions about that
point, though, the optical

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.250
transitions?

00:58:15.575 --> 00:58:16.302
All right.

00:58:16.302 --> 00:58:17.760
So the kinds of
things you can get.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.310
Well, you can get optical
properties, right?

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:25.950
And you can also get
magnetic properties

00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:27.440
from these densities of states.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.190
So we talked about the
optical properties.

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:35.340
And the optical properties is
really the context of your PSET

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.720
5, but it's for a molecule.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.250
We haven't talked
about megnetism,

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.430
and I want to come back to
it, because I did mention

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:45.140
that electrons have spin.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:49.220
And therefore, they also
have a magnetic moment.

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:52.790
And we call this, just
think of it as some constant

00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:54.530
that we call the Bohr magneton.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:55.350
It has a value.

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:02.900
Well, and if you think
about an atom or a molecule,

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:06.710
you could just get that by
knowing how many electrons

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:12.740
are spinning in one direction
more than the other, right?

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.170
So you can just count
how many spin up

00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:18.945
electrons minus how many
spin down electrons you have,

00:59:18.945 --> 00:59:20.570
and multiply that by
the Bohr magneton.

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:22.320
And that will give you
the magnetic moment

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.530
of the atom or molecule.

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:25.910
But what would I do for a solid?

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.770
Do I still have it?

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:32.910
Yeah.

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:35.820
See, there's the atomic picture
where I could just count.

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.700
And in this case,
the difference is 3.

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:39.330
Right?

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.050
But now, I've got a solid.

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.050
So what do I want to do?

00:59:47.545 --> 00:59:49.455
What do I want to
look at for a solid?

00:59:49.455 --> 00:59:50.640
AUDIENCE: Density of states.

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.200
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Density of states.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.390
And it turns out
that you can plot

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:58.380
the density of states for spin
up and spin down electrons

00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.930
separately.

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.840
And they can be different.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:05.660
They can occupy the
two spins differently

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:09.920
in a more complicated
way, but very much same

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.010
idea as what can happen
in and out of them.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:14.630
But it's more
complicated as you get

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:17.930
these curvy bands and
all kinds of other things

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:19.470
that can happen in a solid.

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:24.230
So now, you look at the separate
density of states for electrons

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.210
with spin up versus spin down.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:28.400
And that is something that
I didn't talk about yet.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.300
It's an input
parameter in SIESTA

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.660
that is checked yes
by default. And it's

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.910
called spin polarized,
question mark,

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:40.170
I think is what it's called.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.400
Spin polarized?

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.340
I should give the
right intonation.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.840
And you say yes or no.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.683
And you say yes, because
that's the default.

01:00:47.683 --> 01:00:49.350
But what are you doing
when you say yes?

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:51.210
Well, what you're
doing is you're

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:56.430
telling the calculation to
allow the up and down electrons

01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:00.000
to have freedom
from one another.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.510
That's actually critical.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:04.380
So if you didn't
do that, you would

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:08.820
be simulating the material
with the constraint

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.530
that the up and down
electrons are exactly

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:12.405
at the same energies.

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:19.560
So spin polarized,
the reason you

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.470
do calculations that
are not spin polarized

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.960
is because many
systems don't have

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.400
a difference between up
and down electrons, right?

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.160
And they are actually
all the same, right?

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.910
What do I have if
I fill this up?

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:39.810
What atom is that?

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:40.790
AUDIENCE: Neon.

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:43.060
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It's neon.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.720
And here, every up electron is
the same as every down electron

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.330
for a given state.

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.200
Everything is the same here.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.050
So it's not like this up
electron of this p orbital

01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:59.590
wanted to be there, and the
down one wanted to be there.

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:01.450
That doesn't happen for neon.

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:04.390
And it doesn't happen for many
systems and many materials.

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:07.330
But certainly in some
cases, and certainly

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:10.630
for magnetic materials,
that's what causes magnetism.

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:17.500
It's that you have a difference
between spin up and spin down.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.130
And that as you occupy
the density of states,

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:26.680
literally you get a difference
in the number, right?

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.920
So that's what
causes the magnetism.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.950
So for many materials, there
is no spin polarization.

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.595
Or in other words,
there is no difference.

01:02:37.595 --> 01:02:39.220
Spin up and spin down
is the same here,

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.990
same here, same here.

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:45.100
But if it's a magnetic
material, what you'll find

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.380
is that if you plot
the density of states

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.900
separately for spin
up and spin down

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:54.100
electrons, like in this case
for iron, there's a difference.

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.670
And in fact, the magnetic
moment of that material

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:01.840
is nothing more than the
integral of that difference.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.660
Again, you're
integrating the DOS.

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:09.710
And you're finding something
really cool about the material.

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:13.265
So that's the same
thing as just counting

01:03:13.265 --> 01:03:15.140
number of up a number
of down, but now you're

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:19.740
counting it in this very
complex filling of states

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.870
that happens in a material.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.300
Any questions?

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:32.510
So if I did a calculation
of iron with spin polarized

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:38.070
checked no, then you see,
these would be identical.

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:41.037
And I'd get no magnetism.

01:03:41.037 --> 01:03:41.870
And you can do that.

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:45.260
You can actually do
the calculation of iron

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.343
with spin polarized checked
no, and it's completely wrong.

01:03:48.343 --> 01:03:49.760
It's not the ground
state of iron.

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:55.940
And if you do it with
spin polarized on,

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.920
then it allows those
up and down electrons

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.140
to move relative to each other.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:07.065
And the outputs, you'll
see that in the plots,

01:04:07.065 --> 01:04:09.440
there's something called the
projected density of states.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.400
And it's projected for
one spin and another spin.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.280
And that would allow
you to calculate

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.140
the magnetic
properties of materials

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.940
using the nanoHUB tool.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.330
And I think last year we might
have done a homework on that.

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:24.960
But this year, we won't.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.380
But I want you to know about
it, because it's kind of cool.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.870
OK?

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:30.770
Any questions?

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:34.910
Mm-hm.

01:04:37.995 --> 01:04:39.370
A couple other
things you can do,

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:46.270
and first principles,
quantum molecular dynamics,

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:48.210
you can do it.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:52.920
You can do MD, Just like you
did MD in the first part.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:59.910
You're just getting f from the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:03.990
I referred to a
couple lectures ago.

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:09.030
But it's basically just a
way of getting the forces

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.010
using quantum mechanics.

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:13.560
And I don't really want
to go into it in detail,

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.060
but I just want to
tell you, you can

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:19.500
get the force on these atoms
from these quantum mechanical

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.280
simulations.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.330
And you can do dynamics.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:24.090
Here's one I did
a long time ago.

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:28.120
And here the problem was
that, how do nanotubes grow,

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.150
which was a big question, OK?

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:36.730
And so what you have is, you
have a piece of iron here.

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:39.970
And this is what
happens when you

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.880
grow nanotubes, is you
have these seed particles,

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.540
like iron.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.440
It can be other things,
nickel, other things will work.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.460
Not gold.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.610
And then you flow some
kind of gas over it

01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:55.200
that dumps carbon
onto the catalyst.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.620
Now, the problem is that
understanding how that then

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.230
leads to the growth of a tube
is still an open question,

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.730
by the way.

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:04.810
Still an open question.

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.570
Nobody actually really knows
the full answer to that.

01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:09.340
But certainly, people
were just debating,

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:13.120
does the carbon go inside
the catalyst or not?

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.670
Does it stay on the surface,
does it saturate the catalyst

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:20.920
first, and then come out from
the bulk, from the particle?

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.370
And that's a perfect
problem for quantum,

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:27.050
because there's so many
different bonding environments,

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.160
and so many possibilities here,
that classical potentials will

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.380
fail.

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:36.190
They're not going to capture all
of the different complexities

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:40.507
in how carbon needs to bond
to iron, inside and out.

01:06:40.507 --> 01:06:42.590
And so it's a great problem
for quantum mechanics.

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:46.930
And we studied this, and we
fed the simulation carbon,

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:52.660
and we just watched how the
tube winds up making its way out

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.450
of the system.

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:55.492
And we showed that it
doesn't saturate, actually,

01:06:55.492 --> 01:07:00.287
inside the iron, but rather
stays on the surface.

01:07:00.287 --> 01:07:01.495
And it makes for cool movies.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.510
Somebody tell me something
you notice about this.

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:09.790
Besides just, it's
kind of a fun movie.

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:14.650
But do you notice anything?

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:17.900
There's the initial
nanotube growth.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.170
And that's where it ended.

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:22.270
So I notice two things.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:22.945
Yeah.

01:07:22.945 --> 01:07:24.820
AUDIENCE: Some rings
are more than 6 carbons.

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.903
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Oh yeah.

01:07:25.903 --> 01:07:27.520
Actually, that's a
really good point.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.380
So that was a very interesting
part of the analysis is,

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.280
what kind of carbon you get.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.150
When you catalyze carbon on
a surface, what does it do?

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:39.640
Does it form nice graphene
and then curve it?

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.550
Or does it form the defects
so that you can curve it?

01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:45.130
Where are the penalties
in energy coming from?

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:49.463
But actually, I was going to
say some negative things, two

01:07:49.463 --> 01:07:50.130
negative things.

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:54.200
They're not negatives,
but they're limitations.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.700
Tell me something
obvious about this

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.418
compared to, say, the
protein simulations

01:07:57.418 --> 01:07:58.460
we did in the first part.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.910
AUDIENCE: Very small.

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:00.870
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.970
This is really tiny.

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:05.632
And how long do you
think this went?

01:08:05.632 --> 01:08:06.848
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:06.848 --> 01:08:08.140
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: What is that?

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.515
AUDIENCE: When was it found?

01:08:09.515 --> 01:08:10.015
What year?

01:08:10.015 --> 01:08:13.150
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: I'm not
going to tell you, because that

01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:15.550
would make me feel old.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:16.569
A while ago.

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:22.359
[LAUGHS] But anyway,
how long can you

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:25.120
run a molecular dynamics
simulation having to do

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.800
quantum mechanics at each step?

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.240
AUDIENCE: Very short period.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.200
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.710
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well,
how long could you

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:35.050
do proteins with classical MD?

01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:36.370
Huge systems.

01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:38.109
Could you do them for seconds?

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:38.770
No.

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.621
But how long?

01:08:40.621 --> 01:08:41.794
AUDIENCE: Milliseconds?

01:08:41.794 --> 01:08:44.229
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
actually even longer.

01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:47.410
With classical MD, you can
get up to microseconds now.

01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:52.420
Certainly nanoseconds, just 10,
100 nanoseconds, no problem.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.600
Here, we're at 10
picoseconds, right?

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.340
Even 2 picoseconds.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.517
Nowadays, you can push
50, 100 picoseconds,

01:09:01.517 --> 01:09:03.100
but you wouldn't go
further than that.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.760
It's really hard.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.910
So the time and size
are really limited.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.390
And that's why with
quantum MD, you

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:13.000
study small systems
for short timescales.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.319
This was now cluster growth.

01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:21.520
I think quantum, these are
just other things you can do.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.430
This is supposed
to be just making

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:27.702
sure you see that it's not
just the band structure in DOS.

01:09:27.702 --> 01:09:28.660
There are other things.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.740
You can do a lot of things
with quantum simulations.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:36.340
Water is a really cool problem.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.130
And I love Cavendish.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:40.540
I love reading about Cavendish.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.880
Has anybody read
about Cavendish?

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.180
He's such a fascinating guy.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.770
He's a university dropout.

01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:51.130
He compared the
connectivities of electrolytes

01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:55.570
and expressed a version of
Ohm's law way ahead of time.

01:09:55.570 --> 01:10:00.790
And he measured the
gravitational constant.

01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:03.790
And he came up with really
water, which at that point

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:10.360
was phlogiston and
dephlogisticated air, which

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.850
I love those names.

01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:14.650
Which is hydrogen and oxygen.

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:19.225
But anyway, water has these
really interesting properties.

01:10:19.225 --> 01:10:22.068
This is a wonderful website
to read about water.

01:10:22.068 --> 01:10:23.110
I'll give you the answer.

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:26.030
It actually looks like this.

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:29.310
Water sees water like
this, not like this.

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:33.320
So it really sees it
much more spherical

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.150
than we usually draw it.

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:39.020
And yet, it does have these
very definite bondings

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:39.920
that it likes to do.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.820
And the point I want to make
is, when you go into an MD code,

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.920
and you put water in
there, did you use water

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.600
in your protein simulations?

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.335
Yeah.

01:10:48.335 --> 01:10:49.460
Which water did you pick?

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.710
You must have
picked a potential,

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:57.300
or the code picked a potential.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.000
Right?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.620
Tip 3P to 4P.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:02.120
Well, there's hundreds of them.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.430
These are just a few
water potentials.

01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:05.510
Why are there so many?

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:08.450
Well, because some of them
reproduce some things better

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:09.860
than others, right?

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:13.130
And that gets to be a
really serious problem

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:16.580
if you want to study some of the
fundamental problems of water.

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:20.510
And there's so many mysteries
that we still don't know,

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:24.560
in terms of what happens when
water evaporates, freezes.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.480
And so, which one is best?

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.090
Well, this is a perfect
problem for quantum mechanics.

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:31.790
And I won't go
through the details.

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:38.000
But you can do
water with quantum.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.530
And this is a good
way to validate

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:43.550
which potential you use in
your classical simulations.

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:45.500
You can also calculate phonons.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:51.170
You can just displace atoms and
calculate energy differences,

01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:52.640
and get frequencies.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.050
So you can calculate phonons.

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:58.040
And when you calculate
photons in a crystal,

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.860
that's different
than in a molecule.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.670
When you calculate
phonons in a crystal,

01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.610
you're getting the,
waves the sound waves.

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:12.520
You're going to get the acoustic
waves in the material, right?

01:12:16.475 --> 01:12:17.550
You're just using water.

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:21.720
In a water molecule, how
many phonon modes do I have?

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.520
In a water molecule?

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.850
Who can tell me?

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:30.510
Take a guess.

01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:31.080
AUDIENCE: 6.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.580
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It's a good guess.

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:37.020
Let's get rid of
translational and rotational.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:40.510
How many waves can the
water molecules stretch?

01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:41.965
AUDIENCE: Two.

01:12:41.965 --> 01:12:44.760
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
there's actually three, right?

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.830
Because the OHs can stretch,
and the bond can stretch.

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:54.690
But then there's two different
ways that it can go, right?

01:12:54.690 --> 01:13:01.840
And so those are your phonon
modes for the molecule.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.720
It's just stretch
frequencies, right?

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.370
And they can be measured.

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:09.300
In a solid, you calculate
your phonon modes

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.640
by moving atoms
around in the lattice.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:18.815
And that actually
gives you the behavior

01:13:18.815 --> 01:13:20.940
of the sound waves in the
material, which tells you

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.400
something about how sound
travels in the solid,

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.380
and you can calculate
the sound velocity,

01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.740
you can calculate
thermal transport.

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:31.020
You can calculate the heat
capacity of the material.

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.350
All of this are things that
we do with quantum mechanics

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:37.260
that we're not going to
do in any of our problems,

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:37.860
or anymore.

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:40.152
But I just wanted you to be
aware of some of the things

01:13:40.152 --> 01:13:43.260
that people do in
research, and that

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:47.970
are really a big part of
quantum mechanical simulations.

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:52.950
So those are some
of the properties.

01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:54.450
So that was sort
of the point here.

01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:57.360
You can do a wide calculator,
a wide range of properties.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.783
This has been our
focus, these two.

01:14:01.783 --> 01:14:03.450
And we're going to
stay with that focus.

01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:07.860
But there's a very large
range of things you can do.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.110
Now, I want to just end.

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:12.420
I got 5 minutes, OK?

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:17.740
And we'll start solar
with this on Tuesday.

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.740
But for five minutes, I
want to do a simulation.

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:25.800
So we'll start solar on Tuesday.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.050
But here we are.

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:29.580
You know which tool it is.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.510
It's our favorite.

01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:33.260
AUDIENCE: Are we
[INAUDIBLE] Tuesday, or no?

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.680
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: And we'll
do another problem or two

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.880
in class.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.200
And I can do a little review.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.050
I sort of did that on
Tuesday of this week.

01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:47.120
Does anybody want to do
more review next week?

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.470
What do you guys think?

01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:49.670
A little bit?

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:50.630
Yeah?

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:52.820
OK.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:54.890
What I'll do next
Tuesday is we'll

01:14:54.890 --> 01:15:03.830
do another quiz problem from
last year like we did today.

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:06.560
I'll ask if you have any
questions about this practice

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.410
quiz but, I'll also
post the solutions.

01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:15.560
And I'll go over some key things
to keep in mind for the quiz.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.870
So we'll spend the first
half of class on that, then.

01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:20.510
But let me just spend the
last few minutes here.

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:21.590
Let's do a simulation.

01:15:23.985 --> 01:15:25.360
AUDIENCE: It's
open notes, right?

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.500
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It's open notes.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.450
Open notes, yeah.

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:30.875
AUDIENCE: Does that
mean computer is open?

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:34.570
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: I think no.

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:40.265
Because that's like,
everything, right?

01:15:40.265 --> 01:15:41.890
What did you guys do
in the first part?

01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:43.080
AUDIENCE: We had the computers.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:43.755
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: You
had the computers?

01:15:43.755 --> 01:15:45.672
AUDIENCE: We had the
computers, but we weren't

01:15:45.672 --> 01:15:46.938
allowed to use the internet.

01:15:46.938 --> 01:15:51.160
So I don't know how
they were checking that.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:58.127
But I [INAUDIBLE] my
computer, so I don't know.

01:15:58.127 --> 01:15:59.960
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK,
let's put it this way.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.570
If we do open computers, then
I'll make the problems harder.

01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:03.425
AUDIENCE: No.

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:04.300
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK.

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.940
[LAUGHS] All right.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.950
Because Wikipedia's
pretty powerful, right?

01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:13.000
And Google.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.747
And so if you have that, you
can find a lot of close answers

01:16:18.747 --> 01:16:19.580
with a quick search.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:23.740
So I'd have to be a
little more creative.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:25.570
But you won't need
your computers.

01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:27.230
And it's full open notes, right?

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.820
OK.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:34.990
Now here's what I wanted to do.

01:16:38.295 --> 01:16:38.795
OK.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.600
Let's go to our favorite
thing here, SIESTA.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.380
There it is.

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:57.150
So I wanted to show you first
of all, this feature here,

01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:58.790
which is that spin polarized.

01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:59.590
Do you see?

01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:00.470
Yes?

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:01.710
No.

01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:02.270
OK?

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:08.965
Now, when it's yes, and
I calculate silicon,

01:17:08.965 --> 01:17:12.625
here's the calculation of the
density of states of silicon,

01:17:12.625 --> 01:17:13.750
is what I want to show you.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.280
What you are going to find.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.620
Oh, I didn't fill
out the structure.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:27.740
Is that, OK, so this
is just rounding out

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:31.625
our SIESTA understanding
of what the tool does.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:33.500
Because there were just
these few things that

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.240
we hadn't talked about.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.490
This is the density of states.

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:40.150
And you now really feel
your oneness with this.

01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:41.150
You know what these are.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:47.690
You look at this, and you
get emotional, which is OK.

01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:48.530
But look at this.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:54.920
I also have here,
because I did, let's see

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.950
if it does this right.

01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:00.350
Total, and there.

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:01.910
Look at that, OK.

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:04.463
You see, it's
automatically doing

01:18:04.463 --> 01:18:06.380
what's called the projected
density of states.

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:08.900
And what a projected density
of states is, is it's

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:12.620
the density of states, but
only for a certain part

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.360
of the system.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.070
Which turns out to be
really interesting.

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:18.070
Like sometimes you just
want to know the density

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:19.670
of states for one type of atom.

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:23.390
Where is that atom
contributing to the states?

01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:26.270
Or in this case, because
it has been polarized,

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:29.420
it's giving me the density of
states for spin down and spin

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.410
up separately.

01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:31.340
And look at this.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:37.320
They are, while spin down,
spin down, you can't see it.

01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:41.850
There's some spin up in there.

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.760
They're exactly on
top of each other.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.774
What does that mean?

01:18:46.774 --> 01:18:48.615
AUDIENCE: Same energy.

01:18:48.615 --> 01:18:49.990
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
All the spin up

01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:52.940
electrons when they're
paired with spin down,

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.100
they all have the same energy.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.140
They have the exact
same position on this.

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.360
And they lead to
this total DOS here.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:04.300
They just add up.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:08.230
So if I did silicon
with spin polarized off,

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:12.665
then the answer would
be exactly the same.

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:15.040
So there was really no need
to do it with spin polarized,

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.470
but it's the default. And
now if I do iron, you see?

01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:22.930
And I press simulate.

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:29.428
Then what you'll find is that
you should see a difference.

01:19:29.428 --> 01:19:30.220
Let's see if we do.

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.450
Here is iron.

01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:39.160
And now you have the
total density of states.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.800
Oh, what is this?

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.923
I forget, is this an insulator?

01:19:43.923 --> 01:19:45.690
AUDIENCE: No, it's
a [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:47.023
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: How do I know?

01:19:47.023 --> 01:19:48.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.920
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Because
I got some DOS here, right?

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.000
At the Fermi energy.

01:19:57.450 --> 01:20:01.810
Oh, we got to do it for iron.

01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:02.900
And now look at this.

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:03.760
This is beautiful.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.220
OK, so this is the
total, the green.

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:13.810
That's the total.

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:14.590
And look at this.

01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:18.340
The red is the spin down.

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.680
And the blue is the spin up.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.730
And look at those differences.

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:24.900
What does it mean?

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.620
Whoa!

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.698
I mean, you've got to
integrate it to know.

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:28.740
But there's a difference.

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.870
There's a big difference
in the spin up

01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:32.460
and spin down
electrons and where

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.370
they sit in energy space
in the magnetic material.

01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:36.240
There can be.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.670
That's what makes it a magnet.

01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:42.180
And so if you integrate
that difference up to here,

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.810
well then, you're going
to get this magnetization.

01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:51.280
If I simulated iron with
spin polarized turned off,

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.670
it would force those
to be exactly the same,

01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:55.810
and they would lie exactly
on top of each other,

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:58.500
just like they just
did in silicon.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.260
But that would be not iron.

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:05.550
So you got to be aware of
what this spin thing is,

01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:07.440
and when you need it,
when it's important.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.215
Keeping it on is safe.

01:21:09.215 --> 01:21:10.840
But I wanted you to
know what it means.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.330
So OK.

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:13.530
Very good.

01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:15.500
Have a good weekend.

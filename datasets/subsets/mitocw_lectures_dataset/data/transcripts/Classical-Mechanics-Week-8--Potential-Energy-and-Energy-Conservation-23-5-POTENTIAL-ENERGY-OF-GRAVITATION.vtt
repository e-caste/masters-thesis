00:00:03.772 --> 00:00:05.980
We would now like to calculate
the potential function

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.890
for a universal law of gravity.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.382
So let's set up a
coordinate system first.

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:13.840
And in this case, we're going
to make a very special case--

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.200
although, the general result
doesn't depend on that.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.130
So suppose we have a
planet of radius rp

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.410
and we have a small object.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.840
And initially, our
object is a distance r

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.130
away from the planet.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.070
This is our initial state.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.290
And the planet has
mass to the planet.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.380
And our small object has m.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.980
And this object is moving.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.320
Of course, orbits
really aren't like that,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.870
so we should be a
little bit more careful.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.780
But our orbit might be some type
of hyperbolic section-- conic

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.950
section.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.830
And the orbit over here
is at some final position.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.790
In our eyes, the distance
from the object to the center

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.750
of the planet as our final is.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.390
Now because there's a central
point to this problem,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.790
the natural coordinate
system to use

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.360
is polar coordinates
in the plane.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.100
And let's just imagine
that at this moment

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.890
we have the universal
force of gravity.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.300
Here's our object.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.630
And it's being
displaced a distance s.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.420
So our coordinate
system is polar.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.970
Let's call r hat this way
and theta hat that way.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.490
And let's blow up our
little displacement

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.259
in terms of our
coordinate system,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.910
just so that we see
what's happening.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:50.500
So let's imagine
that our little ds

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.310
vector is pointing like this.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.900
And our center point here,
we have tge r hat pointing

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.740
radially outward
and the theta hat

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.470
pointing towards the center.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.620
Now to exaggerate this
picture, if this is r,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.030
then the arc length
here is rd theta.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.610
And the difference as
the object moves from one

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.142
point here to a closer point
towards the center, will be dr.

00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:32.530
And so our ds vector, we can
write as a radial piece r hat.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.390
Now, I don't put
a sign in there,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.160
because only the end
points of my integral

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.290
will tell me whether I was
going towards the planet

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.660
or away from the planet.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.670
And rd theta, theta hat.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.370
And our gravitational
force is minus

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.960
g mass mass of the planet over
the distance squared r hat.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.440
So now what we see
is that when we

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.890
take the dot product
of these two forces,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.920
r hat dot r hat is 1
in polar coordinates.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.490
Why is that the case,
r hat dot r hat is 1?

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.970
Because these vectors are
in the same direction,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.830
the angle between them is 0.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.550
And remember, that any two
vectors that are perpendicular

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.320
have dot product 0.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.320
r hat and theta hat
are perpendicular.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.550
And so r hat dot r hat is 1.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.420
r hat dot theta hat is 0.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.500
And so we only get
minus GMP r squared dr.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.740
And that's the first
step in calculating

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.310
our potential difference because
U of r final minus U of r

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.840
initial by definition is
minus the work done in going

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.990
from the initial state
to the final state, which

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.910
are described by these
parameters r initial

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.130
and r final of F
gravitation dot ds.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.120
And now we have,
actually, minus sign

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.040
in the definition, another
minus sign coming from the dot

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.450
product.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.550
And lets make this our
integration variable,

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.489
r prime, r initial, r
prime equals r final.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.030
And there's going
to be a third minus

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.680
sign because the integral of
dr r prime squared is minus 1

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.110
over r prime.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.210
So there would be
3 minus signs-- one

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.150
from the definition, one
from the scalar product,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.860
and one from the integration.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.560
And so we get r final minus r
initial equals 3 minus signs

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.770
given overall minus
sign planet and planet

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.770
1 over r final minus
1 over r initial.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.460
So this is the change in
gravitational potential energy

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.760
as my small object goes
from some initial state

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.770
to some final state.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.350
What about the
potential function?

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.590
Where should we choose
our reference point?

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.750
So our reference state here
is a little bit unusual.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.590
And it will be at infinity.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.820
And we'll choose as a potential
for our reference potential

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.050
to be 0 at infinity.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.840
Imagine initial state very,
very far away from the planet.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.570
And we'll take us a final
state, an arbitrary state,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.560
just where the object is some
distance r from the planet.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.990
Now, we have to be a
little bit careful,

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.159
because in this calculation
our final state must always

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.420
be outside the planet.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.940
And the reasons
for that is subtle,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.400
but the gravitational
force inside the planet

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.600
is no longer minus g
and 1 M2 over r-squared.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.890
So our analysis only applies
for r bigger than r planet.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.930
And if we put these values
for r and infinity in here,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.160
we get U of r minus the
potential at our reference

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.110
point, which will be
0, equals minus GMNP.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.240
And here's the
reason why we choose

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.460
that reference point, 1 over r
arbitrary state is just minus 1

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.300
over r.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.950
But 1 over infinity, if
we use the initial state

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.500
as the reference point,
1 over infinity is 0.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.470
So that's minus 0.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.550
And so what we get is that
the potential function

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.090
is equal to our
reference potential--

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.780
actually, minus GM mass
of the planet over r for r

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.380
bigger than our reference.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.990
And that is the
potential function

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.760
for the gravitational problem.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.409
But now remember, we're choosing
that to be our reference point.

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:56.950
And so the real conclusion
is U of r equals minus GMN

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:02.020
planet over r with U at
infinity equals to 0.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.820
Now, let's just finish
this by saying in words

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.770
precisely what this means.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.030
So if I start my
system at infinity

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.110
and I end my system a distance
r away from the planet,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.010
and I calculate the work done
by the gravitational force

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.470
in going from infinity
to a distance r

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.630
away from the planet-- I
take a minus that sign.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.620
So the negative of the
gravitational work--

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.390
then that's what that
number corresponds to.

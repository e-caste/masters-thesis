00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:26.290
PROFESSOR: Welcome to 5.111, and
today what we're going to

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.390
do is introduce you to the
course and the people teaching

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.370
the course.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.110
And we're also going to let you
know that you were going

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.990
to be part of the great web
exercise that is OCW,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.850
OpenCourseWare.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.460
So, this course is being
videotaped this year, and this

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.810
is the announcement that
I have to make.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.050
So, the videotape is in the
back, and if you want to come

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.115
up front and participate in
the class, you know that

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:59.000
you'll be videotaped -- if you
want to hide your face or

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.550
whatever, you can do that but
please pay attention to the

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.910
lectures anyway.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.720
So, this course will be
available on the OCW site in

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.770
the future, I'm not sure exactly
what that date is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.020
going to be.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.460
So, today we're going to
introduce the chemistry

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.800
topics, which we will cover in
5.111, and give you general

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.090
information, practical
information about the course

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.710
number of points you need, when
the exams are, that kind

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.030
of thing, policies, and
introduce you to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.110
the teaching staff.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.720
I am, again, Professor Cathy
Drennan, and I'm one of the

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.410
lecturers in this course.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.150
So, because this is MIT, we're
going to start to quiz.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.070
OK, not a quiz for points or
anything, don't freak out, but

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:50.950
I do want you to tell me
who these people are.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.140
So, what about this person?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.430
That's me -- this is my college
yearbook photo.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.620
OK, what about this
person over here?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.610
STUDENT: You?

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.850
PROFESSOR: It's not me again.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.310
Not Elizabeth Taylor.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:23.750
It is Lisa Kudrow, known as
Phoebe on "Friends." So, we

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.450
both went to college at
the same time, we

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.690
went to the same college.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.160
Does anybody know what
college that was?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.510
STUDENT: Vassar.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.430
PROFESSOR: Vassar College,
very good.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.540
And we graduated the same year
-- now no one has to say what

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.400
year that was, even if
you know, but we did

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.290
graduate the same year.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.170
All right.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.780
So, given what you know about
us, what do you think Lisa

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.280
went to college to study?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.750
STUDENT: Computer?

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.200
PROFESSOR: Computers?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.650
No.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.420
STUDENT: Theatre?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.880
PROFESSOR: Theatre?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.650
Surprisingly, no.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.710
STUDENT: Nuclear Engineering?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.520
PROFESSOR: Nuclear Engineering
at Vassar, no for

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.120
a variety of reasons.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.940
Any other guesses?

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.040
STUDENT: English?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.720
PROFESSOR: English, no.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.280
Biology --

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.260
I heard it.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.990
Biology.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.670
What do you think I went
to college to study?

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.750
STUDENT: Theatre.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.670
PROFESSOR: Theatre, correct!

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.610
And/or I hadn't made up
my mind exactly --

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.300
biopsychology or drama.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.920
So, biopsychology was what they
called sort of brain and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.530
cognitive sciences
in those days.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.580
So, those were the two things
I was thinking about.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.000
What do you think Lisa ended
up majoring in college?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.490
STUDENT: Biopsychology.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.210
PROFESSOR: Not biopsychology.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.490
STUDENT: Biology.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.180
PROFESSOR: Biology, yes.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.000
What do you think I majored
in college?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.060
This should be a bit easier.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.300
STUDENT: Chemistry.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.660
PROFESSOR: Chemistry, And, of
course, our professions,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.160
actress and chemistry
professor.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.960
So, let me ask what
happened here?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.410
My understanding about Lisa
Kudrow is that she came from a

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.770
Hollywood family.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.650
She went to college and said
here's my opportunity to study

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.390
the thing that I find most
interesting, and that was

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.490
biology, and then she went back
and participated in the

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.450
family business, which was of
course the acting profession.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.410
For me, what happened?

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.220
Well, I have to say, I did not
like chemistry in high school,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.920
so I did not think about going
to college to study chemistry.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.010
So, why did I not like chemistry
in high school?

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.420
I think it was because of
images such as this one.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.730
You spend a lot of time talking
about the transition

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.680
between alchemy and
modern chemistry.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.580
I wasn't very interested in
that kind of thing, and

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.870
there's nothing in these
photographs that really

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.810
appealed to me personally.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.690
I mean, Avogadro --

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.050
I'm fond of his number, and he
is, in fact, an interesting,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.770
if not frightening looking
man -- this just didn't

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.160
connect with me.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.130
But then I got to college and
they said, "Well, if you're

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.950
thinking about anything bio --
biopsychology, biology -- you

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.890
have to take chemistry." And I
said to my advisor, "No, no.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.530
I have taken chemistry in high
school, and I can assure you

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.500
that chemistry has no relevance
whatsoever to the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.210
life sciences." And they said,
"Well, I'm sorry you feel that

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.010
way, it's incorrect, and you
have to take it anyway."

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.120
So, I, like some of you in
this room, took freshman

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.870
chemistry, because we had to,
not because we wanted to.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.540
And I, like hopefully some of
you in this room, discovered

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.620
that chemistry was actually
a lot of fun, and that the

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.030
chemistry I got in college was
pretty much nothing like the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.780
chemistry I had seen
in high school.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.930
So, let me introduce you to
some of the topics we are

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.590
going to be covering in
chemistry this semester.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.470
So, there's more detail on your
syllabus -- a detail of

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.810
what we'll cover every day,
but these are the kind of

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.010
basic things that were covering,
and you don't need

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.060
to write this down, you'll
become familiar with it as the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.280
semester goes on.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.900
We start out with some really
basic principles.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.050
So, up here, atomic theory,
periodic table, bonding,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.560
structures and molecules.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.990
And there will be a little bit
of history in there, but this

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.330
is mostly modern chemistry
and represents the basic

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.960
properties of matter, and it's
basic properties of all

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.860
matter, including living matter,
which was what really

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.070
interested me, that connection
between chemistry and biology.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.050
So, then we go to thermodynamics
and chemical

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.850
equilibrium, and this is
really about chemical

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.051
reactions -- weather a reaction
will go, will it be

00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:06.330
spontaneous, if there an
equilibrium, what direction

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.590
will the reaction
be shifted in.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.350
And then, of course, not just
whether the reaction will

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.830
occur but, how fast it occurs
is really important.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.500
So, that's kinetics -- how fast
a reaction will go, and

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.910
from the perspective of someone
who's a biochemist,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.350
I'm interested in kinetics and
enzyme kinetics, and thinking

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.060
about molecules that catalyze
reactions in the body.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.760
And then, there's acid base
equilibrium, and also

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.030
oxidation reduction reactions,
and what is true is that most

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.100
reactions that occur are either
catalyzed by either

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.880
some kind of acid base catalysis
or involve some kind

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.510
of oxidation reduction reaction,
and so, this sort of

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.100
represents a lot of the basic
way reactions go -- now,

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.830
whether that's a reaction in
your body or a reaction in a

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.790
test tube -- it doesn't matter,
a lot of the same

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.450
principles are involved.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.620
And then, we also cover
transition metals, which is

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.570
something that you often don't
see in high school.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.060
And transition metals, those
all medals in the middle of

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.240
your periodic table, have some
really unique properties,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.840
which are exploited again in
reactions that occur in your

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.270
body, and also are utilized in
industry, for example, so

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.960
we'll talk about some of those
unique properties.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.090
And if we put all of that
together, we get the real

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.650
fundamentals that you need to go
on and study -- any kind of

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.710
curriculum that involves
chemistry.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.440
So, these are all the
fundamentals that are involved

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.630
in chemistry that relate to
physical chemistry, organic

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.670
chemistry, inorganic chemistry,
biological

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.040
chemistry, and are a solid
foundation for studying any

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.510
kind of life science.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.880
So, I congratulate you of being
here in this class, this

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.830
is really good solid foundation
for whatever you go

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.460
on to do, here at MIT.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.900
So, normally at this point, we
do actually start class with a

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.760
little bit of history from
alchemy to modern chemistry,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.040
but I decided to skip
that this year.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.680
If you are interested in that,
it's never required on any

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.140
test, it never has been, but if
you're interested in that

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.070
there is an OCW lecture, which
you can listen to that's an

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.580
excellent lecture by Professor
Sylvia Ceyer on that.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.800
But today instead, I thought I
would give you some examples

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.500
of modern chemistry -- why
people now need to know

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.200
chemistry, what they're doing
with chemistry, what is

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.330
chemistry research here at MIT,
and how does it utilize

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.590
these basic principles,
which we'll be talking

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.420
about in the course.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.870
So, I'll start with
my colleague,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.620
Professor Joanne Stubbe.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.680
She studies molecules, in
particular she studies

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.500
biological molecules.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.310
And, so one of the things she's
very interested in is

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.470
how this anti-cancer
drug, gemcitabine,

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.270
works in the body.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.020
So, it inhibits an enzyme, and
she's interested in knowing

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.620
how that really works.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.690
So, enzymes are made up of amino
acids, you have long

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.980
chains of amino acids that form
together into a protein

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.710
molecules, protein molecules
in your body often act as

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.880
enzymes, catalyzing reactions.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.820
So, she is interested in how
this molecule, gemcitabine,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.380
inhibits an enzyme.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.455
So, to do those studies, she
needs to know a lot of the

00:10:09.455 --> 00:10:10.510
stuff on this list.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.170
Of course, she needs to know
the basic principles, but

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.430
she's also talking about it an
enzyme, so she needs to know

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.490
about enzyme catalysis.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.290
She needs to know this enzyme
works by both acid base

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.220
chemistry, and oxidation
reduction.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.980
It has two irons that are
involved in doing the

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.610
chemistry, so it includes
transition metals.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.450
She thinks about how things
bind, how the natural

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.230
reactants binds, how the
inhibitor binds, and so she

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.482
needs to know what happens to
the chemical equilibrium, she

00:10:37.482 --> 00:10:39.170
needs to know about the
thermodynamics of those

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.280
binding events, and, of course,
everything, all the

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.620
basic principles, are
required here.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.380
So, to do this biochemistry
research, she needs to know

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.330
all of these things, and she
has really made tremendous

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.040
progress in understanding how
gemcitabine works, and it is

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.860
not so toxic, so it's a really
good thing to have in

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.770
chemotherapy.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.860
So, in addition to studying
molecules, chemists often want

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.890
to make molecules, such
as Tim Jamison,

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.940
who's an organic chemist.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.170
So, you will hear, probably,
hopefully, in this

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.470
presidential debate about the
environment and about why

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.290
saving the environment
is important.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.480
And one of the things you
often hear about in this

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.340
discussion is about our oceans
and about rainforests, and

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.740
part of the reason why people
want to protect those areas is

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.740
because you find a
lot of natural

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.480
products in those regions.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.530
So, a natural product is
something that is made by

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.880
nature, and often natural
products, whether it comes

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.960
from a plant or a marine
organism have some really

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.730
good, useful properties.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.330
And so, one particular compound
has anti-tumor

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:45.790
properties.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.760
So, again, along this line
of cancer research.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.850
So, Tim Jamison's lab figured
out how to make this thing.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.300
And often that's really
important, because you can't

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.920
get enough of the organism that
naturally makes it, to be

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.670
able to grind that organism up
and have enough that you can

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.030
actually use as a medicine.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.040
So, you have to make more of
it, because nature doesn't

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.850
make enough.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.290
So, it's very important to
figure out how to do that.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.120
So, in doing that, Tim Jamison's
lab needs a lot of

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.250
these things.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.610
So, he needs a lot of knowledge
of bonding, he wants

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.370
to form bonds in making this.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.700
He needs to know about the
structures of the molecules,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.920
because if the structure is
wrong it's not going to work.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.060
And often, if you want to make a
lot of it, you have to think

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.870
about the thermodynamics of
the system, how fast the

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.380
reactions will go and kinetics,
and then whether

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.885
they'll go, the thermodynamics,
and sometimes

00:12:33.885 --> 00:12:40.130
then you need to adjust the
reactions, maybe use a

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.190
transition metal to
make it go better.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.810
So, these are all the things
that Tim Jamison needs to know

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.110
to do organic chemistry.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.000
So, you'll be learning in this
class a great preparation for

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.280
512, which is organic
chemistry.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.250
In addition to studying
molecules and making

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.590
molecules, some chemists want
to detect molecules, and a

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.250
chemist who likes to detect
molecules is Tim Swager.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.800
So, Tim Swager's lab has
designed sensors that detect

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.590
vapors, and so they will detect
TNT, for example.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.810
And so, he has put this
chemistry to use in this

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.300
robotic arm and they call it
Fido, because often dogs are

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.080
the creatures that have to go
out and detect these things,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.430
and it's not a great job if
you're a dog to be sent out to

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.630
see whether there was an
explosive and discover yes,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.740
there was, a little
bit too late.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.640
So, this is a much nicer way to
detect chemicals with this

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.960
robotic arm, and here's a
picture of it in use in Iraq.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.730
So, in doing this, if you go
down to kind of a basic

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.060
principles that Tim needed
to know about, oxidation

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.520
reduction was really key in
developing this technology, so

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.170
we'll talk about that.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.520
So, my final example is from
Alan Davidson's lab, and Alan

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.070
is an inorganic chemist -- he
loved those transition metals

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.850
and they're unique properties,
and he designed this compound,

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.560
it's called Cardiolite, and it's
used in heart imaging.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.830
So, many people have relatives
they know of that have had to

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.140
have their heart imaged --
heart disease is a major

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.840
problem in the United States,
and there's a good chance that

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.910
they had Cardiolite given
to them to help in

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.270
that imaging process.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.410
So, this again, takes advantage
of those great

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.440
unique properties of transition
metals, which we'll

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.510
talk about in this course.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.270
So, again, all together, this
is the basis for modern

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.550
chemistry, and examples I just
gave you, are some of the

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.430
things that modern chemists are
working on -- some of the

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.570
issues that our country faces
and our world faces, and how

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.550
chemistry is involved in that.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:52.140
So, not only will you have the
fundamental knowledge to go on

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.010
and take more courses in
chemistry, you will also have

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.360
the fundamental knowledge to
go on and do undergraduate

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.120
research here, and here
are some of the 5.111

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.460
undergraduate researchers that
have come through my lab, in

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.260
particular, from this class.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.130
So, it's a really nice
solid foundation.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.910
So, I want to encourage you to
set some of your likes and

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:22.010
dislikes from high school aside
when you come to MIT,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.840
because at MIT you often see
disciplines taught and

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.960
emphasize a very different
fashion than

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.030
what you've seen before.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.380
And you may discover that the
thing you came here to study

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.770
is not the thing that
you really want

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.860
to study after all.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.300
One other thing that I'll say
to you is that I said these

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.730
words at one point, it's true,
I said, when I was in high

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:49.570
school, I said, "I hate
chemistry." And now, I do

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:56.120
chemistry every day and will
for the rest my life.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.490
I love chemistry now.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.480
Be very careful what you say.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.070
Have any of you made
that statement

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.150
about hating a subject?

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.750
Tell me later what it is you're
going to be doing for

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.850
the rest of your life.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.030
So, at MIT things are very
different, and keep an open

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.510
mind, explore new areas -- take
advantage of being at

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.370
this amazing place for science
and technology and you may

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:25.430
surprise yourself in what you
really enjoy learning about.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.555
So, that's a little bit about
the chemistry that we're going

00:16:28.555 --> 00:16:32.660
to cover in this class, and now
I'm going to talk a little

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.460
bit about some of the policies
and procedures.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.210
But first I need to introduce
my co-instructor for this

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.280
class, and let me just put
up her picture, you'll

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.310
see her in a minute.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.040
So, Dr. Beth Vogel Taylor.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.910
So, all chemistry courses are
team taught, so you have a

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.240
different lecturer for the first
half than the second

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.690
half, and Dr. Taylor will be
doing most of the first half

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.960
lectures, and I'll
be doing most of

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.360
the second half lectures.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.870
So, Dr. Taylor will take you
from atomic theory through

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.750
thermodynamics, and I'll start
up with chemical equilibrium,

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.630
talk to about kinetics, acid
base, oxidation reduction and

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.920
transition metals.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.560
So, you will have both of us
as lecturers in this class.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.190
Now, in the past, sometimes
students have found this whole

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.860
thing a little frustrating, that
they just get used to one

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.370
lecture style, and then all of
a sudden there's another

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.340
lecture style, and
that can be true.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.450
I mean sometimes the styles of
the two professors couldn't be

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.740
more different -- think
McCain/Palin, odd couples.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:39.450
Sometimes they're more similar,
and when I first,

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.410
about a year and a half ago,
got to know Dr. Taylor, we

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.830
sort of realized that we had
very similar styles, and we

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.170
got very excited about the
idea that we could teach

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.730
together, so that there would
be much more continuity

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.960
throughout the semester.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.860
And so, Dr. Taylor had been
teaching the first half of the

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.050
material in the Spring, and I
had been teaching the second

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.740
half of the material in the
Fall, and we thought wouldn't

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.300
it be great if we got together
and taught in the Fall.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.920
So, this was actually, for a
variety of reasons, a very

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.520
complicated thing to request
and do, and so we started a

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.880
campaign and campaigned for a
year and a half that we should

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.330
be allowed to do this course
together, and finally just a

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.250
few weeks ago in August -- we
really didn't know up until

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.560
almost when this course
started -- that

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.070
permission was granted.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:29.470
So, I have to say, I am very
excited now to introduce you

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.970
to Dr. Taylor, who I would be
teaching with this semester --

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.540
limited engagement -- who will
tell you about some of the

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.430
course policies.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:47.070
PROFESSOR: Okay, so before we
get to some of these course

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.150
policies, I think I'll tell you
a little bit about my path

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.540
to chemistry as well.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.390
Professor Drennan explained that
not everyone that ends up

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.360
as a chemist started off that
way on their first class

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.240
freshman year, for example,
in chemistry.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.350
And in fact, if you talk to a
lot of chemists, if you talk

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.940
to some of the graduate
students, maybe your TA,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.650
you'll find that that phrase, "I
hate chemistry," has maybe

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.540
been uttered by more than one us
at some point in our lives

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.430
before we realized, and once it
happens you don't go back,

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.650
that actually you love chemistry
and it's hard to

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.330
even remember a point where you
didn't see all of these

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.330
connections that it
provided for you.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.010
To give a little background of
where I was, sitting where

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.330
maybe you are today on the first
day of chemistry, when I

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.790
left high school, I had no
interest in chemistry

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.710
whatsoever.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.740
And I have only one strong
memory from high school

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.050
chemistry, and that memory is
shown right here, and that is

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.260
the common ions.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.690
Did you guys have to learn
the common ions?

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.990
Does anyone have that in their
brain somewhere for ready use?

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.400
I don't, in fact, so it's
actually okay if you don't

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.350
know all your common ions,
if you missed that part.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.790
This is the strongest memory I
have, and I remembered a) that

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.940
I didn't learn them, and that
was really bad because it kept

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.040
coming up, but the other thing
I remember is that I had no

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.780
idea why they were important.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.740
I didn't really understand
what any of

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.270
these molecules were.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.270
I certainly didn't understand
how they even connected really

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.390
to chemical reactions, much less
other disciplines that I

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.480
was interested in.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.560
I couldn't have told you, for
example, if we look at a

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.870
phosphate group, that that's
going to be incredibly

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.340
important in DNA, that it's also
an incredibly important

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.630
group when you're dealing with
proteins and whether you're

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.220
turning the function of
a protein on or off.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.850
So really, I just had no context
for the chemistry.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.210
So, when I started in college,
that wasn't even an option for

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.360
me and I was interested
in a lot of things,

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.320
chemistry not being one.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.490
But one that I was very
interested in was biology, and

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.730
the reason was we did a lot of
cool labs in high school, I

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.630
loved doing the dissections --
it was very interesting to me

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.410
to think about how different
organs worked, how the heart

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.880
could be a pump, how
the lungs worked.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.590
And then when we got to more
of a cellular level, it was

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.210
even more interesting to see
that we could actually

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.610
understand how our body worked
as low of a level as thinking

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.500
about cells.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.690
And so, that was a clear
major for me to pick --

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.820
I actually also was considering
English and ended

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.980
up being a minor in English.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.850
But, I think what most of you,
actually having come to MIT,

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.820
have probably realized is
sometimes it's nice to major

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.260
in a science, because you can't
just pick up a reaction

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.250
and do it in your kitchen on the
weekend, where as you can

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.500
sometimes join a book
group and do that.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.610
So, it's kind of nice to major
in the thing that you're going

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.180
to get to have the opportunity
to do for the

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.370
rest of your life.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.320
So, I actually also
started pre-med.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.050
Is anyone else pre-med here?

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.800
Okay, so a pretty
good showing.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.290
So maybe you can relate to some
of the reasons I wanted

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.590
to be pretty pre-med -- part of
it was the interest in the

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.980
science and the biology.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.800
Also, I wanted to help people
-- it seemed like a really

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.730
clear way that I could have a
career that was challenging

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.030
and involved in science, but
also helping others.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.230
So, it seemed like a good start
for me, pre-med/bio, and

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.560
I signed up for my
bio class --

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.390
I found out, as Professor
Drennan did, that I had to

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.120
take chemistry as well.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.210
I wasn't as upset, I was sort of
a neutral chemistry person

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.570
at this point, but I thought it
was pretty smart to get it

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.270
over with on the first
semester, so

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.700
that's what I did.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:16.050
And my plan was going along fine
until something happened,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.810
and what happened was that
chemistry was just way more

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.530
interesting than
I anticipated.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.250
So, my perfect pre-med/bio
plan was getting a little

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.150
shaken right from the start,
and the reason that it was

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.610
getting taken was because I
would learn this new principal

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.780
in chemistry and because I was
taking bio with the same time,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.430
I could see the connections.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.020
And at one point I realized,
"Oh, my gosh, chemistry is

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.910
just biology, it's just looking
at one level deeper."

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.200
So actually, all of my interest
in biology was

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.680
quickly transferred to saying,
"Wow, now I can think about

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.070
things on the molecular
level." And one of the

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.620
molecules that caught my
attention first, and I can't

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.950
remember if this was freshman
or sophomore year in high

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.700
school, was the first time I
actually took meaning in

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.840
looking at a chemical structure,
and that was with

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.800
the structure of penicillin
here, and I know that all of

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.330
you are familiar with
penicillin, whether or not you

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.300
know the structure or not, but
the most important part of

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.440
this structure is the
four-membered ring here, the

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.400
beta-lactam, and this was the
first time I thought I could

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.370
actually understand how a
molecule worked because I knew

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.130
something about chemistry.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.620
So, for example with penicillin
what it does is it

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.710
inhibits an enzyme that builds
the cell wall in bacteria, the

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.250
bacterial cell wall, and if I
thought about what I'd learned

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.230
in chemistry -- some of you know
this from high school,

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.980
some of you will be very
familiar with this soon, is

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.230
that this carbon here,
for example, is

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.720
bonded to three things.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.640
Does anyone know what angle
those would like to be at?

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.620
120.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.930
They want to get as far away
from each other possible, the

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.640
ideal angle is 120.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.270
But what we have here is a
four-membered ring, so what

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.660
angle does that have
to be, that bond?

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.140
90 degrees.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.750
So, we have a problem here if
we're thinking about keeping

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.120
things at the lowest energy,
so there's a lot of ring

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.410
strain in the system.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.130
And I was incredibly excited
that I could look at that and

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.530
realize it and say "Wow, that's
why it's so reactive,

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.470
that's why it's such a good
medication," because when it

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.590
comes into contact with these
bacterial cell wall building

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:17.420
enzyme, the enzyme can actually
react with this

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.690
four-membered ring and
open up the ring and

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.470
relieve that ring strain.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.560
So, now the angles can open up
all the way to 120 if it wants

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.740
to, and there's no way it's
going to form that ring again,

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.550
right, because it's not going
to back to those 90 degree

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.970
angles, if it can help it.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.940
So now, the enzyme is locked
up with the penicillin

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.380
molecule, no more bacterial cell
wall being built, and the

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.060
penicillin has effectively
killed the bacteria.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.500
So, that, for me, was kind of
the first connection that what

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.770
went, "Woah, wait a second, I
want to be thinking about

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.250
these molecules all the way
down to the level of

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.570
individual atoms." So, at this
point, kept the pre-med, just

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.180
switched the major
to chemistry.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.770
The next problem came
up when I went and

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.750
took organic chemistry.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.730
So, if you're dead set on
staying with bio, maybe, I

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.990
guess you have to take organic,
so this might happen

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.610
to you, just to warn you.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.890
We started looking at all
sorts of other kinds of

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.620
molecules that became very
interesting to me.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.170
I especially love thinking
about vitamins and drugs,

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.050
because I do have
that interest in

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.420
medicine and human health.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.700
These are actually all examples
that we'll talk about

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.200
in freshman chemistry at some
point, as an example of a

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.790
connection between a chemical
principle we learn, and what

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.160
we can know about how
it functions.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.740
But what happened here was I
thought "Oh, my gosh, now I

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.240
could actually, using my
chemical knowledge, think

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.100
about synthesizing these
molecules, or maybe coming up

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.150
with new ways to synthesize
them better or synthesize

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.380
different molecules.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.170
And the real clincher was when
I started doing some

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.960
undergraduate research.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.620
Any potential UROPs out there
-- anyone planning to do a

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.690
research at some point?

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.420
Excellent.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.870
Okay.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.430
So, just to be warned, you might
fall in love with the

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.490
subject you do your UROP in.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.690
This is one of our summer
students from this past

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.270
summer, who is also premed.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.180
She's continuing to be pre-med,
which is fantastic.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.430
That didn't happen to me --
once I got into the lab, I

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.250
didn't want to leave.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.880
So, I thought, "You know what,
I think I'll change the

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.020
medical school plans and now I'm
going to go all the way --

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.030
chemistry major, chemistry grad
school." And the reason I

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.920
was able to do that and keep
with what my original

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.120
intentions were was to have
a career that was the

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.510
fulfilling, in terms of helping
people and being

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.880
engaged in science, is all of
a sudden I realized, as

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.910
chemists, we can think about
better ways to build molecules

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.400
that are important for
making medications.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.450
Another thing we can do is we
can use our chemistry to

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.650
understand biological systems,
so we can help illucinate

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.440
pathways, maybe, that are
implicated in disease.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.740
So, the combination of these
two things had made my

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.340
decision and I ended up coming
here for graduate school,

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.840
actually, and working in
Professor Imperiali's lab

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.850
doing bio-organic chemistry,
which means that I synthesize

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.710
molecules, which I loved,
and used them to

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.620
study biological systems.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.060
So, really I'm pretty happy with
what I've gotten to do,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.620
and I just want to say we're not
trying to convert all of

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.050
them you pre-med people,
by any means.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.220
My roommate for many years was
going to medical school as I

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.330
was going to graduate school,
and we found we had so many

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.920
interesting conversations about
chemistry -- her from

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.300
the context of practicing and
using medications and talking

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.590
about how they worked on a
molecular level, and me

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.590
talking about my research.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.110
JON GRUBER: All right, so today
we are going to continue

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.730
with our discussion of
producer theory.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.310
And today we're going to move
beyond the unrealistic case of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.460
perfect competition to the
somewhat more realistic case

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.570
of monopoly.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.310
Now, we've been discussing
perfect competition thus far

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.590
as a form of market
organization, and that makes

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.010
sense in some context like fast
food and other things.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.910
But in most contexts, we think
perfect composition is not the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.480
way the world works.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.080
There's some limits
on competition.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.180
And we think that markets--

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.240
many markets, many of the goods
we consume have only a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.450
few firms. Operating systems or
cars or a lot of things we

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.645
consume, typically have only
a few firms in them.

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:14.260
So the most realistic model of
markets would be one which

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.180
accounts for the fact that
there's less than an infinite

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.210
number of firms, there's
only a few firms.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.530
That turns out also to
be the hardest model.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.090
So what we do is we sort
of iterate there.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.590
We started with one extreme,
which is a competitive market

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890
where there's an infinite number
of firms, that allows

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.750
us to draw some interesting
conclusions.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.540
Now we're going to reverse field
and talk about the other

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.962
extreme, monopoly, which
is only one firm.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.080
We'll talk about monopoly
markets with only one firm.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.020
Then we'll talk about oligopoly,
that middle case,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.950
which is multiple firms.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.230
So let's talk about monopoly,
a market where

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.480
there's only one firm.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.300
The key thing to remember for
monopolies is they're no

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.080
longer price takers, they're
now price makers.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.680
Competitive firms are
price takers.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.730
They were given a price
by the market and

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.795
they reacted to that.

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:04.790
And as we saw in the long run,
that price settled at the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.440
minimum of average cost. So
basically, they were given the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.320
price which dictated production
efficiency.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.130
They reacted to that in how
much they produced.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.970
You got a flat long
run supply curve.

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:19.480
However, in a monopoly market,
we don't meet the conditions

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.660
for perfect competition.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.120
In particular, one condition was
that consumers had perfect

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.850
substitutes between your
good and other

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.010
goods they could buy.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.530
That's not true in a
monopoly market.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.850
So if we think about that era,
sort of maybe, I don't know, I

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.340
don't have my computer history
isn't as good.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.420
Maybe 10 years ago when Macs
were sort of at the nadir of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.580
their popularity.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.670
And really you had to be a
pretty high tech guy to be

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.390
using Linux and things
like that.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.150
That Windows had virtually a
monopoly on operating systems.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.700
Not really, but virtually.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.460
Certainly unless you were a
high tech guy who could do

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.880
Linux and things like that,
pretty much if you wanted an

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.090
operating system,
you got Windows.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.440
Windows pretty much
had a monopoly.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.420
And that's may be as close as
we've come in the modern

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.680
economy to thinking about
an example of monopoly.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.540
In that case, Bill Gates
had to decide--

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.210
wasn't given a price, he had to
decide how much to charge

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.450
for Windows.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.320
And that decision determined
in turn how

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.200
much he would produce.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.990
And that's exactly what we'll
talk about today, is how does

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.930
a monopolist decide both what
to charge and how much to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.990
produce of their good?

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.820
So to do that, we're going
to turn to a new concept.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.340
Well, not a new concept, but a
different way of looking at

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.450
something we've talked
about before,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.700
which is marginal revenue.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.640
If you remember, the profit
maximizing condition that we

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.470
derived when we started our
competition lectures was that

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.430
marginal revenue equals marginal
cost. That was our

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.630
profit maximizing condition,
was that marginal revenue

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.670
equals marginal cost.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.640
Now we're going go to--

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.050
in perfect competition.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.340
And the way we thought about
this marginal revenue equals

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.290
marginal cost, remember the
logic was this notion of

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.090
climbing this profit hill.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.780
You want to produce any unit.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.290
Think of yourself as climbing
this profit hill.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.709
You're deciding, do I produce
the next unit?

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.920
And I produce the next unit as
long as the money I make off

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.630
that unit exceeds what it cost
to produce that unit.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.990
So I climb that profit hill.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.010
If marginal revenue is greater
than marginal cost,

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.280
I keep going up.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.060
At the peak, marginal revenue
will equal marginal cost. Once

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.420
I go beyond that peak, marginal
revenue will fall

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.030
down below marginal cost and
I'll stop producing.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.090
So the notion is I climb this
hill, which in the peak is

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.430
dictated by marginal revenue
equals marginal cost.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.600
Now for a competitive firm,
we said marginal

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.630
revenue was just price.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.670
So in perfect competition, the
rule was set price equal to

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.090
marginal cost. But that
was a particular

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.440
case of marginal revenue.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.460
So for example, to see that,
let's look at Figure 14-1.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.475
This is another way.

00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:04.125
Probably next year when I teach
this, I'll put this in

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.660
the lecture on competition.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.750
Just a way to think about how
marginal revenue is priced.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.160
Remember, a perfectly
competitive firm faces a

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.720
perfectly elastic
demand curve.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.160
They face a perfectly elastic
demand curve.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:24.360
So they have to think about what
the implications are of

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.850
the marginal unit they sell.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.720
Well if they sell little q
units, their revenue's a.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.390
If they sell one more unit,
their revenue is b.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.950
And the marginal revenue is the
height of that rectangle B

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.650
times the base.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.740
The base is 1 because it
goes from q plus 1.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.390
The height is p.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.240
So the marginal revenue
is price.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.800
This is a pretty
basic diagram.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.620
So marginal revenue
is price for the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.430
perfectly competitive firm.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.270
Now let's look at the
monopoly case.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.320
The difference with a
monopolist, as you see in

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.900
Figure 14-2, is they no longer
face a perfectly elastic

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.080
demand curve.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.840
They now face a downward-sloping
demand curve.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.870
Why is that?

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.150
Well remember, this is the
graph for little q.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.690
The reason the graph for little
q was perfectly elastic

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.430
with a perfectly competitive
case was not that we said the

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.080
demand for the entire good
was perfectly elastic.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.070
It's just that the residual
demand facing anyway one firm

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.050
was perfectly elastic.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.870
Well now, a monopolist is the
only firm in the market.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.500
So their residual demand
equals total demand.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.756
Their residual demand
equals total demand.

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:37.030
So as long as total demand is
downward-sloping, as we

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.080
typically think it is,
then they'll face a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.120
downward-sloping demand curve.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.650
So unlike a perfectly
competitive firm, which faces

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.080
a perfectly elastic residual
demand curve, a monopoly firm

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.900
will face a downward-sloping
market demand curve.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.632
They face the entire market
demand curve.

00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:53.910
So this is demand curve.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.330
Now we're talking about big Q's
not little q's anymore.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.110
Or we could say little
q equals big Q.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.430
There's only one firm.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.290
So little q's and the big
Q's are the same.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.370
So now the firm reacts not to
its residual firm demand

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.330
curve, which is flat, but
the downward-sloping

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.050
market demand curve.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.170
Now, we're going to make
one assumption

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.990
here that's very important.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.080
We'll come back to this at
the end of the lecture.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.540
We're going to assume that the
monopolist can only charge one

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.310
price for their good
to all consumers.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.500
So most of this lecture we're
going to assume a non-price

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.775
discriminating monopolist. We're
going to say that Bill

00:07:26.775 --> 00:07:28.980
Gates can't look at you and say,
look, you look like you

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.700
really want Windows.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.460
I'm going to charge
you more than her.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.180
He can't do that.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.910
He has one price.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.450
He sells it to the stores
at one price.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.830
So it's a non-price
discriminating monopolist

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.520
we're going to work with for the
first 2/3 of this lecture.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.910
That monopolist has
to set one price.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.310
Now, for that monopolist, for
Bill Gates with Windows circa

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.900
10 years ago, let's think about
his decision to produce

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.260
another unit.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.660
He's originally producing at
Q, big Q at a price p1.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.010
He's originally producing
a big Q at a price p1.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.090
If he wants to sell one more
unit, he's going to have to

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.400
lower the price.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.350
Because he now faces a
downward-sloping demand curve.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.640
So if he wants to sell one more
unit, he's going to have

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.070
to lower the price to P2.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.240
I have a big cockatoo at home.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.180
This is his feather.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.580
So he's going to have to
lower the price to P2.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.750
What's that going to do?

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.120
Well, on the one hand, what
that's going to do is that's

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.270
going to mean on that next unit
he's going to make p2.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.850
So he's going to get the
rectangle B. On the other

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.400
hand, on all the units he was
selling at p1, he now gets a

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.000
lower price p2.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.080
So he loses the rectangle C.
So the marginal revenue for

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.490
this monopolist, the marginal
revenue is equal to the

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:05.360
rectangle B minus the rectangle
C. The marginal

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.020
revenue is rectangle B
minus rectangle C.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.640
Or alternatively, you could say
that if we just write that

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:18.590
out, write out what that
is, that's p2 minus p1

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.670
minus p2 times Q1.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.550
Or rewriting, we could rewrite
this then as marginal revenue

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:42.260
equals p plus delta p delta q,
how much the price changes

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.640
when you change the quantity,
times the

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.010
original quantity Q1.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.780
Or one more time, for those of
you who prefer calculus.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:59.950
If revenue equals p times q, and
q is a function of p, then

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.770
marginal revenue,
differentiating that, is p

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:13.300
plus dp dq times Q. So marginal
revenue is the price

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.440
plus the change in price from
selling another unit times the

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.690
initial quantity.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.860
Once again, the graphics
are in this graph.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.550
The math is here.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.213
We just differentiate the
revenue equation.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.210
This term is positive.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.450
Price is always greater
than 0.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.150
But this term is negative
because demand

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.370
curves slope down.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.920
So there's now two effects.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.750
There's a positive effect, which
is if I sell another

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.700
unit, I make money on
that other unit.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.200
There's a negative effect, which
is to sell that other

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.790
unit, I have to lower the
price because I face

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.170
downward-sloping demand.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.970
So there's two effects a
monopolist as he thinks about

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.790
wanting to sell another unit.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.700
There's the money from that
unit, but the lower

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.260
willingness to pay for
all previous units.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.790
And that's what makes a
monopolist a little more

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.210
interesting.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.040
We basically think of the
monopolist as basically having

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.520
to work down the demand curve.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.230
With a perfectly competitive
firm, they don't have to work

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.730
down the demand curve.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.120
The demand's flat to them.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.040
They can sell as much as they
want at that price because

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.350
they don't affect the price.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.970
They want to sell 10 of that
price or a million at that

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.090
price, it doesn't matter.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.280
Their demand curve's flat.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.050
Not true for the monopolist.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.890
If the monopolist wants to sell
more, he has to face the

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.780
wrath of the market.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.832
And the wrath of the market is
such that if he wants to sell

00:11:34.832 --> 00:11:36.370
more, he's going to have to
lower the price to do so.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.940
Remember, once again assuming
he has to charge the same

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.520
price to everyone.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.355
Assuming he's going to charge
the same price to everyone, if

00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:45.695
he wants to sell more, he's
going to have to lower the

00:11:45.695 --> 00:11:46.945
price to do so.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.220
There's different ways
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.890
intuition on this.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.100
I like to call this the
poisoning effect.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.620
That's how I like to
think about it.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.470
That basically, if I want to
sell another unit, I'm going

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.820
to poison the money I made
on all previous units.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.020
Because if I want to sell
another unit, I have

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.220
to lower the price.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.760
That's going to take away from
the money I was making on my

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.380
previous units.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.990
So it's sort of a poisoning
effect is how I like

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.630
to think about it.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.260
But you can have your own
intuition for it.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.470
And basicallly, this poisoning
effect did not exist for the

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.610
perfectly competitive firm
because they couldn't affect

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.000
the price with their action.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.030
They could sell however many
units they wanted at that flat

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.130
price and their actions did
not affect that price.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.270
The poisoning effect only
exists with monopolists

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.880
because to sell that next
unit, they have

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.130
to lower the price.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.890
Now, basically what that means
is to find equilibrium for a

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.640
monopolist, it's going to be
a little bit trickier.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.380
And so let's go to Figure
14-3 and slowly walk

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.120
through Figure 14-3.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.230
And we'll start walking
through.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.770
What the monopolist is going
to want to do is draw a

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.810
marginal revenue curve.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.160
With the perfectly competitive
firm, marginal revenue curve

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.590
was just a price, it
was given to them.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.420
There was no marginal
revenue curve.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.280
For a monopolist, there is
a marginal revenue curve.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.155
So here I have a demand curve.

00:13:05.155 --> 00:13:07.160
The demand curve I've drawn
here in this example.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:15.410
The demand curve I've drawn here
is q equals 24 minus p.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.310
That's a typical demand curve,
downward-sloping.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.250
As the price goes up, people
want less of it.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.610
And now we're in
market demands.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.520
Because remember, little
q equals pq.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.160
There's only one firm
in the market.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.870
Now, here's the trick with
monopoly: mathematics.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.150
The first thing you're going to
want to do is you're going

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.780
to want to invert this.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.330
You're going to want say, OK,
that takes q, but what takes

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.490
the price a monopolist
is going to charge?

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.560
The price a monopolist is going
to charge is therefore

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.850
going to be 24 minus q.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.500
That's going to be the
price that the

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.750
monopolist is going to charge.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:58.370
Therefore, revenues, pq,
is 24q minus q squared.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.880
So we inverted the
demand equation.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.160
We do this because we want to
write down a revenue equation.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.050
So that's the trick.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.970
This is the mathematical trick
here is to invert this, so

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.870
then you can write down
a revenue equation.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.780
We then differentiate this
revenue equation to get that

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.430
marginal revenues equals
24 minus 2q.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.080
That's marginal revenues.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.940
The next unit you sell, you
make 24 minus 2 times the

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.190
amount you're now selling.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:32.890
And that's the marginal revenue
curve graphed here.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.990
Now, basically what you see is
in this case the marginal

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.450
revenue curve starts at the same
point as the demand curve

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.840
on the y-axis and
lies everywhere

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.150
below the demand curve.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.060
Now that first fact, that it
starts at the same intercept,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.870
is not always true.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.940
That is true because in this
case we assumed a linear

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.510
demand curve.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.180
With a nonlinear demand curve,
marginal revenue curves can

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.550
start at different points
on the y-axis.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.810
The second point about the
marginal revenue curve always

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.700
being below the demand curve is
always true regardless of

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.590
the function.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.840
The marginal revenue is
always below demand.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.380
Marginal revenue is always
below demand.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.350
So that marginal revenue curve
will always be below the

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.660
demand curve because of
this poisoning effect.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.030
Now, what I want to highlight
here is this means there's a

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.410
very important relationship
between marginal revenue and

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.170
the elasticity of demand.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.860
So let's take our marginal
revenue equation and put it

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:41.530
back in change terms. p plus
delta p over delta q times Q.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.250
And let's multiply
and divide by p.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:52.620
So marginal revenue you can
rewrite as p plus p times

00:15:52.620 --> 00:16:01.240
delta p over delta
q times Q over p.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.350
So I just took this second term,
multiplied and divided

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.540
by p, the second term.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.230
I just multiplied and
divided by p.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.060
The reason I did that is because
that means you can

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.400
rewrite this.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.245
This now starts to look like
an elasticity expression.

00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:17.820
Remember the expression
for elasticity.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.420
This looks like the inverse of
an elasticity expression.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.690
Remember what elasticity of
demand was, delta q delta p

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.400
times p over Q. So that's
the inverse to

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.950
the elasticity demand.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.620
So we can rewrite this as
marginal revenue equals p

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:35.720
times 1 plus 1 over the
elasticity of demand.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.800
Marginal revenue equals p
times 1 plus 1 over the

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.870
elasticity of demand.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.520
Think about what this
means for a second.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.070
What is the marginal
revenue in a

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.460
perfectly competitive firm?

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.430
Well, as a perfectly competitive
firm, what's the

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.670
elasticity of demand facing a
perfectly competitive firm?

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.110
Infinity.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.210
Perfectly elastic.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.061
So marginal revenue by
L'Hopital's rule equals p.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.849
So for a perfectly competitive
firm where elasticity is

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:11.470
infinity, marginal
revenue equals p.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:16.900
Now instead, if we took a firm
where the elasticity of demand

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.250
was minus 1, the electricity
demand was minus 1, the

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.950
marginal revenue would be 0.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:25.589
Why is that?

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.550
What that says is, if you're
a monopolist facing an

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.820
elasticity of demand of minus
1, then you make no money by

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.420
selling the next unit.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.020
Because these two effects
exactly cancel.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.790
It turns out with elasticity of
demand of negative 1, these

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.110
two effects exactly cancel.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.010
Exactly what you make by selling
one more unit is

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.170
offset by how much you have to
lower the price on all your

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.090
previous units.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.430
So an elasticity of demand
of minus 1, marginal

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.650
revenue equals 0.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.820
And as you can see as the
elasticity of demand gets

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.820
below minus 1, as it approaches
0 from below.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.500
As the elasticity of demand
approaches 0 from below--

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.130
OK, I should have said perfect
competition, I'm sorry, was

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.500
negative infinity,
not infinity.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.990
Negative infinity.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:09.300
As the elasticity of demand
approaches 0 from below, then

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.100
you're going to see that
the marginal revenue--

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.830
as you approach 0 from below,
marginal revenue is going to

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.800
become negative.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.270
So for example, if the
elasticity of demand equals

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.090
minus 0.5, then the marginal
revenue equals minus p.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.700
So if this is minus 0.5, then
this becomes minus 2.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.240
So marginal revenue
equals minus p.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.260
You lose money.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.270
So as that elasticity of demand
approaches 0, you're

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.740
going to have a negative
marginal revenue from selling

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.310
the next unit.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.280
And why is that?

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.370
With a very inelastic good,
you have to push the price

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.940
down so much to sell the next
unit that you lose money.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.850
Think about a very elastic
versus very inelastic good.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.580
With a very elastically demanded
good, to sell another

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.710
unit you don't have to change
the price much.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.580
Because the demand curve's
very flat.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.440
So there's not much of
a poisoning effect.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.490
dp dq is small, or
dq dp is big.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.810
OK, this is the inverse.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:14.560
So dq dp is big with elasticity,
so dp dq is small.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.290
With a very inelastically
demanded good, to sell one

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.680
more unit you're going to lower
the price a ton, which

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.570
is going to poison the revenues
you get from selling

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.820
that extra unit.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:35.840
So that's why marginal revenue
will be higher, or will be a

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.330
larger fraction of p
as this elasticity

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.580
becomes more negative.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.902
Yeah.

00:19:45.902 --> 00:19:46.388
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:19:46.388 --> 00:19:50.762
elastic that means
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:19:50.762 --> 00:19:52.220
irrespective of the price.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.622
So couldn't you just charge a
higher price and get marginal

00:19:55.622 --> 00:19:57.580
revenue [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.910
JON GRUBER: No, because
here's the thing.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.460
You should have already been
charging that high price.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.030
The point this is the margin.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.920
So you go into a market
for insulin.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.552
You say, look, these guys are
going to die without it.

00:20:07.552 --> 00:20:11.120
I'm going to charge
$500,000 a shot.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.090
But now the question we're
asking about marginal revenue.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.600
And at $500,000, you sell to
everyone who can afford it and

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.100
everyone else dies.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.270
Now you want to ask, what's the
marginal revenue as you're

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.720
trying to sell that 500,000
and first unit?

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.560
Well to sell that, since it's
inelastically demanded, if

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.690
that person could afford
anything like $500,000, they

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.320
would have bought it already.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:33.960
They can't.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.450
They can only afford $400,000.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.280
We have to lower the
price to $400,000.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.720
You're going to sell one more
unit at $400,000 but lose

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.090
$500,000 on all those other
units you were going to sell

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.710
at $500,000.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.870
The point is it's about the
margin not the level.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.010
Yes, monopolists make a huge
profit when it's inelastic.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.160
I'll talk about that
in a minute.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.630
But that next unit they're
going to lose money on.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.190
So that's actually a good point
to segue to now, let's

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.880
talk about with this in place,
let's talk about how

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.310
monopolists maximize profits.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.970
Let's talk about monopoly
profit maximization.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:16.960
Let's go to Figure 14-4.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.630
Profit Maximization
for a Monopolist.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.510
Now, this is a lot more
confusing than perfectly

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.310
competitive firms, so let's
follow along here.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.300
This is a case the cost
function here

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.760
is 12 plus q squared.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.200
So I'm doing the cost
function, which

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.440
is 12 plus q squared.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.710
That's the cost function.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.990
And the demand function,
as before, is Q

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.120
equals 24 minus p.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.370
So that's what's graphed here.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.840
Now, recall the rule that profit
is maximized where

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.390
marginal revenue equals marginal
cost. Well, we know

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.540
marginal revenue.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.100
We know marginal revenue--

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.570
we derived that above--

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.660
is 24 minus 2Q.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:07.110
What's marginal cost with
this expression?

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.030
Well, marginal cost,
differentiation of the cost

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.280
equation, which is 2Q.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.220
So the optimization term for a
monopolist is going to where

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.300
marginal revenue, which is 24
minus 2Q, equals marginal

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.560
cost, which is 2Q.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.190
Or Q equals 6.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:27.460
That's going to be the optimal
production level for the

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.600
monopolist.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:36.120
So we can see that graphically
that's where the marginal cost

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.400
curve hits the marginal
revenue curve.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.490
If you go downward from that
point, you get that the sales

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.730
are 6 units.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.200
So marginal revenue equals
marginal cost at 6.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.740
You should be able to see that
graphically, it's just where

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.060
the curves intersect.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.235
Mathematically I just
did it here.

00:22:51.235 --> 00:22:52.840
It's actually pretty
straightforward.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.270
Here's the hard part.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.180
What's the price?

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.640
We might say, well, gee,
marginal cost and marginal

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.590
revenue intersect at 6.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:00.660
I'm going to draw the
dashed line over.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.530
That means the price
is going to be 12.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.150
Why can that not be the price?

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.320
Why is that wrong?

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.070
What would that violate
if the price was 12?

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.880
If you tried to sell
6 at a price of 12?

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.270
Yeah.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.550
JON GRUBER: It's not on
the the demand curve.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:19.460
The monopolist still has to
respect the demand curve.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.370
So monopolists in setting
their quantity, gets the

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.580
intersection of marginal revenue
and marginal cost. But

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.740
then in setting the price, they
still have to read off

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.340
the demand curve.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.440
They can't change
consumer tastes.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.740
So they charge a price of 18.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.010
That's where you sell
a quantity of 6.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.270
So monopolists it's a little
bit trickier in a perfectly

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.990
competitive firm.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.380
You set marginal revenue equal
marginal cost to derive Q. But

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.330
then to get p, you've got to go
back and plug that into the

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.540
demand curve.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.250
So with a Q of 6, I
have my Q of 6.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.410
Well, what's the p?

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.900
Well, to get that p, I've
got to go back and

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.690
plug this in here.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:05.310
At Q equals 6, p is
24 minus q, or 18.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.210
So I've got to respect
the demand curve.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.320
The monopolist has to respect
the demand curve.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.480
The monopolist picks both price
and quantity, but he has

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.150
to pick them such that you get
a point on the demand curve.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.890
And the way we solve it, is
the monopolist chooses a

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.230
quantity to set marginal revenue
equal to marginal

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.980
cost, and then chooses the price
that's consistent with

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.230
demand for that quantity.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.630
Questions about that?

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.270
Now one last thing.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.950
In the short run, we still have
another condition for

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.740
profit maximization, which
is the shutdown rule.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.340
Remember the shutdown rule
we talked about perfectly

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.530
competitive firms in the short
run, which is even if profits

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.390
are negative, you might
not shut down.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.770
You only shut down if price is
less than average variable

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.450
cost. So there's still
the shutdown rule.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.590
So you only shutd own if price
is less than average variable

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.920
cost.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.840
Now in this case, what's
the monopolist profits?

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.430
Well, the monopolist made
a profit of 60.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.660
How do we see that?

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:17.530
Well that's graphically the box,
the rectangle, that's the

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.320
difference between the average
cost curve and

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.420
the price they get.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.130
So they're charging 18.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.980
Now once again, marginal
revenue is gone.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.870
Think about marginal revenue
like an imaginary concept.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.610
Marginal revenue isn't something
that actually exists

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:30.390
in the market.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.920
Marginal revenue is just
something the monopolist draws

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.420
to pick what they're
going to do.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.400
But then it disappears.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.920
What the monopolist cares
about then is price.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:44.640
They're charging 18.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.580
Their average cost for
that unit is only 8.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.000
So they're making a profit of
10 per unit on 6 units.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.660
So they're making
a profit of 60.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.660
And what you can see, what you
should be able to demonstrate

00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.040
to yourself is, if a monopolist
sold 5 units.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.325
I'm sorry, selling 6 units.

00:26:01.325 --> 00:26:04.650
If the monopoly sold that
seventh unit, what you'll be

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.640
able to see is they would lose
money on the seventh unit.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.890
Because yes, if they sold that
seventh unit, what happened if

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:11.670
they sold the seventh unit?

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.470
Well then their price would have
to be what if they wanted

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.130
to sell a seventh unit?

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.520
The price would have to be 17.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.080
The price would have to be 17.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.970
So to sell a seventh unit,
they'd have to

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:30.760
have a price of 17.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.040
So basically at a price of
17, the price was 17.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.650
Then what would happen?

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.570
Well, they'd sell one
more unit at 17.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.710
That'd be good.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.470
But they'd lose $1
on the previous 6

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.760
units, which is bad.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.000
So how much revenues
would they make?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.550
What would be their
marginal revenue?

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.170
Well, the marginal revenue would
be they make 17 minus

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.020
the 6 poisoning effect.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.730
So marginal revenue equals 11.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.240
What's their marginal cost?

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.640
Their marginal cost is 2Q.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.090
Marginal cost is 14.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.060
So they lose money.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.290
So you should be able
to walk through

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.770
this exercise yourself.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:17.340
You might say, gee, the marginal
cost of that next

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.140
unit is only 14.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.800
They sell it for 17.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.620
Gosh, they should do it.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.840
What you're missing is by
selling it for 17, they've

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.160
lost the dollar extra
they make on each of

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.610
the previous 6 units.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:28.880
And that poisoning
effect makes it

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.630
unprofitable to do this.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.700
And that's why the monopolists
stop short of what would be

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.790
the perfectly competitive
outcome.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.580
What would the perfectly
competitive firm do?

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.390
The perfectly competitive
firm would set marginal

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.520
cost equal to demand.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.370
And they would end up producing
where marginal cost

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.190
equals demand.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.270
So demand here is 24 minus p.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.040
Marginal cost is 2Q.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.530
So they would end up producing
where marginal cost equals

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.080
demand at a much higher
level charging a

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.860
slightly lower price.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.230
So what you see is the
monopolist ends up selling

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.490
fewer units at a higher price.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.296
Questions about that?

00:28:09.296 --> 00:28:10.230
Yeah.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.755
AUDIENCE: How does this work
for Microsoft where their

00:28:11.755 --> 00:28:15.100
marginal costs are very
low or nonexistent?

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.640
JON GRUBER: Well, then what
would happen, if their

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.360
marginal costs were very
low or nonexistent.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.990
Think of that marginal
cost curve then as

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:22.140
being much, much flatter.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.860
It would intersect demand at
a much higher quantity.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.110
Or it'd intersect marginal
revenue at a

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.820
somewhat higher quantity.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.060
Not that much higher.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.540
So if marginal cost is very
low, they produce more but

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.770
they make even more profits.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.120
So it's a good question
actually, a good comparative

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.860
statics exercise.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.520
You bring that marginal
cost curve down,

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.530
what's going to happen?

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.260
Quantity is going to go up, but
not as quickly as profits

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.390
are going to go up.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.230
That's why Bill Gates is the
richest man in the world.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.280
That's what happens.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.540
You get really rich.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.650
So basically, when you're a
monopoly, low marginal cost

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.900
you get really rich.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.920
But that's a great thought
exercise to understand how

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.640
this monopoly example works.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.920
Other questions about that?

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.770
So this is a good opportunity
to introduce an important

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:09.550
concept with monopolists, the
concept of market power.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.040
What monopolists have, what Bill
Gates has that my local

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.830
McDonald's does not
is market power.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:23.720
Or what he had, has less of
now, is market power.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:29.010
Market power is the ability to
charge price above marginal

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.210
cost. The summary statistic of
how much power a monopolist

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.690
has is how much they can drive
their price above marginal

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:37.190
cost.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.870
When Bill Gates marginal cost
dwindles to 0, his market

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.240
power gets bigger.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.720
Price above marginal cost.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.010
Now to think about this,
remember the condition for

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.540
profit maximization.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.130
It was that marginal revenue,
which we wrote as p times 1

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:59.340
plus 1 over epsilon equals
marginal cost. So we can

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:05.430
rewrite this as marginal cost
over price equals 1 plus 1

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.680
over epsilon.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.810
Now let's define the markup.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:17.060
Let's define the markup as price
minus marginal cost, how

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.900
much money you make
on the next unit.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.080
You sell for p, you get marginal
cost. It's money you

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.010
make the next unit.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.700
If you define the markup, p
minus MC over p, that's the

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.370
percentage markup.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.810
It's how much you make
on the next unit,

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.340
the percentage markup.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:34.660
Then you can see that
that markup equals

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.580
minus 1 over epsilon.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.000
So the markup for a monopoly
firm equals

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
minus 1 over epsilon.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.840
This comes to the question
before about the insulin

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.430
example's sort of confusing.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.180
Here we see your intuition
on insulin.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.310
The lower its elasticity, the
more the monopolists can mark

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.170
up their price.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.740
So your intuition
is shown here.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.350
Yes, the monopolist
will charge an

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.550
incredible price for insulin.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.820
They'll still lose a lot of
money if they try to raise

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.960
that price, if they try
to sell one more unit.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.700
But the first initial price
they'll set will

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.170
be incredibly high.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.850
Basically, what is the
constraint on Bill Gates?

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.040
What is the constraint
on Bill Gates?

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.640
It's Steve Jobs.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.660
It's substitutes.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.430
The only constraint on a
monopolist is the extent to

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.320
which people can sub--

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.980
actually, let me go back, that's
not a good example.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.410
Let's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.560
Bill Gates circa 10 years ago.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.940
The constraint on Bill Gates
circa 10 years ago was a

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.650
mainframe or some other form
of doing a set of--

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.920
or 20 years ago it
was a typewriter.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.790
It was basically the fact that
there was some other way to do

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.370
what Bill Gates was
letting you do.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.680
If there was no other way to do
what Bill Gates was letting

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.460
you do, he would charge
an infinite price.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.080
Clearly if there's
some other way--

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.200
and also, elasticity of course,
comes from substitutes

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.240
or one substitute is just
not to compute.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.580
So if Bill Gates tried to charge
infinity for Windows,

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.500
people just wouldn't
own computers.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.103
So the reason Bill Gates can't
charge infinity, and the

00:32:02.103 --> 00:32:04.520
reason he can't charge infinity
for insulin is that

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.720
there's some elasticity
of demand.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.180
People at some point will
just stop buying.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.980
Either because they'll choose to
use a typewriter instead or

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.060
they just won't compute.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.140
They'll write by hand
or something.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.770
So basically at some point,
there is some elasticity

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.550
because there's a market
demand curve.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.870
And basically what's going to
determine how much market

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.940
power the monopolist has is
going to be how elastic it is.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.200
Basically, how close the
substitutes are for that good.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.880
If there's close substitutes,
the monopolist won't be able

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.510
to charge a very high markup.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:33.900
If there's not close substitutes
as of Window circa

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.020
10 years ago, the monopolist can
charge a very high markup

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.910
and become very, very rich.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:41.690
Yeah.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.990
AUDIENCE: But if there are
substitutes for the market,

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.750
then it's not a monopoly
anymore.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.190
JON GRUBER: No, no, this
is the key thing.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:51.080
Substitutes for that producer.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.140
So basically, that's why
I said Steve Jobs

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:53.980
is not a good example.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.670
Because then it's not
a monopoly anymore.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.390
But the typewriter is
a good example.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.760
That's a different good, that's
a different market,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.740
different good that
substitutes.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.650
So my point is any given good,
insulin being an exception,

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.220
but any good there's always
something you can do instead.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.410
Insulin there is something
you can do

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.340
instead, you can be sick.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.710
There's always something
you can do instead.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.200
We don't have only one
thing in life.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.170
So the elasticity of demand is
never perfectly inelastic.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.830
It seems silly 10 years ago, but
20 years ago it actually

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.700
was a legitimate decision
whether to have a PC or not.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.770
A lot of people just didn't
have computers.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.300
You could always just
not have one.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.720
That gives you inelasticity
of demand.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.465
So basically, it's important
to recognize when we talk

00:33:34.465 --> 00:33:36.740
about substitutes, I'm talking
about here not substitutes

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.790
within the market, but
substitutable activities,

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.970
other things you could
do with your money.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.360
And the more other things are
you could do with your money,

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.360
the less markup that Bill Gates
can make on his Windows

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.110
operating system.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.590
Questions about that?

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:58.570
OK, now we can ask, OK, gee,
John, this is all good and

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.186
interesting, but why did you
just waste the last lecture

00:34:00.186 --> 00:34:01.576
and a half teaching us about
welfare if you're just going

00:34:01.576 --> 00:34:03.150
to go back to producer theory?

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.050
Well, the reason is because
now we come to what the

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.720
welfare effects of monopoly.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.480
And ask, what effects do
monopoly have on society?

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.170
And in fact, we can show you
that there's a deadweight loss

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.350
on society imposed
by monopoly.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.659
To see that, let's go
to Figure 14-5.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.900
And here we can show the
deadweight loss of monopoly.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.830
And here's the same example
we were using.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:29.489
Demand is Q equals 24 minus p.

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:31.139
Marginal cost is 2Q.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.340
The cost function is
12 plus Q squared.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.480
So marginal cost is 2Q.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.880
As we saw before, the monopolist
chose to sell 6

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.460
units at a price of 18.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.820
6 units at a price of 18.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:54.420
The perfectly competitive firm
sets demand, which is 24 minus

00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:00.540
Q, sets price, I'm sorry, equal
to marginal cost. Well,

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.230
price comes to demand
curve as 24 minus Q.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.830
Marginal cost is 2Q.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.310
So the perfectly competitive
firm sets Q equal to 8.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.400
The perfectly competitive
firm sets q equal to 8.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.850
They choose to sell 8 units
at a price of 16.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.680
So you get the competitive
quantity Q sub c is eight and

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.380
the competitive price
piece p sub c is 16.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.830
That's where graphically demand
equals marginal cost.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.960
Or price equals marginal cost.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.320
The monopoly firm sells 6
units at a price of 18.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.350
So what is the welfare
effects of monopoly?

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.600
What we see is we know
that the competitive

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.770
firm maximizes welfare.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.490
We learned that last time.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.650
We know that the best you can
do is to sell 8 units at a

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.180
price of 16.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.780
What happens when you sell
6 units at a price of 18?

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:58.120
What happens is consumer surplus
falls from A plus B

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:07.770
plus C. So with perfect
competition, consumer surplus

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:14.980
is A plus B plus C. With a
monopoly, consumer surplus

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:21.330
falls to the area A. So you lose
B plus C with monopoly.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.730
Producer surplus under perfect
competition was the area D

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:32.510
plus E. Now under a monopolist,
the producer

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:47.060
surplus is equal to D plus E
plus B. The monopolist , in

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.680
this case, gained the rectangle
B, but gave up the

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.760
rectangle E. The consumer lost
the rectangle B, that was a

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.180
transfer to the monopolist. So
there was a transfer of the

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.880
rectangle B from the consumer to
the monopolist. But C plus

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.260
E have disappeared.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.060
They're a deadweight loss.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.250
They're deadweight loss because
in the perfectly

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:10.840
competitive equilibrium these
are trades that would have

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.570
made both parties better off.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.930
That is, these are trades which
socially should happen.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.070
They are trades where the value
to the consumer exceeds

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.640
the cost of producing
that unit.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.240
Those seventh and eighth
units are units--

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.940
so take the seventh unit.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.700
What's that worth to someone?

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.380
Well, it's worth 17.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.320
We can read that off
the demand curve.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.260
That's a willingness
to pay curve.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.950
People are willing to pay 17
for that seventh unit.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.610
What's it cost to produce?

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.270
It cost 14.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:44.210
So you have a unit which people
want more than it costs

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.180
to produce, yet it's
not getting sold.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.890
That's deadweight loss.

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.190
So monopolists induce deadweight
loss because units

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.690
that people value above
their marginal

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:54.940
cost doesn't get sold.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.110
Units people value above their
marginal cost don't get sold.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.180
And that's because this
poisoning effect.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.060
Because while it's socially
optimal to sell those units,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.690
while society is better off,
it's privately sub-optimal.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.740
From the monopolist's
perspective, it's bad to sell

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.620
that unit because of this
poisoning effect.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.800
So basically, the monopolist
is underselling,

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.730
underproducing.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:24.320
In general, monopolists will
underproduce goods.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.560
They'll sell too few goods
because to sell the right

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.810
amount would not be
profit maximizing.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.260
Because remember, what's the
profits for the perfectly

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.246
competitive firm?

00:38:34.246 --> 00:38:36.060
Profits for the perfectly
competitive firm?

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.820
Well, we know the profits of
perfectly competitive firm.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.500
We know cost if they
sell 8 units.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.500
We know the cost function
is, the cost here

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.700
is 12 plus Q squared.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:52.650
So if they sell 8 units, their
costs are 12 plus 64,

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:55.800
which equals 76.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.620
Their revenues if they sell 8
units are 8 units times the

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.730
price of 16.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:11.280
8 units time the price
of 16, which is 128.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.560
So what are their profits?

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.770
Their profits are 52.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.940
So their profits are 52.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.380
The monopolist's
profits are 60.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.330
So the monopolist is
better off than the

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.620
competitive firm would be.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.330
The competitive firm would
only make profits of 52.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:28.060
Obviously the short run.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.670
The long run they
make no profits.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.220
But in the short run they
make profits of 52.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.180
The monopolist makes
profits of 60.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.440
So the monopolist is better off
than the competitive firm.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.220
The difference of course, is to
do so they cause a social

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.020
deadweight loss.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.950
Questions about that?

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.930
Yeah.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:49.870
AUDIENCE: Is that what the
OPEC is doing right now?

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.340
JON GRUBER: I'm going to
come to that actually.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:51.780
Time out on that.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.060
Because OPEC is more
of an oligopoly.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.286
And we'll come to that when
we talk about that

00:39:54.286 --> 00:39:56.380
in a couple of lectures.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.610
But I want to talk about one
more thing before we stop,

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:00.880
which is I want to talk about
the key assumption we made

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.130
here, which was the monopolist
could only charge

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.210
one price to everyone.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.080
In fact, we know that's
not true.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.880
In fact, we know in the world,
there's a large amount of what

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.730
we call price discrimination.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.510
There's a large amount of
price discrimination.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.185
We know that for many goods,
different prices get charged

00:40:20.185 --> 00:40:21.390
to different consumers.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.210
If you ever tried to book an
airline ticket the last

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:26.370
minute, you know exactly
what I mean.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.570
Basically, different prices
in many, many contexts get

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.020
charged different consumers.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:34.440
Everything from discounts for
senior citizens, to higher

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.110
price last-minute flights, to

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.770
specials, two for one specials.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.770
People who buy two get
a special price on

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.410
the third, et cetera.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.320
There's all sorts of price
discrimination just out there

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:45.870
in the world.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.480
And in fact, there's very
few goods that are

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.760
sold at just one price.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.330
McDonald's hamburger
is typically

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.340
sold at just one price.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:56.820
They don't say like, fat people
got to pay more for

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.240
McDonald's hamburgers
or something.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.190
But many, many goods we buy in
the real world are sold at

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.920
many prices.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.580
And that's an example of a
price-discriminating firm.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.810
And here's the crazy part.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.990
Here's the crazy part.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.530
It turns out that a
price-discriminating

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:17.220
monopolist maximizes
social welfare.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.690
A price-discriminating
monopolist is as good as a

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:20.786
competitive outcome.

00:41:20.786 --> 00:41:22.470
How can that be?

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:27.210
Let's go to Figure 14-6.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.280
Here's the price-discriminating

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.380
monopolist. Now, the
price-discriminating

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.550
monopolist, what does he do?

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.900
This is a perfectly
price-discriminating

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.300
monopolist, someone who can
charge a different price to

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.180
every single consumer.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.440
Well, if you were a
price-discriminating

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.410
monopolist, perfectly
price-discriminating

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:46.390
monopolist and you could charge
a different price to

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:49.310
every consumer, what do you
charge the first consumer?

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:53.360
24.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.350
What do you charge the
second consumer?

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:57.390
23.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.700
Third consumer, 22.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.050
You literally charge them their
willingness to pay.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.660
If you're perfectly
price-discriminating, then

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.960
what you do is literally charge
every consumer exactly

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.210
their willingness to pay.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.235
You say look, I know your
willingness to pay function.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:21.560
Your willingness pay function
is p is 24 minus Q. That's

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.120
your willingness to
pay function.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.260
So I'm going to literally
charge you that.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.650
I know that about you, it's
stamped on your head.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.850
So I'm going to say, ah, you're
willing to pay 24 for

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.690
the first unit, 23 for the
second, et cetera.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:39.990
In that case, what will the
perfectly price-discriminating

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.810
monopolist do?

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:44.140
Will they stop at 6 units?

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.380
No, they won't.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.980
Because for that guy, there's
no poisoning effect.

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.970
There's no reason to
stop at 6 units.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.910
That seventh unit, as we just
did the math, there's money to

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.490
be made on that seventh unit.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:57.220
Because that seventh unit is
worth 17, but it only costs 14

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.460
to produce.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.310
So the perfectly discriminating
monopolist will

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:02.460
sell it at 17.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.720
Likewise the eighth unit, people
willing to pay 16 and

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.930
it cost 16 to produce.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:08.780
So they'll sell it or not.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.260
They're basically indifferent.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.720
So we typically say
they'll sell it.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.155
The point is, the perfectly
price-discriminating

00:43:15.155 --> 00:43:19.380
monopolist will work all the way
down the demand curve to

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.160
the competitive outcome.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.810
They will move to the
competitive market outcome

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.560
because there's no
poisoning effect.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.560
There's no reason not to.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.020
No reason not to sell
as many units.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.410
No reason not to climb the same
hill the competitive firm

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:39.930
climbs and sell any unit where
the price exceeds the marginal

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.950
cost.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.110
Well, what's interesting is
let's ask what's happened to

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:47.730
social welfare with this
perfectly price-discriminating

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:53.260
monopolist. Well, consumer
surplus is what?

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.670
What's consumer surplus
with the perfectly

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:55.890
price-discriminating
monopolist?

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:56.540
Somebody raised their hand.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.150
Yeah.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.050
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:58.380
JON GRUBER: Zero.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.066
Why is it zero?

00:44:00.066 --> 00:44:01.726
AUDIENCE: Because they're
charged exactly

00:44:01.726 --> 00:44:02.560
how the value is.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.070
JON GRUBER: Exactly.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.490
Consumer surplus is defined
as willingness

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:06.790
to pay minus price.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:08.980
But your price is set equal to
your willingness to pay.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.470
So by definition, consumer
surplus is 0.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:12.505
With a perfectly
price-discriminating

00:44:12.505 --> 00:44:14.210
monopolist, there's no
consumer surplus.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.060
But what's producer surplus?

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.360
Same person, what's
producer surplus?

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.500
AUDIENCE: Everything else.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.340
JON GRUBER: Everything else.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:25.870
A plus B plus C plus D plus E.
There's no deadweight loss.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:30.850
You get exactly the same social
welfare as you got with

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.810
perfect competition.

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.760
It's just divided differently.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.600
With perfect competition,
consumers got A plus B plus C.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.840
Producers got D plus E.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.140
With a perfectly
price-discriminating

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.220
monopolist, the monopolist
gets everything.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.890
But the total shaded
area is the same.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.970
So really fascinating because
here we have the ultimate

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:53.570
screw on consumers.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.570
We think about competition
as being the

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:56.940
best thing for consumers.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.380
Lots of firms selling goods at a
competitive market where you

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.420
can shop and do what's
best for you.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.870
It's not surprising intuitively
that that's the

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.120
best thing for society.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:09.700
What's very surprising
intuitively is having a

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.160
producer who can screw every
single consumer out of every

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.680
penny they value something is
equally good for society.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.750
And why is that?

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.390
That's because we've made a
particular assumption, which

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:23.840
is social welfare is the sum
of producer surplus and

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.430
consumer surplus.

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:26.570
The linear sum.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.240
Since it's is sum, we don't care
in that function who gets

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.130
the dollars.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:32.540
We just care about the total
amount of dollars, the total

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.740
size of the pie.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.900
We don't care who gets what
slice of the pie, we just care

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.310
about the total size
of the pie.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.280
And the total size of the pie
is the same with a perfectly

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.680
price-discriminating
monopolist and

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.030
a competitive firm.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.550
What this highlights is that
that's a pretty stupid way to

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:49.400
think about social welfare.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.210
Clearly, we don't feel the same
way about a market where

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.430
people get everything
they want and a

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.910
market where people--

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.080
all they're willing to pay is
sucked out of them by a greedy

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.160
monopolist. Clearly we don't.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.550
And that's why we're going to
need to think more richly

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.280
about equity and think more
richly about the division of

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.170
resources in society.

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:09.790
Because it turns out that you
can have equally good outcomes

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:13.020
from an efficiency perspective
that are very, very different

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.400
from an equity perspective.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.590
And this is the first example
we'll see of that.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:21.960
What we'll do when we get
towards the end of the course

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.933
lectures, like 23, 24, lectures
like that, we're

00:46:24.933 --> 00:46:26.230
going to start talking
about equity.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.570
And what are different rules we
can think of for dividing

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.200
this pie that might give
us a different answer?

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.790
OK, questions about that?

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.040
All right.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.130
OK, so anyway, we'll
stop here then.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.770
Let's remember that perfectly
price-discriminating

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.440
monopolist is obviously also
a silly concept just like a

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.140
perfectly competitive firm's
a silly concept.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.090
What we're going to do next
time is come back and talk

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.670
about price discrimination in
reality and what firms do to

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.830
try to approximate this
golden outcome.

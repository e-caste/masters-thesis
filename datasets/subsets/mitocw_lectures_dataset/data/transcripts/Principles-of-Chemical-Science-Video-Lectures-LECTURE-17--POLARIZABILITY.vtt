00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
-- sometimes called the van der
Waal's interactions.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And we saw that we could make a
molecule between two inert gas

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
atoms, like argon two or
xenon two,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
by virtue of these dispersion
interactions,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where the instantaneous charge
in one atom or molecule produces

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
a dipole.
That dipole then induces a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
dipole in the neighboring
molecule, and the result is a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
stabilization,
an attraction.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And we saw, last time,
we had a generic form for the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
interaction potential for the
dispersion interactions.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This Lennard-Jones interaction
potential.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We talked about that in detail.
And one of the parameters in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that Lennard-Jones potential was
this quantity epsilon,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which actually was the well
depth.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And I just wanted to talk a few
moments, here,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
about what determines what the
well depth is,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
what the strength of that
interaction is.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And the bottom line is,
what determines that is the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
polarizability of the atoms or
the molecules that are

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
interacting.
And we give the symbol alpha to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the polarizability.
And what that is,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is a measure of the ease with
which a charge distribution can

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
be distorted.
That is the polarizability of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the molecule.
That is a term you will hear in

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
future courses quite a lot.
And, in general,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
the polarizability goes up with
the number of electrons present.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
As you go from --
And you can see on the side

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
slides, here.
As you go from helium to argon

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to xenon, and let me fix my
pointer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
As we go from helium to argon
to xenon, this polarizability

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
goes up because the number of
electrons are going up.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If the number of electrons are
going up, that means we have

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
electrons in outer shells,
they are farther away from the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
nucleus.
They are more easily distorted.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
As this polarizability goes up,
helium, argon and xenon,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that well depth for the
Lennard-Jones potential is going

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
up, 0.085, 0.996 and 1.8.
And here, on this diagram,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I actually show you what the
shape of the Lennard-Jones

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
potential is.
Sometimes when I draw it on the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
board, it is not so accurate.
But you can see this

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Lennard-Jones potentially
actually has this repulsive wall

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that goes up really very
steeply.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And, likewise,
on the next slide,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
you see some interactions for
at least one molecule here,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
helium, nitrogen,
and argon.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
You can also have these
dispersion interactions,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and you do have them,
between molecules.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So, the polarizability is going
up.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Helium, nitrogen,
argon, the well depth is going

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
up.
Again, these are the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Lennard-Jones potentials for
those inert gases and for the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
interactions between two
nitrogen atoms,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
dispersion interaction.
All atoms and molecules have

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
these dispersion interactions.
It is just that often times the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
dispersion interactions can be
so weak compared to some other

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
interactions,
which we are going to look at

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
today, that we don't even think
about them.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But they are actually there.
But what I want to do now is to

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
talk about what happens as we
lower the temperature even

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
further.
In other words,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
last time we were talking about
the deviation from the inert gas

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
law as we lowered the
temperature.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And what we said is that it is
these dispersion interactions

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that are the microscopic origin
for the deviation from the inert

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
gas law, which is a macroscopic
law, as you lower the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
temperature.
But we also know that if you

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
lower the temperature enough,
that the gas condenses,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
the gas liquefies.
And it is these dispersion

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
interactions that are also
responsible for the condensation

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
of these gases.
But now, let's talk about,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
a little bit more deeply,
what exactly is going on as we

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
lower the temperature close to
the liquification point.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Let me draw a Lennard-Jones
potential again.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And now I am going to do it for
two nitrogen molecules.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Here is nitrogen,
here is nitrogen,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
two separated nitrogens as a
function of r,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the distance between the two
nuclei.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This is our zero of
interaction.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And, as I said from that slide,
this bond association energy

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
measured from the bottom of the
well is 0.79 kilojoules per

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
mole, the bottom of the well,
where the molecules actually

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
can never be.
But that is the well depth.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Now, let's think about this.
At 300 degrees Kelvin,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
what is the average energy of
the molecules?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Well, the average energy is
three-halves RT,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
as we saw.
And, if I substitute in this

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
temperature, I am going to get
something on the order of 3.7

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
kilojoules per mole,
if this has two significant

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
figures.
3.7 kilojoules per mole.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Well, let me do the following.
Let me draw 3.7 kilojoules per

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
mole, here, on this
Lennard-Jones potential.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
When I do that,
and I am going to start here at

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the bottom of the well,
and I draw 3.7 kilojoules per

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
mole, well, that is somewhere
way up here, compared to the

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
interaction energy.
At 300 degrees Kelvin,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the bottom line is that those
two nitrogen molecules have

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
enough kinetic energy to totally
ignore this interaction energy.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
They are way up here.
If they have 3.7 kilojoules per

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
mole of energy,
they are not going to stick

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
together.
They are not going to condense.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
They are actually really going
to ignore this small interaction

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
energy.
They are just going to fly

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
apart.
And they do.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
You have a gas.
However, let's lower the

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
temperature now.
Say we lower the temperature to

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
100 degrees Kelvin.
When we do that and calculate

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the average energy at
degrees Kelvin,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that is on the order of 1.2 or
so kilojoules per mole average

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
energy.
1.2 kilojoules per mole,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
we are somewhere here.
And now, the relative energies

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
between these nitrogen molecules
are much lower.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And it is beginning to be
comparable to this well depth.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And those nitrogen molecules
now are deviating from the inert

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
gas law.
They are kind of hanging around

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
each other.
They don't hit the walls as

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
often, the walls of the vessel
that they are in,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
because they are having an
attractive interaction with

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
their neighboring nitrogen
molecule.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And so, we are deviating,
here, from the inert gas law.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
The pressure is not as large if
you are doing it under constant

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
volume conditions.
And then, say we lower the

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
temperature to 77 degrees
Kelvin, which is actually the

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
boiling point of nitrogen to
make liquid nitrogen.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Well, at 77 degrees Kelvin,
the kinetic energy is 0.96

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
kilojoules per mole.
And now, in this case,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
we are fairly comparable to the
well depth here at 0.96

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
kilojoules per mole.
What happens is the gas

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
condenses.
The interaction energy between

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
those two nitrogen molecules is
on the order of the kinetic

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
energy.
And then these molecules stick

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
together, the gas condenses,
and you have a liquid.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That is the origin,
here, of this temperature

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
dependence and the relevance to
the microscopic interactions

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
between the molecules.
You can understand that.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And then vice versa,
if you start to raise the

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
temperature, the molecules start
to fly apart.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
They ignore this interaction.
Their energy is greater than

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that attractive interaction.
And so what you can see in the

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
macroscopic boiling points is
the vestiges of this microscopic

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
interaction energy.
I think I am going to put the

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
center screen down.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:52.000
If you look at --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
-- helium, neon,
argon, krypton,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and xenon.
What we said is that this

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
polarizability increases as we
increase the number of

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
electrons.
We see that the well depth

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
increases.
Therefore, the boiling point

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
increases as we go down the
inert gas column.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
You can see how that
macroscopic boiling point is a

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
reflection of what is happening
on the microscopic scale between

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
two individual molecules.
You can also see that in this

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
plot or in this chart.
Here we have molecules,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
hydrogen, nitrogen,
and oxygen.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
The polarizability alpha is
also increasing as we go down.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Correspondingly,
the well depth is increasing.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Correspondingly,
that boiling point is also

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
getting larger and larger.
That macroscopic quantity,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
then, reflects the change in
the individual interaction

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
energies between the molecules,
the microscopic quantity.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
But it also turns out that the
shape of the molecules are

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
important.
For example,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
let's take this molecule,
C five H twelve.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
There are several ways I can
draw a skeletal structure for C

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
five H twelve.
One way is to make it pentane,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
making a linear molecule.
And another way is to make this

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
two, two dimethylpropane,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
carbon in the center,
some methyl groups around that

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
center carbon.
It turns out that the boiling

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
point of pentane is 309 degrees
Kelvin.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
The boiling point of
2,2-dimethylpropane is

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
degrees Kelvin.
These are two molecules that

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
have the same number of atoms,
i.e., the same number of

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
electrons, should have the same
polarizability.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
However, one has a higher
boiling point than the other.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And the reason for this is
because of the different shapes

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
of these molecules.
In the case of propane,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
if we have an instantaneous
fluctuation in our charge

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
distribution,
it is going to be essentially

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
along a line.
That instantaneous fluctuation

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
is essentially kind of rod-like
because of the skeletal nature

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
of the pentane.
So, one end is a little

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
positive, one end is a little
negative, the other way around.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
That is going to induce a
dipole in a neighboring pentane

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
molecule.
And then they are going to

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
align, positive-negative here,
positive-negative there.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
But then, in the case of
dimethylpropane,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
you are also going to have this
charge fluctuation.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
But in the case of propane,
here, this is a more

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
spherical-looking molecule.
And so, the charge fluctuation

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
is not going to be so rod-like.
But, nevertheless,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
this charge fluctuation,
induced dipole here,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
is going to induce another
dipole in a neighboring

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
molecule, and you are going to
have an attractive interaction.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But, in the case of the
2,2-dimethylpropane,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
this is a much more spherical
distribution than this.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
In this case,
these two dipoles are not as

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
close together as they are in
the case of pentane,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
meaning that the interaction
energy, here,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
between the dimethylpropane,
is going to be less than it is

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
in the case of the pentane.
And, again, that is reflected

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
in the macroscopic boiling
points.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
The boiling point of pentane is
larger than that of

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
dimethylpropane because that
microscopic interaction energy

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
is larger for propane because
the induced dipoles can get

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
closer together.
So, the shape is also important

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
in determining these boiling
points, these energies of

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
interactions.
That is going to take care of

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
our discussion of molecules or
discussion of the induced dipole

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
- induced dipole interaction
energy where we are talking

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
about molecules that do not have
permanent dipole moments.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
But now we are going to turn to
molecules with permanent dipole

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
moments, such as HCl.
And, of course,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
in these molecules,
the dispersion interaction is

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
also taking place.
It is just that that is going

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
to be weak compared to the
interaction between two

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
permanent dipoles.
Here we have one HCl molecule,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
permanent dipole.
It is going to then,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
in a collection of HCl
molecules, attract another HCl

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
molecule.
And that HCl molecule is going

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
to align in the opposite
direction.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
The alignment of those two
dipoles is going to lower the

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
energy.
That is the attractive

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
interaction.
And then you might say,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
you get this attractive
interaction, but you also have

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
now this repulsive interaction
between the two chlorines and

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
the two hydrogens.
Doesn't this all cancel out?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And the answer is no.
And that is because of this.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
The positive end of one
molecule and the negative end of

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
the other, this distance and
this distance on the opposite

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
end are actually closer than the
positive charges.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
The yellow distance,
here, is smaller than the

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
distance between the two
hydrogens, is smaller than the

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
distance between the two
chlorines.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And so, it is this attractive
interaction that wins out,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
actually.
When you put those two dipoles

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
together, the repulsion actually
is there, but it is the

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
attractive interaction that wins
out, and the whole system is

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
stabilized because the distance
between the unlike charges is

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
smaller than the distance
between the like charges.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Now, it also turns out that we
have a functional form for the

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
dipole-dipole attractive
interaction.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And that attractive interaction
turns out to be a minus one over

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
r cubed dependence.
And this is exact.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
You can actually derive this.
You can show that this is the

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
interaction between two
permanent dipoles is one over r

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
cubed.
The quantity on the top,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
mu, that is not a reduced mass,
this time.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
If we go back to when we
started talking about dipole

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
moments, this is the dipole
moment of the molecule.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
We have to use our symbols for
multiple quantities.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So, that is the dipole moment.
We are talking about

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
dipole-dipole attractive
interactions.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And that attractive interaction
looks like this,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
minus one over r cubed.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Now, you might say,
where is the repulsive part of

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
this interaction?
In the case of the

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Lennard-Jones potential,
remember we had two parts,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
the attractive part and the
repulsive part.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
The repulsive part was one over
r to the 12.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
The attractive part was one
over r to the 6.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
But it turns out that for
dipole-dipole interaction,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
we do not have a general form
for the repulsive part,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
unlike induced dipole - induced
dipole.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
So, the best we can do,
in general, is to tell you that

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
the dipole-dipole attractive
interaction is one over r cubed.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
But I want to compare this one
over r cubed to the attractive

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
interaction due to the induced
dipole - induced dipole

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
interaction.
You see that the dipole-dipole

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
interaction is what we call
longer range than the induced

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
dipole - induced dipole.
What I mean by that is that the

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
value of r here,
the distance between the two

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
dipoles, can be larger.
In the case of a longer range

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
interaction, it can be larger
and still have some non-zero

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
quantity for the interaction
potential.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
For example,
if you are out here,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
if this value of r,
you can just see with the

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
shorter range interaction,
one over r to the 6,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
that the attractive
interaction is only the

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
difference between the pink
curve and the black curve,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
which is zero.
Whereas, with a longer range

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
interaction, we have more
attractive interaction.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
This is more negative.
That energy difference is

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
larger.
That is what we mean by a

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
longer range interaction.
And I want to just compare,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
in this diagram here,
the strength of the dispersion

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
interaction to that of the
permanent dipole-dipole

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
interaction by comparing the
interaction between two argon

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
atoms to those between two HCl
molecules.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Argon only has the dispersive
interaction between it because

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
it does not have a dipole
moment.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
And you can see that this well
depth, here, is one kilojoule

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
per mole, roughly speaking.
But in the case of HCl,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
that well depth,
here, is three kilojoules per

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
mole because that has a
permanent dipole.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And, in both cases,
HCl and argon-argon,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
we are talking about roughly
the same number of electrons,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
not exactly,
but roughly,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
meaning the polarizability is
roughly the same.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
The dispersion interaction
energy is roughly the same for

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
HCl as it is for argon,
but the difference is that HCl

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
has that permanent dipole
moment.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Therefore, the deeper well
depth, therefore,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
in HCl, the higher boiling
point, 239 degrees Kelvin as

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
opposed to 87 Kelvin for argon.
What is on this slide is just

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
an example of how that
dipole-dipole interaction energy

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000
varies with the dipole moment.
The larger the dipole,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
of course, the larger the
interaction energy.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Here, I show you several
molecules that all have,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
again, roughly the same number
of atoms.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
They have the same mass,
they roughly have the same

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
number of electrons,
so they roughly have the same

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
polarizability.
The induced dipole - induced

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
dipole is the same,
but what is changing here,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
as I go down,
is the dipole moment.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
For propane,
dipole moment really small,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
0.1 debye.
Dimethyl ethe,r 1.3.

00:24:32.371 --> 00:00:02.700
Acetaldehyde,

00:24:34.387 --> 00:00:03.900
Acetonitrile,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Dipole moment increases.
The boiling point increases

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
because that attractive
interaction is increasing.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
It scales roughly as the dipole
moment squared.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.000
The dipole-dipole interaction
is stronger.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Now, I just want to briefly
then remind you about one other

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
attractive interaction that we
have talked about before.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
And that is between two ions.
There we are talking about the

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Coulomb interaction energy,
where the dependence is minus

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
one over r.
That is the longest range

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
interaction.
Again, you can see this way out

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
here.
If I choose this value of r,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
the one over six interaction
term would give me a

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
very small value for the
attractive interaction,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
--
-- because it is one over r to

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
the six.
You take a large number for r

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
and raise it to the 6 power and
put in the denominator.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
You are going to have a small
value for U of r.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
The one over r to the three
gives you some

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
interaction energy,
but one over r gives you a lot

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
of attractive interaction.
It is the longest range.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
And you can also see here,
in a moment,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
that it is going to be the
strongest interaction.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
What I am just doing is
comparing several molecules or

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
atoms.
Here is argon 2 which has only

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
the dispersive interaction.
Here is the plot,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
well depth minus one kilojoule.
Then, there is the HCl

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
interaction energy that has the
dispersion interaction in it,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
but also the dipole-dipole
permanent interaction.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
It is minus three kilojoules.
And then we are talking about

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
chlorine two.
This is a covalent bond.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
This is no longer a
Lennard-Jones potential energy,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
but this well depth,
here, is minus 200 kilojoules

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
per mole.
And then, finally,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
this ionic interaction between
potassium and chlorine,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
look at how strong that is,
minus 450 kilojoules per mole.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
So, these are the relative
strengths here of these

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
interaction energies.
That is all I that want to say

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
about these kinds of
intermolecular interactions,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
where we are dealing with some
kind of dipole.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
But before we move on,
I want to talk about one other

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
kind of intermolecular
interaction potential.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And that is something called
hydrogen bonding.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
All right.
A final intermolecular

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
interaction, hydrogen bonding.
Hydrogen bonding,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
here, occurs between a hydrogen
atom that is attached to an

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
electronegative atom and another
molecule in the gas or in the

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
solution.
The first requirement is that

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000
you have hydrogen attached to a
very electronegative atom.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Hydrogen bonding occurs for
hydrogens attached to oxygen,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
nitrogen, and chlorine.
Those are all electronegative

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
atoms.
Water is a good example.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000
In the case of water-- You have
hydrogen bonded to this oxygen.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
This oxygen is really very
electronegative.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
What that oxygen does is it
pulls those electrons away from

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
the hydrogen.
This hydrogen is kind of

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
partially unshielded.
It is partially deshielded.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
And then, there is a lot of
electron density here on this

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
oxygen.
Well, because that hydrogen is

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
partially deshielded and because
it is really small,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
this hydrogen actually will
kind of see the oxygen atoms on

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000
a neighboring water molecule.
And since this is kind of

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
partially negative,
this hydrogen will interact

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
with one of the lone pairs on
this oxygen and will form a

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
bond.
This is a little bit partially

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
positive, this is a little bit
partially negative,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
and the result,
here, is a bond between the

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
hydrogen and the oxygen.
And that bond is on the order

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
of 20 to 60 kilojoules per mole.
This bond is not a covalent

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
bond.
A covalent bond is

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
kilojoules per mole.
This is 10% of it,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
but it is still a very
important quantity or a very

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
important phenomenon,
this hydrogen bonding.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
The hydrogen bonding is
certainly responsible for the

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
peculiar properties of water,
as you will learn more about in

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
5.60, but it is also responsible
for the unique shape,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
oftentimes, of biological
molecules.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
The helix in DNA owes its
structure to hydrogen bonding.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
The hydrogen bonding is what
makes trees stand upright.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
The long cellulose molecules in
trees are actually bonded

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
together by hydrogen bonding.
Nylon owes its strength to

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
hydrogen bonding.
And hydrogen bonding is also

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000
responsible for whether or not
you have a bad hair day.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:47.000
As an example of that,
I want you to look at the slide

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
up there on the walls.
What you see is a protein

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000
molecule.
This is the structure of hair.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
The molecules that make up the
strands of your hair look like

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
this.
It is a polymer.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Well, it is a polypeptide.
This unit right in here,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
carbon-oxygen bound to
carbon-hydrogen bound to

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
nitrogen-hydrogen is the
peptide.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
It is repeated.
You see the next unit over?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
CO-CH-NH.
CO-CH-NH.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
That keeps repeating.
That is the repeat unit.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
And, of course,
this carbon-hydrogen right

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
there, you can see it has a line
there, indicating that it is

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
bonded to something.
And it is bonded to something.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
If that carbon-hydrogen is
bound to another hydrogen,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
then you have a polypeptide
which has been made from an

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
amino acid that you might know
of as glycine.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
If that carbon is bound to a CH
three group,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
then that peptide was made from
an amino acid that you might

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
know of as alanine.
And if it is bound to a CH two

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
S H group,
well, that was an amino acid

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
known as cysteine.
But what I want you to notice

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000
here is that these hydrogens on
the nitrogen --

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
That nitrogen is an electron
negative atom.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And that hydrogen,
if your hair is wet,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
it is actually hydrogen bonded
to a water molecule.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Here is that hydrogen bond.
And then in the next strand

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
over, this oxygen is hydrogen
bonded to a water molecule when

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
your hair is wet.
And the bottom line is that

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
when your hair is wet,
you have the strands of your

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
hair that kind of slip by each
other.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
There is no registry of one
strand to another,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
because each strand has this
coating, here,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
of water molecules due to
hydrogen bonding.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Suppose you take your hair and
put it in a very contorted

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
configuration like this.
And then you drive off the

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
water molecules,
you dry your hair.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
What happens is that these
water molecules then leave,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
the hydrogen bonds are broken.
This is not such a strong bond,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
20 to 60 kilojoules per mole,
those hydrogen bonds are

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
broken.
And then this hydrogen on this

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
nitrogen looks around and sees
the oxygen with its lone pairs

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
on this strand,
and so you form a hydrogen bond

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
between this strand and this
strand.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
And so now the strands of your
hair are in registry with each

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
other.
They are actually stronger.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And they do tell you not to
brush your hair when it is wet,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
because it isn't so strong.
Well, it is not so strong

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
because these water molecules
are insulating each one of these

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
strands.
And when it is dry these two

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
strands are bond to each other.
They are in registry with each

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
other.
And so, if you do this right,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
and you then let go of the
contorted configuration,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
which I am having trouble
doing, those strands are in

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.000
registry with each other now.
And you have a good hair day.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
So, that is the importance of
hydrogen bonding.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
I curled my hair just for this
demo, a little asymmetric,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
here.
[LAUGHTER] But now,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
if you are as fortunate,
or unfortunate,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:33.000
depending on your preference,
to have naturally curly hair,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000
then what you have are a lot of
sulfur-sulfur bonds.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:49.000
You have a lot of cysteine
peptide groups.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:58.000
What happens there is this.
On the CH groups,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
you have CH two sulfur H.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
And on the next strand over you
have S, CH two,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
and CH bonded to nitrogen,
bonded to a CO.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
And you actually have a
covalent bond between these two

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
sulfurs, here.
This is a strong bond.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
The strands of your polymers in
your hair are in registry all of

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
the time.
And if you want to make your

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
natural curly hair straight you
have to do drastic things like

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
use drastic chemicals to break
this sulfur-sulfur bond.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
You can do it,
but it is not easy.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Likewise, if you have naturally
straight hair and you want to

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
curl it and make it
semi-permanently curly,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
then you have to build in the
sulfur-sulfur bonds.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And you have to do,
again, some rather drastic

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000
chemistry to make that happen.
Hydrogen bonding is important,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000
especially if you go to do
anything in biologically-

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
related sciences,
you will see that.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Now, I am going to change
topics here.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
I am going to change topics,
and we are going to talk a

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
little bit about thermodynamics
in preparation to get up to

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000
chemical equilibrium so that
Professor Cummins can come in

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
next Wednesday and start talking
about acid-base equilibrium.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
He is great.
You will love him.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
We are going to review some
thermodynamics today.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
I am going to go kind of
quickly because some of this I

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
think you know,
but I want to make sure

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
everybody is on the same page.
First of all,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
bond energies.
We talked about bond energies

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
as delta E sub D.
And we measured it from the

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
bottom of the well.
And I told you a few days ago,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
I lied to you.
The measured energies are

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
really from v equals zero,
and they are.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
But what I am going to do is
change my language.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Instead of talking about
energies, I am going to talk

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
about enthalpies.
I am going to talk about delta

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Hs rather than delta Es.
The reason I am going to do

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
this is because it is easier for
us to measure a bond enthalpy

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
than a bond energy.
And that has to do with the

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
fact that we usually make
measurements in bulk under

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
constant pressure conditions.
And that is the quantity that

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
comes out.
The relationship between delta

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
H and delta E is this.
Delta H is equal to delta E

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
plus delta PV.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
This is a
relationship that you will learn

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
about in a lot of detail in
5.60, in Chemical

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Thermodynamics.
At this point,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
we are going to take it as a
given.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
For gases, delta H differs on
the order of 1% to 2% from delta

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
E.
It is not much,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
but if you are doing some
precise calculation,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
you need to be aware of that.
For liquids and solids,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
delta H and delta E are really
the same for all intrinsic

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
purposes.
The delta PV term is really

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
very small.
And, in thermodynamics,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
since we are most always
looking at changes in energy,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
we need what we call standard
states.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And we are going to put a
nought, here,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
on all of our delta Hs to
designate the standard state.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
And our standard state that
your book uses,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
and will use,
refers really to the pressure.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000
And the pressure is one bar.
And one bar is equal to 10^5

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Pascal.
That is equal to 10^5 kilograms

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
per meter second squared.
The delta Hs we are going to

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
talk about are also,
just about all of them,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
measured at 298.15 degrees
Kelvin.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Delta H does depend on
temperature, but we actually are

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:04.000
not going to look at that in the
next few days.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:00:05.600
You are going to do that in

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Our delta Hs are going to be
delta Hs at 298.15 degrees

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Kelvin.
On the first slide here,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
I show you a bunch of bond
enthalpies for CH bonds.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And, of course,
those bond enthalpies are a

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
little bit different,
depending on what molecule you

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
have.
But they are not that

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
different.
And so, what is often done,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
and your book does this,
is that somebody goes and

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
calculates the average of the
bond energies for lots of CH

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
bonds and lots of molecules and
they prepare a table that looks

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
like this.
This is the mean bond enthalpy.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
And they have CH,
CC, carbon-carbon.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
But these are average bond
enthalpies.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Now, why are bond enthalpies
important to us?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Well, they are important
because they determine the

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000
enthalpy of a chemical reaction.
If the bonds are stronger in

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
the products than in the
reactants, that is going to give

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
us an exothermic reaction.
If the bonds are stronger in

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
the reactants than the products,
that gives us an endothermic

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
reaction.
And so let's look at this

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
reaction.
This is an important reaction.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
This is the oxidation of
glucose.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
This is a reaction very
exothermic, minus

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
kilojoules per mole.
It is a reaction that is being

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
carried out in every cell of
your body as we speak.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
It is the reaction that is
providing the energy to maintain

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
your body temperature,
the energy to move your

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.000
muscles, the energy to repair
tissue, and the energy to think.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Important reaction.
This is the reason why we eat.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
This is the reason why we
breathe, this is the reason why

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
we exhale, and this is the
reason why we pee.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
What do we need to do to
calculate the enthalpy for this

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
reaction?
We have to figure out how much

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
energy is required to break all
of the bonds of the reactants

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
because that is how much energy
we put in.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
And then we have to figure out
then how much energy we get back

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
when we form the product bonds.
Bottom line is,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
the enthalpy necessary to break
all of the bonds,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
you can calculate,
is 12,452 kilojoules per mole.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
That number comes from using
these average bond energies I

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
told you about.
We can then get back some

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
energy, minus 15,000,
approximately,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
when we form some new bonds.
That number comes from those

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
average bond enthalpies.
The difference between these

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
two energy levels is the
exothermicity of the reaction.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Now, what did we do to get the
enthalpy?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Well, what I did is took the
bond enthalpies of each bond of

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
the reactants and summed them.
Then, I took the bond

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
enthalpies for each one of the
products, summed them,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
and subtracted the two to get
the enthalpy of the reaction.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
I want you to notice something
here, important.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
This is reactants minus
products.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
In a moment,
I am going to show you another

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
way to calculate the enthalpy
for a reaction.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
And it is going to be products
minus reactants.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
You have to know this.
But you also see that the

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
calculated enthalpy is not the
experimental enthalpy.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Why?
Because we use the average bond

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
enthalpies.
We did not use the exact bond

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
enthalpies because if we had to
use the exact bond enthalpies,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
can you imagine the size of the
table of data that we would have

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
to have?
We would have to have a bond

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
enthalpy for every bond for
every known molecule.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
That is a lot.
What are we going to do,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
then?
Is there a more accurate way to

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
do that?
Yes, with knowing the absolute

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
bond enthalpies.
But that is too much data.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Is there some other way to do
it?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Yes.
We are going to use heats of

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
formation.
A heat of formation,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
delta H nought with an F as a
subscript.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
The heat of formation is the

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
enthalpy of a reaction that
forms one mole of a compound

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000
from the pure elements in their
most stable form in their

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
standard state.
For example,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
here is water.
We are forming one mole of

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
water from its elements,
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
The enthalpy for this reaction
is defined as the heat of

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
formation of water.
Why is this the heat of

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
formation of water?
Well, because we are forming

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
one mole, and that is important,
from the elements that make up

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
water.
What elements are they?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
They are hydrogen.
But notice that this hydrogen

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
is H two.
It is not hydrogen atoms

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
because H two is the most
stable form of hydrogen.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Oxygen is O two,
not oxygen atoms because this

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
is the most stable form of
oxygen at bar pressure.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Look at this here.
What is the heat of formation

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
of oxygen?
Well, the enthalpy change for

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
this reaction is zero.
That is the heat of formation

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
of oxygen.
Why?

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Because we are forming one mole
of oxygen from the elements in

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
their most stable form.
For elements like oxygen,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
hydrogen, nitrogen,
chlorine, two

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
in the gas phase,
those all have heats of

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
formation that are equal to
zero.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
And then, finally,
here is the expression or the

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
reaction that gives us one mole
of glucose.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
The enthalpy for this reaction
is the heat of formation of

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
glucose.
We get it from its elements,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
hydrogen, oxygen,
and look at the elemental form,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
the most stable form of the
element carbon is graphite.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Is there an 18.0-something
exam?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Yes?
Okay.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
See you on Monday.

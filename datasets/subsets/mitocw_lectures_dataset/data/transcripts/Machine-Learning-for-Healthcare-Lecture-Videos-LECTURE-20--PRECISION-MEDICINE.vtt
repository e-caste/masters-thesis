PETER SZOLOVITS:
So today I'm going

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.010
to talk about
precision medicine.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.800
And we don't really
have a very precise idea

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.080
of what precision medicine is.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.880
And so I'm going
to start by talking

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.370
about that a little bit.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.920
David talked about
disease subtyping.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280
And if you think about
how do you figure out

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.250
what are the subtypes
of a disease,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.350
you do it by some
kind of clustering

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.910
on a bunch of different
sorts of data.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.990
And so we have data like
demographics, comorbidities,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.870
vital signs,
medications, procedures,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.330
disease trajectories, whatever
those mean, image similarities.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.000
And today, mostly I'm
going to focus on genetics.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.020
Because this was the great hope
of the Human Genome Project,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.830
that as we understood more
about the genetic influences

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.220
on disease, it
would help us create

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.390
precise ways of dealing
with various diseases

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.470
and figuring out the right
therapies for them and so on.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.560
So I want to start by
reviewing a little bit

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.390
a study that was done by the
National Research Council,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.470
so the National Academies, and
it's called "Toward Precision

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.010
Medicine."

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.080
This was fairly recent, 2017.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.150
And they have some
interesting observations.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.750
So they start off
and they say, well,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
why is this relevant
now, when it may not

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.420
have been relevant before?

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.330
And of course, the biggie
is new capabilities

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.870
to compile molecular data
on patients on a scale that

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.370
was unimaginable 20 years ago.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.960
So people estimated that
getting the first human genome

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.370
cost about $3 billion.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.560
Today, getting a human genome
costs less than $1,000.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.730
I have some figures later in
the talk showing some of the ads

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.520
that people are running.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.460
Increasing success in
utilizing molecular information

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.830
to improve diagnosis
and treatment,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.780
we'll talk about some of those.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.720
Advances in IT so that we have
bigger capabilities of dealing

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.690
with so-called big data--

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.170
a perfect storm
among stakeholders

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.270
that has made them
much more receptive

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.320
to this kind of information.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.630
So the fact that costs in the
health-care system in the US

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.920
keep rising and quality doesn't
keep rising proportionately

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.960
makes everybody
desperate to come up

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.600
with new ways of dealing
with this problem.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.620
And so this looks like the next
great hope for how to do it.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.780
And shifting public attitudes
toward molecular data--

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.980
so how many of you have
seen the movie Gattaca?

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.970
A few.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.090
So that's a dystopian
view of what

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.960
happens when people are
genotyped and can therefore

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.720
be tracked by their genetics.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.620
And it is true that there are
horror stories that can happen.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.600
But nevertheless, people
seem to be more relaxed today

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.620
about allowing that kind of
data to be collected and used.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.630
Because they see the potential
benefits outweighing the costs.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.990
Not everybody--
but that continues

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.270
to be a serious issue.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.680
So this report goes
on and says, you know,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.680
let's think about
how to integrate

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.190
all kinds of different
data about individuals.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.170
And they start off and
they say, you know,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.280
one good example of this
has been Google Maps.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.350
So Google Maps has
a coordinate system,

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.040
which is basically
longitude and latitude,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.140
for every point on the Earth.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.800
And they can use that
coordinate system in order

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.720
to layer on top of each other
information about postal codes,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.950
built structures, census tracts,
land use, transportation,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.870
everything.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.420
And they said, wow, this
is really cool, if only we

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.240
could do this in health care.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.950
And so their vision is to
try to do that in health care

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.620
by saying, well,
what corresponds

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.390
to latitude and longitude
is individual patients.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.720
And these individual
patients have various kinds

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.990
of data about them,
including their microbiome,

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.910
their epigenome, their genome,
clinical signs and symptoms,

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.090
the exposome, what
are they exposed to.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.630
And so there's
been a real attempt

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.100
to go out and create
large collections of data

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.160
that bring together all of
this kind of information.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.560
One of those that is notable
is the Department of Health--

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.280
well, NIH basically started
a project about a year

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.050
and a half ago called All of
Us, sounds sort of menacing.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.320
But it's really a million of us.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.160
And they have asked institutions
around the United States

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.970
to get volunteers to
volunteer to provide

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.690
their genetic information, their
clinical data, where they live,

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.110
where they commute,
things like that,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.500
so that they can get
environmental data about them.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.790
And then it's meant to be an
ongoing collection of data

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.850
about a million people
who are supposed

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.360
to be a representative
sample of the United States.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.550
So you'll see in some
of the projects I talk

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.310
about later today that
many of the studies

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.130
have been done in populations
of European ancestry.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.930
And so they may not apply to
people of other ethnicities.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.370
This is attempting to
sample accurately so

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.120
that the fraction of
African Americans and Asians

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.570
and Hispanics and
so on corresponds

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.180
to the sample in the
United States population.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.950
There's a long history.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.120
How many of you have heard of
the Framingham Heart Study?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.350
So a lot of people.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.710
So Framingham, in
the 1940s, agreed

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.370
to become the subject of
a long-term experiment.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.340
I think it's now run by Boston
University, where every year

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.520
or two they go out
and they survey--

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.510
I can't remember the
number of people.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.370
It started as something
like 50,000 people--

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.920
about their habits and
whether they smoke,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.020
and what their
weight and height is,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.870
and any clinical
problems they've had,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.300
surgical procedures, et cetera.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.580
And they've been collecting
that database now

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.160
over several generations of
people that descend from those.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.260
And they've started collecting
genetic data as well.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.810
So All of Us is really doing
this on a very large scale.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.560
Now, the vision of
these of this study

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.370
was to say that we're going
to build this information

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.270
commons, which collects all
this kind of information,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.100
and then we're going to develop
knowledge from that information

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.780
or from that data.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.900
And that knowledge will
become the substrate on which

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.340
biomedical research can rest.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.510
So if we find
significant associations,

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.310
then that suggests
that one should

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.190
do studies, which
will not necessarily

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.950
be answered by the data
that they've collected.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.890
You may have to grow knock-out
mice or something in order

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.560
to test whether an
idea really works.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.660
But this is a way
of integrating all

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.920
of that type of information.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.530
And of course, it can
affect diagnosis, treatment,

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.490
and health outcomes, which
are the holy grail for what

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.880
you'd like to do in medicine.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.060
Now, here's an
interesting problem.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.310
So the focus, notice,
was on taxonomies.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:21.540
So Sam Johnson was a very famous
17th century British writer.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.310
And he built encyclopedias
and dictionaries,

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.690
and was a poet and a
reviewer and a commentator,

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.200
and did all kinds
of fancy things.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.900
And one of his quotes
is, "My diseases

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.380
are an asthma and a dropsy
and, what is less curable,

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.820
75," years old.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.380
So he was funny, too.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.020
Now, if you look up
dropsy in a dictionary--

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.370
how many of you have
heard of dropsy?

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.570
A couple.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.094
So how did you hear of it?

00:08:59.094 --> 00:09:01.310
AUDIENCE: From
Jane Austen novels.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.810
[LAUGHS]

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.768
PETER SZOLOVITS: Sorry?

00:09:02.768 --> 00:09:03.470
From a novel?

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.490
AUDIENCE: Novels.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.407
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yeah.

00:09:05.407 --> 00:09:08.043
AUDIENCE: I've heard
of dropsy [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:08.043 --> 00:09:08.960
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yeah.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.380
I mean, I learned about it by
watching Masterpiece Theatre

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:18.200
with 19th century people, where
the grandmother would take

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.260
to her bed with the dropsy.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.870
And it didn't turn
out well, typically.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.050
But it took a long time
for those people to die.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.010
So dropsy is water sickness,
swelling, edema, et cetera.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.910
It's actually not a disease.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.720
It's a symptom of a
whole bunch of diseases.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.540
So it could be pulmonary
disease, heart failure,

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.200
kidney disease, et cetera.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.220
And it's interesting.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.360
I look back on this.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.840
I couldn't find it for
putting together this lecture.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.190
But at one point, I did discover
that the last time dropsy was

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.060
listed as the cause of death of
a patient in the United States

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.520
was in 1949.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.100
So since then, it's disappeared
as a disease from the taxonomy.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.070
And if you talk to
pulmonary people,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.950
they suspect that
asthma, which is still

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.770
a disease in our
current lexicon,

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.890
may be very much like dropsy.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.250
It's not a disease.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.050
It's a symptom of a whole
bunch of underlying causes.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.940
And the idea is
that we need to get

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.110
good enough and precise enough
at being able to figure out

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.670
what these are.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:35.300
So I talked to my friend
Zack Kohane at Harvard

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.780
a few weeks ago when I started
preparing this lecture.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.480
And he has the following idea.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.080
And the example I'm going
to show you is from him.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.110
So he says, well,
look, we should

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.930
have this precision
medicine modality

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.920
space, which is this
high-dimensional space that

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:01.160
contains all of that information
that is in the NRC report.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:07.880
And then what we do is, in
this high-dimensional space,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.630
if we're lucky, we're going
to find clusters of data.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.030
So this always happens.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.960
If you ever take a very
high-dimensional data set

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.800
and put it into its very
high-dimensional representation

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.950
space, it's almost
never the case

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:30.320
that the data is scattered
uniformly through the space.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.350
If that were true, it
wouldn't help us very much.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.450
But generally, it's not true.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.160
And what you find
is that the data

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.790
tends to be on
lower-dimensional manifolds.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.650
So it's in subsets of the space.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.800
And so a lot of
the trick in trying

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.040
to analyze this kind
of data is figuring out

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.000
what those lower-dimensional
manifolds look like.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.220
And often you will find among
a very large data set a cluster

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.920
of patients like this.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.020
And then Zack's approach is to
say, well, if you're patient--

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.810
it's hard to represent
three dimensions in two.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.780
But if you're patient that falls
somewhere in the middle of such

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.420
a cluster, then
that probably means

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.630
that they're kind of
normal for that cluster,

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.500
whereas if they fall somewhere
at the edge of such a cluster,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.660
that probably means that
there's something odd

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.900
going on that is worth
investigating, because they're

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.820
unusual.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.370
So then he gave me an
example of a patient of his.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.570
And let me give you a
minute to read this.

00:12:50.902 --> 00:12:51.402
Yeah?

00:12:51.402 --> 00:12:53.460
AUDIENCE: What's
an armamentarium?

00:12:56.893 --> 00:12:58.935
PETER SZOLOVITS: Where
does it say armamentarium?

00:12:58.935 --> 00:12:59.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.813
PETER SZOLOVITS: Oh, yeah.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:03.810
So an armamentarium,
historically,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.230
is the set of arms that
are available to an army.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.560
So this is the set of treatments
that are available to a doctor.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.008
AUDIENCE: Is that the
only word you don't know?

00:13:15.008 --> 00:13:17.378
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:17.378 --> 00:13:18.330
It's the only word--

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.960
AUDIENCE: If I start asking--

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.252
AUDIENCE: Based on [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:22.218
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.150
AUDIENCE: In the world.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.570
Some of it, I thought
I could understand.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.028
PETER SZOLOVITS:
Well, you probably

00:13:28.028 --> 00:13:29.750
know what antibiotics are.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.440
And immunosuppressants,
you've probably heard of.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.820
Anyway, it's a bunch
of different therapies.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.270
So this is what's
called a sick puppy.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.900
It's a kid who is
not doing well.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.220
They started life, at age
three, with ulcerative colitis,

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.010
which was well-controlled
by the kinds of medications

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:56.090
that they normally give
people with that disease.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.570
And then all of a
sudden, 10 years later,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.710
he breaks out with this horrible
abdominal pain and diarrhea

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.490
and blood in his stool.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:12.717
And they try a bunch of stuff
that they think ought to work,

00:14:12.717 --> 00:14:13.550
and it doesn't work.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:23.030
So the kid was facing some
fairly drastic options,

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:28.410
like cutting out the part of
his colon that was inflamed.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.950
So your colon is an important
part of your digestive tract.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.770
And so losing it is not fun
and would have bad consequences

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.520
for the rest of his life.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.850
But what they did
is they said, well,

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:51.790
why is he not responding
to any of these therapies?

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:57.330
And the difficulty,
you can imagine,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.050
in that cloud-of-points
picture, is,

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.860
how do you figure out whether
the person is an outlier

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.820
or is in the middle of
one of these clusters,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.870
when it depends on
a lot of things?

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.560
In this kid's case, what it
depended on most significantly

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.920
was the last six months
of his experience,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.980
where, before, he was doing OK
with the standard treatment.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.830
So that cloud might
have represented people

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.650
with ulcerative colitis
who were well-controlled

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.330
by the standard treatment.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.360
And now, all of a sudden,
he becomes an outlier.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.850
So what happened in
this case is they said,

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.170
well, maybe there
are different groups

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.420
of ulcerative colitis patients.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.080
So maybe there are ones who
have a lifelong remission

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.260
after treatment with a commonly
used monoclonal antibody.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.090
So that's the center
of the cluster.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.540
Maybe there are people who
have multi-year remission

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.230
but become refractory
to these drugs.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:09.200
And after other treatments, they
have to undergo a colectomy.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.560
So that's the
removal of the colon.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.590
And then there are people who
have, initially, a remission,

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.230
but then those
standard therapy works.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.550
So that's what this kid
is in, this cluster.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:29.470
So how do you treat this as
a machine learning problem

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.750
from the point of view
of having lots of data

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.060
about lots of
different patients?

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.560
And the challenges, of
course, include things like,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.250
what's your distance function
in doing the kind of clustering

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.650
that people typically do?

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.920
How do you define
what an outlier is?

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.280
Because there's always a
continuum where it just

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.190
gets more and more diffuse.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.610
What's the best representation
for time-varying data,

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.160
which is critical in this case?

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.069
What's the optimal weighting
or normalization of dimensions?

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:07.630
So does every dimension in this
very high-dimensional space

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.040
count the same?

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.380
Or are differences
along certain dimensions

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.990
more important than
those among others?

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.900
And does that, in fact, vary
from problem to problem?

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.160
The answer is probably yes.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.300
So how do we find the
neighborhood for the patient?

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.110
Well, I'm going to
give you some clues

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.590
by starting with a shallow
dive into genetics.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.390
So if you've taken a
molecular cell biology class,

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.080
this should not be news to you.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.320
And I'm going to run
through it pretty quickly.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.480
If you haven't,
then I hope at least

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.120
you'll pick up some
of the vocabulary.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.240
So a wise biologist
said, "Biology

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.670
is the science of exceptions."

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.990
There are almost no rules.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.820
About 25 years ago,
the biology department

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.590
here taught a special class
for engineering faculty

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.320
to try to explain
to us what they

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.150
were teaching in their
introductory biology,

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.240
molecular biology classes.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.400
And I remember, I
was sitting next

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.800
to Jerry Sussman,
one of my colleagues.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.150
And after we heard some
lecture about the 47 ways

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.460
that some theory doesn't
apply in many, many cases,

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.780
Jerry turns to me and
he says, you know,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.540
the problem with this field is
there are just too many damned

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.950
exceptions.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.990
There are no theories.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.540
It's all exceptions.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:39.310
And so even biologists
recognize this.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:43.570
Now, people have observed,
ever since human beings walked

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.610
the earth, that
children tend to be

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.030
similar to their
parents in many ways.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.470
And until Gregor Mendel,
this was a great mystery.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.077
Why is it that you
are like your parents?

00:18:57.077 --> 00:18:58.660
I mean, you must
have gotten something

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.750
from them that sort of
carries through and makes

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.790
you similar to them.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.880
So Mendel had this
notion of having

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.810
discrete factors of inheritance,
which he called genes.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.060
He had no idea what these were.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.080
But conceptually, he knew
that they must exist.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.860
And then he did a bunch of
experiments on pea plants,

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.920
showing that peas
that are wrinkled

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.330
tend to have offspring peas
that are also wrinkled.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:33.010
And he worked out the
genetics of what we now

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.430
call Mendelian
inheritance, namely

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:41.710
dominant versus recessive
inheritance patterns.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:47.980
Then Johann Miescher came
along some years later,

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.270
and he discovered a
weird thing in cells

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:56.545
called nuclein, which
is now known as DNA.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:07.940
But it wasn't until 1952 that
Hershey and Chase said, hey,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.950
it's DNA that is carrying
this genetic information

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.400
from generation to generation.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.100
And then, of course,
Watson, Crick, and Franklin,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.120
the following year, deciphered
the structure of DNA,

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.180
that it's this double
helix, and then figured out

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.480
what the mechanism
must be that allows DNA

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.920
to transmit this information.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.840
So you have a double helix.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:44.570
You match the four letters A,
C, T, G opposite each other,

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.380
and you can replicate
this DNA by splitting it

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.050
apart and growing
another strand that

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.430
is the complement
of the first one.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.470
Now you have two.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.980
And you can have children, pass
on this information to them.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.110
So that was a big deal.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.330
So a gene is defined
by the National Center

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.930
for Biotechnology Information
as a fundamental physical

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.980
and functional unit of heredity
that's a DNA sequence located

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.830
on a specific site
on a chromosome which

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.590
encodes a specific
functional product,

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.350
namely RNA or a protein.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.710
I'll come back to
that in a minute.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.940
The remaining mystery
is it's still very

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.980
hard to figure out what
parts of the DNA code genes.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.090
So you would think we
might have solved this,

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.210
but we haven't quite.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.840
And what does the rest, which
is the vast majority of the DNA,

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.920
do if it's not encoding genes?

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.250
And then, how does the
folding and the geometry,

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.383
the topology of
these structures,

00:21:49.383 --> 00:21:50.425
influence their function?

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.250
So I went back and I read
some of Francis Crick's work

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.660
from the 1950s.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.360
And it's very interesting.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.130
This hypothesis was considered
controversial and tentative

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.420
at the time.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.290
So he said, "The specificity
of a piece of nucleic acid

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.950
is expressed solely by
the sequence of its bases,

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.960
and this sequence
is a simple code

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.010
for the amino acid sequence
of a particular protein."

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.190
And there were people arguing
that he was just flat wrong,

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.450
that this was not true.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.900
Of course, it turned
out he was right.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.480
And then the central
dogma is the transfer

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.110
of information from nucleic
acid to nucleic acid

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.810
or from nucleic acid to
protein may be possible.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.790
But transfer from protein
to protein or from protein

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.820
to nucleic acid is impossible.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.160
And that's not quite true.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.380
But it's a good
first approximation.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:57.740
So this is where things stood
back about 60 years ago.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.800
And then a few
Nobel prizes later,

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.890
we began to understand some
of the mechanism of how

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.180
this works.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.490
And of course, how
it works is that you

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:13.250
have DNA, which is these
four bases, double stranded.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.400
RNA gets produced in the
process of transcription.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.720
So this thing unfolds.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:27.710
An RNA strand is built along the
DNA and separates from the DNA,

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.380
creating a single-stranded RNA.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.320
And then it goes and
hooks up with a ribosome.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.990
And the ribosome takes that
RNA and takes the codes

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.020
in triplets, and
each triplet stands

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.710
for a particular amino acid,
which it then assembles

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.020
in sequence and
creates proteins, which

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.300
are sequences of amino acids.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.210
Now, it's very complicated.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.340
Because there's
three-dimensionality

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.720
and there's time involved.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.310
And the rate constants--
this is chemistry, after all.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:10.245
So again, a few more
Nobel prizes later,

00:24:10.245 --> 00:24:15.330
we have that transcription,
that process of turning DNA

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:19.140
into RNA, is regulated
by promoter, repressor,

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.860
and enhancer regions
on the genome.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:27.960
And the proteins mediate this
process by binding to the DNA

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.560
and causing the beginning
of transcription,

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.340
or causing it to run faster
or causing it to run slower,

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.730
or they interfere
with it, et cetera.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.000
There are also these
enhancers, some of which

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.280
are very far away from
the coding region, that

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.210
make huge differences
in how much of the RNA,

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.510
and therefore how much
of the protein, is made.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.270
And the current
understanding of that

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.360
is that, if here
is the gene, it may

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.750
be that the strand
of DNA loops around.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:08.700
And the enhancer, even though
it's distant in genetic units,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.130
is actually in close
physical proximity,

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.860
and therefore can encourage
more of this transcription

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.160
to take place.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.550
By the way, if you're interested
in this stuff, of course

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:28.230
MIT teaches a lot of
courses in how to do this.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.860
Dave Gifford and Manolis
Kellis both teach

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.000
computational courses in how
to apply computational methods

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.820
to try to decipher
this kind of activity.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.470
So repressors prevent activator
from binding or alters

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.770
the activator in order to
change the rate constants.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.340
And so this is
another mechanism.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.930
Now, one of the
problems is that if you

00:25:53.930 --> 00:26:02.510
look at the total amount of DNA
in your genes, in your cells,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.160
only about 1 and
1/2% are exons, which

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:14.820
are the parts that code for
mRNA, and eventually protein.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.600
So the question is what does
the other 98 and 1/2% do?

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.650
There was this unfortunate
tendency in the biology

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.100
community to call
that junk DNA, which

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.200
of course is a terrible notion.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.990
Because evolution would
certainly have gotten

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.540
rid of it if it was truly junk.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.710
Because our cells spend a lot
of energy building this stuff.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.700
And every time a
cell divides, it

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.640
rebuilds all that
so-called junk DNA.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.700
So it can't possibly be junk.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.280
But the question
is, what does it do?

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.890
And we don't really
know for a lot of it.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.370
So there are introns--

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.580
I'll show you a picture.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.830
There are segments of the
coding region that don't wind up

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.180
as part of the RNA.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.890
They're spliced out.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.650
And we don't quite know why.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.350
There are these
regulatory sequences,

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:15.070
which is only about 5%,
that are those promoters

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:22.880
and repressors and enhancers
that I talked about.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.230
And then there's a whole
bunch of repetitive DNA that

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:30.980
includes transposable
elements, related sequences.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.150
And mostly, we don't
understand what it all does.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.700
Hypotheses are things
like, well, maybe

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.870
it's a storehouse of
potentially useful DNA

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.750
so that if environmental
conditions change a lot,

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.720
then the cell doesn't
have to reinvent

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.490
the stuff from scratch.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:55.740
It saved it from previous
times in evolution

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.460
when that may have been useful.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.640
But that's pretty much pure
speculation at this point.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.300
So just recently,
the Killian Lecture

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.520
was given by Gerald Fink,
who's a geneticist here.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.590
And his claim is that a gene
is not any segment of DNA

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:17.260
that produces RNA or protein.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.770
But it's any segment of
DNA that is transcribed

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.740
into RNA that has some
function, whatever

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:29.060
it is, not necessarily building
proteins, but just anything.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.200
And I think that view
is becoming accepted.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.130
So I promised you a little
bit of more complexity.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.520
So when you look at
your DNA in eukaryotes,

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.820
like us, here's the promoter.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:51.070
And then here is the
sequence of the genome.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:55.420
When this gets transcribed, it
gets transcribed into something

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.320
called pre-mRNA, messenger RNA.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.120
And then there's this process
of alternative splicing

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:09.100
that splices out the introns
and leaves only the exons.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.620
But sometimes it doesn't
leave all the exons.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.640
It only leaves some of them.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.470
And so the same gene can,
under various circumstances,

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.840
produce different
mRNA, which then

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.310
produces different proteins.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.540
And again, there's a lot
of mysteries about exactly

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.940
how all this works.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.210
Nevertheless, that's
the basic mechanism.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:36.325
And then here, I've
just listed a few

00:29:36.325 --> 00:29:38.860
of the complexity problems.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:43.630
So there are things like,
RNA can turn into DNA.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.810
This is a trick that
viruses use a lot.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.260
They incorporate
themselves into your cell,

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:55.390
create a DNA
complement to the RNA,

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.670
and then use that to
generate more viruses.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:03.340
So this is very typical
of a viral infection.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.700
Prions, we also don't
understand very well.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.740
This is like mad cow disease,
where these proteins are able

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.000
to cause changes in other
proteins without going through

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.130
the RNA/DNA-mediated mechanisms.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.100
There are
DNA-modifying proteins,

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.920
the most important of
which is the stuff involved

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.200
in CRISPR-CAS9, which is
this relatively new discovery

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:37.540
about how bacteria are able to
use a mechanism that they stole

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:45.670
from viruses to edit the genetic
complement of themselves,

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:50.110
and more importantly, of other
viruses that attack them.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.120
So it's an antiviral
defense mechanism.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.890
And we're now figuring out how
to use it to do gene editing.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.270
You may have read about this
Chinese guy who actually went

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:05.980
out and edited the genome of a
couple of girls who were born

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:11.050
in China, incorporating
some, I think, resistance

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.390
against HIV infections
in their genome.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.080
And of course, this is
probably way too early

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.570
to do experiments
on human beings,

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.810
because they haven't
demonstrated that this is safe.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.990
But maybe that'll
become accepted.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.680
George Church at Harvard
has been going around--

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.080
he likes to rattle
people's chains.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.850
And he's been going
around saying, well,

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:39.280
the guy, he was unethical and
was a slob, but what he's doing

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.110
is a really great idea.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:45.480
So we'll see where that goes.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.750
And then there are
these retrotransposons,

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:53.460
where pieces of DNA in
eukarya just pop out

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.670
of wherever they are
and insert themselves

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.860
in some other place
in the genome.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.770
And in plants,
this happens a lot.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:08.550
So for example, wheat seems to
have a huge number of copies

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:13.320
of DNA segments that
maybe it had only one of,

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.730
but it's replicated
through this mechanism.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.390
Last bit of complexity--

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.520
so we have various kinds of RNA.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.740
There's long
non-coding RNA, which

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.640
seems to participate
in gene regulation.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:39.700
There is RNA interference,
that there are these small RNA

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.260
pieces that will actually
latch onto the RNA produced

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.770
by the standard
genetic mechanism

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.260
and prevent it from being
translated into protein.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.530
This was another Nobel
Prize a few years ago.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.700
Almost everything in this
field, if you're first,

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.150
you get a Nobel Prize for it.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.420
Once the proteins
are made, they're

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.010
degraded differentially.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:08.130
So there are
different mechanisms

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.490
in the cell that destroy
certain kinds of proteins

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.660
much faster than others.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.290
And so the production
rate doesn't tell you

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.830
how much is going to be
there at any particular time.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:24.630
And then there's this secondary
and tertiary structure,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.030
where there's actually--

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:27.780
what is it?

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.530
It's a mile of DNA in
each of your cells.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.140
So it wouldn't fit.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:41.550
And so it gets wrapped up
on these acetylated histones

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.610
to produce something
called chromatin.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.700
And again, we don't quite
understand how this all works.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.850
Because you'd think that if
you wrap stuff up like this,

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.290
it would become inaccessible
to transcription.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.560
And therefore, it's not
clear how it gets expressed.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.840
But somehow or other, the
cell is able to do that.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:06.840
So there's a lot yet
to learn in this area.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.480
Now, the reason we're
interested in all this

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.400
is because, if you plot Moore's
law for how quickly computers

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.610
are becoming cheaper
per performance,

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:22.500
and you plot the cost
of gene sequencing,

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.270
it keeps going down.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:29.120
And it goes down much faster
even than Moore's law.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.239
So this is pretty remarkable.

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:36.070
And it means that, as I said,
that $3 dollar first genome now

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.010
costs just a few
hundred dollars.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:44.420
In fact, if you're just
interested in the whole exome,

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:51.710
so only the 2%,
roughly, of the DNA that

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.400
produces genetic
coding, you can now

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.490
go to this company, which
I have nothing to do with.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.950
I just pulled this off the web.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:09.000
But for $299, they will
give you 50-times coverage

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.110
on about six gigabases.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:17.300
And if you pay
them an extra $100,

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.860
they'll do it at 100x coverage.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.530
So these techniques
are very noisy.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.340
And so it's important to
get lots of replicates

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:30.430
in order to reassemble
what you think is going on.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.320
A slightly more recent
phenomenon is people say, well,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.930
not only can we
sequence your DNA

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:42.320
but we can sequence the RNA that
got transcribed from the DNA.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:49.880
And in fact, you can buy a
kit for $360 that will take

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.220
the RNA from individual cells--

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:58.770
so these are like
picoliter amounts of stuff.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:04.250
And it will give you the RNA
sequence for $360 for up to 100

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:09.120
cells, so $3, $3.50 per cell.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.030
So people are very excited.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.730
And there are now also
companies that will

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.580
sell you advanced analysis.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.100
So they will correlate
the data that you

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.310
are getting with
different databases

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:26.540
and figure out whether
this represents

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.260
a dominant or a recessive
or an x-linked model,

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.760
if you have family familial
data and functional annotation

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.250
of candidate genes, et cetera.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.610
And so, for example, starting
about three years ago,

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:46.070
if you walk into the Dana-Farber
with a newly diagnosed cancer,

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:50.420
a solid-tumor cancer, they will
take a sample of that cancer,

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.560
send it off to companies
like this, or their own labs,

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.190
and do sequencing and do
analysis and try to figure out

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:02.780
exactly which damaged genes
that you have may be causing

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.820
the cancer, and maybe more
importantly, since it's still

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:13.730
a pretty empirical field, which
unusual variants of your genes

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.400
suggest that certain
drugs are likely to be

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.270
more effective in treating
your cancer than other drugs.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:25.131
So this has become completely
routine in cancer care

00:37:25.131 --> 00:37:27.185
and in a few other domains.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:35.250
So now I'm going to switch to a
more technical set of material.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.390
So if you want to
characterize disease subtypes

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:42.710
using gene expression
arrays, microarrays, here's

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.740
one way to do it.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.070
And this is a famous
paper by Alizadeh.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:51.500
It was essentially the first
of this class of papers

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.220
back in 2001, I think.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.420
Yeah, 2001.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.840
And since then, there have
been probably tens or hundreds

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.420
of thousands of other
papers published

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:06.930
doing similar kinds of
analyses on other data sets.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.510
So what they did is
they said, OK, we're

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:16.200
going to extract the coding RNA.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.510
We're going to create
complementary DNA from it.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.420
We're going to use a
technique to amplify that,

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.660
because we're starting
with teeny-tiny quantities.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:34.380
And then we're going to take
a microarray, which is either

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.580
a glass slide with tens
or hundreds of thousands

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.200
of spotted bits of
DNA on it or it's

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.770
a silicon chip with
wells that, again,

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:51.360
have tens or hundreds of
thousands of bits of DNA in it.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.640
Now, where does
that DNA come from?

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.360
Initially, it was just
a random collection

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.790
of pieces of genes
from the genome.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.920
Since then, they've gotten
somewhat more sophisticated.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:12.090
But the idea is that I'm going
to take the amplified cDNA,

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.870
I'm going to mark with one of
these jellyfish proteins that

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.750
glows under light,
and then I'm going

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:23.370
to flow it over this slide
or over this set of wells.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:29.410
And the complementary parts
of the complementary DNA

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:35.556
will stick to the samples of
DNA that are in this well.

00:39:35.556 --> 00:39:39.260
OK-- stands to reason.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.040
An alternative is that you
take normal tissue as well

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.150
as, say, the cancerous tissue,
you mark the normal tissue

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:51.770
with green fluorescent
jellyfish stuff

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.750
and you mark the
cancer with red,

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.260
and then you flow both
of them in equal amounts

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.550
over the array.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.500
That lets you measure a ratio.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.650
And you don't have as much
of a calibration problem

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.640
about trying to figure
out the exact value.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.760
And then you cluster
these samples by nearness

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.470
in the expression space.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.670
And you cluster the genes
by expression similarity

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.240
across samples.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.540
So it used to be
called bi-clustering.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:24.110
And I'll talk in a few minutes
about a particular technique

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.370
for doing this.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:30.750
So this is a typical
microarray experiment.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:34.790
The RNA is turned into
its complementary DNA,

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.440
flowed over the microarray chip.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.720
And you get out a
bunch of spots that

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.960
are to various degrees
of green and red.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.370
And then you
calculate their ratio.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.620
And then you do
this bi-clustering.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.370
And what you get is a
hierarchical clustering

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:57.540
of genes and a hierarchical
clustering, in their case,

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.240
of breast cancer biopsy
specimens that express

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.790
these genes in different ways.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.150
So this was pretty
revolutionary,

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.730
because the answers made sense.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.590
So when they did
this on 19 cell lines

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:22.230
in 65 breast tumor samples
and a whole bunch of genes,

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.400
they came up with a
clustering that said, hmm,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.950
it looks like there are
some samples that have

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.810
this endothelial cell cluster.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.230
So it's a particular
kind of problem.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:42.240
And you could correlate
it with pathology

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.280
from the tumor slides
and different subclasses.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.330
And then this is a very
typical kind of heat map

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:53.820
that you see in
this type of study.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.590
Another study from 65
breast carcinoma samples,

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.700
using the gene list that
they curated before,

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:12.540
looks like it clusters
the expression levels

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.040
into these five clusters.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.500
It's a little hard to look at.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.770
I mean, when I stare at
these, it's not obvious to me

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:25.790
why the mathematics came up with
exactly those clusters rather

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.080
than some others.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.150
But you can see that
there is some sense to it.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:34.640
So here you see a lot of
greens at this end of it

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.460
and not very much at
this end, and vise versa.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.850
So there is some difference
between these clusters.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:41.450
Yeah?

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.533
AUDIENCE: How did they
come up with the gene list?

00:42:43.533 --> 00:42:46.254
And does anyone ever do this
kind of cluster analysis

00:42:46.254 --> 00:42:48.195
without coming up with
a gene list first?

00:42:48.195 --> 00:42:49.070
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yes.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.850
So I'm going to talk in a
minute about modern gene-wide

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.670
association studies,
where basically you

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:59.630
say, I'm going to look at
every gene known to man.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:04.760
So they still have a list, but
the list is 20,000 or 25,000.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.770
It's whatever we know about.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:09.310
And that's another
way of doing it.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:15.830
So what was compelling about
this work, this group's work,

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:21.560
is a later analysis showed that
these five subtypes actually

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.930
had different survival rates,
and at p-equal 0.01 level

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:29.030
of statistical significance.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.130
You've seen these survival
curves, of course,

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.500
before from David's lecture.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.340
But this is pretty impressive
that doing something

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.340
that had nothing to do
with the clinical condition

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.250
of the patient--

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:45.570
this is purely based on their
gene expression levels--

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.740
you were able to find
clusters that actually

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.780
behave differently, clinically.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.840
So some of them do
better than others.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.650
So this paper and
this approach to work

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:02.360
set off a huge set
of additional work.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.110
This was, again, back
in the Alizadeh paper.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:12.350
They did a similar
relationship between 96 samples

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:15.860
of normal and
malignant lymphocytes.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:20.180
And they get a
similar result, where

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.450
the clusters that
they identify here

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:28.820
correspond to sort of
well-understood existing

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.150
types of lymphoma.

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:35.350
So this, again, gives
you some confidence

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:41.080
that what you're extracting
from these genetic correlations

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.820
is meaningful in the terms that
people who deal with lymphomas

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.530
think about, about the topic.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.160
But of course, it can
give you much more detail.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.770
Because people's
intuitions may not

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:59.210
be as effective as these
large-scale data analyses.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:02.410
So to get to your question
about generalizing this,

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:06.050
I mean, here's one way
that I look at this.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:12.280
If I list all the genes and
I list all the phenotypes--

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.110
now, we're a little
more sure of what

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.760
the genes are than of
what the phenotypes are.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.690
So that's an
interesting problem.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.530
Then I can do a
bunch of analyses.

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:27.460
So what is a phenotype?

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.720
Well, it can be a diagnosed
disease, like breast cancer.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.320
Or it can be the type of
lymphoma from the two examples

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.880
I've just shown you.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.000
It can also be a qualitative
or a quantitative trait.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.020
It could be your weight.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.340
It could be your eye color.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:48.790
It could be almost anything that
is clinically known about you.

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.860
And it could even be behavior.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:58.940
It could be things like, what
is your daily output of Twitter

00:45:58.940 --> 00:45:59.440
posts?

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.670
That's a perfectly
reasonable trait.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:06.830
I don't know if it's
genetically predictable.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:12.170
But you'll see some
surprising things that are.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.300
So then, how do
you analyze this?

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:19.070
Well, if you start by looking
at a particular phenotype

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.070
and say, what genes are
associated with this,

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.250
then you're doing what's
called a GWAS, or a Gene-Wide

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.260
Association Study.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.120
So you look for
genetic differences

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.810
that correspond to specific
phenotypic differences.

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.810
And usually, you're looking at
things like single nucleotide

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.640
polymorphisms.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.850
So this is places where
your genome differs

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.030
from the reference genome,
the most common genome

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:47.760
in the human population,
at one particular locus.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.590
So you have a C instead of
a G or something one place

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:53.120
in your genes.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:57.710
Copy number variations,
there are stretches of DNA

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:01.010
that have repeats in them.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:03.810
And the number of
repeats is variable.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.020
So one of the most
famous ones of these

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:09.330
is the one associated
with Huntington's disease.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:14.090
It turns out that if you have
up to 20-something repeats

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:17.790
of a certain section of DNA,
you're perfectly healthy.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.220
But if you're
above 30 something,

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.760
then you're going to die
of Huntington's disease.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.780
And again, we don't quite
understand these mechanisms.

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.790
But these are empirically known.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.580
So copy number
variations are important,

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:38.030
gene expression levels, which
I've talked about a minute ago.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:41.150
But the trick here
in a GWAS is to look

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.690
at a very wide set
of genes rather than

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:48.260
just a limited set
of samples that you

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.300
know you're interested in.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.650
Now, the other approach
is the opposite,

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:56.600
which is to say, let's
look at a particular gene

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.600
and figure out what's
it correlated with.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:05.000
And so that's called a PheWAS, a
Phenome-Wide Association Study.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.340
And now what you do is you list
all the different phenotypes.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.180
And you say, well, we can
do the same kind of analysis

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.570
to say which of them
are disproportionately

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:22.490
present in people who
have that genetic variant.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:25.220
So here's what a
typical GWAS looks like.

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.190
This is called a Manhattan plot,
which I think is pretty funny.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:33.540
But it does kind of look like
the skyline of Manhattan.

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:37.730
So this is all of your
genes laid out in sequence

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.250
along your chromosomes.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:45.980
And you take a particular
phenotype and you

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:51.200
say, what is the difference
in the ratio of expression

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.250
levels between people who have
this disease and people who

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.200
don't have this disease?

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.140
And something like this gene,
whatever it is, clearly there

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.670
is an enormous difference
in its expression level.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.760
And so you would be surprised if
this gene didn't have something

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.920
to do with the disease.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:15.740
And similarly, you can calculate
different significance levels.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.470
You have to do something
like a Bonferroni correction,

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:23.400
because you are testing so
many hypotheses simultaneously.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.210
And so typically, the
top of these lines

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:29.630
is the Bonferroni-corrected
threshold.

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:33.780
And then you say, OK, this guy,
this guy, this guy, this guy,

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.420
and this guy come
above that threshold.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.300
So these are good
candidate genes

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.840
to think that may be
associated with this disease.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.140
Now, can you go out and start
treating people based on that?

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.380
Well, it's probably
not a good idea.

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.740
Because there are many
reasons why this analysis

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.640
might have failed.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.240
All the lessons that you've
heard about confounders

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.520
come in very strongly here.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.620
And so typically,
what biologists

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.230
do is they do this
kind of analysis.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:08.030
They then create a
strain of knock-out mice

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.895
who have some analog
of whatever disease

00:50:10.895 --> 00:50:12.020
it is that you're studying.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:17.870
And they see whether,
in fact, knocking out

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:24.590
a certain gene, like this
guy, cures or creates

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:27.470
the disease that you're
interested in in this mouse

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:28.280
model.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.130
And then you have a more
mechanistic explanation

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:32.960
for what the
relationship might be.

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.010
So basically, you're
looking at the ratio

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:47.790
of the odds of having the
disease if you have a SNP,

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:52.570
or if you have a genetic
variant, to having the disease

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:54.600
if you don't have
the genetic variant.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.210
Yeah?

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:57.145
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious on the class size.

00:50:57.145 --> 00:50:58.770
It seems like the
Bonferroni correction

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:01.920
is being very limiting here,
potentially conservative.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.930
And I'm curious if there
are specific computational

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:07.060
techniques adapted
to this scenario that

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.133
allow you to sort of mine a bit
more effectively than those.

00:51:10.133 --> 00:51:11.050
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yeah.

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.740
So if you talk to the
statisticians, who

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:19.030
are more expert at this than the
computer scientists typically,

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.160
they will tell you
that Bonferroni

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.940
is a very conservative
kind of correction.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.840
And if you can impose
some sort of structure

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:33.370
on the set of genes that you're
testing, then you can cheat.

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:39.100
And you can say, well, you
know, these 75 genes actually

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.420
are all part of
the same mechanism.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.780
And we're really testing
the mechanism and not

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.000
the individual gene.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.240
And therefore, instead of
making a Bonferroni correction

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.470
for 75 of these guys, we
only have to do it for one.

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:57.610
And so you can reduce the
Bonferroni correction that way.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:00.490
But people get nervous
when you do that.

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:06.040
Because your incentive
as a researcher

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:10.090
is to show statistically
significant results.

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.790
But that whole
question of p-values

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:15.880
keeps coming under discussion.

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.920
So the head of the American
Statistical Association,

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.070
about 15 years ago-- he's
the Stanford professor.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:31.360
And he published what became a
very notorious article saying,

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.640
you know, we got it all wrong.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.505
Statistical significance
is not significance

00:52:37.505 --> 00:52:40.450
in the standard English
sense of the word.

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:42.940
And so he called for
various other ways

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:46.840
and was more sympathetic to
Bayesian kinds of reasoning

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.250
and things like that.

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:50.870
So there may be some
gradual movement to that.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:54.310
But this is a huge can of
worms to which we don't have

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:55.930
a very good mechanistic answer.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.860
All right.

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.760
So if you do these GWASs--

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.400
and this is the real
problem with them

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:10.160
is that most of what
you see is down here.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.365
So you have things
with common variants.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.270
But they have very
small effect sizes

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:24.120
when you look at
what their effect is

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.590
on a particular disease.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:31.540
And so that same Zach Kohane
that I mentioned earlier

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:34.560
has always been challenging
people doing this kind of work,

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.950
saying, look--

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:42.080
for example, we did
a GWAS with Kat Liao,

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:45.890
who was a guest interviewee
here when I was lecturing

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:47.540
earlier in the semester.

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.930
She's a rheumatologist.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.360
And we did a gene-wide
association study.

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.650
We found a bunch of genes
that had odds ratios

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:59.360
of like 1.1 to 1, 1.2 to 1.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.160
And they're statistically
significant.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.410
Because if you
collect enough data,

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.950
everything is
statistically significant.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:12.440
But are they significant in the
other sense of significance?

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.260
Well, so Zach's
argument was that if you

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:18.800
look at something like the
odds ratio of lung cancer

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.910
for people who do
and don't smoke,

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:25.750
the odds ratios is eight.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:33.100
So when you compare 1.1 to
eight, you should be ashamed.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.310
You're not doing very well
in terms of elucidating

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.470
what the effects really are.

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:41.650
And so Zack actually
has argued very strongly

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:44.110
that rather than focusing
all our attention

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:49.060
on these genetic factors that
have very weak relationships,

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.330
we should instead focus
more on clinical things that

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:56.020
often have stronger
predictive relationships.

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.480
And some combination,
of course, is best.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:04.870
Now, it is true that we know a
whole bunch of highly penetrant

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:06.760
Mendelian mutations.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.660
So these are ones where,
one change in your genome,

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:14.800
and all of a sudden you
have some terrible disease.

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:19.100
And I think when the Genome
Project started in the 1990s,

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:21.580
there was an expectation
that we would

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:24.520
find a whole bunch
more things like that

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.860
from knowing the genome.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.810
And that expectation was dashed.

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:34.190
Because what we discovered
is that our predecessors

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:36.380
were actually pretty
good at recognizing

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:40.250
those kinds of
diseases, from Mendel

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:42.290
on, with the wrinkled peas.

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:45.740
If you see a family in
which there's a segregation

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:48.860
pattern where you can
see who has the disease

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.880
and who doesn't and what
their relationships are,

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.520
you can get a pretty
good idea of what

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.770
genes or what
genetic variants are

00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:00.300
associated with that disease.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:04.650
And it turns out we had
found almost all of them.

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:08.680
And so there weren't a whole lot
more that are highly penetrant

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.590
Mendelian mutations.

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:14.430
And so what we had is
mostly these common variants

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:17.400
with small effects.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.610
What's really interesting
and worth working on

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:24.180
is these rare variants
with small effects.

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:30.690
So the mystery kid, like the
kid whose case I showed you,

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:33.750
probably has some
interesting genetics

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:39.290
that is quite uncommon, and
obviously, for a long time,

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:41.300
had a small effect.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.120
But then all of a sudden,
something happened.

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.800
And there is this whole
field called unknown disease

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.870
diagnosis that says, what do
you do when some weirdo walks in

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:57.530
off the street and you have
no idea what's going on?

00:56:57.530 --> 00:57:01.580
And there are now companies--
so I was a judge in a challenge

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.130
about four or five
years ago, where

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:09.890
we took eight kids like
this and we genotyped them,

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:12.440
and we genotyped their
parents and their grandparents

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.400
and their siblings.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.840
And we took all
their clinical data.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.220
This was with the consent
of their parents, of course.

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:22.250
And we made it
available as a contest.

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.860
And we had 20-something
participants

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:27.890
from around the world who
tried to figure out something

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:30.950
useful to say about these kids.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:33.410
And you go through a pipeline.

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:35.870
And we did this in two rounds.

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:39.380
The first round, the pipelines
all looked very different.

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.060
And the second round,
a couple of years

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:44.120
later, the pipelines had
pretty much converged.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.030
And I see now that there
is a company that did well

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:51.020
in one of these challenges that
now sells this as a service,

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:54.560
like I showed you before,
different company.

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:58.880
And so you send them
the genetic makeup

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.000
of some kid with
a weird condition

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.300
and the genetic makeup
of their family,

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:08.270
and it tries to
guess which genes

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:13.580
might be involved in causing
the problem that this child has.

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:19.510
That's not the
answer, of course.

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:24.790
Because that's just a sort
of suspicion of a problem.

00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:28.980
And then you have to go out
and do real biological work

00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:31.080
to try to reproduce
that scenario

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.690
and see what the
effects really are.

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:37.800
But at least in a couple of
cases out of those eight,

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.690
those hints have, in fact, led
to a much better understanding

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:45.630
of what caused the
problems in these children.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.875
That was fun, by the way.

00:58:49.875 --> 00:58:53.400
I got my name as
an author on one

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.890
of these things that looks
like a high-energy physics

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:56.920
experiment.

00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.080
The first two pages of the paper
is just the list of authors.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:04.245
So it's kind of interesting.

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.770
Now, here's a more
recent study, which

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:14.640
is a gene-wide association
of type 2 diabetes.

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.680
It's not quite
gene-wide, because they

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.990
didn't study every locus.

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:22.680
But they studied a
hundred loci that

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:26.860
have been associated with type
2 diabetes in previous studies.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.850
So of course, if you're
not the first person doing

00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:33.120
this kind of work, you can
rely on the literature, where

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.820
other people have already come
up with some interesting ideas.

00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.210
So they wound up
selecting 94 type

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:42.030
2 diabetes-associated variants.

00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:45.810
So these are the glycemic
traits, fasting insulin,

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:51.390
fasting glucose, et cetera;
things about your body,

00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:54.120
your body mass index, height,
weight, circumference,

00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:57.630
et cetera; lipid levels
of various sorts,

00:59:57.630 --> 01:00:00.390
associations with
different diseases,

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:03.300
coronary artery disease,
renal function, et cetera.

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:09.640
And let me come back to this.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.800
So what they did
is they said, OK,

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.710
here's the way we're
going to model this.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.870
We have an association
matrix that

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:20.220
has 47 traits by
94 genetic factors.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.740
So we make a matrix out of that.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.230
And then they did
something funny.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.850
So they doubled the traits.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:31.830
The technology for
matrix factorization

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:34.890
is called non-negative
matrix factorization.

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:37.320
And since many of
those associations

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.410
were negative, what they
did is, for each trait

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:43.380
that had both positive
and negative values,

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:46.050
they duplicated the column.

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:51.180
They created one column that had
positive associations and one

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:55.260
column that had the negation
of the negative associations

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.740
with zeros everywhere else.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.262
So that's how they
dealt with that problem.

01:00:59.262 --> 01:01:00.720
And then they said,
OK, we're going

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.920
to apply matrix
factorization to factor X

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:10.090
into two matrices, W and H. And
I drew those here on the board.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:12.630
So you have one matrix that--

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:17.070
well, this is your
original 47 by 94 matrix.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:21.570
And the question is, can you
find two smaller matrices that

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:26.640
are 47 by K and K by 94,
that when you multiply these

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.700
together, you get back
some close approximation

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.560
to that matrix.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.620
Now, if you've been
looking at the literature,

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:37.590
there are all kinds of
ideas like auto-encoders.

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:42.000
And these are all basically
the same underlying idea.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.210
It's an unsupervised
method that says,

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:48.330
can we find interesting
patterns in the data

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.820
by doing some kind of
dimension reduction?

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:55.320
And this is one of those methods
for doing dimension reduction.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.120
So what's nice about
this one is that when

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:07.710
they get their W and H,
they predict X from that.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.800
And then they know, of
course, what the error is.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.270
And they say, well, minimizing
that error is our objective.

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.820
So that also lets them
get at the question of,

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.860
what's the right K?

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.750
And that's an important problem.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.820
Because normally
clustering methods

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.980
like hierarchical
clustering, you

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.860
have to specify what
the number of clusters

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.310
is that you're looking for.

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:33.240
And that's hard to do a
priori, whereas this technique

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:38.110
can suggest at least which
one fits the data best.

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:42.450
And so the loss function is
some regularized L2 distance

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:48.450
between the reconstruction, W
times H and X, and some penalty

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:52.470
terms based on the
size of W and H

01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:54.960
coupled by these
relevance weights that--

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.000
you can look at the paper, which
I think I referred to in here

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.590
and I asked you to read.

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:04.050
And then they do give
sampling and a whole bunch

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:08.400
of computational tricks
to speed up the process.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.650
So they got about 17,000 people
from four different studies.

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.580
They're all of
European ancestry.

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:18.660
So there's the usual
generalization problem of,

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:23.620
how do you apply this to people
from other parts of the world?

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:28.600
And they did
individual-level analysis

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.010
of all the individuals with
type 2 diabetes from these.

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:37.060
And the results were that
they found five subtypes--

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:47.800
again, five-- which were
present on 82.3% of iterations.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.200
By the way, total
random aside, there's

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.040
a wonderful video at
Caltech of the woman who

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.660
just made the picture of
the black hole shadow.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.410
And she makes arguments
very much like this.

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:05.830
We tried a whole bunch
of different ways

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:08.500
of coming up with this picture.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.230
And what we decided
was true is whatever

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:14.350
showed up in almost all
of the different methods

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.480
of reconstructing it.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.370
So this is kind of
a similar argument.

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:22.780
And their interpretations,
medically, are that one of them

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:27.000
is involved with variations
in the beta cells.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.240
So these are the cells in your
pancreas that make insulin.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.600
One of them is in
variations in proinsulin,

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.630
which is a predecessor
of insulin that

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:40.660
is under different controls.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:47.620
And then three others have to
do with obesity, bad things

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:52.135
about your lipid metabolism,
and then your liver function.

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:57.170
And if you look
at their results,

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:03.410
the top spider diagrams, so
the way to interpret these

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:08.720
is that the middle
circle, octagon,

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:14.030
the one in the very middle,
is the one with negative data.

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:17.330
The one in between
that and the outside

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.580
is with zero correlation.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.820
And the outside one is
with positive correlation.

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:25.970
And what you see is
that different factors

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:29.850
have different influences
in these different clusters.

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:31.400
So these are the
factors that are

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.330
most informative in figuring out
which cluster somebody belongs

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:36.230
to.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:40.660
And they indeed look
considerably different.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.700
I'm not going to
have you read this.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.470
But it'll be in the slides.

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:46.480
Now, one thing
that's interesting--

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.770
and again, this won't
be on the final exam.

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:52.087
But look at these numbers.

01:05:52.087 --> 01:05:52.795
They're all tiny.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.450
Some of them are hugely
statistically significant.

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:09.490
So DI, whatever that is,
contributes 0.05 units

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:17.260
to having beta-cell type of
this disease at a p-value of 6.6

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.140
times 10 to the minus 37th.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.740
So it's definitely there.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.960
It's definitely an effect.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.920
But it's not a very big effect.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.520
And what strikes me every
time I look at studies

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.840
like this is just how
small those effects are,

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.510
whether you're
predicting some output

01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:39.090
like the level of
insulin in the patient,

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:42.480
or whether you're predicting
something like a category

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.400
membership, as in this table.

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:51.510
So as I said, PheWAS
is a reverse GWAS.

01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:55.650
And the first paper that
introduced the terminology

01:06:55.650 --> 01:07:02.270
was by Josh Denny and colleagues
at Vanderbilt in 2010.

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:07.460
And so they did not quite
a phenome-wide association.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:12.860
But they said, we're going
to take 25,000 samples

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:16.550
from the Vanderbilt
biobank, and we're

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:19.550
going to take the first
6,000 European Americans

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:23.170
with samples, no other
criteria for selection.

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.560
Why European Americans?

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:28.130
Because all the GWAS data
is about European Americans.

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:31.140
So they wanted to be
able to compare to that.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.230
And then they said,
let's pick not

01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:37.920
one SNP but five different
SNPs that we're interested in.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.620
So they picked these,
which are known

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.710
to be associated with
coronary artery disease

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:47.870
and carotid artery stenosis,
atrial fibrillation,

01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:51.890
multiple sclerosis and
lupus, rheumatoid arthritis

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:53.100
and Crohn's disease.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.940
So it's a nice grab-bag
of interesting disease

01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:58.130
associations.

01:07:58.130 --> 01:08:01.130
And then the hard
work they did was

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:04.160
they went through
the tens of thousands

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.690
of different billing
codes that were available.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:16.010
And they, by hand, clustered
them into 744 case groups

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.010
and said, OK, these
are the phenotypes

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:22.130
that we're interested in.

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:25.100
And that data set, by the
way, is still available.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.200
And it's been used by
a lot of other people,

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.310
because nobody wants to
repeat that analysis.

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.279
So now what you see
is something very

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:38.689
similar to what you saw in
GWAS, except here, what we

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:41.359
have is the ICD-9 code group.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:46.069
I guess by the time this got
published, it was up to 1,000.

01:08:46.069 --> 01:08:53.210
And these are the same
kinds of odds ratios

01:08:53.210 --> 01:09:00.439
for the genetic expression
of those markers.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:06.500
And what you find, again, is
that this is the p-equal 0.05.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.130
That's the
Bonferroni-corrected version.

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:13.609
And only multiple
sclerosis comes up

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:17.840
for this particular SNP,
which was one of the ones

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.460
that they expected to come up.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.720
But they were interested to
see what else lights up when

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.729
you do this sort of analysis.

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:30.529
And what they discovered
is that malignant neoplasm

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:34.939
of the rectum, benign
digestive tract neoplasms--

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:39.290
so there's something going on
about cancer that is somehow

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:42.600
related to this
single-nucleotide polymorphism,

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.120
not at a statistically
high enough level,

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.390
but it's still
kind of intriguing

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.370
that there may be some
relationship there.

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:50.120
Yeah?

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.827
AUDIENCE: So is this
data at all public?

01:09:52.827 --> 01:09:54.410
Or is this at one
particular hospital?

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:55.750
Or who has this data?

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:57.033
Would it be combined?

01:09:57.033 --> 01:09:57.950
PETER SZOLOVITS: Yeah.

01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:01.430
I don't believe that you
can get their data unless--

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.690
I think, if--

01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:04.670
I mean, they're pretty
good about collaborating

01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:05.690
with people.

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:11.450
So if you're willing
to become a volunteer

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:15.020
employee at Vanderbilt, they
could probably take you.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.330
But I just made that up.

01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:21.410
But every hospital has
very strong controls.

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:25.340
Now, what is
available is the NCBI

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.490
has GEO, the Gene
Expression Omnibus, which

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.050
has enormous amounts--

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:35.940
like, I think, hundreds of
billions of sample data.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.370
But you don't often know
exactly what the sample is from.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.860
So it comes with
an accession number

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:48.620
and an English description
of what kind of data it is.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.840
And there are actually
lots of papers

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.580
where people have
done natural language

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:56.270
processing on those English
descriptions in order

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:59.270
to try to figure out what
kind of data this is.

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:01.140
And then they can
make use of it.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.230
So you can be clever.

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:04.880
And there's a ton
of data out there,

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.090
but it's not well-curated data.

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:11.700
Now, what's interesting
is you don't always

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.720
get what you expect.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.770
So for example, that
SNP was selected

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:19.680
because it's thought
to be associated

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.370
with multiple
sclerosis and lupus.

01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:28.550
But in reality, the association
with lupus is not significant.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:32.580
Its p-value of 0.5, which
is not very impressive.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.110
The association with multiple
sclerosis is significant.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:40.620
And so they found, in
this particular study,

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:46.190
a couple of things that had been
expected but didn't work out.

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:51.770
So for example, this SNP, which
was associated with coronary

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:56.270
artery disease and thought to
be associated with this carotid

01:11:56.270 --> 01:12:00.590
plaque deposition in your
carotid artery, just isn't.

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:04.460
p-value of 0.82 is
not impressive at all.

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:09.370
OK, onward.

01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:12.070
So that was done for SNPs.

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:14.560
Now, a very popular
idea today is

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.700
to look at expression levels,
partly because of those prices

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:22.390
I showed you where you can
very cheaply get expression

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:24.850
levels from lots of samples.

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:28.060
And so there's this whole notion
of Expression Quantitative

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.570
Trait Loci, or EQTL,
that says, hey,

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:36.160
instead of working as hard
as the Vanderbilt guys did

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.320
to figure out these hundreds
of categories of disease,

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.820
let's just take your
gene expression levels

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:49.960
and use those as defining the
trait that we're interested in.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.530
So now we're looking
at the relationship

01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:57.210
between your genome and
the expression levels.

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:59.700
And so you might say, well,
that ought to be easy.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.300
Because if the gene is there,
it's going to get expressed.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.460
But of course, that's
not telling you

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:09.330
whether the gene is being
activated or repressed

01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:13.680
or enhanced, or whether any
of these other complications

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.080
that I talked about
earlier are present.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.230
And so this is an interesting
empirical question.

01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:26.190
And so people say, well, maybe
a small genetic variation

01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:31.710
will cause different
expression levels of some RNA.

01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:33.450
And we can measure
these, and then

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:36.840
use those to do this
kind of analysis.

01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:45.580
So differential expression
in different populations--

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.650
there is evidence
that, for example,

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:53.290
if you take 16 people
of African descent,

01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:57.970
then 17% of the genes
in a small sample

01:13:57.970 --> 01:14:02.380
of 16 people differ in
their expression level

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.350
among those individuals;
and similarly,

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:15.550
26% in this Asian population and
17% to 29% in a HapMap sample.

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:17.980
Of course, some of
these differences

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.720
may be because of
confounders like environment,

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.670
different tissues, limited
correlation of these expression

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:30.070
levels to disease phenotypes.

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:32.890
Nevertheless, this
type of analysis

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:38.290
has uncovered relationships
between these EQTLs and asthma

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:40.270
and Crohn's disease.

01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:42.517
So I'll let you read
the conclusion of one

01:14:42.517 --> 01:14:43.225
of these studies.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:00.700
So this is saying what I said
before, that we probably know

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.350
all the Mendelian diseases.

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:06.580
So the diseases that we're
interested in understanding

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.670
better today are the ones
that are not Mendelian,

01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:14.530
but they're some complicated
combination of effects

01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:17.770
from different genes.

01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:21.770
And that makes it, of course,
a much harder problem.

01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:27.090
There is an interesting
recent paper--

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:28.360
well, not that recent--

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:35.560
2005-- that uses Bayesian
network technology

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.280
to try to get at this.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.930
And so they say, well, if you
have some quantitative trait

01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.400
locus and you treat the
RNA expression level

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:50.365
as this expression quantitative
trait locus, and then

01:15:50.365 --> 01:15:55.780
you take C as some complex
trait, which might be a disease

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.000
or it might be a
proclivity for something,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.050
or it might be one of
Josh Denny's categories

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.840
or whatever, then
there are a number

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.810
of different Bayesian
network-style models that you

01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:09.190
can build.

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:14.290
So you can say, ah,
the genetic variant

01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:18.820
causes a difference in
gene expression, which

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.580
in turn causes the disease.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.640
Or you could say,
hmm, the genetic trait

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.640
causes the disease,
which in turn causes

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.840
the observable difference
in gene expression.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:38.560
Or you can say that the
genetic variant causes

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.120
both the expression
level and the disease,

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.280
but they're not
necessarily coupled.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.820
So they may be
conditionally independent

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.950
given the genetic variant.

01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:53.380
Or you can have
more complex issues,

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:57.100
like you could have the
gene causing changes

01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:01.000
in expression level of a
whole bunch of different RNA,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.470
which combined
cause some disease.

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:08.530
Or you can have
different genetic changes

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:12.040
all impacting the expression
of some RNA, which

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.870
causes the disease.

01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:17.680
Or-- just wait for it.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.600
Oops.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:26.010
You can have models
like this that say,

01:17:26.010 --> 01:17:28.700
we have some environmental
contributions

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.220
and a bunch of
different genes which

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:37.550
affect the expression of a
bunch of different EQTLs, which

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:40.640
cause a bunch of
clinical traits, which

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.930
cause changes in a bunch
of reactive RNA, which

01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:48.530
cause comorbidities.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.860
So the approach
that they take is

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:57.800
to say, well, we can generate
a large set of hypotheses

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.300
like this, and
then just calculate

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:05.750
the likelihood of the data
given each of these hypotheses.

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:09.680
And whichever one assigns the
greatest likelihood to the data

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.185
is most likely to be the
one that's close to correct.

01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:18.740
So let me just blast through
the rest of this quickly.

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:22.310
Scaling up genome-phenome
association studies--

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:26.630
the UK Biobank is sort of
like this All of Us project.

01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:30.460
But they do make
their data available.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:34.340
All of Us will, also, but it
hasn't been collected yet.

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.455
UK Biobank has
about half a million

01:18:36.455 --> 01:18:41.210
de-identified individuals
with full exome sequencing,

01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:46.520
although they only have about
10% of what they want now.

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:51.110
And many of them will have worn
24-hour activity monitors so

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.760
that we have behavioral data.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.240
Some of them have had
repeat measurements.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.880
They do online questionnaires.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.930
About a fifth of them
will have imaging.

01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:05.730
And it's linked to their
electronic health record.

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:07.490
So we know if they
died or if they

01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:12.230
had cancer or various
hospital episodes, et cetera.

01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:19.640
And there's a website here which
publishes the latest analyses.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.180
And so you see, on April
18, genetic variants that

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:27.050
protect against obesity and
type 2 diabetes discovered,

01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:30.530
moderate with meat-eaters
are at risk of bowel cancer,

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:33.930
and research identifies
genetic causes of poor sleep.

01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:35.690
So this is all over the place.

01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:38.390
But these are all the studies
that are being done by this.

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:42.910
I'll skip this.

01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:46.190
But there's a group here
at MGH and the Broad that

01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:49.730
is using this data
to do, large-scale,

01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:54.860
many, many gene-wide
association studies.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.830
And one of the things
that I promised you,

01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:00.860
which is interesting, is
from these studies, they say,

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:05.370
well, the heritability
of height is pretty good.

01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:10.910
It's about 0.46 with a p-value
of 10 to the minus 109th.

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:14.660
So your height is definitely
determined, in large part,

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.580
by your parents' height.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:18.650
But what's interesting
is that whether you

01:20:18.650 --> 01:20:21.680
get a college degree
or not is determined

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.500
by whether your parents got
a college degree or not.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.440
This is probably not genetic.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:29.540
Or it's only partly genetic.

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:34.850
But it clearly has confounders
us from money and social status

01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:36.770
and various things like that.

01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:40.250
And then what I found
amusing is that even

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:47.000
TV-watching is partly
heritable from your genetics.

01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:55.230
Fortunately, my parents
watch a lot of TV.

01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:57.150
The last thing I
wanted to mention,

01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:59.220
but I'm not going to
have time to get into it,

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.390
is this notion of gene
set enrichment analysis.

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:05.490
It's what I was saying
before, that genes typically

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:08.260
don't act by themselves.

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:11.400
And so if you think back
on high school biology,

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.300
you probably learned
about the Krebs cycle

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:17.170
that powers cellular mechanisms.

01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:19.440
So if you break any
part of that cycle,

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.940
your cells don't
get enough energy.

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:24.570
And so it stands to
reason that if you

01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:27.840
want to understand that
sort of metabolism,

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.510
you shouldn't be looking
at an individual gene.

01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:33.330
But you should be looking
at all of the genes that

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:36.070
are involved in that process.

01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:39.450
And so there have been many
attempts to try to do this.

01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:46.560
The Broad Institute here has
a set of, originally, 1,300

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.710
biologically-defined gene sets.

01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:52.350
So these were ones that
interacted with each other

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:55.750
in controlling some important
mechanism in the body.

01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:58.380
They're now up to 18,000.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:02.190
For example, genes involved
in oxidative phosphorylation

01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:05.790
and muscle tissue show reduced
expression in diabetics,

01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:09.300
although the average decrease
per gene is only 20%.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.040
So they have these sets.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.060
And from those, there
is a very nice technique

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.090
that is able to pull--

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:27.180
it's essentially a
way of strengthening

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:31.710
the gene-wide associations by
allowing you to associate them

01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:33.750
with these sets of genes.

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:36.810
And the approach that
they take is quite clever.

01:22:36.810 --> 01:22:40.930
They say, if we take all
the genes in a gene set

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:45.430
and we order them by their
correlation with whatever trait

01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:49.450
we're interested
in, then the genes

01:22:49.450 --> 01:22:52.420
that are closer to
the beginning of that

01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:54.370
are more likely to be involved.

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:57.970
Because they're the ones that
are most strongly associated.

01:22:57.970 --> 01:23:00.790
And so they have this
random walk process

01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:04.060
that find sort of the
maximum place where

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.640
you can say anything
before that is

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.890
likely to be associated
with the disease

01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:11.080
that you're interested in.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:16.930
And they've had a number of
successes of showing enrichment

01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:22.870
in various diseases and
various biological factors.

01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:26.650
The last thing I want to say
is a little bit disappointing.

01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:30.310
I was just really looking
for the killer paper

01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:32.890
to talk about that
uses some really

01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:36.160
sophisticated deep
learning, machine learning.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.370
And as far as I can tell,
it doesn't exist yet.

01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:45.700
So most of these methods are
based on clustering techniques

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:49.000
on clever ideas,
like the one for gene

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.270
set enrichment analysis.

01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:55.780
But they're not neural
network types of techniques.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:58.540
They're not immensely
sophisticated.

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:02.080
So what you see coming up is
things like Bayesian networks

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.040
and clustering and matrix
factorization and so on, which

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:10.390
sort of sound like 10-, 15-,
20-year-old technologies.

01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:15.770
And I haven't seen examples
yet of the hot off the presses,

01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:19.870
we built a 83-layer
neural network

01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:23.110
that outperforms
these other methods.

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:25.180
I suspect that that's coming.

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:28.630
It just hasn't hit
yet, as far as I know.

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:31.760
If you know of such papers,
by all means, let me know.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.260
All right.

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.050
Thank you.

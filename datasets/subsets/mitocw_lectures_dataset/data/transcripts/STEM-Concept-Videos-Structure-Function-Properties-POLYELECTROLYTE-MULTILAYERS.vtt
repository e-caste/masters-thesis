82% of soldiers in battle suffer from traumatic
limb injuries. Many of these injuries are

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.750
large bone defects. Engineers at MIT are trying
to create materials that mimic the function

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.810
of the bone's natural healing processes. The
structure and properties of these materials

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.559
promote bone regeneration. This video is part
of the Structure-Function-Properties video

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:33.079
series. The structure, function, and properties
of a system are related and depend on the

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.679
processes that define or create the system.
Hi, my name is Nisarg Shah, and I am a graduate

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:44.820
student in Professor Paula Hammond's lab in
the chemical engineering department at MIT.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.999
In the Hammond Lab, we design novel materials
for tissue engineering, gene and drug delivery,

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:56.010
and energy applications. My research in particular,
focuses on developing and assembling different

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.929
materials for bone tissue regeneration.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.930
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with the concepts of pH and pKa,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.000
and with the common chemical functional groups.
After watching this video, you will be able

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.280
to explain how the concepts of pH and pKa
are useful in the design of materials via

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.280
layer-by-layer assembly. Many of the materials
our lab develops are based on a technique

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.740
called layer-by-layer assembly. Layer- by-layer
assembly utilizes electrostatic interactions

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.530
to create layers of chemical species of alternating
charge. These chemical species could be anything

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.530
-- polymers, proteins, small molecules -- the
key is that they have the appropriate positive

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.039
or negative charge to incorporate them into
the film.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.020
We assemble these films using a simple dip
method. First, we take our substrate or surface

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.990
that we wish to coat and bombard it with free
radical oxygen in an instrument called a plasma

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.169
cleaner. This not only cleans the surface
of contaminants, but also leaves the surface

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:17.170
with a negative charge. Next, we take our
substrate and dip it into a solution of positively

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:24.040
charged molecules. The molecules in solution
bind to the substrate because of Coulombic

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.060
interactions.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.219
This process is self-adsorption limited, meaning
that once the newly adsorbed layer neutralizes

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:37.359
the charged sites on the surface, additional
molecules will not bind. This creates layers

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.590
that are on the order of nanometers thick.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.590
After a rinse step to remove any unbound components,
the substrate is dipped into a solution of

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.510
negatively charged molecules. Interactions
with the charges on the previous layer allow

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.329
a new layer to be deposited. Again, we would
rinse to remove any unbound components. We

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.829
can continue this process and dip our growing
film into solutions of positively and negatively

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.829
charged molecules, with rinse steps in between,
building up our coating layer-by-layer. Many

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.980
of the films I work with have on the order
of 40 layers. We use polymers in many of our

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.620
layers. These long chain, high molecular weight
molecules form more stable layers than small

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.900
molecules. The long polymer chains from one
layer weave through other layers creating

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.819
an interlocking structure. Also, because we
use negatively and positively charged polymers

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.819
in these layers, the polymers ionically crosslink,
adding to the stability of the overall film.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.430
Polymers whose repeating unit contains a charged
group are called polyelectrolytes. Thus, many

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.150
people refer to the films that we create as
polyelectrolyte multilayers. For every polymer

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.150
or small molecule I incorporate into my layer-by-layer
assembly, I have to be mindful of it's pKa

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.889
and select appropriate assembly conditions
to ensure they have the desired charge. For

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:18.660
example, one of the polymers that I use in
a layer-by-layer assembly is polyacrylic acid.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.620
You don't need to worry about it's exact chemical
structure. The important thing to note is

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.870
the repeating carboxylic acid group. Another
polymer that I use in my layer-by-layer assembly

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.389
contains repeating amine groups. Let's say
I'm creating my layer-by-layer assembly at

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.389
a pH equal to 4. If the pKa of the carboxylic
acid groups on our first polymer is approximately

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.470
4.5, and the pKa of the amine groups on our
second polymer is approximately 6.5, what

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.330
would the charge on each of these polymers
be? Pause the video and take a moment to think

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.330
about it. At a pH of 4, some of the carboxylic
acid groups on our first polymer would be

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:14.539
deprotonated, resulting in a negative charge.
At the same pH, some of the amine groups on

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:21.539
our second polymer pick up an extra hydrogen,
resulting in a positive charge. Because so

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.970
many molecules could be viable candidates
for incorporation into these films, they are

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.039
being used in a wide variety of applications.
My main interest is using these films in tissue

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.810
engineering applications.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.060
So, first I have to ask myself, what problem
do I want to solve? Then, I have to ask myself

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.550
how these multilayer films could be useful.
What function do they need to have? What properties

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.000
of the film would help to achieve that function?
Taking all of this into account, how should

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.409
I structure my film?

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.770
One of the problems I became particularly
interested in is that of large bone defects.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.479
Large bone defects are large gaps in the bone
that result from trauma.

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.860
Although bone is capable of regeneration,
when there are large defects, some sort of

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.639
intervention therapy is needed to bridge the
defect for proper healing.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.389
These intervention therapies typically involve
taking bone tissue either from another location

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:31.060
in the patient's body or from a deceased donor
source and grafting it into the defect site.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.720
While bone taken from the patient may be immune
compatible and be more viable, this method

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.729
has limitations. Tissue injury and trauma
at the site of bone removal causes patients

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:48.650
pain and long healing times. Bone tissue from
a deceased donor may cause an unfavorable

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.490
immune response. The processes used to prepare
these tissues for implantation may also compromise

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.219
their mechanical properties.

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.949
Our lab had an idea for a possible solution
to this problem. We asked ourselves, can we

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:01.800
design a scaffold to bridge these large defects
that will stimulate the growth of new bone

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.979
tissue? The idea was to create a rigid, porous
scaffold coated with a multilayer film. The

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:12.530
multilayer film would deliver biological molecules
that would stimulate the growth of bone both

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:18.060
on the surface and throughout the scaffold.
Over time, the scaffold would slowly degrade,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:24.300
leaving the new bone tissue behind. In selecting
components for both the scaffold and these

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.610
films, we looked to the biological process
of wound healing for inspiration. The idea

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.530
was that if we could mimic the wound healing
process in bone, we could potentially regenerate

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.229
tissue that is mechanically and chemically
identical to native bone tissue.

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:46.770
The bulk of our scaffold consisted of a polymer
that would slowly degrade when placed in the

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:52.610
body. This polymer was mixed with calcium
phosphate, a significant component of native

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:58.610
bone. Our thought was that calcium phosphate
would promote the attachment, growth, and

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.840
migration of cells that produce bone tissue
within the scaffold.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.289
We then used layer-by-layer assembly to create
a multilayered film on the surface of the

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:13.560
scaffold. The film contained layers of polymers
and layers of biological molecules that we

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.240
wanted to release into the defect site. One
of the molecules was a protein called bone

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.749
morphogenetic protein-2. This protein is a
growth factor that stimulates mesenchymal

00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:30.479
stem cells from the bone marrow to transform
into bone tissue producing cells.

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:35.000
The biodegradable properties of the polymers
we used in the film would help to release

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.570
the protein into the surrounding tissue when
the scaffold is implanted.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.510
In addition to identifying molecules that
would give us the function and properties

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:49.980
that we desired, we had to choose an assembly
pH that would ensure they had the desired

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.180
charge.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:00.540
To test our hypothesis that these materials
would lead to bone growth, we implanted our

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.440
coated scaffold into a rat quadriceps muscle.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.639
In this model, the scaffold was placed in
a location where bone is not normally found,

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:15.180
so that we would know that any bone created
on the scaffold was due to the coating.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.750
Our experiments were successful in that we
saw the deposition of bone minerals and collagen

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:26.800
on our scaffolds within 4 weeks. Of course,
there are more experiments to be done to see

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.550
if this system will work in the same way in
a large defect site.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.829
The main lesson I learned in these experiments
was that for bone tissue regeneration to occur,

00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:43.450
my multilayer-coated scaffolds needed to provide
two key functions: to encourage bone producing

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:50.450
cells to attach, migrate through, and deposit
tissue in the scaffold; and to encourage mesenchymal

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.760
stem cells to transform into bone producing
cells.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:08.290
In this video, we hope that you saw how general
chemistry concepts such as pH and pKa continue

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:22.060
to be useful beyond the classroom and into
research settings. Here, we saw how we need

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:28.440
We also saw how considering the desired function
and properties of a material can help us rationally

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:35.440
design its structure.

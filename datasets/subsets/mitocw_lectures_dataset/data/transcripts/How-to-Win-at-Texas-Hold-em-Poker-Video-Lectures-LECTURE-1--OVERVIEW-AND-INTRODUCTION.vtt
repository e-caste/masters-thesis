00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:21.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.785
So let's get started.

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:24.340
So before I get into
any poker I want

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.890
to talk about the
mentality I want everyone

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.830
to try to have when analyzing
poker in this class.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.900
So I call it the
decision mentality.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.070
I'm going to start with a story.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.800
Who here has heard of
credit card roulette?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.190
It's like a game you play
at the end of a guy going

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.090
to restaurants.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.910
So what happens
is poker players,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.242
they're going to split
the bill by instead

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:46.450
of everyone paying their
own bill, which is annoying.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.231
You have to keep track.

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:50.480
You might have to Venmo
people after the exact amount.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.810
And sometimes the
waiter or waitress

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.040
doesn't want to split
the bill per person.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.180
So poker players get around
this by just picking one person

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.800
at random to pay the bill.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.240
And we like making
this exciting.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.930
So what we do is we ask everyone
to put in their credit cards.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.060
And then we pull out the
credit cards one at a time.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.450
And if your credit card is
pulled out then you're safe.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.630
And the last person in has
to pay for the whole table.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.619
So it's a pretty fun game.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.910
Yeah, I think I'm pretty lucky.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.970
The biggest one I
lost was in Hong Kong.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.980
I once had to pay
around 1,200 USD.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.720
It was a pretty big table.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.820
But overall I'm pretty
good at this game.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.180
It's a game of skill for sure.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.320
But sometimes this results
in some funny stories

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.820
with non poker players.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.860
So this is something that
happened to some poker players.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.600
So poker pro Matt, he goes to
dinner with poker pro Steven.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.350
And that brings Emily, who's
a close friend whom he also

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.980
has a romantic interest in.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.990
So when the bill
comes Matt's like OK,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.460
I'm going to pay for it Emily.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.960
So he puts in two credit cards.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.110
He's like the second credit card
is for Steven-- is for Emily.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.640
And then Steven
pays for himself.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.920
So Stephen puts in
one credit card.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.900
So they play credit
card roulette.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.330
And then Matt, being
a very lucky guy,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.700
pulls out both of his credit
cards before Steven's.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.690
And Steven ends up paying
for all three of them.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.640
So now the question is,
who should Emily thank.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.900
So who would you thank if
you were in Emily's shoes?

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.112
Does anyone want to
say to thank Steven?

00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:23.792
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:26.000
PROFESSOR: Because Steven
actually paid for the meal.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.690
So I think it's a
totally reasonable thing

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.440
to do as a reasonable person
to thank Steven who actually

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.016
had to pull out his wallet.

00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:35.390
So in this class
we want everyone

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.840
to think in terms of the
expected results and not

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.980
actual results.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.190
So Emily should be thanking
Matt because, on average, Matt

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.540
put in the card for Emily.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.050
And on average Matt is
going to be paying for Emily

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.450
because Matt's
going to be paying

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.370
the one third of the time
that Emily would be paying.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.370
But at the time, Emily
thanked Steven for her meal

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.670
and then didn't say
anything to Matt.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.180
And then Matt was upset about
it and told the entire poker

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.680
community.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.346
That's how I found
out about this story.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.730
So we want to think about
in terms of on average

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.570
what your decision
would have whether you

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.430
would have made money in
expectation or on average.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.350
So roughly, the law
of large numbers

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.680
says, over your
lifetime, the amount

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.970
you end up paying for
credit card roulette is

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.310
the same as you would have
paid from splitting the bill.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.602
So you know why split the bill?

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.309
You might as well just
save a lot of time

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.280
by playing this fun
game every single time.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.900
And over your
lifetime, the amount

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.280
you pay in credit card
roulette is roughly

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.750
going to be what you would
have paid from splitting.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.120
So all randomness
eventually averages out

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.560
to it's expected value.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.750
That's what this is saying.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.520
So what does eventually mean?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.434
So basically when we say
a gamble is very risky

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:47.350
I'm not mathematically
defining anything here.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.350
But I just want to throw
out some intuitive concepts.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.450
So a risky gamble
is a gamble where

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.470
it takes a long time to
converge at your expectation.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.630
But the point is, no matter
how risky it is, eventually

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.060
it will get you.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.449
So there's a saying
that death, taxes

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.240
are the two things that
eventually get you.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.365
As poker players, we would
like to think that three

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:08.660
things eventually get you.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.420
It's death, taxes, and
the law of large numbers

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.260
will eventually-- you're going
to reach your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.930
So here's another
hypothetical situation.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.310
So let's say you get off
at the wrong bus stop

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.781
because you were distracted.

00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:24.280
And then you were
upset yourself you

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.200
analyze how to not be
distracted in the future

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.670
and get off at the
right bus stop.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.520
But then after you get
off at the wrong bus stop

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.560
you find $1,000 on the ground.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.720
And then you immediately,
you're no longer upset

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.550
and you marvel at your riches.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.280
So this is sort of
an absurd story.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.100
But situations like this
happen all the time in poker.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.640
You're going to
make a bad decision

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.720
but bad decisions still get a
good result 49% of the time.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.700
And if you make
the right decision

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.830
you're still going to get a
bad result 49% of the time.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.420
So it's very important
to analyze your decisions

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.780
without being biased by the
actual outcome that occurred.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.510
So you really want
to be obsessed

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.140
with this self-improvement,
analyzing your decisions.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.270
If you made $10,000
in a situation

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.600
where you could have be $12,000
then that's not good enough.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.430
So I want everybody
to think in terms

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.585
of what's the maximum
you could of made

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:19.960
and analyzing what's the best
decision you could possibly

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.010
have made in every situation.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.819
And sometimes it's hard because
if the result is exactly

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.360
correlated with the
decision then you

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.830
can just go back and
look at the result

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.900
and know whether you made
a good decision or not.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.210
But that's why learning
poker can sometimes

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.570
be very, very hard because you
don't have immediate feedback.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.100
You're not sure whether
the decision you made

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.060
is what caused you to make that
money or you just got lucky.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.850
So with that being
said, now let's

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.880
talk about some ways to
reason about poker hands.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.380
So roughly there's three levels
of reasoning of poker hands.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.650
Level one my hand
versus your hand.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.640
But by this I mean, you can
see what your cards are.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.070
And you look into
your opponents eyes

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.210
and you say, OK, I can tell
your cards must be pocket kings

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.050
or whatever.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.880
Your hand must beat
this other hand.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.790
And you played your hand
exactly against your opponent's

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.990
specific hand because you
have a soul read on them.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.570
So let's see the
example of this.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.360
So we'll watch an episode
of Poker After Dark here.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.695
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:26.695 --> 00:06:28.570
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:42.478
- Raise to 1,200.

00:06:42.478 --> 00:06:44.933
- I think you would call
it this time, Patrick.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.930
- Button raises.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.854
Never anything.

00:06:50.854 --> 00:06:52.270
NARRATOR: Contrary
to what Patrick

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.780
might think Jennifer has a real
hand and it just got better.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.340
She's flopped top set.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.390
Patrick flopped a pair of tens
with a gutshot straight draw.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.544
- I've got two pair.

00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:39.813
- Check.

00:07:53.188 --> 00:07:53.729
- Full house.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.906
- I can't beat that.

00:08:03.906 --> 00:08:05.510
- I thought you
had pocket kings.

00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:12.000
- I almost thought I had you.

00:08:16.383 --> 00:08:23.076
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:23.076 --> 00:08:24.700
PROFESSOR: So yes,
this is sort of well

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.926
known poker term from
way that in the day.

00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:28.300
If you're a Jennifer
Tilly hand--

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.160
I'm sorry if I'm
making fun of her--

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.000
but basically she put her
opponent on a specific hand.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.039
She looked at
Patrick and Antonius

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.539
and had a feeling
that he had pocket

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.460
kings for some strange reason.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.720
And then what happened was,
so she had pocket jacks here,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.220
which is a really,
really good hand.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:44.980
It's a full house.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.580
And she just checked the
turn and checked the river

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.860
instead of trying to
get Patrick to put

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.800
more money in because she
was so certain Patrick

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.900
had pocket kings.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.640
Just mathematically
speaking, out of all

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.040
the possible combinations
of cards you have,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.750
to put your opponent
specifically

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.810
on pocket kings in this
example is basically unfounded.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.140
So this gets to
level two reasoning.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.590
So level two
reasoning is my hand

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.560
versus your range of hands,
versus your probability

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.940
distribution of hands.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.730
And another name for this
is exploitative play.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.211
So let's look at
a different hand.

00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:21.835
And I'm going to show
you how to reason

00:09:21.835 --> 00:09:27.074
about this hand using level
two exploitative reasoning.

00:09:27.074 --> 00:09:28.990
So I'm not going to go
through the whole hand.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.960
But this is actually a real
hand I played in Macau five,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.890
six years ago.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.400
So we get to the river and I
had ace 10 in this situation.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.020
So the pot is 21,000 roughly.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.220
And my opponent
bets 8,000-- sorry,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.440
so the pot is 21,000 after
my opponent bets 8,000.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.740
So basically the pot was
13,000 and my opponent

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.939
bet 8,000 making it 21,000.

00:09:52.939 --> 00:09:55.480
And I have to decide whether to
call with a pretty good hand.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.680
I have a pair of aces here.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.290
But I know my opponent is
[? Rain ?] [? Kahn, ?] who is

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.840
a very tight player and
doesn't really like bluffing.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.600
So I don't think he's
really ever bluffing.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.480
If I'm beating him
here it's because he's

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.880
betting a hand that
he thinks is good

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.320
but is actually worse than
mine, like ace eight basically.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.106
So I model my opponent's range
as ace king through ace eight.

00:10:18.106 --> 00:10:19.980
I don't think he has
something even stronger,

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.896
like pocket nines because
he would have raised

00:10:21.896 --> 00:10:25.870
more earlier in the hand.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.090
So let me run through
this calculation

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.890
slowly for those of you seeing
pot odd for the first time.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.830
So here basically, I want
to think of it like this.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:39.370
The pot, which includes the
8,000 he just put out, is 21.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.257
We're considering calling for
8,000 so if we lose, if we call

00:10:43.257 --> 00:10:45.340
and her turns up ace king,
which is a better hand,

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.090
then our net result from this
decision is negative $8,000.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.880
If we win and we get our 8,000
back as well as the 21,000

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.470
in the pot, so we make,
our net is plus 21,000.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.110
So therefore, our
win to lose ratio

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.720
needs to be at least
8,000 to 21,000 in order

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.460
for calling to be
positive expectancy.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.645
So we'll do the
exact calculation.

00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:08.020
I'll try to do it
somewhat slowly

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.390
to show an example of how
to do this calculation.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:15.850
So essentially what I do
is I count the combinations

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.550
of each hand that exists.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.490
So ace king, there's
eight combinations

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.106
because there's two aces
remaining that I haven't seen

00:11:24.106 --> 00:11:25.480
and there's four
kings remaining.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.740
So it's two times four,
there's eight combinations.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.580
Same with ace queen,
ace jack, and ace eight.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.400
Ace 10 and ace nine, there's
only six combinations each

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.780
because I have the
10, which makes

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.140
him having ace 10 less likely.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.360
And for ace nine there's
a nine on the board.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.870
So ace nine is also
slightly less likely.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.640
So ace 10 we actually
get half the pot.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.930
So I'm just going
to roughly make

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.480
that equivalent to us
winning three of those times

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.230
and losing three of
those times, which

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.600
is equivalent in expectation.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.880
So basically, if you
do this counting,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.750
there's 33 combinations
that beat us,

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.850
there's 11 combinations
that we beat.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.155
And so our equity is
basically our probability

00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:09.280
of winning, which is
equivalently only the fraction

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.380
of the pot that we own.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.110
So our equity in
this case is 25%.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.190
And the pot odds are 21 to 8.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:22.650
So we need we
basically 1 over 3.56.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.180
So 21 to 8 is 2.56 to 1.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.355
We need equity 1 over 3.56
to call, which is 28%,

00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:29.980
which we don't.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.670
So I folded.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.205
So unfortunately, this
calculation is a bit ugly.

00:12:40.205 --> 00:12:41.330
You just have to do
it a bunch of times

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.788
and convince yourself that are
doing the right calculation.

00:12:43.788 --> 00:12:46.610
Basically you got to remember to
add one when you're converting

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.560
the odds ratio to an equity.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.410
So it should be
fairly simple math.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.870
So in this case,
I folded because I

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.309
didn't have the desired.

00:12:58.309 --> 00:12:59.850
So is there any
questions about that?

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.080
That was maybe a bit confusing
but I don't know of a great way

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.750
to show the exact conversion
from pot odds into equity.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.560
But I just want to
point out that they're

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.020
slightly different.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.260
One is a ratio of when to
lose and one is basically

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.160
a fraction of win over
all possible outcomes.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.650
So just don't get
confused by this.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.566
That's all I'm saying.

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:23.150
I'm going to quickly
interchange between the two

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.090
throughout the course.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.720
And you should try to get in the
habit of being able to quickly

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.761
complete between the two.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.870
So this is an example
of level two reasoning.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.800
And hand reading is about using
your opponent's past actions

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.720
and your knowledge
of their tendencies

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.510
to tweak your probability
distribution of over what

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.710
you think their hand is.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.130
So hand reading is not
about pegging your opponent

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.550
on a specific hand.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.730
It's a marketing message.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.290
Poker players, they
wear sunglasses,

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.130
they have earplugs to prevent
people from reading their soul.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.980
It matters a bit, but
really, these things, things

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.200
like I scratched my
ear before I raised,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.780
it should affect your belief
about my cards a very small

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.460
amount, way less than what
Lady Gaga and the media

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.450
makes it seem like.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.080
That's how you reason about
a hand exploitatively.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.600
You build a model for
how your opponent behaves

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.480
and you make the decision that's
the most positive expectancy

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.860
against that model.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.860
And you can go very, very
far with level two reasoning.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.830
You can basically build a career
out of level two reasoning.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.550
And it's best targeted
towards individual opponents

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.140
with specific
tendencies that you're

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.589
trying to take advantage of.

00:14:35.589 --> 00:14:36.630
So this sounds very good.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.490
This sounds like a
great way to play poker.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.980
I figured out what my
opponent's doing right.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.912
I just figured out the
probability distribution

00:14:45.912 --> 00:14:47.870
and play in a way make
the most money from him.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:56.070
So does anyone have any problems
with this type of reasoning?

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.530
So I've got some $20
Amazon gift certificates

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.160
from [? Acuma ?] Capital.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.000
Someone can point out
potentially something

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.520
you don't like about
this type of reasoning

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.162
I'll give you this
gift certificate.

00:15:09.162 --> 00:15:10.870
AUDIENCE: You reveal
a lot of information

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.010
about what your hand is
when you think like this.

00:15:16.562 --> 00:15:17.270
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.150
But what if your model
incorporates the fact

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.300
that they are going to behave
based on what they think

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.030
is in your hand.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.930
Yeah.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.430
AUDIENCE: It might take you a
long time to build this model.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.430
And if the players leave
your table, or whatever,

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.430
you spent like-- because
before you have a model

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.870
you can't use this
line of reasoning.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.719
So it's expensive to do it.

00:15:39.719 --> 00:15:41.010
PROFESSOR: That's a good point.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.040
So first of all, level
two reasoning is not easy.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.190
Even though it has flaws, even
playing very good level two,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.210
poker is not easy.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.880
Building the model can be very
hard and you could be wrong.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.970
But that's not really
what I'm looking for.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.248
Colin, yeah.

00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:59.890
AUDIENCE: Because if your
opponent knows your reasoning

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.120
then he could maybe bet a
certain way to push it to 28%,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.922
where you'd only call if it's--

00:16:06.922 --> 00:16:07.630
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.129
OK.

00:16:08.129 --> 00:16:09.840
Yeah.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.090
I think that's be good enough.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.381
I' going to give a certificate.

00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:15.420
I'll give it to you at the end.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.190
So essentially,
the problem is it's

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.352
this assumption-- the
fatal flaw in every plan

00:16:21.352 --> 00:16:23.560
is the assumption that you
know more than your enemy.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.560
Does anyone know where
this is from, by the way?

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.200
If you do I'll have another
$20 gift certificate.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.660
Does anyone know where
this phrase is from?

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.160
Yeah.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.788
AUDIENCE: Is it from Kasowitz?

00:16:32.788 --> 00:16:33.371
PROFESSOR: No.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.460
Yeah.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.250
AUDIENCE: The Art of War?

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.409
PROFESSOR: No.

00:16:41.409 --> 00:16:41.950
No one knows.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.575
I'm going to keep
the gift certificate.

00:16:43.575 --> 00:16:45.980
That's OK.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.620
So essentially, the problem
with this line of reasoning

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.360
is your opponent does
not play according

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.380
to a fixed, static algorithm.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.030
They're also an
intelligent human

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.140
who's taking this class who's
building all this for you

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.690
and adapting the
strategy to beat you.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.290
So if you assume your opponent
plays with a fixed strategy,

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.910
but what if they're
doing the same for you?

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.510
Now I'm going to get to the
third level of reasoning,

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.520
which I call optimal play.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.069
So let's analyze the exact
same hand using level three

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.569
reasoning.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.200
So don't get me wrong.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.540
Level two reasoning is great.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.609
If you can do level
two reasoning very well

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.099
you can make a ton of money.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.839
But level three reasoning is
a completely different way

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:28.430
to analyze this hand that can
also make you a lot of money.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.300
So level three reasoning I'm
going to think like this.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.570
Level three is my range of
hands over your range of hands.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.180
So instead of looking
at my specific cards

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.000
and figuring out
what my cards are,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.430
I'm actually going to also
put a probability distribution

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.630
over myself and myself, to
my opponent's eyes, what

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.540
is the probability
distribution of my hands?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.730
And in this specific
spot, let's just say,

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.410
I decide that my
range in this spot

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.210
is ace jack through ace seven.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.330
So not including ace nine.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.300
It's basically ace 10,
ace eight, ace seven.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.360
So this is the way to
do the calculation.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.650
So let's just assume I know
my opponent's propensity

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:13.870
to bet 1 over 1.6% of
the pot on the river.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.050
So the pot was
13,000 on the river

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:21.630
and I know that my opponent's
going to bet 8,000.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.302
So I must call with
the frequency such

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:26.240
that their EV from
bluffing is zero.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.350
So that's essentially my
goal with optimal play.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.970
So essentially
what I'm saying is,

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.560
let's say they have
a really bad hand.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.570
They have like jack 10
for jack high, which

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.620
is almost certainly going to
lose the pot if they don't

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.870
bet to try to get me to fold.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.840
Then I want to call
with the frequency

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.180
such that with those
hands, regardless

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.880
of whether they bluff,
their expectation is zero.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.170
So how do I do that?

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.990
I just make my call to
fold ratio 1.6 to 1.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.620
Sorry, in all
these computations,

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.800
to make it easier,
I'm assuming 1.6

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.900
is approximate for the ratio.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.520
It's actually 13 over 8.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.920
It actually turned out to
be mostly Fibonacci numbers

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.890
so the ratio is around
1.6 to 1 for all of them.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.170
So my call to fold ratio
needs to be 1.6 to 1

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.840
so that if they
have that a bad hand

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.710
their expectation
from bluffing is zero.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.810
It doesn't matter
whether they bluff.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.020
So if I do this calculation
then ace 10-- sorry,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.710
there's a typo--
ace 10 is definitely

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:37.020
in the top 61.5% of hands I
can have so I need to call.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.660
So I'm not building a
probability model for them.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.050
What I'm essentially saying is,
if I'm not calling ace 10 here

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.530
then they can exploit
me by bluffing too much

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.420
and I'm just folding
all my hands here.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.180
And they're going to be able
to make money off of me.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.000
To prevent this I must
call ace 10, which

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.700
is a 61.5 percentile
hand in my range,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.590
so they can't exploit me.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.450
So I'm going to make
an analogy with RPS.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.950
Rock, paper, scissors,
does everyone

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.074
know how to play this game?

00:20:05.074 --> 00:20:08.180
So you either throw a
rock, scissors, or paper.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.359
So there's no way that you
would not know this game.

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:12.650
I know people, if you grew
up in a different background

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.640
you might call it
something else or you

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.960
might have different rules.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.080
But the rules I'm playing
with is rock beats scissors,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.230
scissors beats paper,
and paper beats rock.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.137
So exploitative play
you think like this.

00:20:25.137 --> 00:20:26.720
You say, since my
opponent just played

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.980
rock three times
in a row I think

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.750
they're probably not
going to play a rock

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.010
a fourth time in a row.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.830
So I'm going to play
scissors because I

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.677
know I can't be beaten.

00:20:35.677 --> 00:20:37.510
Optimal play just says
I'm going to memorize

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.390
a sequence of random
bits and always play

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.530
each a rock, paper, and
scissors with probably a third.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.070
So this is an analogy with
rock, paper, scissors.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.090
So one question I often get it
is, if when you play optimally

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.480
you're making all
your opponent's

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.882
decisions the same then your
opponent essentially is never

00:20:53.882 --> 00:20:55.340
making a mistake
because regardless

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.430
of what they do it's the same.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.539
Then how do you make
money playing optimally?

00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:01.080
In rock, paper,
scissors that's true.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.632
If my strategy is just
play rock, paper, scissors,

00:21:03.632 --> 00:21:05.090
each with a
probability a third I'm

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.690
never going to beat you
more often than I should.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.420
But in poker there's
enough opportunities

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.220
to essentially be inconsistent.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.550
For example,
sometimes you will see

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:21.922
players fold seven six suited
and then, because later they're

00:21:21.922 --> 00:21:23.630
bored and feel like
playing a worse hand,

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.530
they'll call six five suited in
the exact same situation, which

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.160
is like basically making a
strictly dominated strategy.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.380
Or like check raising a
circling theory range.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.630
Essentially, a theoretical
optimal strategy you

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.010
will still extract money slowly
from even the best players.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.132
Because even the best
players in poker right now,

00:21:41.132 --> 00:21:43.090
there's going to be slight
inconsistencies that

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.360
are not theoretically optimal.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.975
So the optimal strategy,
another way to think about it

00:21:50.975 --> 00:21:53.100
is a Nash equilibrium, if
you've heard of the term.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.480
Because the best response
to the optimal strategy

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.480
is the optimal strategy itself.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.990
Whereas the best response
to any exploitative strategy

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.500
is going to be a
different strategy.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.580
Whenever you play an
exploitative strategy

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.300
you stand to bee beating
by a different exploitive

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.380
strategy that re-exploits you.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.150
This is a defense optimal plays.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.390
We play each with
the same probability.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.290
Optimal play you're indifferent
to your opponent's move.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.690
So optimal play, you're
making a lot of money

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.300
when your opponent does
something strictly suboptimal.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.000
Whereas in exploitative
play you make a lot of money

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.530
when you're winning
the mind games

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.321
and you lose a lot when
you're losing them.

00:22:30.321 --> 00:22:32.667
So exploitative play
is sort of like I

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:35.250
know that you know that I know
that you know that I know this.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.333
But you know that I know
that you know that I know

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:38.630
that you know that I know this.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.880
You get into these mind games.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.056
And if you're good at them
then it's pretty good.

00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:43.680
If you're playing
rock, paper, scissors

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.680
against a four-year-old
child, probably you

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.936
don't want to play optimally.

00:22:47.936 --> 00:22:49.560
Probably you want to
look at their face

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.268
and try and figure
out what they're going

00:22:51.268 --> 00:22:53.400
to do and try to beat them.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.110
But if you're
playing rock, paper,

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.140
scissors against the rock,
paper, scissors world champion,

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.302
which there is one
actually, then probably

00:23:01.302 --> 00:23:03.510
you just want to memorize
the sequence of random bits

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.930
and play each
probability a third.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.330
So another good thing
about exploitative play

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.790
is it's intuitive.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.610
We sort of grew up thinking
in terms of exploitative play.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.370
I think that's a fair statement.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.770
In most things it's like what
do you think might happen?

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.260
OK, if that might
happen, OK, I'll do this.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.740
But optimal play is sort
of a weird mentality thing

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.210
because it's sort
of like I'm just

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.750
going to analyze what my
opponent could potentially do.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.580
So you need an
opponent essentially.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.360
And then I'm just
going to perform

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.830
an action that makes it so
that my opponent can't really

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.707
beat me.

00:23:39.707 --> 00:23:41.790
So that's enough about
those two general concepts.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.620
I'm going to take a short
break right here since it's

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.330
good timing.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:48.570
So I'm going to continue and
we'll get in some actual poker.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:52.120
But first we're going
to play one last game.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.620
We're going to play a
game called Who's Taller?

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.740
Anyone can join the
content for a dollar.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.847
We're not actually having this
so don't get out your wallets.

00:24:00.847 --> 00:24:02.430
And then the tallest
person who joined

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.920
the game gets the entire pot.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.812
So all the people
who join the game,

00:24:05.812 --> 00:24:07.520
we're going to measure
who's the tallest,

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.605
and then that person
gets everyone's money.

00:24:09.605 --> 00:24:10.480
So again, let's play.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.270
So everyone, close your eyes
so that you can't look in here.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.450
Everyone close your eyes.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.260
No peeking.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.950
No peeking at how tall--

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.980
So I want everyone--
close your eyes.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.890
Is everyone's eyes closed?

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:25.020
So put up your hand if you
want to join the contest.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.679
Put it nice and high so
that I can see if you

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:28.720
want to join the content.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.495
So raise your hand high.

00:24:32.495 --> 00:24:33.050
It's OK.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:33.800
There's no embarrassment.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.420
The whole point of
poker is where--

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.300
OK, cool.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.070
So now everyone open your eyes.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.680
So I think five people joined.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.120
So you guys come down here.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.270
Let's see who-- [LAUGHTER]
Let's see who won the pot.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:49.795
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:50.670
PROFESSOR: That's OK.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.355
It's totally OK if you lost.

00:24:54.355 --> 00:24:55.480
So I think the four of you.

00:25:02.088 --> 00:25:03.102
Sorry, what's your name?

00:25:03.102 --> 00:25:03.810
AUDIENCE: Justin.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.060
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:04.559
Justin.

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.180
So I think Justin voted one.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.000
So good job Justin,
you would have made $3.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.681
All right.

00:25:10.681 --> 00:25:11.180
Cool.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.620
So what's the
point of this game?

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.750
The point of this
game is so from a game

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.444
theoretic point of
view no one really

00:25:20.444 --> 00:25:21.610
should be playing this game.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:26.830
So this is only known as the
k-beauty game from game theory.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.139
So how tall are you Justin?

00:25:28.139 --> 00:25:28.680
JUSTIN: 6'5".

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.950
PROFESSOR: 6'5".

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.649
So why did you play the game?

00:25:31.649 --> 00:25:33.940
Because he thought there's
probably someone who's going

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:38.830
to be 6'2" who might
play the game, right?

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.320
But if everyone knew that
if you're only 6'2" you

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.611
shouldn't be playing this
game because someone might be

00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:46.630
6'5" then you wouldn't play the
game because someone else is

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.850
only going to play the
game if they were like

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.270
6'8" or something.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.490
So let's say we
played this again.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.730
Probably only Justin would play.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.310
Eventually this always
devolves into a situation

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.180
where basically no
one is going to join.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.180
Because you know that no
matter-- even if you're

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.580
like seven feet tall,
you're LeBron James,

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.199
you would know that
someone would only

00:26:09.199 --> 00:26:11.740
played this game if they were
the tallest person in the world

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.770
essentially.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.430
So basically poker
without blinds,

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.710
which is the money
that's put into the pot

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.260
at the start of every
hand, would essentially

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.910
be like Who's Taller game.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.940
So when you play poker you want
the motivation of every hand

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.590
to be stealing the
blinds, stealing

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.780
the money that was
forced into the pot

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.742
without the choice
of the person.

00:26:30.742 --> 00:26:32.200
So you would always
fold king king,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.450
which is the second best
hand in poker pre-flop,

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.480
if there were no blinds.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.310
Suppose we were to play
Who's Taller again.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.720
But I told you that I'm going
to force Lee Marie to play.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.710
OK So now we've got
a game because now,

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.770
even if you're not sure
whether you're the tallest

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.334
person in the room, if
you're taller then Lee Marie

00:26:54.334 --> 00:26:55.750
then you have a
chance of winning.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.744
So that's essentially why we
need blinds to have a game.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.450
So you always want to
think how many chips you

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.150
have in terms of the blinds.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:14.710
So having $400 in front of you
in a game where the blinds are

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.890
$1 or $2, for our purposes,
is equivalent to having

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.890
$4,000 in front of
you in a game where

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.690
the blinds are $10 and $20.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.260
Because essentially,
everything you're wagering

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.290
is relative to stealing
the blinds that were forced

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:30.740
into the game at the beginning.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.620
So in both of
these situations we

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:37.180
say that you have 200 bets,
or 200 big blinds, or 200 BB.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.580
So that's how to
calculate your stack size.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.400
But what's actually
important isn't stack size

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.770
it's effective stack size.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.470
So effective stack
size takes into account

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:54.730
the stack sizes of the people
remaining in the pot as well.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.330
So I'll give an example.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.400
So in this case, we're the
player with the ace jack.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.890
And we decided to go all in.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.390
So what is our exact stack size?

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.320
The big blinds is 2,000,
the small blind is 1,000.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.800
And we wagered in total 42,000.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.485
So what's our stack size?

00:28:20.485 --> 00:28:22.360
AUDIENCE: 20--

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.830
PROFESSOR: 21, right.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.995
It's around 21.

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:26.740
It's around 21 big blinds.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.850
But we didn't really risk
21 big blinds here, did we?

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.520
Can someone-- OK, I'll give
a $20 gift certificate.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.430
How much did we actually
risk in some sense.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.895
Yeah.

00:28:38.895 --> 00:28:40.270
AUDIENCE: I can't
see quite well,

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.670
but I think 12 and
one half big blinds?

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.660
I'll remember it.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.630
I'll put it here.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.970
So we only risked 12
and a half big blinds

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.450
because everyone in front
of us has already folded.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.210
And the true players behind the
small blind and the big blind,

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.190
one of them only has 7
and a half big blinds

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.470
and the other one only has
12 and a half big blinds.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.386
Can everyone see that?

00:29:00.386 --> 00:29:06.250
So even though UTG plus two
has 32 and a half big blinds

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.320
could have
theoretically covered us

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.810
and could have theoretically
taken all our money.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.060
But on this hand, because
they already folded,

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.234
we're essentially only
risking at most 12

00:29:15.234 --> 00:29:16.150
and a half big blinds.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.417
That's the most we can lose.

00:29:17.417 --> 00:29:19.750
So we can't be eliminated
from the tournament this hand.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.980
So here's another example.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.192
So here you see
this guy that I'm

00:29:27.192 --> 00:29:28.650
going to call Low
Jack for now, you

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.110
see him go all in
for 16 big blinds.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.590
So in this case, technically
he could lose all his money

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:39.650
because we have more than 16
big blinds and we do cover him.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:43.930
But in reality, I'd say
he's probably not on average

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.860
risking 16 big blinds because
most of the people who

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.600
could call him,
other than us, have

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.730
way less than 16 big blinds.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.350
Does that make sense?

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.620
So essentially, there's
not like an exact formula

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.180
for effective stack size.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.490
But you want to sort of
think of it in terms of you

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.390
look at the stack
sizes of all the people

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.690
who could potentially
play the hand against you.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.990
And you want to look at
roughly how much am I going

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.510
to be risking in this hand.

00:30:12.114 --> 00:30:13.280
That's effective stack size.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.056
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:30:17.652 --> 00:30:19.610
So the second thing I
want to talk about that's

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.410
very important is position.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.260
So position is basically
where you are at the table

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.610
relative to the blinds.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.200
So how many players
are remaining

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.660
to compete versus
me for the blinds?

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.430
Essentially, the
fewer players that

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:35.340
are left the less strong my hand
needs to be attack the blinds.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.480
So I'm going to give
names for the positions.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.340
Basically the thing
that matters is how far

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.720
you are from the button.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.030
So in this example
with ace jack,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.700
when everyone folded
to you and you're

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.750
the dealer, which is
also known as the button,

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.530
essentially to steal
the blinds, you just

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.650
need to get through the
two blinds themselves.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.310
So that's essentially
two players.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.350
And then if you're in
one position earlier,

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.240
when it was folded
to cut off, then he

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.740
had to deal with three players.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.280
So you want to name everything
relative to the dealer

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.580
essentially.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.150
So we can just quickly
go through the names.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:11.390
They'll get more
familiar as time goes on.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.920
So the first person to act,
we call them under the gun.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.720
So that's this guy here.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.070
And then we go around the table.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.060
It's under the gun plus
one, under the gun plus two.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.920
There can be different
names for the same position.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.620
So in this specific hand, where
there were only six players

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.922
at the table, you could have
called Low Jack under the gun

00:31:33.922 --> 00:31:35.630
because under the gun
is the first person

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.920
to act to the left
of the big blind.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.454
But essentially, it's
more clear to say Low Jack

00:31:40.454 --> 00:31:41.870
because when you
say under the gun

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.540
you have to say under the
gun at a six-handed table.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.290
And then people will
know that means you

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.720
got to get through five hands.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.770
But if you say Low
Jack it's very clear.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.380
You have to get
through five hands.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.700
So under the gun and then
plus two, and then Low Jack.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.030
You can also call under the gun
plus two, Low Jack minus one,

00:31:59.030 --> 00:31:59.840
if you want.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.322
And then High Jack,
cut off, button.

00:32:03.322 --> 00:32:05.030
Don't ask me where
these names came from.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.227
I actually have no idea.

00:32:07.227 --> 00:32:08.560
And then small blind, big blind.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.480
So that's position.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.990
And the importance of position
is basically the later

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.404
you are the fewer hands
you got to get through

00:32:18.404 --> 00:32:20.820
to steal the button, to steal
the blinds of everyone who's

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.280
already folded.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.400
So the third thing that matters
in a poker game is equity.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.100
So we talked about stack size,
we talked about position.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.320
The last thing is
actually your cards.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.840
So the equity of your cards is
basically your secret height

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.970
for the Who's Taller game.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.345
So you can think
of it like that.

00:32:37.345 --> 00:32:38.970
Your cards is like
your secret height.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.310
And the probability of
you winning the pot,

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.110
or equivalently, the
fraction of the pot

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.150
you would win once the
remaining cards are dealt

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.200
is called your equity.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.940
So I'm going to give some
examples of calculating equity.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:57.580
So here's an example where
we get it all on the turn.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.355
And so I have five four
states spades here.

00:33:00.355 --> 00:33:01.990
So I'm not in a great position.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.980
But let's count how
many outs I have.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.560
So this one I want to just
name a river card that

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.417
would help me win the pot.

00:33:10.417 --> 00:33:11.500
AUDIENCE: Seven of spades.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.125
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:13.250
AUDIENCE: Seven of spades.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.375
PROFESSOR: Seven of spades.

00:33:14.375 --> 00:33:17.170
So that gives me a straight
and a flush actually.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:18.710
So let's go along those lines.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.057
So how many spades are
there left in the deck?

00:33:21.057 --> 00:33:22.640
AUDIENCE: There
should be nine spades.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.889
PROFESSOR: Right, nine spades.

00:33:23.889 --> 00:33:28.160
And then how many cards help
me make a straight here?

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.130
AUDIENCE: Six more.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.172
AUDIENCE: Seven or a two.

00:33:30.172 --> 00:33:30.880
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.000
A seven or a two.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.930
So it's six more because
there's eight sevens and twos.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.850
But I'm double counting
the seven of spades

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.020
and the two of spades.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.540
So that's nine plus six.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.210
And then I actually have
to subtract one more card.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.650
Does anyone see what it is?

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:45.150
Yeah.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:45.950
AUDIENCE: The queen of spades.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.350
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.141
The queen of spades
because that's actually

00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:51.996
a disastrous situation because
then if it wasn't all in I

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:54.120
would probably put more
money in the river thinking

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.680
I have a flush and
lose to a full house.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.040
So it's 14 outs, 17 minus 3.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.350
Our equity is around 32%.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.740
It's 14 over the 44 cards
that could still come.

00:34:08.406 --> 00:34:09.739
Did that make sense to everyone?

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:11.405
So that's one way of
calculating equity.

00:34:11.405 --> 00:34:14.050
It's just a very simple
probability distribution

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.840
over the remaining cards in
the deck that could come.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.080
And if you're worried,
what if someone

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.618
folded the queen of spades so
I shouldn't be counting that?

00:34:22.618 --> 00:34:24.159
Essentially, you
just want to pretend

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.674
that the cards that
are in the muck,

00:34:25.674 --> 00:34:27.719
like the cards that were
folded by other players,

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.324
they're essentially irrelevant
because they could have

00:34:30.324 --> 00:34:31.449
folded the queen of spades.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:34.260
But they could have also
folded an irrelevant card,

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.860
like the jack of
hearts or something.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.290
So essentially you just
want to all the cards

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.909
that you haven't
seen, it's easier

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:43.254
to just assume that they
don't affect anything.

00:34:43.254 --> 00:34:44.670
In theory they
affect things a bit

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:49.379
because if you know that the
dealer button folded two cards,

00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:50.920
even if you don't
know what they are,

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.960
they're probably
more likely to be

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.750
really crappy cards, like twos
and threes rather than aces

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.958
because if they had an ace
they would have played it.

00:34:57.958 --> 00:34:59.950
But I think not worrying
about that is fine.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.980
You don't need to
worry about it.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.630
Another example of
equity calculation.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.880
So it's the exact same
example as before.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.060
But in this case, the
probability distribution

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.530
isn't over cards
that could come.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.060
All the cards have already come.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.750
The probability distribution is
just over my opponent's hand.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.730
So this is the same calculation.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.970
We calculated our equity is 25%.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.040
And that's not a
probability distribution

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.290
over cards to come.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.800
That's a probability
distribution

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.610
over our beliefs of
our opponent's hand.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.290
So example three of
calculating equity.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:35.010
So this one you can't
really do by hand.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.280
Let's say you get it all in
pre-flop, with ace king suited

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.750
against pocket twos.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.659
And you basically
need a calculator.

00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:44.700
There are certain websites
that help you do this.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.100
And ace king suited
against pocket twos,

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.860
if they don't have
a two of your suit

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.296
is actually a very small
favorite which is cool.

00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:53.670
But if you have
the two of hearts

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.710
then you're actually
a slight underdog.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:02.000
So just make sure for
all the different things

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.420
equity could mean.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.570
Equity could mean a probability
over river cards, probability

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.996
over the unknown.

00:36:07.996 --> 00:36:09.370
A very good
calculator in general

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.370
is PokerStove,
which all have lots

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.660
of examples of in my slides.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.720
And you can download
it via this link here.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.110
So this is an example
of using PokerStove.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.850
You can put in
exact calculations.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.090
Let's say you get it in with
two of diamonds, two of spades.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:28.162
So pocket twos on the flop of
5, 3, 2 versus a range where you

00:36:28.162 --> 00:36:30.120
know your opponent is
going to have a big pair,

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.550
like pocket jacks plus,
you can actually run it

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.790
and your equity is 85%, which
is actually surprisingly low,

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:36.431
I think.

00:36:36.431 --> 00:36:38.430
Because it seems like
you've got three of a kind

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.660
they've only got a pair.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.580
They have two chances
to hit one of two cards.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.840
But there's a lot of random
stuff that can happen,

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.020
like if they have aces
they can make a straight,

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.270
they can make a back
door flush, the board

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.430
could come two more
fives, which counterfeits,

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.590
or three of a kind deuces.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.280
So this is another example
of calculating equity.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.820
So this is just a summary of
the different situations you

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.770
might want to calculate equity.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.530
And I recommend you
download PokerStove.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:06.430
But you don't really have to.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.520
And I guess one
question you could ask

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.980
is how do you actually
do this at a table?

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.320
So essentially, if you do
this a lot while you're

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.880
studying about
hands and thinking

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.540
about poker, eventually--

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.050
I've been able to-- you just
memorize a lot of situations

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.090
in general what the
probabilities are,

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:25.260
or at least what the
correct decision is.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:30.840
So now let's talk about raising
two win the blinds and antes.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.350
So the antes, an ante
is an extra small bet

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.680
that each player must put
into the pot each hand.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.560
And these sum to
around a big blind.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.070
And they come in during the
later stages of a tournament.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:44.725
And they're inexistant
in cash games.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.965
I stuck this under the rug
in the earlier examples.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:58.580
So in-- let me go
back-- so like in here.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.410
Do you see the
1,200 in the middle?

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.150
So actually stuck
this under the rug.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.540
But that comes from
each player being

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.570
forced to put in 200, which
is 1/10 of the big blind,

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:11.110
at the start of every hand.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.980
And if you're playing
tournaments then

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.990
this would usually be the case.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.850
Antes will come in fairly soon.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:20.529
If you're playing cash games,
where you just sit down

00:38:20.529 --> 00:38:22.320
and you can leave
whenever and you sit down

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.110
and just play for
your own play money,

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.790
then there's usually no antes.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.867
But antes actually make
a world of difference

00:38:29.867 --> 00:38:31.200
in terms of what you want to do.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:38.100
It's not just the stakes are
bigger when there's antes

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.780
because you don't
want to just think

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.390
of it like there's extra
money in the pot every hand.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:44.370
It's equivalent to the
blinds being bigger.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:47.910
That's not true because you
also have to put in an ante.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.520
So if the blinds were
proportionally bigger

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.790
to cover the antes you would
have to raise to a bigger size

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.620
to try to steal the blinds.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.500
But with antes you don't need
to raise to any bigger size

00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.630
to try to steal the blinds.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.530
So it's actually
very action driving.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:02.424
It's very exciting.

00:39:02.424 --> 00:39:03.840
It makes it so
that your basically

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.930
want to play a very
wide range of hands.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.910
And you really just
want to be trying

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:12.720
to win the blinds as often as
possible because winning one

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.440
pot with the antes is so big.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.690
So this is what it looks like.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.240
So the first thing
I'm going to say

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.531
is if you're going to start
playing tournaments tonight

00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:26.679
is if no one has raised yet you
really, you don't want to call.

00:39:26.679 --> 00:39:28.220
You want it to raise
to give yourself

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.630
a chance of winning the
blinds without seeing a flop.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.970
So I'd say the most
common beginner mistake

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:37.260
I see beginner poker
players make is not raising

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.940
when no one has raised before.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.740
So in this case, it would
be just calling for 2,000

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.970
and trying to see a flop.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.890
But the main issue
is you're giving

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.380
the big blind they
can just check and see

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.490
the flop for free.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.640
Whereas if you raise you
put them to a decision.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.940
And they might fold,
and you might just

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.480
win the pot for
free without having

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.230
to do anything essentially.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.380
So how much do you
raise when I say raise.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.910
The minimum raise
size you can do

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.440
is raising to two big blinds.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.470
However, this is a
bit small because you

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.950
give the blinds fairly good
odds to make a profitable call.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.890
Although, it's
not even that bad.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.140
So let me just talk in
general about raising

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.760
big versus raising small.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.190
So the advantage
of raising small

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.900
is that you're risking less.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.530
Like let's say you raise and
then the next person re-raises,

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.490
and then the next
person goes all in.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.870
So you know probably those two
people have pretty good hands

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:30.960
and you want to fold.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.340
If you raise to a small
size then you can fold

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.070
and you don't lose that much.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:39.040
If I raise to five big blinds
then I'm losing a lot more.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.190
But what's the
benefit of raising big

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.490
is you give other people
worse odds to call.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.272
If I only raise
to two big blinds,

00:40:46.272 --> 00:40:47.730
let's actually do
this calculation.

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.040
Let's say here, instead
of going all in I

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.360
raise two big blinds,
which is 4,000.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.990
What odds am I
essentially giving

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.330
the big blind you call to call?

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.210
So this is actually, in
this very exact situation,

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.910
this is a very common
mistake I see beginners make,

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.100
which is you raise
to only 4,000.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:09.880
Yeah.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.450
AUDIENCE: So there's
8,000 that's in the pot

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.152
and they have to call
2,000, so it's 21?

00:41:14.152 --> 00:41:14.860
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.419
So it's 41.

00:41:15.419 --> 00:41:16.710
But there's also a small blind.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:20.050
So there's actually going to be
9,000 essentially in the pot.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:20.880
Yeah.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.200
So it's going to be 8,800 in.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.158
It's going to be 8,800.

00:41:23.158 --> 00:41:24.990
So approximately 9,000.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.285
And they only have to
call 2,000 to see the pot.

00:41:27.285 --> 00:41:30.190
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.910
So the odds are
actually 4.5 to 1.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.530
And ace jack off-suit
is a great hand.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:38.820
But there's no
hand that ace jack

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:43.680
off-suit is more than a
4.5 to 1 favorite against.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.920
So in some sense, basically,
even if they have jacks two,

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.880
or whatever, ace two, think
of the best possible case,

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.110
you're still not doing
better than the odds

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:53.955
you're giving them.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.590
So on the other hand
though, it is really risky

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.990
to raise more than 2.25.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.826
So a reasonable rule
of thumb, I'd say,

00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:08.209
is to raise to the 2.25
big blinds in tournaments.

00:42:08.209 --> 00:42:09.500
I know it's pretty close to do.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.680
If you just raised to two
it's probably not that bad.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.210
But roughly speaking,
I think this

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.310
is a reasonable rule of thumb.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:18.080
Earlier you could
try to raise to more.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.640
I think that's
sort of customary,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.210
although I don't think
it's theoretically optimal.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.030
You'll often see
players raise to like

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:28.000
three blinds, especially
when you watch pro players.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.120
They'll raise to bigger.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.800
But the main reason
is because they're

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.720
the better player by
a lot and they're just

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.660
trying to make big pots,
which is reasonable.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.370
If you're trying to
just play big pots

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:41.270
and win big pots then raising
to the bigger size is fine.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:43.490
But I don't think there's
any theoretical reason

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:49.340
to raise to more than 2.25
big blinds in most situations.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.600
Other than when in cash
games, where all players have

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.340
a lot of money, then
it's a bit different

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.714
because also in
cash games you're

00:42:56.714 --> 00:42:59.930
not worried about risking
more because you're not

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.710
worried about losing
out of the tournament.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:07.520
So the other thing is instead
of raising you should just

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.830
go all in if the effective stack
size is 12 big blinds or less.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.365
So recall, the rational
for raising big

00:43:15.365 --> 00:43:17.510
is to prevent others
from calling for cheap.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:19.130
But the rational
for raising small

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.830
is to lose less if we get
re-raised and have to fold.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.950
But 12 big blinds is sort of the
point where it's small enough

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:27.500
that you never really want
to fold after committing

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.180
2.25 big blinds.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.430
So if I only have 12 big
blinds, I raise 2.25,

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:36.660
I've only got 9.75 left after.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.440
OK, fine, if I get raises and
re-raised maybe I'll fold.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.080
But even if I get
re-raised once,

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.120
if I'm raising in
the first place

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.850
my hand is going
to be reasonable.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.320
If it's a Who's
Taller game I'm not

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.270
going to raise in
the first place

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.760
if I'm 5 feet, or something.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.360
So your hand will be reasonable.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.260
So this is beginner mistake
number two is being too scared

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.310
to go all in pre-flop.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:05.240
So that's why this ace jack
hand, I actually cheated a bit.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.030
So technically here, the
effective stack size is--

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.420
the big blind has 12
and a half big blinds

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.550
but the small one
only has 7 and a half.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:17.930
So I roughly said, the effective
stack size is less than 12,

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.864
and I just went all in.

00:44:19.864 --> 00:44:21.780
So that's definitely a
beginner mistake number

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:27.920
two in tournaments is to be too
scared to go all in pre-flop.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.370
So what your goal essentially
should be-- oh, sorry.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.680
I should say the rule is--

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.350
so all of the numbers I
said assume there's antes.

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:39.140
If there's no antes you should
change to 10 big blinds.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.180
So the threshold
for going all in

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.807
should be less because
when there's no antes

00:44:43.807 --> 00:44:46.098
you want to be risking less
because the pot is smaller.

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:52.200
So overall, when I
talked about position

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.975
I talked about stack size.

00:44:53.975 --> 00:44:56.100
Essentially what I'm trying
to get the point across

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.770
is if you're just
starting out, players

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.230
tend to make all decisions
based on their cards.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.390
It's just like, I
have a pair of jacks.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.980
I see my pair of
jacks on this board.

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.540
I have a pair
that's pretty good.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.900
And you sort of tend to ignore
what the effect of stack size

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.370
is, how much you're
wagering, and position.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.460
But experienced
players, the cards

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.530
actually matter much,
much less to the.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.590
In fact, if you're
doing optimal play

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.720
you don't care in some
sense what your cards are.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.990
You just care what your range
of cards are at that point.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.620
So experienced players, they're
willing to raise the blinds

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.890
with much weaker hands
from good positions rather

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:32.847
than early positions.

00:45:32.847 --> 00:45:34.680
And they're going to
risk going all in a lot

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.390
more frequently with
a lot worse hands

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.744
if their stack size is low.

00:45:37.744 --> 00:45:39.160
So I want you to
think about that.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.400
So if you're just
starting out that's fine.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.140
If you're still
trying to figure out

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.280
whether you have a straight and
stuff like that, that's fine.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.950
And it's totally fine
if you try to play

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.270
based just on your cards.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.550
But I want everyone's goal
by the end of the class

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.700
to be able to play based
on these other factors

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.322
more so than your cards.

00:45:56.322 --> 00:45:58.030
So that being said,
I'm going to give you

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.150
some concrete suggestions
for those of you

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:03.530
who might want to start
playing tonight of what hands

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:07.830
you should be playing
from each position.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:12.240
So most of the tournaments will
have nine players per table.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.610
So this is going to be roughly
a range I recommend to open.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:17.080
So these are the
range of hands you

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.450
should be playing from
the worst position,

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:22.220
so under the gun at
a nine-handed table.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.050
So there's eight
players left behind you.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:25.540
You can pick up
really good hands.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:29.070
So it's aces, kings, queens,
jacks; ace king off-suited;

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:33.720
ace king off-suit; 10s; ace
queen suited; ace queen off.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.950
So that's basically
the list of hands.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.230
These are only premium hands.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.580
This is like 6.2%
of hands, I think.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.370
It's a very premium range.

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.460
So note how tight this is.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.680
Because the thing to
remember is only the best

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.980
hand out of nine hands at the
table is going to get the pot.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.980
When there's nine hands, even
though the average hand is

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.224
really bad the best
hand out of nine hands

00:46:59.224 --> 00:47:00.640
is always going
to be pretty good.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.880
So to even think that you have
a chance you need to start out

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.250
with a very premium hold 'em.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.780
Roughly, what do you add
as you go around the table?

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.077
So for the second position--

00:47:12.077 --> 00:47:14.410
I'm going to post all these
slides before the tournament

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.201
starts, by the way.

00:47:15.201 --> 00:47:17.020
So you don't feel
that you scramble

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.850
to write all this down.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.790
I'm going to post it.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:25.510
From the second position,
I put in black the hands

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.550
that I would open from
the previous position.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.770
And I've put in red the
hands that I would open

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.810
from that position in addition.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.740
So second position
there's one less player.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.240
OK.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.270
I'll gamble with sevens, ace,
jack, king, queen, ace 10

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.950
suited.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:39.790
So we'll get around
the table and then

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:44.000
the range will slowly increase.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.830
Also note that these are
very conservative ranges.

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:51.380
If you watch high stakes
poker, probably the players

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.520
will open a lot more hands than
what I'm recommending here.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.890
But my general
experience has been

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:59.050
when you're just starting
out to play poker

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.690
it's much easier to err
on the side of being

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:04.140
too tight than being too loose.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.730
Because it's in some
sense a lot easier

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.520
to play pocket aces
than seven five suited.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.020
With pocket aces
you're always going

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.394
to have a pair of
aces or better.

00:48:12.394 --> 00:48:14.434
You just back that bet.

00:48:14.434 --> 00:48:15.850
And then with seven
five suite you

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.160
need to be able to
bluff very carefully,

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.406
you need to sometimes be able to
try to get value when you just

00:48:21.406 --> 00:48:22.280
hit a pair of sevens.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.190
And it's just a lot harder.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:26.740
So the ranges I'm
suggesting are very

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.770
tight by most poker standards.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.700
By tight I mean conservative.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.290
But I think that's
the right side

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:35.130
to err on when
you're just starting.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.230
So these are the ranges.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.580
As we get to the later
positions, so this is Low Jack,

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:42.960
we're opening more hands now.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.440
Any two suited Broadways.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.010
So that's hands like jack
10 suited, queen 10 suited.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:48.400
It's basically
any two cards that

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:52.281
are the same suit and
both 10 or higher.

00:48:52.281 --> 00:48:54.280
So maybe I should just
run through this quickly.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.532
So why is having your
cards be suited good?

00:48:57.532 --> 00:49:00.172
AUDIENCE: You get a flush.

00:49:00.172 --> 00:49:00.880
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.005
So if it suited you're more
likely to make a flush.

00:49:03.005 --> 00:49:05.260
But if have two unsuited
cards then there's

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.200
two different flushes
you could get.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.710
If you have queens or
diamonds, 10 of spades

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:14.470
is going to make a diamond
flush or a spade flush.

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:16.360
Essentially, that
argument is wrong

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.280
because there's two
reasons why it's wrong.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.830
One is it's not more of a
play because you need four

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.900
of the suit to make a flush.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.300
And two is, when you make the
flush it's also more obvious

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.760
you have the flush.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.260
like

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.980
If you only have
one diamond, even

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:32.030
if it's the ace of
diamonds, once there's

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.180
four diamonds on the
board it's way more likely

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.099
that you have a flush.

00:49:35.099 --> 00:49:36.640
So you're going to
get paid off less.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.067
Whereas if you have two
diamonds in your hand

00:49:39.067 --> 00:49:40.900
and there's only three
diamonds on the board

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.360
it's less susceptible
that you have a flush.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.920
So high jack is
three to the button.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.680
So this is what I
would recommend.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:57.530
So any pair, pairs
are pretty good.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.010
Any suited ace, so
suited ace means any card

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.040
with any hand with an ace and
another card of the same suit.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.840
Any suited connector.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.020
By that I mean hands
like basically two cards

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.900
that are next to each other and
also the same suit, like 10,

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.400
9--

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.960
10 of spades, nine of spades.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.320
Or any two unsuited
Broadway cards.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.000
So I do use a lot
of terminology here.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.597
So yeah, please stop me
if something is unclear.

00:50:23.597 --> 00:50:25.180
You can google most
of these, I think.

00:50:33.509 --> 00:50:34.800
And suited connectors are good.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.910
So like a hand like
seven, six suited

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:40.297
is often better than a
hand like 10, 6 suited,

00:50:40.297 --> 00:50:42.130
even though the trend
is bigger than the six

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.485
because ten is sort of a
small enough card where

00:50:44.485 --> 00:50:47.020
it's not that relevant, the
fact that it's a big card.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.960
But the fact that
seven, six is connected

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.774
and can hit a lot more
straights is very relevant.

00:50:52.774 --> 00:50:54.190
So we're if we're
cut off I'm just

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.148
going to show you on
PokerStove because there's

00:50:56.148 --> 00:50:57.090
too many to list.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:59.620
But the thing I want you
to know is the percentages.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.130
30%.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:04.380
So remember, under the gun
I recommended playing 6%.

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:08.070
So we've multiplied
how bad our hand could

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:10.050
be for us to play by five.

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:13.030
And I think this is what I
really want you to try to do.

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:14.640
And I think what a
lot of new players

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.181
don't do enough is they always
play the same cards regardless

00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:17.969
of their position.

00:51:17.969 --> 00:51:19.510
And then even crazier,
on the button,

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.340
if everyone in
front of you folds,

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:24.210
I recommend them playing
about 55% of hands.

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:24.990
This is huge.

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:27.540
I want you to play
jack three suited.

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.110
Who thinks jack three
suited is a good hand?

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.430
Or king four off-suit,
or queen six off-suit.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.670
What hands do we play
from the small blind

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:40.920
if it's folded to you?

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.070
So let's compare opening from
the small blind to opening

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:44.757
from the button.

00:51:44.757 --> 00:51:46.590
So for small blind it's
a bit different now.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.840
So I should mention
this because when

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:56.550
you're raising from the button,
from the dealer, if you get

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:59.737
called you get to
act last post-flop.

00:51:59.737 --> 00:52:02.070
So I'm going to talk more
about this in future lectures.

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:06.030
But this is basically called
having position post-flop.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.090
And having position
is basically good.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:08.637
Yeah.

00:52:08.637 --> 00:52:10.220
AUDIENCE: For all
these hands, are you

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.140
assuming that everyone's
folding behind you?

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:13.440
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.117
If people haven't
folded, essentially, I'll

00:52:16.117 --> 00:52:17.700
talk more about this
in future classes

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.130
but essentially what
you need to do if--

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:24.480
so let let's say this guy
raised and you're the button.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.230
Essentially you need to
consider what his range is

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:30.410
and calculate your equity
against his range, which

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.910
you can do--

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:32.620
AUDIENCE: The calculation
is completely different.

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:33.260
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.093
So the calculation is
essentially completely

00:52:35.093 --> 00:52:36.120
different.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.690
So essentially the
first guy who raised

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:42.845
determines what the barrier
to entry to the pot is.

00:52:42.845 --> 00:52:44.220
Because essentially
the first guy

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.340
that raises, if it's from under
the gun, he's telling you,

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:49.234
my range is pocket eights plus.

00:52:49.234 --> 00:52:50.775
Even if he's sort
of loose it's still

00:52:50.775 --> 00:52:55.650
going to be pocket fours plus
and queen 10 suited plus.

00:52:55.650 --> 00:53:00.240
Basically it's saying, if you're
playing eight six suited then

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.210
you're basically in
idiot, because my range is

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:04.090
way better than that.

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:07.140
So essentially the first guy
who plays this hand sort of

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.820
sets the tone on how good
your hand needs to be.

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:18.090
Thanks for that question.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:20.131
So I'll talk more about
this in a future lecture.

00:53:20.131 --> 00:53:24.120
But essentially that's
what you need to do.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.200
So from the small blind let's
compare opening the small blind

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.830
from opening the button.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:30.970
So the issue with
opening the small blind

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:32.671
is if the big blind
calls you actually

00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:33.920
don't have position post-flop.

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.040
The big blind gets to
act after you post-flop.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:36.660
Pot.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.700
So it's actually a lot
worse in some sense

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.366
than opening from the
button because you

00:53:40.366 --> 00:53:41.370
don't get you act last.

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:44.530
But it is better in the sense
that there's one fewer person

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:45.330
to get through.

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.880
And also, you have less to
wager, which is actually

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.510
really relevant because
from the button,

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:57.910
if the blinds are 2,000 or 1,000
or OK, let's just dictate it.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.790
So if the blinds
are 20, 40, if you

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:02.730
want to steal the lines from the
button and you want to do 2.25

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:04.080
you need to put in 90.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.530
You raise me 90 and
you need to wager 90.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:08.280
But if you're raising
from the small blind

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.500
you only need to put in 70 more.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.540
So you're actually
paying a smaller price

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.414
to try to steal the blinds.

00:54:14.414 --> 00:54:16.080
But the fact that
you're out of position

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.212
is a very important negative.

00:54:18.212 --> 00:54:19.920
So I'd say all these
factors balance out.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.140
And you can roughly play
the same range of hands

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.570
from the small blind as you
would from the big blind.

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.984
I think that's a
reasonable rule of thumb.

00:54:26.984 --> 00:54:28.650
But the fact that
you're out of position

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.770
hurts a lot less as stacks
get shallower, essentially

00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:35.900
as effective stack
sizes get a lot smaller.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:39.200
So you could really
drastically increase this range

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.726
if you only have 10 big
blinds from the small blind.

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.050
So let me just give a
few caveats about this.

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:49.675
So actually, I'll
leave it to you guys.

00:54:49.675 --> 00:54:51.620
If someone comes up with
a very good complaint

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.810
about these recommendations
I'm giving you

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:57.120
I'll give up the
last $20 gift card.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.447
So what are some problems?

00:54:59.447 --> 00:55:01.530
Normally I get lots of
complaints in this section.

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.420
You already got one
but you can answer.

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.000
Yeah.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.204
AUDIENCE: They're very
predictable so it's unusable.

00:55:07.204 --> 00:55:07.870
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:09.026
That's a very good point.

00:55:09.026 --> 00:55:11.150
A lot of people ask me,
why would you follow these?

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.310
If I follow these everyone
knows what I'm doing.

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:19.690
Well the point is, for most
of these, even this range,

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:21.950
it sort of encompasses
enough hands.

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:25.280
So this is where I'm talking
about optimal balance play.

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.100
I think even though humans
haven't solved poker,

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.100
I think roughly,
if you want to ask,

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.720
I would guess that roughly
the optimal range of hands

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.851
you open from this position
is something like this.

00:55:36.851 --> 00:55:37.850
It's going to be looser.

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.920
But it's something
roughly like this.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.180
Probably you want to
probabilistic play some smaller

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.980
cards just so when the
flop comes 2, 2, 4,

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.382
you can potentially have a two.

00:55:48.382 --> 00:55:50.090
But essentially you're
not doing bad here

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:53.712
because if the flop comes
three small cards then

00:55:53.712 --> 00:55:55.670
you were going to be
doing pretty well with all

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:56.930
your big pairs.

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:58.940
And if the flop
comes the big cards

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:04.630
you've still got ace king, ace
queen, ace jack in your hand.

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:10.520
But not that is
a good complaint.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.450
So in theory, it's
in theory optimal

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:16.630
to play seven seven some
fraction of the time,

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:18.330
six six some
fraction of the time,

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:20.060
and two two some
fraction of the time.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:23.286
But that's making things
really complicated.

00:56:23.286 --> 00:56:24.910
I don't want to add
two two to the list

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:26.900
because if you play two
two every single time

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.070
then that's way too loose.

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:30.440
You're just spewing money
by raising with two two

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.810
against this many
players behind.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.580
So ideally maybe
with two twos you

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.242
should do a random
number generator and 10%

00:56:37.242 --> 00:56:38.450
of the time you play two two.

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:40.870
That would probably be
theoretically optimal.

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:42.594
OK, good.

00:56:42.594 --> 00:56:43.760
That would have gotten this.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.800
But OK, I'll give it to--

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.274
Yeah.

00:56:45.274 --> 00:56:47.482
AUDIENCE: I think another
problem with playing really

00:56:47.482 --> 00:56:50.070
tight all the time is that
you are also very easily

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.870
bullied around the table.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.386
If someone bets and you
really want to play,

00:56:54.386 --> 00:56:56.760
you really want to stick to
your tight range, you'll fold

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.860
and you'll maybe
miss out on something

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:00.535
that you shouldn't
have depending

00:57:00.535 --> 00:57:02.160
on your position,
and things like that.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:02.430
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.930
Good.

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:06.560
So yes, these are
pretty tight in that it

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.450
does give the other
people incentive

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.100
to raise a lot
because everyone's

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.350
going to be folding a lot
because you are just waiting

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:14.260
for these really good hands.

00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.170
OK.

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:17.361
That's good.

00:57:17.361 --> 00:57:19.652
Are there any other questions
about these suggestions I

00:57:19.652 --> 00:57:21.500
gave you guys?

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.104
Or are there other
potential complaints?

00:57:25.104 --> 00:57:27.020
I'm going to give this
gift certificate to you

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:32.520
unless someone thinks that
they have another complaint.

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.762
So I'll give this
to you at the end.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:45.450
This is one thing that
I didn't really address.

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:48.780
I talked about going all
in as well as just raising.

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:52.130
So how do these ranges differ?

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:55.610
The answer essentially is
they don't really differ.

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:58.484
So let's say, here, these are
the hands I told you to play.

00:57:58.484 --> 00:58:00.150
Let's say you were
sort of small enough,

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:03.294
you only had 12 big
blinds with antes

00:58:03.294 --> 00:58:04.710
and you were
supposed to go all in

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:07.920
instead of raise, which of these
hands do you go all in with?

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.807
It's roughly the same range.

00:58:10.807 --> 00:58:12.390
I think that's a
decent rule of thumb.

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:14.460
If you just go all in
with the same range

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:17.850
you're not going
to be doing badly.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:20.790
But when the effective
stack size is much smaller,

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:22.860
like let's say you only
have three big blinds,

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.850
then you can drastically
increase this range.

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:29.250
So when your
effective stack size

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:33.910
is actually say 10, or let's
say your effective stack size is

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:39.110
five big blinds, intuitively you
might think, I can wager a lot,

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:41.570
I can wager a lot
wider range of hands.

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:42.690
So here's the argument.

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:46.740
The argument is I'm only
risking five big blinds.

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:50.070
In the other case I was
risking 12 big blinds.

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:53.350
I should be way more
aggressive with five big blinds

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:54.840
than 12 big blinds.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:55.830
So that's the argument.

00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.660
But the reason why
that argument is wrong

00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.610
is because with five
big blinds you're

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:01.242
going to get called every time.

00:59:01.242 --> 00:59:02.700
With five big blinds
you can't just

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.260
go all in with
seven two off-suit

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.480
because your opponent has
such good odds to call,

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.620
they're going to call you.

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.470
Whereas with 12 big blinds,
even though you're risking more

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:13.140
you also have more chances
of getting everyone to fold.

00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:15.400
So even though it seems like
you're risking way more,

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.860
in some sense you're not.

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.380
Because the more chips you
are risking the more likely

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.490
it is that everyone else folds.

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:23.620
Does that argument
make sense to everyone?

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:24.750
So make sure you don't
get tricked by that

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:26.166
because it is easy
to get tricked.

00:59:26.166 --> 00:59:29.910
But the fact that when
you're risking more

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:31.500
you're getting
people to fold more

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.880
means you're
actually not risking

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.970
as much as you think you are.

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:36.420
And that's a common fallacy.

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:43.330
So we're near the last
part of the class.

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.980
So are there any
other questions?

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.396
I know some of you probably
want to start playing tonight,

00:59:47.396 --> 00:59:51.640
and I definitely did not
address everything you need.

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.830
But are there any
other questions

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:55.660
roughly, in terms
of opening and going

00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:01.114
all in that you might want to
know before playing tonight?

01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:03.280
Because I do think we have
maybe five extra minutes.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.995
So I can answer some questions.

01:00:04.995 --> 01:00:07.120
Does everyone not know what
the term "bluff" means?

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.578
I said bluff a
bunch of times but I

01:00:08.578 --> 01:00:09.850
realized I never explained.

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:14.890
So bluffing essentially
means you have a bad hand

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.810
and because you have
such a bad hand you

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:19.450
know the only way of winning
that is to get your opponent

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.320
fold.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.250
So basically you bet big to
hope that your opponent folds.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:26.500
If you have a better hand,
like an average hand,

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.660
often you actually
don't want to be betting

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.754
because there's no point.

01:00:29.754 --> 01:00:31.920
Because when you bet you're
essentially just getting

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.359
adversely selected, where
your opponent calls you

01:00:34.359 --> 01:00:36.400
when their hand is better
and you lose more money

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.261
to a better hand.

01:00:37.261 --> 01:00:39.260
And your opponent folds
when their hand is worse

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.590
so you're not making any
money from a worse hand.

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.030
And then with your
best hands, you

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:45.880
want to bet to try to get your
opponent to call and increase

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.290
the amount that you win.

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:48.850
And we call this value betting.

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:52.169
So I'm going to get more
into this in future lechers.

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:54.460
But essentially in poker,
the paradigm you want to play

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.610
is you want to value
bet your very best hands

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.810
and then you want to
basically check and try

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:03.010
to get to show down, like try
to show your hand on the river

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:04.390
with your medium hands.

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:07.165
And also bet with your bad hands
to try to get your opponent

01:01:07.165 --> 01:01:08.760
to fold better hands.

01:01:11.337 --> 01:01:12.920
I'm going to get to
the last part now.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.660
So quick test.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.720
So here what would you do?

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.580
It's folded to you.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.580
You're in the high jack.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.770
You have ace, five of clubs.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:24.030
So someone want to
suggest what would you do?

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.770
What would your play be?

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:27.530
AUDIENCE: Call.

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:28.390
AUDIENCE: Bet.

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:29.120
AUDIENCE: Raise.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:29.473
PROFESSOR: Raise.

01:01:29.473 --> 01:01:29.826
OK, good.

01:01:29.826 --> 01:01:30.326
Raise.

01:01:30.326 --> 01:01:31.810
So not call.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:33.490
That was mistake
number one to not do.

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.615
You always want to raise
the blinds if it's folded.

01:01:35.615 --> 01:01:37.190
But it's fine, it's fine.

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.690
That's fine.

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:39.940
We're all here to learn
about these hands.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.010
Now should I go all in
or should I just raise

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:48.880
to 450, which is 2.25?

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:49.790
I should go all in.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:50.596
OK.

01:01:50.596 --> 01:01:52.720
I think it's not terrible
if you just raise to 450.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.330
But I said if it's 10
big blinds-- there's no

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:58.330
antes so you need 10 or less.

01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:00.640
And you have 10, so going
all in I think is fine.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.130
So we decide to go all in.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.900
So there are Nash calculators.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.790
They're complicated.

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:12.310
But if you run this through
a Nash equilibrium calculator

01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:16.390
this is roughly what you
should be going all in with.

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:17.166
So we go all in.

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:19.790
So this range is a bit different
than what I showed you before.

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:23.440
This is an actual Nash
calculation just not

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.584
just my recommendation.

01:02:24.584 --> 01:02:27.250
It's going to be wider than what
you saw before but that's fine.

01:02:29.862 --> 01:02:30.820
So now you're this guy.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.290
You're seat nine.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.590
So I'm going to show you how you
do a quick calculation of what

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:37.050
equity you need to call here.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:43.780
So what equity you
need to call here.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.550
A straight up pot
odds calculation

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:50.500
says you're getting
23 to 20 or 1.15 to 1.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.880
So roughly you need 46.5%
equity to call as this player.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.595
But there's two players behind.

01:02:56.595 --> 01:02:58.720
There is a graphics glitch
because seat one has not

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.219
folded.

01:02:59.219 --> 01:03:01.270
Seat one and seat
two both has cards.

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:04.330
So you actually
need more than 46.5%

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:07.450
equity because the
calculation of 46.5%

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.750
assumes seat one and seat two
can't wake up with pocket aces.

01:03:13.215 --> 01:03:14.590
PokerStove is very
good for this.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.580
And you can do this right now.

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:18.121
I've taught you everything you
need to do these calculations.

01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:21.455
And PokerStove is also easy
to figure out how to use.

01:03:21.455 --> 01:03:22.830
You can essentially
just plug in.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:26.070
You look at pocket
fives, it has 48%.

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:28.300
You need 46.5%.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.390
And I said you need a bit
more than 46.5 due to the fact

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:33.850
that there's two players
behind so pocket fives,

01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:34.900
it's good enough.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.760
Well, I'll call ace nine suited.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.810
I'll call.

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:40.420
So I'm just showing you some
calculations on PokerStove.

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:43.210
It really is a really good tool.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.680
So you can do some calculations.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.640
So basically they call.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.740
And the hands I showed
you here is actually

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.160
sort of the worse hands that
it's plus CV to call with.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.990
Pocket fives, ace
nines suited plus.

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:01.791
So aces nines suited plus means
ace nine suited, ace 10 suited,

01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:03.790
ace jack suited, all the
hands that are strictly

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:05.230
better than ace nine suited.

01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:07.862
Ace 10 off-suit,
king queen suited.

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:14.401
As the last player here, do you
call with king queen suited?

01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:15.400
It's just a rough guess.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.660
How many of you
intuitively would

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.826
call with king queen suited?

01:04:17.826 --> 01:04:21.600
Two players have
already gone all in.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.590
So most of people would fold.

01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:24.910
Oh, you guys would call.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:27.100
So it turns out,
at least according

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:30.040
to the Nash calculator--

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.714
So here you calculate
the pot odds.

01:04:31.714 --> 01:04:34.380
And this is an exact calculation
because there's no more players

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:34.880
behind.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.960
So just calculate, do
I have 29.5% accurate?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.990
Basically if I assume that
player one and player two

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:47.710
are playing according to Nash
equilibrium or optimal ranges,

01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:49.900
you actually have
way more than enough.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:53.230
You actually have 34%
where you only needed 25%.

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:55.470
So this is a trick
question I set up.

01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:59.710
The trick was king queen suited
doesn't seem like a good hand.

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:03.160
But against two other hands it's
actually relatively a very good

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:03.765
hand.

01:05:03.765 --> 01:05:05.890
Against one other hand,
they could just have a pair

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:06.640
and you're behind.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.130
They could have an ace most
of the time and you're behind.

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:10.796
But against two other
hands you actually

01:05:10.796 --> 01:05:13.300
have really good equity because
when you hit a king or queen

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.267
you have the big pair.

01:05:14.267 --> 01:05:15.850
You can also hit
straights and flushes

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:17.050
with king queens suited.

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:22.300
And your equity against two
other hands is very good.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.420
So you have way more
than enough so they call.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.940
So we're going to get
in this all in freefall.

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:31.826
So who are the people
I gave these cards to?

01:05:31.826 --> 01:05:33.200
You guys can come
up to the front

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.275
and I'm going to
hand you your cards.

01:05:35.275 --> 01:05:38.220
The people who I gave these
gift certificates to, I said.

01:05:48.222 --> 01:05:49.930
AUDIENCE: Do you want
me to stay up here?

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:50.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:50.921
Stay up here.

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.380
So what I want you guys to do--

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.213
these are the hands
people went all in with.

01:05:58.213 --> 01:06:00.480
Who was the first
person to answer?

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:00.980
OK.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.880
So you get to pick.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.000
Which hand do you want?

01:06:05.802 --> 01:06:07.537
AUDIENCE: I'll go
with jack jack.

01:06:07.537 --> 01:06:08.120
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:11.300
So Colin is going to jack jack.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.300
Sorry, what's your name?

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:12.810
AUDIENCE: Kevin.

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:13.220
PROFESSOR: Kevin.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.090
Kevin, which hand do you want?

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:14.870
So he took jack jack.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:16.400
Which of these remaining--
you were second, right?

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.100
Yeah, you were--

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:17.340
OK.

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:17.710
AUDIENCE: I was last.

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:18.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:19.188
Which hand do you want?

01:06:21.794 --> 01:06:22.960
AUDIENCE: I want king queen.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.695
So he's going to
take king queen.

01:06:24.695 --> 01:06:28.310
So you're going to
take ace five plus.

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:30.795
This is sort of mean but
I want to show you guys

01:06:30.795 --> 01:06:31.670
this how poker works.

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:34.697
When you've already
won, you've won $20.

01:06:34.697 --> 01:06:36.280
You guys are going
to put in your hand

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.294
and whoever wins this hand
is going to get all $60.

01:06:39.294 --> 01:06:47.850
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:47.850 --> 01:06:49.360
We're going to go for it.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.170
So this is the free
flow of equities.

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:54.854
So it is pre-determined.

01:06:54.854 --> 01:06:56.520
So it looks like you
guys did very well.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.480
You guys picked correctly.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.396
You got to pick first.

01:06:58.396 --> 01:07:01.720
You picked the best hand
with equity of 34.73.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.470
You got 32.95.

01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:06.558
You're only a bit
behind with 31.1.

01:07:06.558 --> 01:07:07.916
So the flop is 6, 7, 8.

01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:09.540
So let's look at the
probabilities now.

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:15.210
Jacks is still ahead, ace five
has picked up a lot of outs.

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:17.420
King queen of diamonds
is not looking too good

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:21.080
but they did pick
up one diamond.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.760
Notice the nine of hearts.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.340
So, sorry.

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.300
Like Queens.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.370
I'm sorry.

01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:30.200
So you're out of the running.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.786
AUDIENCE: He needs a 10.

01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:32.910
PROFESSOR: 2 to 1 to cheer.

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:34.600
Is there any card
you're hoping for?

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.600
What are you hoping for?

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:39.554
AUDIENCE: I think a 10.

01:07:39.554 --> 01:07:41.855
AUDIENCE: A 10 or a heart.

01:07:41.855 --> 01:07:43.480
PROFESSOR: So you
want to be screaming.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.313
I'm going to press it
on the count of three.

01:07:45.313 --> 01:07:48.630
You want to be
screaming 10 or higher.

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:50.170
And you want to be screaming--

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.170
AUDIENCE: Anything else.

01:07:57.210 --> 01:08:00.769
PROFESSOR: So I guess
you got all three of us.

01:08:00.769 --> 01:08:02.560
There's going to be
more of these good card

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.268
stories in class.

01:08:03.268 --> 01:08:05.130

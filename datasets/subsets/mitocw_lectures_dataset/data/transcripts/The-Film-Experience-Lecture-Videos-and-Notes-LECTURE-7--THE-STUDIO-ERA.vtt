DAVID THORBURN: Welcome people.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.290
I'm glad to see
you this afternoon.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.690
We finally make our
transition to sound film.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.870
I hope that you endured the
silent era with good spirits.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.330
I think you'll find, as
the semester goes on,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.080
that even some of the
silent films you found less

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.080
compelling when you began
will resonate for you

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.570
and become more valuable.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.550
And my expectation
is that some of you

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.240
will decide, after the fact,
that Keaton and Chaplain,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.060
and perhaps even for some
of you Murnau, presented you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.130
with films that were at least
as memorable as the most

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.280
memorable sound films.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.349
But we now move into a
segment of the course

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.590
in which every object has more
than merely artifactual a art

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.620
value, although the artifactual
value of these remarkable films

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.900
is very great.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.360
And as I indicated
earlier in the semester,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.530
my hope is to toggle back
and forth in some ways,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.220
in each of our conversations
about these films

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160
on our syllabus.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.300
To toggle back and
forth between what

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.530
we might think of as an
aesthetic perspective, talking

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.210
about the qualities
in these texts that

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.740
make them artful, memorable,
long lasting, worth

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.690
something even beyond
the eras in which they

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.610
were created on the one side.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.290
And then on the other side,
more an anthropological kind

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.400
of perspective rather
than an aesthetic one.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.920
What do these texts tell
us about the culture

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.110
from which they come?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.490
In what ways do the
social, and moral,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.050
and political mythologies
of the society

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.240
find complex articulation
in these texts?

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.610
So those are the two
sort of perspectives

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.750
between which we oscillate.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.340
We now turn to the
kind of film that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.530
emerges after the
advent of sound in 1927.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.230
And we can say that the
period, roughly between 1927,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.060
1928-- when the first
sound films began

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.180
to be made-- and the
era into the 1950s,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.880
briefly after the advent of
television, that era is often

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.700
thought of as-- often called
by some film historians

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.510
the golden age of Hollywood.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.930
And it was in some respects,
maybe in many respects,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.020
a golden age.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.150
It was certainly a
golden age in terms

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.030
of the size and loyalty of the
audience for American movies.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.800
And I'll come back
to that in a moment.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.910
What happened of
course in the sound era

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.100
was that an industry emerged.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.550
A more neutral term for
the golden age of Hollywood

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.510
might just be the studio era.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.240
Because what happened
in the sound era

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.580
was a fortification
and extension

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.880
of the system that
had already emerged,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.540
and which we've discussed-- and
which David Cook catalogs very

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.390
fully in the required reading--
a fortification, an extension

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.360
of the system that had
emerged in the silent era.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.500
The mass production
system that was already

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.400
in place in the silent era
was perfected and extended.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.830
The principle of the
specialization of labor

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.130
became even more complex
and effectively deployed

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.860
in the production
of motion pictures.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.820
And in this period, in the
period between 1928 and 1930

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.750
for example,
Hollywood spent what

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.030
was then a tremendous amount
of money-- $500 million--

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.290
in gearing up for the
transition to sound.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.010
It was almost as if silent
films became obsolete

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.790
almost instantly.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.250
Almost instantly.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.980
And the famous
line from-- what's

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.390
the title of the
first sound film?

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.390
The Jazz Singer.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.920
Who's the star?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.800
The theater singer
Al Jolson, right.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.810
And there isn't very much
dialogue in that film,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.970
although there are some
8 interpolated songs.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.650
There's very little synchronous
dialogue, but there's a little.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.430
And one of the most
famous lines-- maybe

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.440
the most famous line in the
film-- comes at a certain point

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.920
where someone says "You
ain't heard nothing yet",

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.660
and the implication is you
ain't seen nothing yet either.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.130
And it is certainly the
case that within three years

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.460
there were no sound
films really being made.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.840
As I've suggested earlier, a
comic and still illuminating

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.210
perspective on this process
of Hollywood adjusting

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.550
to the advent of the
new technology of sound

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.190
is dramatized for us in
the wonderful musical

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.940
we're going to see in a few
weeks, Singing In The Rain.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.600
So in this era then,
after the advent of sound,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.380
the movies become America's
dominant entertainment form.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.675
And in the period
between 1930 and 1945,

00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:18.050
7,500 films are made by
the Hollywood production

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.500
system, approximately--
almost exactly in fact--

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.620
500 films a year.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.050
Think about the confidence
that this production system

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.630
needed to have in its capacity
to get a return on the number

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.810
of films that it turned out.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.320
And think about what it meant
that the entire society was now

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.150
geared toward this mass
form of entertainment.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.870
We can get some measure of
the tremendous popularity

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.490
of the movies, the centrality
that the movies assumed

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.470
by the end of the silent
era and into the sound era,

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.280
if we think of some numbers.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.790
In 1938, for example,
what we might

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.410
think of as the central, the
height, the apex of the studio

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.500
system, of the sound
era, there were

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.660
a total of 80 million
admissions per week

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.920
in the American movies.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.659
That comes to something
like 67% of the population.

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.700
Now I'm sure some people
were going to the movies

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.880
more than once a week,
so it isn't literally

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.410
as if 70% of the
population was attending

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.970
the movies every week, but
it's something close to that.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.430
Far more than half
the population

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.250
had an intimate, weekly,
habitual relationship

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.540
to the movies.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.750
And the form that the
Hollywood system took on

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.810
was surely, in
part, a reflection

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.040
of this increasingly intimate
and knowledgeable connection

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.900
between a mass
audience and the kinds

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.030
of movies, the kinds of stories
that Hollywood was pumping out.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.010
Can you think, for example,
why the broad attributes

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.350
of the system that I've
already described, can you

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.310
think about why those broad
attributes would encourage

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.350
the development of what we would
call a system based on stars,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.270
in which, movie stars, the
names of particular actresses

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.260
and actresses become so well
known that their names carry

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.760
the film.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.176
And people go to
the movies to see

00:07:10.176 --> 00:07:15.220
Gable, or Colbert, or whatever
famous performer, famous actor.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.390
And there were
dozens of such films,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.840
in a tiering system
in which there

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.350
were great stars at the top,
B level stars below them,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.030
C level actors and
actresses below them.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.690
And the border between those
were somewhat permeable.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.670
And an extraordinary number
of people in the society

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:38.080
were familiar not
only with these stars

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.830
and the particular films they
had made, and would follow them

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.820
from film to film, but
were all so familiar

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.490
with what was a partly
mythological and fictional

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.000
story about their private lives
that the Hollywood publicity

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.820
system kept pumping out about
the stars and performers.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.100
And what was essentially
created was a kind

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.250
of mythological system in which
the stars were literally--

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.500
for the audience-- characters
or creatures who are literally

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.680
larger than life.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.100
And something, some vestigial
form of that star system

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.680
still survives today in the
great celebrity stars, rock

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.070
stars, and some of the
great movie stars of today,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.070
but it's on very
different scale.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.850
And the number of such
recognizable figures

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.232
is much smaller
today than it was

00:08:20.232 --> 00:08:21.690
in the heyday of
the Hollywood era,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.740
when there were dozens and
dozens of actors and actresses

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.920
whose entire careers were known
intimately by the audience

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.266
and whose work from film
to film was something

00:08:31.266 --> 00:08:32.890
that particular
members of the audience

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:38.760
would follow religiously, would
follow as if they were members

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.280
of a kind of fan club.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.640
And then the second
aspect of the star system

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.150
was-- coupled to it and
linked to it-- was what

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.100
we might call a genre system.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.330
What's a genre?

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.370
A category or a kind of story.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.870
So the elegy is a poetic
genre, and the western

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.250
is a narrative genre.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.020
And as soon as we mention
western, or elegy,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.340
or situation comedy-- to talk
about a dominant television

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.730
genre-- as soon as we say
that, a set of expectations

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.500
immediately enters
our mind, right?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.612
We know that there are certain
features that westerns have.

00:09:13.612 --> 00:09:15.320
We immediately know
when we hear the word

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.310
western what historical
era the story is set in.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.340
We know what the
costumes will be like.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.120
We can predict what
kinds of animals

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.740
we're likely to see in the film.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.310
We can even, if we know
the western genre well,

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.230
we could even predict pretty
accurately what kind of story

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.420
we're likely to be told, and
what the rhythms or trajectory

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.910
of that story might be.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.220
Not because we know
the particular western,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.330
but because we
know the category.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.860
And every western that
calls itself a western

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.050
is in some sense in conversation
with every previous western.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.960
What we're talking
about here, in part,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.380
is a new form of literacy.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.300
Or at least not
exactly a new form,

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.190
but a central form of literacy.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.380
A form of literacy that
emerges in popular art

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.560
when a mass audience
becomes more and more

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.280
knowledgeable about the
conventions, and operations,

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.340
and formulas on which
the system depends.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.430
By the middle of the 1930s,
virtually the whole history

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.570
of the silent era and
all the new genres that

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.630
were elaborated and fulfilling
themselves in the sound era,

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.470
were now intimately
known by segments, if not

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.070
the entire American audience.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.940
So to come back to
my question, why

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.660
would a system that emphasized
the repetition of stars

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.000
and the repetition of
genres across experiences

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.150
be a particularly appropriate
or useful one for the kind

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.460
of system I've described?

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.860
What's the answer?

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.510
If it's a mass
production system.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.460
The alternative would be, to
clarify my question, why would

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.940
we not have a system in
which every movie was

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.510
a unique experience?

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.160
Did not make gestures toward
a whole class of other stories

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.470
to which it belongs in,
which it wants the audience

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.000
to compare it.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.794
Or that a series of
stars would emerge,

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.460
so that every time
you see a Clark Gable

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.980
movie, or a Claudette
Colbert movie,

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.500
or a Barbara Stanwyck movie,
you associate those performances

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.460
in those films with all
the earlier performances

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.510
in which you've see-- why
does that system work?

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.560
What's the answer?

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.350
All right.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.200
That's right.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.650
Because it familiar,
you know what to expect.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.172
It's a branding.

00:11:23.172 --> 00:11:24.630
And in fact, if
you think about it,

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.470
if you want people to shell
out money every single week,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.710
you can understand why the
notion that they should

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.770
be getting something familiar
might work, might be important.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.770
It's possible that
you could get people

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.049
to spend all of a
significant amount of money,

00:11:37.049 --> 00:11:38.590
or at least a small
amount of money--

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.410
in the early days
admissions we're not

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.650
that expensive--
for one experience,

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.070
but if you expect them to do
it week after week after week,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.070
it's natural that
you would expect

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.680
that the system
that would develop

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.300
would offer the audience
certain familiar landmarks.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.735
In other words,
the answer-- and I

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:01.610
think it's a very good
answer-- the answer is

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.770
that a mass production
system lends itself

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.000
to principles of repetition
and economies of scale.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.130
What's an obvious thing,
if you're a studio

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.460
and you make a lot of Westerns,
how can you save money?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.330
Do you have to hire
the horses every time?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.900
Maybe you have your own stable.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.494
Not only that, maybe if you
have a scene of a stampede,

00:12:20.494 --> 00:12:22.160
you could use it in
more than one movie,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.630
you don't have to film it again.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.450
And in fact, a lot
of early Westerns

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.980
have stock footage
that were put in.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.642
They would film a tremendously
exciting cattle stampede

00:12:31.642 --> 00:12:34.100
and they would use it in four
or five different movies that

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.420
needed stampedes.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.686
The same with the sets.

00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:38.560
They don't have to tear
down the Western town

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.250
and rebuild it for every movie.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.390
So in other words, one
could say that there

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.420
are economic incentives
that encourage this system.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.680
But this is another example
of that magnificent paradox

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.170
that I spoke to
you about earlier

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.540
in the term, the paradox that
the crassest of alliances

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.940
between commerce and
technology should

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.710
be the enabling conditions
of a narrative art.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.300
Why?

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.550
Because even though the
origins of these strategies

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.300
may very well have been
totally commercial, as they

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.400
begin to elaborate
themselves, they inevitably

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.810
become more complex.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.326
The audiences begin to
generate expectations.

00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:14.950
The people who are
repeating themselves

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.460
begin to repeat
themselves with variation.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.600
Even if they never
intended to get better,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.520
they would get better.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.490
And of course some of them
are excellent professionals

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.890
and they do want to do
a better and better job.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.860
So what happens is the system
begins to refine itself,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.110
even if it begins in the
crassest of intentions.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.650
Figure out a way to save
money and make as much money

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.249
as we can, by
giving the audience

00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:37.540
the same thing again and again.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.200
If the audience would buy the
same story over and over again,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.310
no doubt Hollywood
would give it to them.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.130
But of course, they have to
introduce variations just

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.100
to make a living.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.450
Just to make people come back.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.290
And then as these variations
begin to elaborate themselves,

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.800
something complex and
rich begins to emerge.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.730
And this knowledge
that the audience has

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.890
becomes what we might
call a form of literacy,

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.710
a form of popular literacy.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.160
So there's much more one
could say about this,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.530
and I'm being very
abrupt and overly brief

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.810
about the way this
system elaborated.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.020
Suffice it to say that
there emerged in this era

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.310
a series of recognizable
separate categories of movie

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.810
making.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:29.450
Westerns, gangster films,
various forms of comedy,

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.190
various forms of social
realism, certain forms

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.610
of historical spectacle.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:39.490
And other smaller genres like
the newspaper picture, which

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.920
is a kind of smaller sub genre.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.920
We're going to see one
example of that tonight.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.392
And so that what
I'm trying to do

00:14:45.392 --> 00:14:47.850
over the next couple of weeks,
and especially in this week,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.480
is trying to demonstrate
these principles in small,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.280
by talking today especially
about certain aspects

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.490
of screwball comedy.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.460
And by placing that
particular central Hollywood

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.090
genre in the larger context
of this manufacturing system,

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.630
this mythological system
that we've been describing.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.430
One way of explaining
what I'm trying to get out

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.700
when I talk about
these stars and genres,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.190
and the purely
commercial origins

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.580
of what becomes a rich set
of narrative expectations,

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.830
is to say that what I'm
really implicitly dealing with

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.800
is a problem.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.862
It will seem less of a
problem to your generation

00:15:27.862 --> 00:15:29.320
than it did to
generations earlier.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.260
But it took a long time
before the American Society

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.710
began to recognize that the
movies were a signature art

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.610
form of American society, and
that if American society was

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.210
going to be remembered for
its artistic achievements

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.360
in the 20th century,
the movies were going

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:51.100
to be one of the prime instances
of its artistic identity

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.090
as a society.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.510
It took a long time for
Americans to recognize this.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.010
In fact, the Europeans
recognized it

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.450
before the Americans did.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.270
And one of the fundamental
reasons for that

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.190
is that our ideas
about what art is

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.070
were inherited notions
that came essentially

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.030
from the traditions of
romanticism and modernism,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.340
which lead tremendous
emphasis on pure originality.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.390
On the idea that the work of
art has to be sui generis,

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.810
unique to itself.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.090
That it has to grow out only
of the individual genius

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.230
of the artist.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.820
Well, this notion of art is
actually a very time-bound one.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.812
It's not really a universal
notion of art at all.

00:16:26.812 --> 00:16:28.770
The notion of art that
I want to suggest to you

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.080
was a more populist one.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.130
It goes back to Homer and
to the various forms of Epic

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.580
Performance, and this
notion of artisan

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.160
work-- a communal one,
in which the artist is

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.939
a singer or a speaker to the
main parts of the community,

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:44.980
to the whole of the
community, or to a large part

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.730
of the community.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.690
And in order to do
that kind of singing,

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.590
to do that kind of address,
the singer, the poet,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.390
the storyteller needs to use the
categories and the story forms,

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.592
and the language that
is known by the majority

00:17:00.592 --> 00:17:01.300
of the community.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.890
The aesthetic for
this kind of art

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.109
is an aesthetic of
familiarity, in which meaning

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:14.260
and significance
is generated not

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.359
by a shock of total
recognition of everything

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:20.181
in the text being new or
innovative, but by something

00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:20.680
else.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.819
By the fact that certain
very familiar strategies

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.619
are suddenly very,
very slightly.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.500
And it's the slight
variation from the familiar

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.540
that generates the significance.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.840
And I'm going to try to
demonstrate these principles.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.997
In fact, all of
the clips and films

00:17:36.997 --> 00:17:39.080
that you're going to see
over the next few weeks--

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.950
and especially in today's
viewing and lectures--

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.650
are embodiments or
instances of this principle,

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.700
as I hope you will see.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.640
What we're talking
about here, to borrow

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.780
a phrase from the film
scholar Leo Brody, whose

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.440
essay An Aesthetics
of Connection

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.610
is required reading
in the course,

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.880
we might say that what we're
trying to identify here

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.320
is an aesthetics of
connection, in which the links

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.540
and connections
amongst different texts

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.910
or amongst different
performances, are emphasized.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.300
In which the familiar
is a central element

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.870
in artistic experience.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.180
Most people love to
recognize the familiar.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.440
It is not the case
that art always

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.670
must continually surprise you.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.010
In fact, art that is
constantly surprising,

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.170
that makes no assumptions
that you can share,

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:30.670
or that allude to
or refer to earlier

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.730
forms of the experience,
probably such a text

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.850
doesn't even exist.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.820
Even if the allusion or
reference to ancestors

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.440
is one of antagonism in
which the text is saying

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.700
look how different I
am from my ancestors,

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.990
it still needs its
ancestors in some way.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:51.670
So the notion that a text can
be entirely creatively original

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.110
is itself a kind of modernist
and romantic fallacy.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.480
In any case, the
artistic principles

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.980
on which the Hollywood
film is based

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.190
are artistic principles
we could identify

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.700
as populist or democratic.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.050
Democratist.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.490
And they're based on the idea
that the familiar and the

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.210
every day can be
transmuted into something

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.980
more complex by good
performances, by good writing,

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.850
by the creation of
a compelling story.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:21.220
And that meaning is created
not by a single unique creative

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.380
act, but essentially
by a conversation

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.510
on communal process, in
which a particular perception

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.940
or sense of the world is
juxtaposed against older

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.260
instances of the same thing.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.180
And by comparison, one learns
something about where one

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.510
is in the particular new text.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.800
An Aesthetic of Connection.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.100
It's one measure
of the complexity

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.600
and social centrality of the
movies in the 1930s, '40s,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.705
and early '50s, that we
can find in the system

00:19:52.705 --> 00:19:55.280
three separate kinds of comedy.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.630
It's a measure of its
maturity, by not just one

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.650
but three fairly robust
separate strains of comedy.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.690
And this even excludes musical
comedy, the musical film,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.600
which could be said to be
even yet a fourth strain.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.710
Not just one form
then, but three.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.387
And the form of comedy
we're focusing on today

00:20:13.387 --> 00:20:14.970
is screwball comedy,
but I want to say

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.830
a word about the
other two strains

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.820
to give you at least some sense
of where we're coming from.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.940
The first significant
strain that I

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:30.280
would like to mention to you
is what I call anarchic comedy.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.180
It mobilizes something
that's elemental.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.120
An elemental impulse in many
comedies and maybe in the comic

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.530
impulse itself at
some very deep level,

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.500
which is an impulse toward
anarchic destruction.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.780
There's always, hidden
in comedy, at least

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.220
a kind of skepticism
or suspicion

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.470
or hostility toward
the established

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.110
and the respectable.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.660
And one form that that
can take in comedies

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.640
is a kind of systematic
anarchy, in which

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:06.730
the large respected
structures of a culture

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.620
are systematically-- or
sometimes unsystematically--

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.120
disabled or dismembered.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.240
And over and over again, in the
comedies of the Marx brothers,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.860
something like this happens.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.120
I won't mention
titles, but there

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.490
are a number of titles-- I
think I mentioned one of them

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.680
last week or the week
before-- A Night at the Opera,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.180
which concludes with the entire
set of the opera falling apart,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.060
breaking down.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.590
And that kind of
destructive-- there's

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.900
another film that
the Marx brothers

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.810
made in which they are
on a football team,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.320
and we see one of the things
that Groucho does in that film

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.225
is he gets the ball and
he runs the wrong way.

00:21:48.225 --> 00:21:50.100
And he scores a touchdown
for the other team,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.766
but then he keeps
running, and he starts

00:21:51.766 --> 00:21:53.000
running out of the stadium.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.990
It was a sense that, the
rules of this games are silly,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.950
let's ignore them.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.290
And so this sense of the
dissolution of boundaries

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.610
and the anarchic chaos that
follows from the breaking

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.340
down of established
categories and edifices

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.510
is part of the pleasure of
these Marx brothers' comedy.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.260
And it even extends,
in some way,

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.600
to a kind of deconstructive
attitude toward language

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.460
itself.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.560
And many times the dialogue
in a Marx brothers film

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.040
will go nowhere, it will be
able end up making no sense.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.780
So even language
itself is reduced

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.590
to a kind of anarchic
nonsense at times,

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.055
in the Marx brothers films.

00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:38.230
An even cruder version of this
would be in The Three Stooges.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.120
The Three Stooges are
a version of this kind

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.180
of anarchic comedy.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.320
And there's a final
version I should mention,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.220
a rather distinguished
one in it's own way, films

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.170
that are associated with
the actor W.C. Fields,

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.090
a gravelly voiced comedian
who often portrayed

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.520
people who were
half drunk and were

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.610
very hostile toward children,
very anti-sentimental.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.200
He would kick children,
or spit at them,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.910
act as if children were
smelly, annoying things who

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.350
should get out of his way so we
could keep drinking his scotch,

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.314
that sort of thing.

00:23:08.314 --> 00:23:09.980
So there was both an
anarchic and a kind

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.820
of subversive element
to this kind of comedy.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.150
A second strain of comedy, even
more powerful and artistically

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.055
more valuable.

00:23:17.055 --> 00:23:19.700
A very, very
interesting one, which

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.090
continues to be influential.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.350
Films from this tradition
have been remade recently

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.380
in American cinema.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:34.250
And this is the strain of
comedy we would call worldly,

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.580
that other scholars have
called, it's not my label.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.060
And one thing that the
label intends to acknowledge

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.000
is that many of these
directors in this tradition

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.210
were Europeans.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.800
And they brought a European
attitude, especially

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.260
toward sexuality.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.360
They were much more amused than
shocked by sexual shenanigans.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.150
So one measure of
worldly comedy was

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.280
it had a more generous
and a less puritanical

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.270
attitude toward infidelity,
toward the body itself,

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.920
toward sexual allusion,
and sexual by-play.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.320
They still were not explicit
by today's standards.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.980
You didn't see nudity
in these films.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.660
But they were more
open about the fact

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.120
that men and women actually
engage in that behavior,

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.860
and even sometimes
take pleasure in it.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.590
An acknowledgment that was more
difficult for non-worldly films

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:24.180
to make.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.995
And the central director
of this tradition,

00:24:25.995 --> 00:24:28.970
although there were
others, was Ernst Lubitsch.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.910
I put his name up
on the board there.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.260
His dates are 1892 to 1947,
and he made a series of films,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.070
especially in the '30s
through the early '40s, that

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.660
are still regarded as classics
of this kind of worldly comedy.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.650
Trouble In Paradise,
Design For Living,

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.920
a film called Ninotchka in 1939.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.570
A film called To Be or Not To Be
in 1942, an immensely bold film

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:59.840
in which Jack Benny the comedian
plays an actor who impersonates

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.380
Hitler.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.980
The film is set in Berlin, and
he actually plays as a double

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.830
of Hitler.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.300
A very bold film, on a
par-- and intellectually,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.070
I think, and artistically
an even more powerful film

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.660
than Chaplin's The
Great Dictator,

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:20.390
although it shares
the same ambition.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:27.460
And these worldly comedies
often told infidelity stories,

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.640
or stories, as I've
suggested, that took

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.470
a much more benign
and amused attitude

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.046
toward our sexual
crimes and misdemeanors.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.760
Both these strains of comedy
are robust and deeply popular

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.570
in the era.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.900
But the form of comedy
that I want us to focus on,

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.520
that we're centering on in this
week, is the most important

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.550
of all of these
strains of comedy,

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.820
it's what has come to be
called screwball comedy.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.710
And let me say a few things
about screwball comedy

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:05.230
as a category, describe
it a little bit,

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.990
and then I want to
show you two clips that

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.340
are intended to illustrate
many of the principles I'm

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.080
trying to articulate here.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.900
And we'll come back to
this idea of star and genre

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.950
in these clips as well because
those elements are also

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.120
at issue or embedded in
what I want you to look at.

00:26:27.882 --> 00:26:29.340
Maybe I should've
mentioned, if you

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:35.420
were curious about the later
incarnations of worldly comedy,

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.310
I meant to mention that
for example in 1998,

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.612
Nora Ephron made a film
called You've Got Mail.

00:26:40.612 --> 00:26:41.820
How many of you have seen it?

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.810
At least a couple.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.590
That's a remake of one
of Lubitsch's films.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.630
And in fact, the Lubitsch
film, A Shop Around The Corner,

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.260
is a much more wonderful film.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.270
And it's a measure,
I think, in part

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.800
of the power and authority
of Lubitsch's imagination

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.240
and the elegance of
his comedies that they

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.460
continue to inspire
imitation in that way.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:08.355
What screwball comedy is,
in some ways, a distinctive,

00:27:08.355 --> 00:27:11.560
a signature form
of American movies.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.130
It's a unique equation of
Hollywood in the depression

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.200
years.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.540
It's derived in part from
Broadway farces of the 1920's,

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.270
and also from the slap
stick physical comedy

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.320
of the silent era.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.130
It's a kind of
marriage or hybrid.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.010
And remember--
we've already said

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.290
this but let me remind you--
one measure of a mature medium

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.520
or of a medium that's coming
into maturity-- an expressive

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.990
medium, a communications
medium-- one

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.730
measure of its maturity or
of its emerging maturity

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.180
is that forms that used to be
thought to be separate, marry.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.229
Become hybridized.

00:27:46.229 --> 00:27:48.520
One of the things I was
suggesting about Chaplin's work

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.670
is it suggests a new
maturity in the film,

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.060
in the cinema as an
institution because it's

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.040
marrying comedy and
melodrama, because Chaplin

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.120
bring seriousness into comedy.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.540
He slows it down, it's not
merely just slapstick anymore,

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.510
it's also
psychologically resonant.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.700
Not only can it make you
laugh, it can move you.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.320
That marriage or hybridization
of two essentially

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.040
separate forms--
melodrama, comedy--

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.430
makes for a richer film.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.910
I'm saying the same kind of
thing about this particular

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:25.630
form of comedy, this
merging of ancestor forms,

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.040
of the slapstick comedy
of the silent era--

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.770
and of course the slapstick
comedy of the silent era has

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.900
its ancestors in
stage slapstick--

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.800
and fast dialogue and witty
repartee that was especially

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.280
characteristic of a
series of Broadway farces,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.200
made in 19-teens and the 1920's.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.520
But the particular
historical moment

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.240
in which this form
emerges is also

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.690
a shaping factor in
the kind of comedy

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.070
and the subject matter
of these comedies.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.980
The key qualities
of screwball comedy

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.880
were a kind of irreverent
humor, something

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.460
of the anarchic
subversive skepticism

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.390
that's characteristic of
many comic perspectives,

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.170
coupled with very fast
paced vernacular dialogue.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.900
One way to think
about screwball comedy

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.780
is to say it's one
of the first forms,

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.750
along with singing
movies, movies that

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.060
have singing in-- I don't
want to call the musicals yet

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.090
because sometimes they
weren't fully musicals,

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.810
although musicals
do emerge at a very

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.010
early time-- but any movie
that had singing in it,

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:30.870
like some westerns.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.310
Early western's
had singing in it.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.810
Why?

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.210
Because sound had just
come in, it was a novelty.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.090
The screwball comedy
is one of the forms

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:42.930
that exploits sound in a really
expressive and powerful way,

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.060
compelling way, because
it's full of dialogue.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:49.430
It's full of witty, rapid
dialogue, most often arguments

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.010
or conflicts or quarrels
between men and women,

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:56.340
dramatizing certain kinds
of conflicts of gender

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.050
in the course of the film.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.560
So, key qualities.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.390
Irreverent humor, a kind of
vernacular fast-paced dialogue,

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:08.780
a fast physical pace as
well, full of slapstick.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.610
So a physical quick pace
and a verbal quick pace

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.670
that are often in competition
with each other to see which

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.740
can be more irreverent and
quick and fast and abrupt.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.000
Eccentric, often high born
characters, who are made fun of

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.970
and mocked.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.460
A lot of the
screwball comedy deals

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.390
with the upper social
orders, but they're

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.700
seen as clownish or
foolish in some way.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.540
And in many screwball comedies,
the wealthy characters

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.640
need to be rescued
by their servants.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.530
It's a very modest
form of class warfare,

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:46.152
in which-- again, remember it's
the American capitalist system

00:30:46.152 --> 00:30:47.860
that's making these
stories, so we're not

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.240
going to have a
Marxist comedy that

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.630
says that the government should
be overthrown by violence--

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:59.500
but the comedy is constrained
in certain ways, what

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.070
the story's able to say, what
the films are able to say.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.670
This is a matter to which
I'll return tonight and talk

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:09.720
a little bit more fully about
the ideological and political

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.440
limits that are imposed
on the Hollywood system

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.980
because it has to
appeal to everyone.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.970
I think what I have to say will
clarify these questions in ways

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.440
that you'll find very helpful.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.614
But for now, let's stick
with screwball comedy itself.

00:31:26.614 --> 00:31:28.280
These high born
characters then, they're

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.600
criticized and seen as
clownish, but they're never

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.380
seen as morally evil in
the way that a Marxist

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:37.310
or a social historian
might regard them.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.470
The stories are often very
deeply improbable ones

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:46.395
that are set among the
irresponsible wealthy,

00:31:46.395 --> 00:31:49.550
the irresponsibly
wealthy people.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.465
Often the aristocrats are very
spoiled and hard drinking.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.530
In one of the most famous of
these, a film made in 1937

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:03.110
titled My Man Godfrey, directed
by Gregory La Cava, Carole

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:06.280
Lombard and William
Powell, two of the central

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.710
to screwball comedy
performers, are the stars.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:17.810
And there is a scene in a
shantytown by the river,

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.140
in which the poor are located.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.690
And the film seems
to make some sort

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:26.230
of an acknowledgement of the
fact that the poor are here.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.720
It's acknowledging the
horrors of the Depression.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.490
But it solves the horrors
of the Depression in the end

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.690
by having the wealthy people
build a nightclub on the river

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:38.370
banks to create employment
for all the unemployed.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.530
And it's a very imposed-- and
rather foolish in some sense--

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.410
happy ending.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:46.040
So that film
acknowledges more fully

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.830
than some screwball comedies
the actual existence

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.830
of shanty towns and places where
homeless people, or people who

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.870
have to live under canvas live.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.310
Many screwball comedies
didn't even go that far,

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:02.260
but it solves the social
problem in a characteristically

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.730
mythological and magical,
socially incredible way.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:10.150
Another aspect of these films
is that they foregrounded women,

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.230
and this is a very
important aspect of it.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.370
This is partly a function of
the fact that in the 1920s,

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.940
the era of the flappers,
a new kind of sexually

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.334
liberated woman
begins to appear.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.250
Some of that is an
outgrowth of the fact that,

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:30.120
during the First World War
when so many American men were

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:35.510
in uniform, women got new
jobs and were able to work,

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.840
enter the workforce
for the first time.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.860
And that created
moments of freedom

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.080
for women that had never existed
in American society before.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.880
And some of that is reflected
in screwball comedy,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.400
and in other films as well,
but especially in the screwball

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.600
comedies of the era.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.200
So it foregrounds women.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.660
And it shows women who often
have a great deal more energy

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.530
and freedom than the females
in other films of the era.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.200
Very often in these
films, marriage

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.587
is seen for the first time
as a partnership of equals.

00:34:05.587 --> 00:34:07.670
And as you'll see in It
Happened One Night, that's

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.960
the ideal of marriage that's
dramatized in that film,

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.790
one of the two
screwball comedies

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.150
we'll be looking
at this evening.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:19.900
So these films also reflected
the social disorientation

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.050
of the '30s, the uncertain
values that were represented

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.659
during the Depression.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:29.670
The fear, in some sense, that
the culture was breaking down

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.449
or that the fabric of society
was tearing in some ways.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:36.100
And so these films
were ironically

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.719
simultaneously escapist, because
they were screwball comedies

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:42.040
and they did zany
things, and they often

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.710
had ridiculous or improbable
plots and improbable

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.080
characters, and yet
at the same time

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.270
the anxiety that
they also dramatize,

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.409
the anxiety of things falling
apart, of the center not

00:34:52.409 --> 00:35:01.340
holding, of a kind
danger to the established

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.910
structures and belief systems
of the society, underlay

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:09.200
even the most apparently
escapist of these films.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.340
So there's a subtext
of strong women,

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:16.260
of quarreling and
manipulative men.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.600
And especially, of
course, one of the things

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.140
this dramatized for
us were intelligent

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.340
and witty women, like
Katharine Hepburn

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.500
in Bringing Up
Baby, or Claudette

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.960
Colbert in the film you're
going to see tonight,

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.540
It Happened One Night,
or Rosalind Russell,

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.210
in the second screwball comedy
you're going to see tonight,

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:37.880
His Girl Friday.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.170
And then finally, implicit
in what I've been saying

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:47.060
is that there are
implicit in these stories,

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.420
sometimes rising to
the surface, sometimes

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.160
just beneath the
surface, but there

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.220
are as a kind of
hint or anxiety,

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.420
are what we might call first
some form of class conflict.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.270
Some sense that the class
structure of the United States

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:00.980
is a problem, that
the Depression is

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.330
causing difficulties.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.860
And second, a form
of sexual warfare,

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.200
in which the inequality
between men and women,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.130
and the unequal relations
that men and women have

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:14.440
in the society are put in
question, are quarreled with.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.070
In some sense, even mocked.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.130
And in many of these films, the
actress is the dominant figure

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.192
and the male character
is the secondary figure.

00:36:22.192 --> 00:36:24.650
And even in some of the films
where the male characters are

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:29.040
even more powerful, the best one
can say is that they're equals.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.270
And that in itself, regardless
of what the plot does,

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.580
was in some sense, not
exactly revolutionary,

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.100
but transformative.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.279
Potentially transformative.

00:36:36.279 --> 00:36:38.320
Well, what I want to do
with the time I have left

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.420
is show you two
clips, and they're

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.500
intended to dramatize
many of the principles

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.500
I've been talking about.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.333
So let me rehearse them
very quickly to you.

00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:52.070
I'm going to show you two clips
from two separate screwball

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:52.600
comedies.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.320
One, directed by Preston Sturges
in 1941, called The Lady Eve.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.720
A second, directed
by Howard Hawks,

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.330
the director of the
second film we're

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:03.470
going to see tonight,
Ball of Fire.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:06.290
Hawks is probably, of all
the directors, the one most

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.970
identified with
screwball comedy,

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.200
although as you'll see
tonight when I talk a bit more

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.379
about him, he was a master
of other genres as well.

00:37:13.379 --> 00:37:15.420
But the reason I want you
look at these two clips

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.630
is-- I have multiple reasons.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.750
It's the multiplicity
principle in criticism.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.110
What I want you to recognize
as you're looking at this,

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.110
is first the power
of the star system.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.600
Because here's Barbara Stanwyck.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.070
At this point in
her career, she's

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:36.430
one of the dominant female
stars in the society, one

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.520
of the biggest moneymakers
in the society.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.180
And here we see her in two films
that are in the same genre.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:45.280
Two different versions
of screwball comedy.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.010
As you're watching,
think about the way

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:51.060
in which the persona
that she established,

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.940
the kind of character she
stood for in film to film,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.450
is both stable
but also changing.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.140
That is to say, the
pleasure you take

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.360
in watching the two different
versions of Stanwyck

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.110
is an embodiment of the
principle I was talking about

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.080
before, when I said that we
need an aesthetic of connection.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.650
We need to recognize
that it's the familiar,

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.420
rather than the completely
strange and new,

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.500
that can generate
profound, complex sentence

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.090
of artistic achievement.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.480
Because the Stanwyck we
see in these two films

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.490
is in many ways a radically
different character,

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.394
but we can also see
certain continuities

00:38:28.394 --> 00:38:29.310
across her characters.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.310
And we can take pleasure both
in what is the same about her,

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:36.260
but even more we can take
pleasure in the variations

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.670
she's working on this persona.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:41.380
So one of things
that is embedded here

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:47.360
is a notion of acting that
emerges in the studio era that

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.000
establishes American
acting as something

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.820
different from the classical
British theory of what

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.040
an actor is.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.090
The classical British
theory of what an actor is

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:59.417
is that the actor submerges
herself in her role

00:38:59.417 --> 00:39:01.250
and becomes indistinguishable
from the role.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.430
And that you shouldn't
even be able to recognize

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:04.920
the actor from role to role.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.640
The American system that emerges
from Hollywood and from movies

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.410
is an opposite one,
in which you are not

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.389
only are you supposed
to recognize the actor,

00:39:13.389 --> 00:39:15.180
you're supposed to take
pleasure in the way

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.350
the actor-- it's
not really Barbara

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.990
Stanwyck but the character that
Stanwyck plays, the persona

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:24.620
Stanwyck established is in
film after film after film,

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.760
how does that persona evolve?

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.046
Change in nuances, when
that persona is presented

00:39:31.046 --> 00:39:32.420
with different
sets of questions,

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.545
different sets of problems.

00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:35.630
And what you can
feel-- and this isn't

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.560
just true of the
actresses of course,

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.944
it's even truer for the male
stars who had more freedom,

00:39:40.944 --> 00:39:42.610
there were more rules
available to them.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.880
So people who are interested in
Clark Gable or Humphrey Bogart

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.440
could watch these actors across
a range of films, each time

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.930
not getting the same
experience, but watching

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.870
a variation on the persona
that the actor was setting up.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.970
So a new idea of acting,
a different conception

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:04.070
of what an actors job might be
and of how the audience might

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.550
have a kind of
literacy in performance

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.520
that would enhance
and complicate

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.510
their sense of any
individual performance,

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:12.490
emerges in this era as well.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.492
And the Stanwyck clips
demonstrate that.

00:40:15.492 --> 00:40:16.950
The second thing
I want you to see,

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.920
again, same principle,
having to do with screwball

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.780
comedy itself.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.740
Here are two different
screwball comedies,

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.110
look at the differences in tone.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.680
They belong to
the same genre, we

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.580
can feel how much they
belong to the same category,

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.320
but also how much variation
there is between them.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.150
So the point is, it isn't
a simple form of repetition

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.840
at all.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.180
It's a form of very complex
elaboration and complication,

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.570
in which the relation between
one text in the category

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.880
and another text is far
more complex, artistically

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.990
satisfying, and
rich than we might

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:53.060
imagine if we described this
system in too abstract a way.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.680
So here's the first
scene from The Lady Eve.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.420
And let me set the scene.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:01.980
In this scene, Barbara
Stanwyck plays a con lady.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.360
She's on a ship loaded
with wealthy aristocrats,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.740
wealthy American businessmen,
and she and her partner

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.930
are trying to goal
them out of money.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.700
And she's sitting
at dinner trying

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.700
to pick out a guy that is
going to become her mark,

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.090
played by the great American
comic and serious actor

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:20.910
Henry Fonda.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.802
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.410
DAVID THORBURN:
He's very wealthy.

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.700
Everybody knows
he's very wealthy.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:40.520
He's the son of a beer
magnate, an ale magnate.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.890
He's sitting down in the dining
hall of this cruise ship.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:49.110
And all the fortune
hunting women

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.967
who are there wanting to marry
rich men are staring at him.

00:42:04.404 --> 00:42:05.856
-Not good enough.

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:06.614
-What did you say?

00:42:06.614 --> 00:42:08.280
-I said they're not
good enough for him.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.170
Every Jane is giving
him the thermometer,

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:12.762
and he feels they're
just a waste of time.

00:42:12.762 --> 00:42:16.530
He's returning to his book,
he's deeply immersed in it.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.780
He sees no one except--
watch his head turn

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.230
when that kid goes by.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:21.565
Won't do you any good, dear.

00:42:21.565 --> 00:42:23.580
He's a bookworm, but
swing them anyway.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.700
Oh, now how about this one?

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.245
How would you like that
hanging on your Christmas tree?

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:28.953
Oh, you wouldn't?

00:42:28.953 --> 00:42:32.057
Well, what is your
weakness brother?

00:42:32.057 --> 00:42:33.640
DAVID THORBURN: So
Stanwyck has become

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.134
the narrator of this scene.

00:42:36.134 --> 00:42:38.300
But see what intelligence
she shows, what knowledge.

00:42:42.248 --> 00:42:45.092
-Look at that girl
over to his left.

00:42:45.092 --> 00:42:47.310
Look over to your
left, bookworm.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.040
There's a girl pining for you.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.880
A little further.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.730
Just a little further.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.590
There.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:54.870
Wasn't that worth looking for?

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:56.828
See those nice store
teeth, all beaming at you.

00:42:56.828 --> 00:42:58.000
Well, she recognises you.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.146
She up, she's down, she
can't make up her mind.

00:43:00.146 --> 00:43:00.770
She's up again.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.811
DAVID THORBURN: I hope
you see how brilliant this

00:43:02.811 --> 00:43:04.210
is because look
in her hand here,

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.365
we're looking at this
through the mirror

00:43:05.365 --> 00:43:06.650
as she's narrating it to us.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.775
-Went to manual training
school with in Louisville?

00:43:08.775 --> 00:43:09.650
Oh, you're not?

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.400
Well, you certainly
look exactly like him,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.105
it's certainly a
remarkable resemblance.

00:43:13.105 --> 00:43:14.450
But if you're not going
to ask me to sit down,

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.491
I suppose you're not going
to ask me to sit down.

00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:18.114
I'm very sorry, I
certainly hope I

00:43:18.114 --> 00:43:20.280
haven't caused you any
embarrassment, you so-and-so.

00:43:22.902 --> 00:43:24.830
I wonder if my
tie's on straight.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.890
I certainly upset them, don't I?

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:28.850
Now who else is after me.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:30.820
Ah, the lady champion wrestler.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.530
Wouldn't she make a houseful?

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:33.780
Oh, you don't like her either?

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.360
Well, what are going
to do about it?

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.860
Oh, you just can't
stand it anymore.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.610
You're leaving, these
women don't give you

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:39.750
a moment's peace, do they?

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.500
Well, go ahead.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.930
Go sulk in your cabin.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.430
Go soak your head
and see if I care.

00:43:47.374 --> 00:43:48.360
-Very sorry, sir.

00:43:59.476 --> 00:44:01.100
-Why don't you look
where you're going?

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:01.890
-Why don't I look?

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.566
-Look what you did to my shoe,
you knocked the heel off.

00:44:03.566 --> 00:44:04.065
-Oh, I did?

00:44:04.065 --> 00:44:05.230
Well, I'm certainly sorry.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.120
-You did, and you can just
take me right down to my cabin

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.328
for another pair of slippers.

00:44:08.328 --> 00:44:09.400
-Oh, well certainly.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.070
It's the least I can do.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.200
By the way, my name's Pike.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.160
-Oh, everybody knows that.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.400
Nobody's talking
about anything else.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.620
This is my father
Colonel Harrington.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.161
My name is Gene,
it's really Eugenia.

00:44:16.161 --> 00:44:17.992
Come on.

00:44:17.992 --> 00:44:19.800
[END PLAYBACK]

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.300
DAVID THORBURN: I
hope you recognize

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.090
the tremendous
intelligence and wit that

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:25.407
was embedded in that dialogue.

00:44:25.407 --> 00:44:26.490
That was a little too low.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:28.340
What is revealed
about that character,

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.390
dramatized about that character,
in that opening scene,

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:33.740
tells us almost everything
we need to know about her.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.320
Not everything, but
almost everything.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.820
And you can feel
the energy, the wit.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.320
And of course, who's in
control of that scene?

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.410
Not the man, but the woman.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.570
Now let's look at another
scene from Howard Hawks

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.110
film, Ball of Fire.

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:52.120
The basic situation is Gary
Cooper, the man in the middle

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.640
here, this fellow Gary
Cooper is the head

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.640
of a consortium of
scholars who are compiling

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.610
a dictionary of the
English language,

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:05.620
with special emphasis on
colloquial or slang English.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:10.384
And earlier in the film, Gary
Cooper went to a nightclub.

00:45:10.384 --> 00:45:12.800
And he saw the Barbara Stanwyck
character, who is actually

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:18.030
the mistress of a mob boss,
do a song and dance number.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.990
He spoke to her,
he interviewed her,

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:22.240
and he became very excited
by what she represented.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.640
By the linguistic resources,
the verbal realities

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.490
of the American language
that he'd been oblivious to.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.660
And he wants her to
contribute to his project.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.300
She's not interested.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:39.680
When she shows up at the lair
of the men of the scholars,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.120
when she invades the
nest of scholars,

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.640
she does it because--
although you don't know that

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.201
from seeing this clip,
but viewers of the film

00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:51.200
would know it-- because
she's really on the run.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.160
She's afraid that her
boyfriend, the mob boss,

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.680
is going to bump her off.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.030
So she needs to hide out.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.910
And that's really
why she's come here.

00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:59.430
All right.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:02.290
So here is this scene
from Ball of Fire.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.490
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.620
-Have I missed anything?

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.820
-No, I was just
about to explain.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.090
You see the word
puss means face.

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.590
As for instance, sour
puss, pickle puss.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:16.550
Sugar puss implies a certain
sweetness in her appearance.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.460
-Never mind the
etymology, was she--

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.800
-Was she blonde or brunette?

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.140
-Yes, which?

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.710
-That I don't know,
I didn't notice.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.205
But her vocabulary, even
an ordinary conversation--

00:46:25.205 --> 00:46:26.840
-Oh, you spoke to her?

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.340
-Yes.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:27.705
In her dressing room--

00:46:27.705 --> 00:46:28.800
-In her dressing room?

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.300
-Backstage?

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.820
-Yes.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:36.135
Unfortunately, she disclaimed
any interest in our project,

00:46:36.135 --> 00:46:39.030
in words so bizarre they
made my mouth water.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.885
Shove in your
clutch, for instance.

00:46:40.885 --> 00:46:42.020
-It's amazing.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.270
-Potts, could you tell us,
what was it like backstage?

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:45.750
-Very vivacious, I imagine.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:52.070
-Perhaps ballerinas giggling
up and down iron stair cases?

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.610
-Possibly wearing tights?

00:46:55.534 --> 00:46:57.200
DAVID THORBURN: I
hope you're picking up

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.530
the subtext that these
old men are revealing.

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:05.476
-It's getting a
bit late gentlemen.

00:47:05.476 --> 00:47:07.408
Perhaps we had
better get to bed.

00:47:16.585 --> 00:47:18.340
-Someday I'll tell
you my experiences

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.340
with a young actress
named Lillian Russel.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.010
-Did you know her?

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.146
-I stood in the snow
four hours to get--

00:47:24.146 --> 00:47:26.470
-Is that our doorbell?

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.910
But it's 12:25!

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:32.720
-Oh, must be the statistics
on San Salvador saltpeter.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.950
I asked for it to be sent--

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:36.158
DAVID THORBURN: Did anyone
pick up on the joke there?

00:47:36.158 --> 00:47:39.800
Why is there a joke in
reference to saltpeter?

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.610
It's used in the army to keep
men from getting too horny.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.800
It damps down your
sexual energies,

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.150
and he's writing an
article about saltpeter.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.240
-Hi-DE-ho!

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.584
Don't tell me I'm
too late for class.

00:48:00.584 --> 00:48:03.024
-Oh my goodness gracious me.

00:48:03.024 --> 00:48:04.839
-What is that?

00:48:04.839 --> 00:48:06.880
DAVID THORBURN: I don't
know what scholar came up

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.410
with this brilliant
description, but there's

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:13.820
a kind of convention
now among Capra's fans,

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.412
and fans of this movie, to refer
to this scene as the Snow White

00:48:17.412 --> 00:48:18.370
and Seven Dwarfs scene.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.760
-Those are my colleagues.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.200
-Oh!

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.140
-I must apologize for
their lack of costume.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.680
-Oh, that's all right professor.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.990
-I haven't got my tie on.

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:34.840
-Oh, you know once I watched
my big brother shave.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.146
-Would you come in?

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:37.930
-Why not?

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.090
-Frankly, your coming here
was the last thing I expected.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:42.345
Your no was so explicit.

00:48:42.345 --> 00:48:44.555
-Well, I got thinking
it over, and I

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:46.680
said to myself, who am I
to give science the brush?

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.255
-And I take it
you've reconsidered?

00:48:48.255 --> 00:48:49.380
-Yeah, that's the big idea.

00:48:52.747 --> 00:48:54.671
-Oh dear, oh dear.

00:48:54.671 --> 00:48:57.570
-Look out.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:59.180
-That was Professor Oddly.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.920
-Anymore of them around?

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.170
-I hope not.

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.080
-Hey, who decorated this place?

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.470
The mug that shot Lincoln?

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.040
-This is our work room.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.290
The living quarters
are upstairs.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.870
-Whee, that's a lot of books.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:14.010
All of them different?

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.680
-I trust.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.660
May I have your coat?

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.400
-Yeah, thanks.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:24.460
Oh, Greek philosophy.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.660
I've got a set like this
with a radio inside.

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.430
-Are you sure you
don't want your coat?

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:30.820
-No, I'm fine.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.055
Except I've got a
run in this stocking.

00:49:33.055 --> 00:49:34.510
Well how do we start, professor?

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.134
You see, this is the
first time anybody

00:49:36.134 --> 00:49:38.380
has moved in on
my brain Have you

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.490
got some kind of a machine, an
x-ray or a vacuum cleaner maybe

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:43.035
that's out the words you want?

00:49:43.035 --> 00:49:44.930
What's your method, professor?

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.280
-Well, it's quite simple.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.654
If you'll be here tomorrow
morning, not later than 9:30--

00:49:48.654 --> 00:49:49.510
-Tomorrow morning?

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:50.510
-Well, yes.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:52.410
I've arranged a
roundtable discussion

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:55.510
with a few people of
various backgrounds.

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:59.934
-You, you don't think we could
begin the begin right now?

00:49:59.934 --> 00:50:02.450
-Well, it's nearly
one o'clock Miss--

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:03.340
-Oh, fool professor.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.410
Let's get ourselves a couple of
drinks, light the fire maybe,

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.300
and you can start
working on me right way.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.100
-I wouldn't think of imposing
upon you at this hour.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.700
-Listen, I figured
I'm working all night.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.410
-Any hasty, random
discussion would

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:16.980
be of no scientific value.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.200
You see, I have to have my
notes thoroughly prepared

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.890
for the seminar tomorrow.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:22.390
-OK.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.570
Where do I sleep?

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.070
-I don't know,
where do you live?

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.012
-Up on riverside, but
I'm going to sleep here.

00:50:28.012 --> 00:50:29.338
-Here?

00:50:29.338 --> 00:50:31.530
Oh, you don't
understand Ms. O'Shea.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:34.200
We're all bachelors, with the
exception of Professor Oddly

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.220
who is a widower.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:38.620
Why, no woman ever--
even Ms Bragg,

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.450
who takes care of our needs--
goes home every night at 7:30.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.500
-If you want me tomorrow
morning at 9:30--

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.330
-Oh, I do Ms. O'Shea.

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:53.860
But even the most free-thinking
people must respect the--

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:54.380
-All right.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.820
Feel that.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.530
Go on, feel that foot.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.050
OK, tootsie bell,
what do you say?

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:02.645
-It's cold.

00:51:02.645 --> 00:51:05.734
-It's cold and it's wet.

00:51:05.734 --> 00:51:06.696
Now, come here.

00:51:09.582 --> 00:51:10.544
Come here.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.780
Closer.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.700
Closer.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.820
Oh, come on, give.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.815
Hello kids.

00:51:21.815 --> 00:51:23.430
Look down my throat.

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.030
Go on, look down.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:27.050
All right. [MUMBLING]

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.845
-I don't know what to look for.

00:51:28.845 --> 00:51:31.720
-There is possibly
a slight rosiness

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.300
in the laryngeal region.

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.840
-Slight rosiness?

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.270
It is as red as the Daily
Worker and just as sore.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.865
Who are you?

00:51:37.865 --> 00:51:39.240
DAVID THORBURN:
The Daily Worker.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.240
Red as the Daily Worker.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.036
Did you get that?

00:51:42.036 --> 00:51:42.892
No?

00:51:42.892 --> 00:51:45.017
The Daily Worker is a
communist newspaper,

00:51:45.017 --> 00:51:47.100
so when she says "it's as
red as The Daily Worker,

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.680
she's making a rather
witty joke, especially

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.912
for a gunman's maul.

00:51:51.912 --> 00:51:52.834
-Oh.

00:51:52.834 --> 00:51:54.678
-Professor Robinson, Law.

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:55.570
Professor--

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:56.070
-Ah, ah, ah.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:56.570
Not so fast.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:58.700
Just let it creep up on me.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.180
I'll get to know them.

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.430
Come here physiology, for
all I know I've got a fever.

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:03.490
Feel.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:04.320
-It's possible.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:04.820
-Certainly.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.410
And he wants to throw
me out on my tin.

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.970
There'll be no 9:30 for me if
you make me go out in the rain

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:10.470
now.

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:11.300
-Naturally not.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.860
-With the streets cold, and the
subway hot and full of germs?

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:14.450
-Oh.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:16.780
I'm a pushover
for streptococcus.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.320
Can I have this now, kid?

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.970
-We'll call you a
taxi, and furnish you

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:24.010
with woolen socks
and warm slippers.

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:25.930
-Really, I don't
understand you Potts.

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:28.410
Why take chance with
valuable material?

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:29.970
-Think of your article, Potts.

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:30.470
-See.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:31.470
They get the point.

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:33.610
-If I might venture
a suggestion,

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:37.340
why couldn't the young
lady sleep in my room?

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.345
-Professor Peagram!

00:52:39.345 --> 00:52:41.260
-I can bunk in with
Professor Robinson,

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.700
I sometimes do when
there's an electric storm.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.430
-Yes, he's afraid of thunder.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:47.880
-Well then, it's all settled.

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.200
Well, I guess I'll turn in.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.140
Can I have my coat?

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.100
-Thank you.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.050
Hi-DE-ho, fella!

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:58.220
-I'll show you to my room.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.304
-Yes, we all will.

00:52:59.304 --> 00:53:00.970
-I know where my own
room is, thank you,

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:02.968
without any help from you.

00:53:02.968 --> 00:53:04.450
-I'll find it, don't bother.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:05.840
Just rough out the directions.

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.470
-The top of the stairs, and
the third door on the left.

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:09.134
-Gentlemen.

00:53:09.134 --> 00:53:10.050
Just a moment, please.

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:11.820
Gentlemen, this is
all highly irregular.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.320
What if this should come to the
attention of the foundation?

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.736
And what about Ms.
Bragg tomorrow?

00:53:15.736 --> 00:53:16.910
-What are you talking about?

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:18.322
This is research, isn't it?

00:53:18.322 --> 00:53:19.300
-Yes.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:19.800
-Certainly.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.820
Who was that guy
that learned so much

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.355
from watching an apple drop?

00:53:22.355 --> 00:53:27.920
-Isaac Newton, 1642 to
1727, the law of gravity.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.656
Yeah, that's him.

00:53:29.656 --> 00:53:34.100
And I want you to look at me as
another apple, Professor Potts.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.070
Just another apple.

00:53:44.561 --> 00:53:46.117
[END PLAYBACK]

00:53:46.117 --> 00:53:47.200
DAVID THORBURN: All right.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.890
So you can get an idea not
only for how richly comic

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:54.990
these films can be, but
also how rich the subtext,

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:57.180
the sexual subtext can become.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.990
Even though, of
course, as you all

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:01.300
should know if you've
been reading Cook,

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.340
there was a production
code in force after 1934,

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.180
and there were all kinds of
very elaborate rules imposed

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.680
on American movies.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.032
A form of self censorship
because the movies feared

00:54:13.032 --> 00:54:14.990
censorship from the
government, so they came up

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:16.090
with their own system.

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:17.860
And until sometime
in the, I guess

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:23.610
it was the 1960's, the code
held and it had all kinds

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:25.140
of ridiculous elements in it.

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.660
One of the primary ones that
people always laugh about,

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.510
rightly I think, is that if
it showed a woman on a bed,

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:33.094
at least one of her feet
had to be on the floor.

00:54:33.094 --> 00:54:35.510
You couldn't show a woman lying
with both feet on the bed,

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:37.260
it was too suggestive.

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.410
But you can see how
clever filmmakers

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:41.840
and powerful performers
were able to make

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.760
a mockery of those
kinds of constraints,

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.300
because subtle and complex
and witty films are

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.120
able to do many,
many things that

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.760
are in a suggestive way,
that keep them from crossing

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.680
the boundaries set
up by the censors,

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.310
but nonetheless have a
powerful energy and sexuality.

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.120
So the similarities
between those two scenes,

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.050
but also the differences
between them,

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:13.800
tell you something
about the way in which

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.890
the aesthetic of connection,
this aesthetic of familiarity,

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:22.490
this popular aesthetic
operated in Hollywood movies.

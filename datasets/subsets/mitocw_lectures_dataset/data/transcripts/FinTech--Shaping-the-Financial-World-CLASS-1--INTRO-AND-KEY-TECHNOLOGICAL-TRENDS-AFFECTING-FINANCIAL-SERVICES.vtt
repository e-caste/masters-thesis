[CLICKING]

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.280
GARY GENSLER: So
this FinTech course--

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.740
this is for those who
want to explore FinTech,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.710
how the technologies are
disrupting financial services.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.440
That's the core of it.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.660
Technology is
disrupting finance.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.640
And we'll talk a lot about this,
that finance and technology

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.900
have lived in simpatico,
in some relationship

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.800
together for thousands of years.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.090
In fact, money and ledgers were
initial financial technologies.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.570
And we'll talk about
what makes something

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.200
in this faculty's mind a
financial technology that's

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.720
really changing the
world and then just

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.250
the technology that exists.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.380
The telephone, for
instance, at one point,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.340
in that time, in the
1920s, was, in essence,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.040
a financial technology
that rapidly

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.860
changed the world of finance.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.250
Or even in the 19th century,
the telegraph rapidly

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.830
changed parts of finance, when
you could send your first money

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.653
gram--

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:09.820
or in those days, it was
called something different,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.520
but it was a telegram
attached with money

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.490
in the 1870s and 1880s.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.813
But this course is going to
be about the cutting edge.

00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:19.480
We're going to be
talking about business

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.020
models and the like
around AI, deep learning,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.260
blockchain technology, OpenAPI.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.110
10 and 20 years
from now, OpenAPI

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.260
will not be taught, by my
view, in a FinTech course.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.070
But it's the relevant
topics of the day.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.950
And we'll be looking at
the competitive landscape.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.380
Those of you that have decided
to take this course on top

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.500
of consumer finance course,
the half-semester course that

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.170
was at the same
time, you will know

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.990
that I usually teach in the
concept of business strategy.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.480
What is the strategy that these
startups which big tech, which

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.650
incumbents are looking at this
point in time, in this day

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.630
and age, in this sector?

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.199
And this course is also, I
should say, being recorded.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.960
It's being recorded
for some students

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.940
who can't join us
simultaneously or what's

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.860
called synchronous learning.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.370
And these recordings
will be posted on Canvas

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.110
within a day or two.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.390
Lena and Romain and I
just have to remember

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.720
how to do that and actually
post each of the recordings.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.140
They also might be
shared, just to alert you,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.110
in OpenCourseWare in
the fall or later.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.470
I've chose with MIT that if
we're recording them anyway,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.100
maybe if they come out
being anywhere valuable,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.470
that we would up to
the broader community.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.340
So these might be shared more
broadly come the fall as well.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.210
It's also really to gain
critical reasoning skills

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.790
around the ground
truths of FinTech,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.370
separating hype from reality.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.890
Every week, there's a posting
of three or four readings.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.530
I understand that even
if we were all on campus,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.570
you might not read
every word of that.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.260
But they really are
sort of the foundation.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.550
And I hope that in each
lecture, in each class,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.730
we can go beyond that.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.250
But this week, the Bank of
International Settlement

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.190
Working Paper and the
Financial Stability Board

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.670
are two papers that a
lot of people turn to.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.220
The Financial Stability
Board is a group

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.420
of 20 countries, the
G20 countries, that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.340
have banded together and their
treasury secretaries or finance

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.300
ministers and central banks
and securities regulators

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.180
have formed this thing called
the Financial Stability Board.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.710
And they publish very good work.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.590
This paper came out in 2017.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.490
It feels a little
dated right now.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.820
But it still felt
quite relevant.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.220
And then, of course, the Bank
of international Settlement

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.240
is 60 or 70 central
banks out of Basel.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.492
And they write very good work.

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:06.200
I thought it was also
interesting to take

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.730
the current chair of the US bank
regulator, the Federal Deposit

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.519
Insurance Corporation, Chair
McWilliams, and her view

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.730
as to the future of banking,
what's going on right now.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.150
So that's why I grabbed
these three as an intro.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.920
If you've not yet
read them, I think

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.350
go back, try to at
least skim them,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.520
get your sense of what they are.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.510
And each class, I will
also list study questions.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.890
And the goal of my
listing study questions

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.710
is not just for you to
think about these questions

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.960
beforehand, but you
will also see where

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.550
do I want to land the class?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.660
Where do I think these are the
central learning objectives?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.560
And this is usually in
a classroom setting,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.930
where I'll say "let's
pause here and I'll

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.180
engage in some conversation."

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.180
Now, I do cold call in
the regular classroom.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.720
I don't know if anybody wants to
raise their hand now and answer

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.910
any one of these
questions, but it

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.390
would be great to get a little
bit of life and community

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.060
in this, if anybody
can address themselves.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.200
What are the major technological
trends materially influencing

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.910
finance right now
that you think about,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.710
whether it's in the US or
anywhere around the globe?

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.260
And this course will be
taught from the perspective

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.760
around the globe,
even though I'm

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.140
more knowledgeable in the US.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.980
We will be talking about Europe,
Latin America, Asia throughout,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.960
a little bit about
Africa as well.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.323
Romain, I'm pausing
for you to do your--

00:05:38.323 --> 00:05:40.490
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER: We
have our first volunteer.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.050
Thank you very much, Luke.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.970
The floor is yours.

00:05:46.352 --> 00:05:48.060
AUDIENCE: I'll answer
the first question.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.390
The main technological
change that we see in US

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.320
and outside of US is versus open
banking, use of a lot of APIs.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.623
They can be applicable
to other websites.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.040
GARY GENSLER: All
right, and we're

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.500
going to spend a whole class
on OpenAPIs in two weeks.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.540
But this is an important
part of marketing,

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.930
opening up the banks'
ledgers and their data.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.380
And data, as people
would like to say,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.490
is sort of the new
oil in the business.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.280
It's very valuable for us.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.773
Anybody else, Romain?

00:06:21.773 --> 00:06:22.940
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER: Yes.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.200
AUDIENCE: The natural
language processing so that we

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.807
can have the robotic advisors.

00:06:32.807 --> 00:06:33.640
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.310
So natural language
processing is the concept

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.390
that you can take something
that's in human language

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.270
and put it into machine
or computer language

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.320
or go the vice versa.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.710
And it's not
actually new in 2020.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.020
Some form of natural
language processing

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.860
has been around for decades,
just in terms of reading--

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.770
reading computer code and
putting it into an audio voice

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.210
or going backwards.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.240
Or every postal service of a
major country around the globe

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.320
has had something to read
our scribbled handwriting

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.060
and trying to read
that handwriting

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.210
and then put it into
something where they know

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.210
which post box to send it to.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.210
But natural language processing,
we'll spend a fair bit of time,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.010
and robotics.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.703
Romain?

00:07:21.703 --> 00:07:23.120
ROMAIN DE SAINT
PERIER: And now we

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.750
have Ivy, who raised her hand.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I think
we've seen a lot of digitization

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.320
in the e-commerce space
as well, especially

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.880
in places like China.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.540
And you see this kind of
divergence between China

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.300
and, say, the US and the
way we use mobile pay

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.200
and the way that they've really
adopted like Alipay and WePay

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.715
as well.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.090
GARY GENSLER: And
Ivy, why do you

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.030
think it happened so, as
you say, at this divergence,

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.840
why it happened maybe a
little faster in China?

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.950
AUDIENCE: So I think it's pretty
interesting, because I think

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.660
a place like China,
as an example,

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.140
is probably less
developed in terms

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.920
of even just their financial
structure, whereas the place

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.750
like the US, it's
quite dominated.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.410
And it's really competitive.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.050
But it's also
really consolidated.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.420
So you see these
countries where--

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.260
I mean, I think the
way I think about it

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.487
is the subway systems
in China or Taiwan

00:08:20.487 --> 00:08:22.070
or a lot of these
developing countries

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.100
are much better because
they were just--

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.540
they came a little bit later.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.080
And I just look at that
analogy similarly to kind

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.860
of where payments are,
because you kind of go

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.363
from 0 to 100 versus we
are kind of something--

00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:38.530
GARY GENSLER: No, I think
Ivy's raised a good point.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.960
There's times when a
country is growing rapidly.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.010
And China, for instance, had
been growing at 8% to 10% GDP

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.770
growth a year.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.650
And before corona, it had
come down to still a robust 6%

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.970
a year.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.960
But within that
context, many things

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:02.090
leapfrogged incumbents in
Europe and in North America.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.060
And in the payment space
in particular, two big tech

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.460
companies--

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.380
Alibaba, that really is the
dominant online retailing

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.180
company, and Tencent, which
was the dominant online sort

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.300
of social networking
and messaging company--

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.510
leapfrogged the banking system,
the traditional banking system,

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.460
and now with WeChat
Pay and Alipay

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.780
control well over 90% of
retail payments, small dollar,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.660
and small and medium-sized
enterprise payments.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.240
They don't dominate
large wholesale payments,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.685
but put in the retail
space, absolutely.

00:09:37.685 --> 00:09:38.810
And I would agree with Ivy.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.010
They kind of leapfrogged us.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:45.530
But even Kenya leapfrogged us
with M-Pesa, a technology that

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.400
was pushed forward by a
telephone company, Safaricom,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.030
when they noticed that folks
were trading mobile minutes

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.958
as a form of money.

00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.500
ROMAIN DE SAINT
PERIER: Gary, we have

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.160
two more hands that are up.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.040
We can start with--

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.460
GARY GENSLER: All
right, why don't we

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.543
do those and then move on?

00:10:01.543 --> 00:10:03.510
So who are the two people?

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.153
And they can just go in turn.

00:10:05.153 --> 00:10:06.820
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
So we had Laira,

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.090
but she just disappeared.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.730
So we'll go with Alida.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.550
GARY GENSLER: All
right, one, thank you.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I, to kind
of add on to Ivy's point,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.100
is a lot of financial
institutions in emerging

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.380
markets did not typically
cater towards the mass-market

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.400
consumer population.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.570
And so it really allowed very
quickly for these big tech

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.380
companies to jump in a way that
you couldn't do so in the--

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.010
in more developed markets,
where the financial institutions

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.130
already were catering to the
large majority of the consumer

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.100
population.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.930
GARY GENSLER:
Right, so it's about

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.890
actual financial inclusion
and reaching out and so forth.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.050
So what I'm going to do today
is try to cover, in the minutes

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.840
we have, a little bit
about the financial world.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.230
What do we mean, FinTech
shaping the future

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.490
of the financial world?

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.880
What do I what do I think of it,
having spent my life-- first,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.180
I was 18 years at Goldman Sachs.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.580
Then I worked in
the public sector,

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.120
but always sort of around
finance, with the US Treasury

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.660
Department, with Paul Sarbanes
doing Sarbanes-Oxley, and then

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.470
later running a market
regulator, the Commodity

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.290
Futures Trading Commission,
in the Obama administration.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.330
What do we mean by
the financial world?

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.860
A little touch on FinTech--

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.360
that's the whole
class, of course,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.760
but just a little
touch on FinTech.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.340
Thirdly, again,
just a little review

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.840
of these three big trends--

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.290
of AI, open banking,
blockchain technology--

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.520
what do these trends mean?

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.050
And then the actors--

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.200
and the actors, I think that
some people will use the word

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.960
FinTech to mean these
disruptors, companies

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.470
like Toast getting into the
payment space for restaurants

00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:00.090
or Lending Club and peer-to-peer
lending or Robinhood, an app

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.000
you can download
and trade stocks.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.510
A lot of people constrain the
study and the topic of FinTech

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.370
just to the disruptors.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.630
I think that that's too narrow.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.720
I think that we
really need to think

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.610
of the actors and
the field, more

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.190
broadly about the incumbents.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.270
This is sort of big
finance, we might say,

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:26.190
the Barclays banks and the
JPMorgans and so forth.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.320
And we need to
think of big tech,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.600
as we just talked with Ivy
about Alibaba and Tencent

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.850
getting into this business.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.550
But we see Apple Credit Card
and others and Facebook trying

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.950
to stand up a world currency.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.870
And then it's the disruptors.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:47.010
So I think it's a much
more robust conversation

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.980
and an important
conversation, the strategy

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.208
amongst these three pieces.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.250
And then, of course, we've
got to do a little bit

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.620
on our teaching team, our
schedule and assignments

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.000
and so forth.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.920
So what do I think of is in the
financial world and what it is?

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.900
Well, finance basically
stands, like this hourglass

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.160
in the top-right-hand
corner, stands

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.580
right at the neck of an
hourglass, intermediating,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.080
standing between people that
have money and need money,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.180
people that have risk and want
to get rid of it, lay it off,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.590
and somebody that
wants to pick it up.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.290
And I have for decades,
since I was at Goldman Sachs,

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.860
thought where we were, we were
at the neck of the hourglass.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.800
And for good or for
bad, that's also

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.800
part of why finance
in many countries

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.290
is able to collect
economic rents.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.470
Economic rents is that
classic conceptual framework

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.860
of collecting profits
or revenues in excess

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.100
of what classic
economics might tell you

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.320
would be a competitive
supply and demand space.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.950
But if you stand at the
neck of an hourglass,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.510
between trillions of money
flowing from those who want it

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.780
and those who have it,
and effectively trillions

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.460
of risk between those who have
risk and want to lay it off

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.290
and others who are
willing to hedge it--

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.230
if you're at that neck of
the hourglass, so to speak,

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.170
if you just collect
a few grains of sand

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.470
for the trillions that go
by, it can collect a lot.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.420
In the United States,
for one, for instance,

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.825
our financial sector
takes about 7 and 1/2%

00:14:21.825 --> 00:14:24.450
of our Gross Domestic Product.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.520
Nowhere is it written it has to.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.280
In fact, in the 1950s and
'60s, it was more like 3

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.470
and 1/2% to 4%.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.960
But persistently, it's
grown as a percentage

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.560
of our economy, standing,
intermediating money and risk.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.690
Let's just see if I
can get this to work.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.600
There, so the
functions, the functions

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.890
are intermediating credit.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.130
That's lending.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.980
Investments, we all know that.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.890
Risk transformation--
think of any time one of us

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.510
buys insurance on an automobile
or a car or on our life,

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.410
but also risk transformation
that investment banks do, even

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.680
between somebody that's issuing
stock and somebody that's

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.550
buying stock.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.010
That's a transference
of risk in terms

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.530
of whether that
startup will do well.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.450
Of course, there's
the capital markets.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.460
And at the center of
the capital markets

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.520
is the price, the
money and risk that's

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.120
flowing through the system.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.570
And there's plenty of
advice to go around.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.820
Now, we usually think
about it in sectors.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.830
And every one of these
sectors, whether it's

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.530
commercial banking, asset
management, insurance,

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.350
investment banking,
advisories, we

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.810
will touch upon
during this semester.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.130
And please, interrupt.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.430
If your keen interest is
about insurance companies

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.670
or your keen interest is
about investment banks,

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.170
then pull the community into
that in these discussions.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.350
But we're going to try to
talk about multiple sectors,

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.510
multiple functions,
as contrasted

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.780
to the half-semester consumer
finance course that was really

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:01.090
just about one slice,
household lending, and largely

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:05.020
the commercial banks and
investment banks around that.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.360
This is a much broader topic.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.760
And I hope the learning
objective is ultimately

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.320
to understand how technology
can transform finance

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.360
at any particular given time.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.140
Romain, are there any hands up?

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.600
I'm sort of every once in a
while looking to you to see

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.322
if I keep going or pause.

00:16:24.322 --> 00:16:26.530
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER: No
hands at the moment, Gary.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.530
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.120
The financial world, in this,
I think, four key things

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.110
to think about.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.330
And this is sort of in
a framework of thinking

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.680
about financial technology.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.720
Data-- of course, data is
that new oil, so to speak,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.260
for investing, for
market-making, for marketing,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.760
trying to get new customers.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.550
I mean, how many times
do we get a pop-up ads.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.890
I found in teaching
about student loans,

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.540
I was researching student loans.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.780
And my god, the
last six weeks I've

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.830
got more advertisement
for student loans,

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.380
even now I'm a professor at MIT.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.589
It's because I was researching
the topic of student loans,

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.960
and all of a sudden,
now I am getting

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:15.160
a lot of unsolicited ads and
emails, even, on the topic.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.599
The financial
world it always has

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.420
to think about the management
of their balance sheet.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.089
And if you're starting
a FinTech company,

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.910
are you using your balance
sheet or somebody else's balance

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:25.660
sheet?

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.980
And just as there's
cloud computing,

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.030
that today, cloud
computing has dramatically

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.270
shifted the ability of
startups, a disruptor

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:40.540
can come into a business and
basically the rent versus bill

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.680
decision changes.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.220
I can read somebody else's
data storage capacity.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:51.010
I can basically rent the cloud
instead of building my own data

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.030
warehouse.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.190
That was a big change
about 15 years ago.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:58.240
And it's made startups
more viable in the 2020s.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.320
Also, the ability to raise money
in the capital markets, what's

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.670
called securitizations, which
started decades ago, really

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.870
took off by the 1990s, also
allows a startup like Lending

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.540
Club and others to say I'll
raise my money elsewhere.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.240
I don't have to have
a balance sheet.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.390
And then there's the various
risks that you have to manage.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.060
And most importantly, we're
going to spend a lot of time

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.130
doing this class on
this fourth point-- user

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.200
experience, user interface.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.860
Much of what's happened
with mobile phones,

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.110
with apps that you can download
for free have given all of us

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.070
a better user experience
than online banking.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.900
Online banking has been
around for over 20 years.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.870
Most of the major
banks around the globe

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.920
had a viable platform for
online banking by the naughts,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.380
whether it was 2005 for some
or 2008 or others or so forth.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.020
But by the naughts,
most had online banking.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.300
And yet, their user
experience wasn't what

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.300
we all wanted, and certainly
wasn't what-- maybe

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.300
if the newer users,
as millennials,

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.490
were coming into
the marketplace,

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.890
to do it on your mobile
phone, to do it conveniently.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.890
So the user experience
and the user interface

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.990
is the critical
competitive place.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.520
So what do we mean by FinTech?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.210
I like going back to that
2017 Financial Stability Board

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:22.950
report.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.020
That doesn't mean that
they have it quite right.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.880
But they basically
talk about that it's

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.170
technology-enabled innovation
in the financial world that's

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:39.650
going to some new business
and it's material.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.060
So, as I mentioned earlier,
the telegraph in the 1830s

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.750
comes along.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.180
And by the 1860s
and 1870s, we're

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.090
starting to see digital money.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:56.130
The first form of digital money
is already about 140 years old.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.300
I mean, we think we're living
in this digital age, and we are.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.300
And I would note this
about the corona crisis

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.650
that we're living in--

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.820
the corona crisis,
in my opinion,

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.600
will accelerate
this digitization.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.730
We've already, in
the last 30 years,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.960
significantly
digitized our world.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.280
And if we were all
together in a classroom,

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.470
I would ask by a show
of hands how many of you

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.240
have used paper money or
currency in the last two

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.770
or three days.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.630
And maybe a quarter
of you might have

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.230
said you had used paper money
in the last two or three days.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.910
But let me ask you in the
middle of the corona crisis--

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.240
and Romain, you can tell
me if any hands go up--

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.690
we'll you use the
blue hand, anybody

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:44.905
that's used paper, physical
money in the last two days.

00:20:46.492 --> 00:20:48.950
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER: Thank
you, Alida, for volunteering.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:49.760
The floor is yours.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.138
AUDIENCE: I have for grocery
shopping and so forth.

00:20:57.138 --> 00:20:58.430
GARY GENSLER: So you actually--

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:03.030
and they'll still take the
paper money behind the counter

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.920
without wiping it down
with some cleaner?

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.570
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.420
And I took out a lot of
cash before everything

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.542
happened, so--

00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:13.310
GARY GENSLER: Ah, ah.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.090
Alida, may I ask, was that
just sort of insurance,

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.837
managing risk, as we say, as
part of finance, where you're--

00:21:18.837 --> 00:21:19.420
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.795
GARY GENSLER:
--managing the risk

00:21:20.795 --> 00:21:23.830
that the banking sector and the
ATMs and things might not work?

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.693
GARY GENSLER: And do
I see Devin's hand?

00:21:27.693 --> 00:21:29.360
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
That is correct.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.022
AUDIENCE: I can only
do laundry using cash.

00:21:33.022 --> 00:21:36.490
So I use it for now, but--

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.560
GARY GENSLER: But see how
few of us, of 80 plus people,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.250
two people.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.740
Now, we're in the middle
of a corona crisis.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.180
I would predict that as we come
out of this, whether this is--

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.670
whether this is a matter
of a couple of few months

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.410
or whether this
is, unfortunately,

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:55.670
as long as couple of years,
wherever we come out,

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.310
that the corona
crisis will accelerate

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.470
an already existing trend.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.370
And that already existing trend
distorts further and further

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.910
digitalization of commerce,
that that laundromat

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:14.000
that Devin goes to will take a
QR code or a swipe of a phone

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.410
more readily.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:20.600
And yes, I think it was Anita
said that she took out cash

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.720
before the crisis.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.850
And that's true.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.310
There is still going to be
some people that probably

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.530
also went and bought gold.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.960
And we should respect
that, that that's

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.260
sort of an insurance policy
against the digital world

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.467
collapsing.

00:22:34.467 --> 00:22:36.050
ROMAIN DE SAINT
PERIER: Gary, it seems

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.520
like Devin has a follow-up.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.974
GARY GENSLER: Yes, please.

00:22:39.974 --> 00:22:42.150
No, and maybe Devin
just left his hand up.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:42.900
AUDIENCE: I apol--

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.540
GARY GENSLER: Maybe
after you speak,

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.515
you actually then
take your hand down.

00:22:46.515 --> 00:22:46.800
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.133
GARY GENSLER: So what are the
technologies of our times?

00:22:49.133 --> 00:22:52.590
What's sort of rolling with it
now, no longer the telegraph

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.240
or so forth?

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.855
Well, I put up my favorites.

00:22:55.855 --> 00:22:57.480
And then I kind of
think, well, maybe I

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.938
shouldn't have put
the cloud there.

00:22:58.938 --> 00:23:01.680
Maybe the cloud really
isn't a technology that's

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.900
pushing us forward right now.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.860
And yet, what's interesting
is finance uses the cloud less

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.450
than most industries.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.245
And this is particularly
the case of incumbents.

00:23:13.245 --> 00:23:15.870
Country by country-- it doesn't
matter whether we're in Brazil,

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.670
whether we're in Europe,
whether we're in the US--

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.370
big incumbents, like
JPMorgan and Bank

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.710
of America and Barclays, tend
to still have their own data

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.210
centers.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.140
Now, that's shifting.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.450
I think the 2020s will
see them shift over.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.260
But they've tended to want to
sort of control their destiny.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.230
I think they will shift because
it's lower cost and better

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.070
cybersecurity generally
if you have it, frankly,

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:45.960
at Baidu in China or Microsoft
or AWS and so forth here.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.680
But startups dramatically
use the cloud.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.980
This is this buy versus
build sort of scenario.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.260
Why build my own data center?

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.280
I can rent it.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.050
I can use somebody else.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.240
But all the others we're
going to talk about--

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.480
and I should say that
there's a little--

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.320
a little sleight of hand by
my list, because many of these

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.440
are actually artificial
intelligence and machine

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.600
learning, which is part of
artificial intelligence.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.030
Natural language
processing, in essence,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.040
is artificial intelligence.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.870
Chatbots are sort of that
as well, and robotic process

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:21.520
automation.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.870
But I split them
out because I think

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.300
it's relevant that we kind
of have a chance to talk

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.370
about each of these as we go.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.950
I'm pausing every once
in a while, Romain,

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.000
but you can let me now.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.210
I like to think of this
in the context of history.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.290
Maybe that's just because I've
always loved studying history.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.940
But what's the
customer interface

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.530
that we've seen all the way
back from sort of prehistory,

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.940
that the customer interface was
in tents or bricks and mortar

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.360
later, all the way
up through where

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.960
we got credit cards invented
in the 1940s and '50s?

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.580
That was a FinTech.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.520
That was a new
financial technology.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.580
Visa, here in the
US, was a network

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.450
of banks started by a California
bank called Bank of America.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.270
And they wanted to have
a nationwide network.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.740
And other banks joined it.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.130
That became the Visa network.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.860
But where are we now?

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:26.003
What are the
technologies now that--

00:25:26.003 --> 00:25:27.920
I want to make sure I'm
clicking on the right.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.810
So the base that you
might be thinking about--

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:37.490
mobile payments, the internet,
even contactless cards--

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.370
I would say that was
kind of a last phase.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.640
That was the phase that
really shifted finance

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.660
in the naughts and early
teens, and that we really

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.590
are in terms of
customer interface

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:58.610
is now conversational
interfaces, chatbots

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.860
and conversational interfaces.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.350
That's the cutting edge.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.990
Yes, contactless
cards are important.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.180
Yes, of course, we
need mobile payments.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.990
No doubt about it.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.740
But if you're starting a
new business right now,

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.150
you're going to
start a disruptor

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.110
and say I'm going to do online
banking, that's yesterday.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.930
You have to find a way
to do that online banking

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.040
in a way that has such a
better customer interface.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.430
And you might be using
some form of OpenAPIs

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.490
or robotic process automation
and chatbots to do it.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:36.290
But these are all kind of
build up on each other.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.190
Then there's risk management.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.220
So one is the customer side.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.440
One is the funding and
risk management side.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.380
And you can look
throughout history.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.240
And I spent a lot of
my life in my career

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.040
around the capital markets.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.890
I was at Goldman
Sachs for 18 years.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.470
And I had to think
a lot with hundreds

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.572
of other people
about risk management

00:26:56.572 --> 00:26:57.530
and what we were doing.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.520
And in the 1980s and
the 1990s, a big thing

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.450
was asset-backed securitization
and interest rate swaps

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.910
and even, yes, credit
default swaps that helped

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:11.780
bring down several
economies in 2008.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:16.190
But those innovations
of the 1970s, the 1990s

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.550
were dramatically
shifting, dramatically

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.280
shifting what was going on.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.140
But I would say now, it's
really about machine learning.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.210
Machine learning is an ability
to extract correlations,

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:35.190
extract patterns from data in
a way that we couldn't before.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.950
And many of you have
studied linear algebra.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.970
We're blessed in this class
to have remarkable science

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.300
technology and math folks.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.690
Not all of you-- we accept all
the English majors and history

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.050
majors as well.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:56.780
But I'm saying that you know
that from linear algebra

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.470
and basic statistics, you can
do a lot of regression analyses.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.890
Machine learning is going
a little beyond that

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.020
and extracting
patterns from that

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.810
which was more difficult to
extract when you were just

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.940
doing regression analysis.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.500
And so there's
patterns that we might

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:19.810
see in the data that says you're
a good risk or a less good risk

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.740
that you wouldn't quite say in
a traditional credit scoring

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.430
systems.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.710
I think that's where
we're going right now.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.860
Romain, anything
in the chat rooms?

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.690
Or I'm going to
pause for a second.

00:28:35.545 --> 00:28:37.420
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
Nothing so far, Gary.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.600
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.010
So it's fertile ground.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.310
And we talked a little
bit about this before.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.750
But the fertile
ground of finance

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.920
is we've basically digitized
money securities and credit

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.270
over the last 30 years.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:56.950
The corona crisis is just going
to push that further faster,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.570
in my opinion.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.850
We have this vast
amount of data.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.310
And we're starting to
see patterns in that data

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.370
that we didn't recognize before.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:12.070
I mentioned this in the consumer
finance course that some of you

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.480
were with me on, but somebody
has actually studied something

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.430
like this to say
that if you charge

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:22.480
your phone overnight
every night, if you charge

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.730
your phone every
night, you apparently

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.410
are a better credit
than if you don't

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.480
charge your phone every night.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.400
You might think, oh
my gosh, I'd better

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:36.040
be charging my phone
because Apple is watching.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.490
They're going to be watching
whether I charge my phone.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.300
And in China, there's
a whole social credit

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.140
system that takes data from
many of your online apps.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.380
It's not just taking
your payment information

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.220
from Alipay or WeChat Pay,
but that social credit system

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.520
is checking even
your participation

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.590
in dating websites.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.610
I kid you not.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.930
I kid you not.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:04.200
So that social credit
system in China

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.000
or the private sector's approach
to collecting data in the West

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.110
have sort of the
same goal in mind--

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:19.320
to understand the customers
more and to basically

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.290
provide more marketing,
but also to assess risk.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.810
And, by the way,
the corona crisis

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.710
might change even the
West's view of data sharing,

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.640
because when we have Google
and the US partnering up to say

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.480
we can track everybody to
see how this disease, how

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.320
this disease is propagating
through society, that we

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.740
need the modern technology of
our position location trackers.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.100
A position location tracker
is called a cell phone.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.110
A smartphone is
tracking where we

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:56.920
are if you go running with
it, if you go driving, hiking,

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.750
all of that data.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.900
But now here, even in
the US and in Europe,

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.640
we're starting to
say do we partner,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.390
as the official
sector, with that data

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:12.990
to keep our societies maybe
a little safer, and then,

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.050
of course, the rapid
expansion of computation power

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:16.857
and so forth.

00:31:16.857 --> 00:31:18.440
Now, I think it will
change something.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.780
This disruptive potential, I
think, has a dramatic change.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.500
We'll be talking about this
slide the whole half semester.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.210
But managing risks, updating
the customer user interfaces,

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.980
and financial
inclusion are the three

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:36.180
that I want to focus a
lot on, managing risk.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.200
And AI is also about
targeting products as well.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.440
I think the interesting
challenge is, near the bottom,

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.260
will some revenue models shift?

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:51.120
We saw a company called Credit
Karma start here in the US.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.250
Credit Karma started basically
with the idea to get a free--

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:59.980
free is the operative
word-- a free credit score.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.420
The founders of Credit Karma
couldn't get their credit score

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.770
from the traditional companies--

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.270
TransUnion, Experian,
and the like.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:13.350
And so they started an app
just in the last 10 years.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:18.934
And in January, they sold
Credit Karma for $7 billion.

00:32:18.934 --> 00:32:21.920
Now, Credit Karma
is still a free app.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.930
And you might say how can Credit
Karma commercialize a free app?

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:30.320
In 2019, there was $1 billion
in revenue for Credit Karma

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:35.300
because they basically had built
files on 106 million Americans.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.530
They built data files on 106
million Americans providing

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.220
a free app.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.730
And, by the way, they do not
have 106 million customers.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.100
They even built
credit files on people

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.920
that weren't their customers.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.120
And they were able to
commercialize and build

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.950
revenues around that data stream
and, in essence, referencing.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.090
They get referral fees when
somebody then does buy a loan

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:03.740
or takes out a loan through
the Credit Karma platform.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.740
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
Gary, we have a question

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.000
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.875
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.970
You might need to
unmute yourself.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.890
We--

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.160
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
So I am normally unmuting?

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:16.993
AUDIENCE: I'm just--

00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:18.500
ROMAIN DE SAINT
PERIER: Yeah, OK.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.917
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering, what

00:33:19.917 --> 00:33:23.150
is the difference between
big tech and FinTech,

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.810
and why it is important
preparing and learning

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.330
the FinTech now?

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.273
GARY GENSLER: So I
understand the second part

00:33:31.273 --> 00:33:31.940
of the question.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.250
You said the difference
between what and FinTech

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.300
at the beginning?

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.305
AUDIENCE: Big tech.

00:33:36.305 --> 00:33:37.430
GARY GENSLER: OK, big tech.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.300
So by that, I think of--

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.260
I use the word FinTech in
the broad way the Financial

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.700
Stability Board does.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.660
I use it as is the intersection
of finance and technology

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.780
where the technology is new--

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.180
so not the telephone,
not the internet,

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.960
but it's something new, like
AI and machine learning,

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.860
that may materially change
the provision of finance.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.170
So I use it to capture
the whole field.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.989
Why it's important is I think
it's important every decade.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.600
I don't think it's
just important now,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.989
because I think technologies
will come along each half

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.360
decade, each decade
that will materially

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.100
change finance and provide the
entrepreneurs in this class

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:30.500
an opportunity to break
into the wide margins.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.060
In the US, 7 and 1/2% of our
economy or $1 and 1/2 trillion

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.139
is the revenues of finance.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.389
So if you're an entrepreneur,
you want part of that $1

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:42.350
and 1/2 trillion.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.120
You want an opportunity.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.010
And usually, it's
technology that's

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:47.420
changing business models.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.870
When the internet came
along in the 1990s, that

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.350
provided an opportunity for
PayPal to start and say maybe

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.170
we can provide a better
payment solution.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.420
And subsequent
payment solutions,

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.320
like Venmo and
TransferWise and Square,

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.310
have all been opportunities
to chip away a little bit.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.790
I would say only in
the opportunity--

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.100
the opportunities came
because technology

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.950
was changing the field.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.320
What's the difference
between big tech and FinTech?

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.010
Big tech, to me, are
big platform companies--

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:27.020
in the US, the Facebooks and
the Amazons and the Apples,

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.730
in China, Baidu, Alibaba,
Tencent, in Africa,

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.920
even, Safaricom got in.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.230
We could go country by country.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.590
India, the big tech has
gone into payments as well.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:44.630
I think that big tech companies
have dramatic advantages.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.870
And then I separate what I
would call FinTech startups

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.030
or FinTech disruptors.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:53.630
I always put the second noun
in there, disruptor or startup,

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:57.630
because to me, the word
FinTech is the whole field.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.533
I hope that helps.

00:35:58.533 --> 00:36:00.700
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER: And
we have another question

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.685
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:01.685 --> 00:36:02.560
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi, Professor.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.520
One question that
I have is actually

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.055
one concerned with privacy.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.650
At some point, do
you think that we

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.310
would have up give up to some
extent our privacy in order

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.240
to--

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.600
for me to get a
credit from a startup

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.883
or get a credit from somebody?

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.300
GARY GENSLER: Well,
I think you've

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.140
raised a dramatic issue
for society at large.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.670
And finance is
one example of it.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.070
But yes, we have--

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:39.030
we have shared our personal
data much more broadly

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.120
in the last 10 years, and
certainly in the last 30 years,

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.810
than we did in
societies before that.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.410
And in terms of getting
credit card, yes, we've

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:56.220
been sharing data for 50
years through various credit--

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.020
consumer credit companies.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:05.370
The Fair Isaac Company was
founded almost 60 years ago

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.980
by two people out of
Stanford, actually,

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.680
one named Fair and
one named Isaac.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.080
And that led to something
called FICO scores,

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.230
which are used in over 30
countries around the globe.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.500
These FICO scores took
some personal data,

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.860
as to whether you were
paying your bills on time.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.600
But now, we can go beyond that
and capture alternative data.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.130
We can capture somebody's
digital footprint.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.470
And in China, they are doing
that with social credit scoring

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.580
and Alibaba is with
Alipay and WeChat Pay.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.040
But Amazon is capturing
our data as well.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.330
Amazon captures any
Amazon Prime customer.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.280
And I'm sure amongst at of us,
there are many Amazon Prime

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.090
customers.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.490
That data is being
captured in some way.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.660
Now, it leads to more
financial inclusion.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.810
But it also raises all sorts
of issues around privacy

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.300
that we're grappling
with as societies.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.490
In Europe, they passed
something called

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:08.760
the GDPR, Global Directive
on Privacy Regulation.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.390
Here in the US, only
California's stepped into this

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.450
and passed something that
went into place last year,

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.540
the California Consumer
Protection Act.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.240
So these are things that
society will grapple with.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.560
Technology can enable privacy
as well as take away privacy.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:31.360
Technology actually can
enable us to keep our privacy.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.180
But the technology companies
and the financial companies

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.260
want our data.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.050
So they're not going
to necessarily want

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.550
us to keep our privacy.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.980
So it's an interesting--

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.350
technology can enable
it, but technology

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.070
can take it away as well.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:51.115
So just moving on a little
bit, this three big areas--

00:38:51.115 --> 00:38:52.740
we're not going to
spend a lot of time,

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.020
but artificial intelligence,
machine learning.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.840
I love to give a
shout out to another

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.440
MITer, or Lex Fridman,
who has a wonderful set

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.950
of online courses, if you
wanted to take Lex's courses.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.260
This was online before online
became such the vogue now

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.690
that we're all doing it.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.240
But Lex has this
wonderful course.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.000
And I captured his one slide.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.940
What is AI and machine learning?

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.210
It's extracting useful
patterns from data.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.460
You don't have to be
a computer scientist.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.640
But it's basically that's
the key thing, and something

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.620
that might not be
linear, something

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.430
that might not fit into that old
statistics class and regression

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.850
analysis or linear algebra
that we think about.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:38.400
It all relies on good
data, cleaning up

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.598
data, and good questions.

00:39:41.598 --> 00:39:42.390
Where do we see it?

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.970
We see it in facial recognition,
image classification,

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:48.210
speech recognition, et cetera,
this list from Lex's list

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:52.680
that you can see online,
medical diagnoses--

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.360
in the midst of
the corona crisis,

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.360
a lot are turning to AI
and machine learning to see

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.420
what patterns can we see
beyond the patterns you

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.150
can see by classic statistics?

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.260
It's going beyond that.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.010
But in this field,
in this field,

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:11.490
in finance, we're seeing it
in every one of these areas.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.540
And we have two classes, so
I won't dive into it now.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.410
But whether it's asset
management, where

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.760
BlackRock is literally taking--

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:27.880
and all the news items for the
top companies, every quarter

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.270
that a company
reports its earnings,

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:35.320
BlackRock is listening digitally
to their shareholder meetings

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.780
and their shareholder
conference calls

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:42.880
and seeing which words in there,
which words relate to stock

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.680
markets going up
or stock markets

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.950
going down, using machine
learning and asset management.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:53.380
We talked about call centers
and chatbots and so forth.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.220
I don't know how many of you
are Bank of America customers.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:01.900
But bank of America has millions
of its customers using Erica.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.120
Think the Siri of banking.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.560
Think the Alexa of banking,
a virtual assistant

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.740
called Erica--

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.230
Bank of America, get it?

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:17.480
All right, that was their
marketing thing, I guess, now.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.000
So AI and machine learning
is dramatically shifting.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.940
The question in FinTech
for the big incumbents,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:28.140
how do I do it to
raise my revenues,

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.710
lower the amount of
capital that I have to use,

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.570
raise my profits?

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:36.870
The question for big tech
is how do I do this maybe

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:40.560
to get into the business,
to leapfrog, as Ivy said,

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.520
that Alibaba and WeChat Pay
leapfrogged the Chinese banks

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.660
and payments?

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:49.200
If I'm big tech, can I
leapfrog big finance?

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.130
Because, frankly, if I'm Google,
I'm better at it right now.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.740
Google has a
comparative advantage.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.610
Can I maybe use my comparative
advantage and AI and leapfrog?

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.090
If I'm a startup, maybe I
can give a better customer

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:03.940
interface.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.620
I can do something with
this to better manage risk

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.260
with alternative data.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.800
So that's how I think of it.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.870
OpenAPI-- I should pause.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.873
Romain, any questions
or hands up?

00:42:18.873 --> 00:42:21.040
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
Yes, we have one from Laira.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.915
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I was
just curious to know how,

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:31.510
internationally
speaking, regulation

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:36.640
hampers the capacity of FinTech
companies to expand, just

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.910
on an international level.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:43.340
So for the US, is it more
regulated and, hence, more

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.782
harder for FinTech companies
to expand than for in China?

00:42:47.782 --> 00:42:48.990
GARY GENSLER: Great question.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:50.230
And again, who asked?

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:53.090
I just didn't rem-- is Leia?

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.130
AUDIENCE: Laira.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.620
GARY GENSLER: Laira, all right,
Laira, good to see you again.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.950
I'm sorry that I don't
physically see you.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:04.420
But good to see you remotely.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.330
Every country is taking a
little bit different approach.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:12.790
And the range of approaches
here could be from you're a--

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.250
let's call them a
startup or a disruptor.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.080
You're starting something.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.020
You'd better just
come into whatever

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.160
our traditional
regulatory framework.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.730
If you're taking deposits
and offering loans,

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:26.170
you've got to be a bank.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:28.000
If you're just
doing payments, you

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.520
might come under a European,
US African e-money law

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.270
and just have to do the
things around money laundering

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.010
and anti-money laundering.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:43.100
If you're like Robinhood
here in the US,

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.790
you would need to register
as a broker-dealer.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.640
And there's been this big
debate around cryptocurrencies.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.320
Are they securities or not?

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.110
And in some countries,
like the US,

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:56.860
they generally
are, unless you're

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.860
like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:03.610
But the debate, Lyra, is
really country by country,

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:11.000
is are these startups
and these technologies,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.240
do they fit into the
current regulatory regimes?

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.210
By and large, if you take
deposits and you make loans,

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:20.220
you're a bank pretty much
anywhere around the globe.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.370
If you facilitate the
movement of money,

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:26.390
you're probably in some
e-money laws around the globe.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.780
Securities, if you're
actually facilitating

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.510
the raising of money and
the selling of securities,

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.480
you usually have to register
as a securities broker-dealer

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.460
somewhere around the globe.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.240
But a lot of places
also have this concept

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.900
of some form of regulatory
forbearance called sandboxes.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.620
The idea is let's promote
some innovation, whether it's

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.590
in Hong Kong, whether it's in
Asia, whether it's in the US,

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:56.330
promote some motivation by
saying if it stays small enough

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:58.490
and it's new enough,
you might not

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:03.540
have to comply with all
of the regulatory regimes.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.330
The other interesting challenge
is sometimes things come along

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:07.710
that don't fit in a box.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.200
They don't quite
fit in to something.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.950
So the internet came
along in the 1990s.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:16.160
Internet in the 1990s
was facilitating

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.215
a rapid change in finance.

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:19.590
The internet comes
along and then

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.720
the question is
literally a question

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.150
that the securities
regulators around the globe

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.290
had to deal with--

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.970
what if I put a
bulletin board up

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.760
on the internet that offers
people to buy and sell

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.560
securities on the internet?

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.150
Now, it wasn't a
traditional exchange.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:37.260
It didn't look like the Tokyo or
Shanghai or London or New York

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:40.470
exchanges of old, where
there were humans yelling

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.750
and screaming on the
floors of stock exchanges

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:43.920
around the globe.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.990
It was just a
bulletin board where

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.060
buyers and sellers could meet.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.300
And usually they were insurance
companies and various asset

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.800
managers.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.890
That question was a ripe
question in the 1990s.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:59.880
And over time, we ended up
with two tiers of regulation

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.810
for exchanges.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.260
We had fully-regulated
exchanges,

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:06.060
and this was true in Europe
and the US at the time.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.760
China sort of got
there a little later.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.860
But in Europe and the US,
it was like all right,

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.068
there's going to be these
fully-regulated traditional

00:46:14.068 --> 00:46:15.010
exchanges.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:17.160
And then there would
be another tier.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.170
In the US, we called
them broker dealers,

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:22.590
alternative trading
systems, ATS's.

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.630
In Europe, there
were various rules

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:29.220
that became known as MiFID,
which now I can't remember

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.540
what it all stands for.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.360
But electronic trading platforms
were regulated a little

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.317
differently.

00:46:34.317 --> 00:46:36.150
So I hope that gives
you a sense and puts it

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.010
in a historic concept.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.920
I think over the
2020s, AI and machine

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.640
learning will lead to
tremendous challenges

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:50.940
around regulation, about if
you see a pattern in the data

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.360
but you can't explain
why the pattern is there,

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.360
you fall into some
challenges of explainability.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.780
And for the last 50 years,
or in many countries,

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.520
if you deny somebody
credit, you're

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.240
supposed to be able to explain
why you deny them credit.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.280
We talked about privacy earlier.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.060
It bumps up against
privacy issues.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.380
And a third area it bumps
up against is biases.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.050
What if there is a
bias in the data,

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:19.110
like when Apple Credit
Card just rolled out

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:22.980
and it seemed like husbands were
getting more credit than wives

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.730
in the same household?

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:28.990
So biases, privacy,
explainability

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:32.260
are the three sort of cutting
edge, when I call the big three

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.790
public policy issues around
AI and finance, though there

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:38.420
are other issues as well.

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.855
Romain, did I see
you-- were you--

00:47:39.855 --> 00:47:41.230
ROMAIN DE SAINT
PERIER: Yes, sir.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.335
We have Carlos, who
has his hand up.

00:47:43.335 --> 00:47:44.710
GARY GENSLER: All
right, and then

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.180
I'm going to keep
going, because I

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.540
want to talk about where we're
going in this class as well.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.580
Carlos?

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.270
AUDIENCE: Hi, how are you?

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:55.330
Just a comment on regulations,
sort of to build up on that.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:57.490
So I think ironically,
for example,

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:59.950
in Latin America,
a lot of countries

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.750
have an issue where
the big banks have

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.907
a massive concentration
of deposits.

00:48:03.907 --> 00:48:06.490
But, for example, if you look
at the Mexico FinTech law, which

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.640
was passed end of 2018, it
actually raised the barriers

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.320
to entry for other FinTechs.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.808
So sort of ironically--

00:48:12.808 --> 00:48:15.350
GARY GENSLER: I'm sorry, Carlos,
it raised what for FinTechs?

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.550
AUDIENCE: The barriers to entry.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:18.050
GARY GENSLER:
Barriers to entry, OK.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:19.030
AUDIENCE: And so--

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.030
GARY GENSLER: I think our
faculty member, Luis Videgaray,

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.360
who helped work on that when he
was finance minister of Mexico,

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.430
we should ask him.

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:30.010
And I'll see if I can get his
answer for the next Wednesday

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.180
or next Monday's class.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.570
But keep going.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:34.330
AUDIENCE: OK, that
would be great.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.080
But the question is
do you think there

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.740
is a risk that new regulations
in the FinTech scope

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.080
are actually going to
perpetuate some of the problems

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.710
that we saw before with the
more traditional banking sector?

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:46.400
GARY GENSLER: Great question.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.980
Carlos, can I hold
that for a minute,

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.140
because I'm going to do
that when I do the actors?

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:54.540
But I think yes,
incumbents in every field--

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.330
and these would be incumbents
in the pharmaceutical field,

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:01.470
in the tech fields, in
airlines, whatever-- incumbents

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:07.050
tend to be able to deal with
regulation a little easier.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.700
They're big.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.200
They've got great resources.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.880
They can build systems to
comply with those regulations.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.880
Now, they don't necessarily
embrace new regulation.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.310
But once those regulations
are put in place

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.770
by an official sector,
they tend to have

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.810
the resources to embrace them.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.510
And startups sometimes
have more challenges.

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.060
And thus, you may be
seeing that regulations

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.820
become a barrier to entry.

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:36.150
They're kind of grains in the
sand of innovation at times.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.310
So there's always a
public policy tradeoff--

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:40.800
protecting the
public, whether it's

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:46.620
protecting the public against
consumer fraud or investor

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:50.390
protection or protecting the
public against systemic risk,

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:53.970
that big banks will fail and
hurt the rest of the economy,

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:57.420
also comes with some
tradeoffs, that it could

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.250
raise the barriers to entry.

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:02.625
You're absolutely right there.

00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:05.610
We're going to talk a lot
about OpenAPI and open banking.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:08.040
We have a whole class on that.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.980
So I'm going to keep moving
on just so that we finish

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.230
by our 10 o'clock deadline.

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:16.110
Blockchain technology--
you've heard about it.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:17.640
We're going to have
a class on this,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.040
about cryptocurrencies
and blockchains.

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:24.160
Some of you actually were in
our fall blockchain and money

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:24.660
class.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.360
Some of you are in the
crypto finance class that

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.170
starts in about 30 minutes.

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.580
But we will talk about
blockchain technology.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.650
I want to say and
lay it out right

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:38.250
from the beginning,
these two issues, AI

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:42.420
and machine learning, in these
eight areas are dramatically

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.040
more relevant.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.360
And OpenAPI and open banking,
dramatically more relevant

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:53.340
than blockchain technology
potential use cases as of 2020.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:56.820
The interesting question
is will that shift?

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:01.350
Is there an overabundance of
investment in AI and machine

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.940
learning and not enough
in blockchain technology?

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.180
You get to decide
for yourselves.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:11.610
But I'm saying as of 2020,
sort of the real potential

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.790
that we're seeing and the
dramatic changes around user

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:19.320
interface an OpenAPI and machine
learning and natural language

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.690
processing are more
dramatic in this space.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.630
And yet cryptocurrencies
have dramatically

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:26.830
changed what central
banks are doing.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.970
And we saw Facebook trying to
stand up a worldwide currency

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:31.150
last year.

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:33.060
So I don't think
you can adequately

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.910
discuss and have a course
on financial technology

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:40.680
without really having some
slice of blockchain technology.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.760
And it is shifting.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.820
Everything that's on this list,
it is a catalyst for change.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:49.080
I would say my takeaway
on blockchain technology,

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:52.620
it is definitely pushing
the financial sector

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:57.580
in places that wouldn't
be pushed otherwise.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.580
I guess that's
really saying OpenAPI

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.780
and artificial intelligence,
machine learning

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:07.353
are so much bigger in terms
of what's happening in 2020.

00:52:07.353 --> 00:52:08.770
Romain, unless
there's a question,

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.572
I'm going to do
the actors quickly.

00:52:10.572 --> 00:52:11.072
Anything?

00:52:11.072 --> 00:52:13.280
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER: We
have one specific question

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.930
from [INAUDIBLE] on whether
machine learning and AI can

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:20.710
cause a dark box, or creditors
could deny and approve credits

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:22.115
based on unreasonable grounds.

00:52:22.115 --> 00:52:22.948
How do you see that?

00:52:22.948 --> 00:52:26.830
GARY GENSLER: That
absolutely is a risk.

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:30.130
Our first big data
revolution in the US,

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.310
and then it was about a
decade later elsewhere,

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.410
was in the late
'50s and early '60s,

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.810
credit cards came
along, invented really

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:44.330
in the late 1940s and then
popularized by the mid 1960s,

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:44.990
came along.

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:47.090
And then the official
sector passed laws.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.570
And two of the first
laws we passed in the US

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.700
was something called the
Fair Credit Reporting

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.070
Act and the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.010
And why I speak about
those two and this question

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.560
50 years later is
this was a question

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.930
with the first big data
analytics at that time.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:07.070
And the idea was you couldn't--
you couldn't use data analytics

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:11.240
to deny somebody credit
because of their race,

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.580
because of their color,
because their ethnicity,

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:18.812
because of their gender and
other protected attributes.

00:53:18.812 --> 00:53:21.020
And that was called the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:24.320
That same act is important
now as we move into machine

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.230
learning credit decisions.

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:30.260
Fair Credit Reporting
Act also said in the US,

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.230
and Europe did some similar
things elsewhere later,

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:37.810
said if you deny credit, you
have to be able to explain why.

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:42.000
So to this question, just
because you have a black box,

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.890
you still need to have those
basic tenets of explainability

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.890
and fairness or lack of bias.

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:52.470
And that's why I say the
three big challenges are

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:56.350
explainability, bias,
and then privacy.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:59.605
There's also challenges of
robustness and so forth,

00:53:59.605 --> 00:54:02.280
but great question.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.590
The actors-- I think
of the actors--

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:09.180
we've talked about this a
little bit in several buckets.

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.460
I think of big finance--

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.890
I apologize, I sort of
borrowed this a little bit

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.950
from the central bank
governor of Brazil.

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:17.670
I met with him last year.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.220
And he and I were talking
about Brazilian banking.

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.170
And he said they're
like fortresses.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:26.680
So this was actually his
kind of articulation of Itaú

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.185
and the others in Brazil.

00:54:28.185 --> 00:54:30.060
And I said how do you
see them as fortresses?

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.780
And he says they all
have their moats, towers,

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.930
and they have
sovereign protection.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:39.420
And to him-- and I liked
it so much I repeat it--

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.390
their towers, their
sort of basic tenets

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:46.320
of sort of financial
strength is around payments.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.310
They usually control payments.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.820
They have big balance
sheets that they can use.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:55.860
And balance sheets allow you
to lower your risk, frankly,

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:56.910
and leverage.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:58.380
They have a lot of data.

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.430
And yes, they have
hundreds of legal entities.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:05.220
Their corporate structure is
one of their both complexities

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.810
but benefits.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.780
A company like a JPMorgan
or a Goldman Sachs

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:14.040
or Barclays at a minimum has
probably 1,000 legal entities

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.260
and might have 3,000 or
5,000 legal entities.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.380
When I left Goldman Sachs,
which was already 22 years ago,

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:23.310
I was the co-head of finance
with David Viniar, who

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:28.380
went on to be the CFO, we
had 700 legal entities.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.710
But if I recall, in that quarter
of a trillion balance sheet

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:34.140
that we had to sort of
help manage and fund,

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.040
only about 70 or 80 of those
were regulated companies.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.840
So we had a lot--

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.190
we did everything legal,
I just want to say--

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:45.570
but we had a lot going
on amongst those 700

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:46.920
legal entities.

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:50.970
That's kind of big finance
from a sort of central bank

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:54.150
governor of Brazil's point
of view, like fortresses.

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:56.420
But then big tech--

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.980
the Bank of
International Settlements

00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.740
did a wonderful
report last year.

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.680
And they said it's like DNA--

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.700
data, networks, activities.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:09.920
And if you're Alibaba
or you're Facebook,

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.580
you want to layer another
activity on your network.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.860
Facebook already has
2 plus billion people

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.130
in their network.

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:19.430
They have a lot of data already.

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:22.530
They are supposedly a free app.

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:25.110
They are free if
you download it.

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:27.200
But it's data for services.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.580
And if they can put another
activity on top of it,

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.190
that means they get more data.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:35.210
So every time they add
an activity, more data.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:38.010
And data they can commercialize.

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:42.870
And so that DNA network is
why you see big tech trying

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:45.240
to get in payments
around the globe,

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.790
and then adding credit
products on top of it.

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:51.360
Startups-- startups
have advantages.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.250
Don't count them out.

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.290
Some people would just
call that the FinTech.

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:56.790
But they're flexible.

00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:58.530
They're disruptive innovators.

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:02.670
They can sort of rent their
data storage on the cloud.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.250
In some circumstances, they
can rent their balance sheets

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:07.530
by doing securitizations.

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:10.240
They also have some
asymmetric risks.

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.930
And that asymmetric risk we'll
talk about all half semester.

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:18.390
The important asymmetries
they have is one,

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:21.100
they're not protecting
a business model.

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.100
So let's just talk about
payments and credit

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.000
cards for a minute.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.820
The big banks are protecting
a very profitable credit card

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.320
business.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.040
And there's seven
big banks in the US.

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.780
There's seven big actors
in the credit card space--

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:38.230
Bank of America and Chase
and Citi, of course,

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:43.750
but also American Express and
Discover and the like, Cap One.

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:45.980
They're protecting
that business model.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.950
But then somebody comes along.

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:51.490
Maybe it's a small company like
Toast in the payment system

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:54.520
space for restaurant payments.

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.580
And before corona crisis,
Toast was doing pretty well.

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.340
And they did a C or
series C or D round

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.100
at $4.9 billion valuation.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.980
Well, Toast can come along
and provide a payment product

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.250
for the restaurant business.

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:11.860
They're not protecting
any business model.

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.170
Or even Lending Club
that came along 10

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:18.490
or 11 years ago can come
into the personal loan space

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:22.000
and say we're not
protecting wider profit

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.030
margins and interest rate
margins in the credit card

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:26.320
space.

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.840
You can come into the
personal lending space,

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.660
which is growing dramatically.

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:36.460
Personal lending in the US is
about $170 billion asset class.

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.890
Credit cards is $1 trillion.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:41.760
So it's only one sixth the size,
but the personal loan space

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.540
is growing rapidly, in
part because those actors

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.460
in the disruptive
startup space are not

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:51.040
protecting the trillion-dollar
asset class, which

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.700
is called credit cards.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.750
And then there's
the official sector.

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:59.520
So I think of these actors
as, importantly, all of them.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.350
And just some pictures,
just for fun--

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:03.550
we don't need to
stop, but big finance.

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:06.150
And, of course, I
left companies out.

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:08.580
But to give you a sense,
it's an asset management,

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.720
like BlackRock and
Fidelity and Vanguard.

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.170
It's in banking.

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:14.460
It's in investment banking.

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.660
It's global.

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.780
If I left your country or
your favorite company out,

00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:19.680
I apologize.

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.460
But I could have put 200,
500 companies on this page.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.820
But then there's also
big tech, which I only

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.530
picked six or seven at the top.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.720
And then the
startups-- and we're

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:34.380
going to talk about startups
in every one of our classes.

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.050
But I think you've got
to sort of bear with me

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:41.750
and think about it
more broadly as well.

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:43.500
And then I'm just going
to close before we

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:47.990
talk about our actual
course and so forth, is

00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:49.140
where's the investments?

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:51.810
Accenture puts out
this wonderful report,

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:55.140
I think on a quarterly
basis, as to the number

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:59.200
of deals in different
sectors and then the funding.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.920
And I don't ask you to study
this on your screen now.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.760
But think about it.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.390
Maybe pull up the
Accenture report itself.

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:10.350
But the big bulk of it is
in payments and credit.

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:14.760
If you look at the kind of
purplish blue boxes, nearly 50%

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.280
of the funding is
in those boxes.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.010
Insurance, pretty
good size, too.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:24.270
But it gives you the sectors
that actual funding is going on

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.920
in this marketplace.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.662
Romain, questions?

01:00:28.662 --> 01:00:29.620
AUDIENCE: No questions.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.930
GARY GENSLER: My god,
Romain, where did you

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.630
get this picture taken
anyway that I grabbed off

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.645
the internet?

01:00:36.645 --> 01:00:38.770
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
That was when I was working

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:41.020
in the Middle East for BCG.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.970
GARY GENSLER: I see, I see.

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:45.670
All right, so you've met Romain.

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:46.650
You've met myself.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.630
Lena is the course
administrator.

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:52.060
If you want to set up
office hours-- and, yes,

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.760
I am committed to office hours--

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.890
it's great to also copy Lena.

01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:58.740
You can probably
do it with me, too.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:05.320
But Lena is going to be
better to sign it up as well.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.600
The course-- so
after this intro,

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.420
we're going to take
the technologies.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.670
We're going to take two classes
on artificial intelligence,

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.980
machine learning, natural
language processing

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.000
and the like, and then talk
about the customer interface

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.270
on April 8 and then
blockchain and technology.

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.730
These three slices-- now,
there are other slices

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:27.050
we could address as well.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.290
So then we're going to
go through the sectors.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:31.090
We're going to talk
about these sectors.

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:35.830
And what I could see is payment
and credit, trading, a little

01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:37.570
less on the risk management.

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:42.830
So maybe on May 4, we'll squeeze
that down a little bit as well.

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.470
And then, of course,
we have the intro.

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:47.530
I've just, [INAUDIBLE] and
I, revised the syllabus

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:48.700
this past week.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.430
I want to take the
next-to-last class

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:53.540
and just talk
about corona crisis

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:56.500
and how it might be
shifting the landscape.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.340
I already said, I really
do think this shifting,

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:05.110
this deep trend towards
online from bricks and mortar,

01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:07.190
that was already happening.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.910
But we've even seen in
the last three weeks,

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:11.900
we've seen winners and losers.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.110
I asked each of you
to think about this.

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:19.410
Who are the winners and losers
within the financial sector,

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:22.200
big tech, and the
financial startups?

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.670
I talked a little
bit about Toast.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:27.120
Toast is a very
successful Boston company

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.340
that is providing
payment services

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.163
and credit to restaurants.

01:02:31.163 --> 01:02:33.330
For a moment, that would
have to-- you'd have to say

01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:35.670
that's a company that's taking--

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.940
taking it on the chin,
so to speak, not as badly

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.520
as all those individuals that
have health care worries,

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.710
that are ending up in the
hospitals and the families

01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.160
losing loved ones.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.940
But I'm saying from an
economic perspective,

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.470
there are some
winners and losers.

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:55.440
Robinhood, an online app,
mobile app for trading,

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.860
has crashed several times
in the last three weeks.

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.510
And there's some
data out of Europe

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:06.810
already that online FinTech
apps as a sector have

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:12.450
seen usage up 70% and 100%,
and some apps up 700%.

01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:14.130
But not all will be winners.

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.020
Not all will be losers.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.800
And so I thought we'll take
one class towards the end

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.850
and just discuss it and get
your feelings and thoughts

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:29.080
as well going forward
how this might play out.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.130
So MIT chose this as pass-fail.

01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:36.060
So welcome to not only
remote learning MIT,

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.420
but technically pass
emergency, no-credit emergency,

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.100
incomplete emergency.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.940
Just so that you understand what
this is, it's almost pass-fail.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.940
Pass emergency, PE, will
be on your transcript,

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.990
hopefully for all of you.

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:52.530
I can't commit to it,
because it's up to you

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.060
whether you pass.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.160
There are assignments.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.660
And no credit emergency,
you can think of is an F,

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.700
but it's not going to
be on your transcript.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:07.430
So this is an emergency
circumstance right now.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:09.440
There's still
assignments because we

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.380
want to give you
the most learning

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.380
experience you can have.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.672
You might say wait a minute,
wait a minute, I thought--

01:04:15.672 --> 01:04:18.020
I thought assignments were
just about so that a faculty

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.370
member can decide who gets A's
and who gets B's and the like.

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:24.830
I look at assignments in
a different way than that.

01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:27.080
I look at assignments
really as a way

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.710
to help you engage
in this subject.

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:31.040
And so in this class--

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.870
and those of you
who know me, I do

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:36.050
this in a couple of classes-- is
one individual paper, one group

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:36.750
paper.

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.870
And it's all geared
to writing a group

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:43.560
paper for either a big
incumbent, Bank of America,

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:49.170
a big tech company, Jeff
Bezos and Amazon, or kind

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:53.870
of a startup company, a big VC
company, Andreesen Horowitz,

01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:56.550
that you form groups and
you decide on a sector.

01:04:56.550 --> 01:05:00.360
You can decide on credit
or payment or trading.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.230
You choose, and it helps
you engage in the subject.

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:07.170
And then I ask you to split,
if it's a three or four-person

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.300
team, or even if it's
a one-person team,

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:14.100
if you choose to do that,
because we're all so separated,

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.030
then split up and write a
three or four page paper,

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:24.080
900 words or so, on one of the
topics that I lay out here--

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.620
the traditional competitors,
the startup competitors

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:33.450
and so forth, the technology
that you're interested in.

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:36.810
Why do I still do
assignments when it's PE NE?

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:38.970
It's to help you
engage in this subject.

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:42.900
And Romain and I are committed,
even if we slap a PE on most

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.090
of these-- hopefully
all of them--

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:46.890
we're trying to
give you feedback

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.390
so you engage in a subject.

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:53.460
And yes, I'm willing to do
Zoom group meetings, Zoom

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.390
individual meetings.

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:58.610
Look, this is not an
easy time for any of us.

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:01.410
But I want to make sure that
I deliver as much as I can

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:03.750
and that MIT
continues to deliver

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:08.460
for you as we're going through
this sort of challenging time.

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:11.800
Class participation
is still important.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.330
If you can't sign up, if it's
the time zone doesn't work

01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:18.740
or there's something going on
in your family, it doesn't--

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.200
if you're interviewing
for a job, God bless,

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.970
then listen to the recording.

01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:29.470
We'll put the recordings
up on Canvas as well.

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:32.400
And so professionalism, I
just want to say something.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:32.550
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER: Gary?

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:33.240
GARY GENSLER: Yeah?

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.698
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER: Excuse
me, just on the assignments,

01:06:35.698 --> 01:06:37.470
I'm being asked
whether listeners also

01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:39.210
have to comply with
these assignments.

01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:40.933
GARY GENSLER: No.

01:06:40.933 --> 01:06:42.350
ROMAIN DE SAINT
PERIER: Thank you.

01:06:45.278 --> 01:06:48.220
GARY GENSLER: I'm trying to
get rid of the poll here.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:48.720
OK.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.230
I've never been
asked that question.

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.000
A little word on
professionalism,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.680
just for my, God knows,
30 plus years in business.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.050
And this is just sort
of my closing thing,

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:08.160
is my advice for
all of us is success

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.890
goes for those prepared,
curious, and self-starters.

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:13.950
If you read the
assignments for this,

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:15.970
you'll do better in this class.

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.720
But if you go into a meeting,
if you go into a pitch,

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.190
you go into an interview, if
you read about the person,

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:25.122
you're going to learn
more about them.

01:07:25.122 --> 01:07:26.580
And, by the way,
if you're curious,

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.270
when you walk into
somebody's office,

01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:34.190
whether it's a video office or a
real office, look at the walls.

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:36.440
What does it mean
that Gary Gensler has

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.570
this stuff behind him or not?

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:41.360
I'm not asking you to
analyze me right now.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.570
But I'm telling you, if you
walk into somebody's office,

01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:48.020
whether they're a US senator,
the president of the United

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:52.220
States, some job interview,
a colleague, and you look

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.440
at their walls and you ask
them about their families,

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.640
show some curiosity.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.040
You'll do better off.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.460
As I said, respect and courtesy
builds reputation and networks

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.380
and so forth.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.250
Engage.

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:08.580
It's going to be hard with
this many students online,

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.270
but engage in this class.

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:12.600
You'll learn more if
you engage with me

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:19.140
also offline, Gensler@MIT.edu,
but also engage

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.840
by setting up office time.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.210
I also think understanding both
strategy and detail matter.

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:27.779
Some people are really
good tactical people,

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:30.500
really good detail folks.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.000
They'll do fine
in their careers.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.609
But if you step back and
understand the trends as well,

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:35.850
you'll do better.

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.760
Some people are really
global strategists

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.500
and not really good
at the details.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.270
They'll probably do OK.

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:42.870
But I'll tell you,
my experience,

01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:46.430
whether it's in finance,
whether it's watching people

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:51.040
at MIT and the faculty, or
my time in public service,

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.319
the people that can
merge both broad strategy

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:56.870
and can execute on the
details, those folks

01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:58.538
are unstoppable often.

01:08:58.538 --> 01:09:00.080
Those are folks that
you really-- you

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.770
want them on your team, that
they can do a bit of both.

01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:06.859
So we're going to talk a lot
about strategy and the trends.

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:10.231
But we're going to get into
the granular details as well.

01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:11.689
And then lastly,
it's always better

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.520
to stay true to your values.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.350
Now, I do say this--

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:16.630
it's going to be a little--

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.130
we're in this pass-fail thing.

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:21.320
But if you want to know
one way that Romain and I,

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.569
it will drive us a
little nutty, we're

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:26.660
going to try to put your
papers through some plagiarism

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:27.680
software.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.420
I use Grammarly.

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.750
I actually check, yes.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:36.859
And if you have one like
eight or ten-word section

01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:38.660
that you pulled
off of Wikipedia,

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.410
and I've had students grab the
first 15 words off of Wikipedia

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:45.080
and put it right in
their paper, that's

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.880
kind of a sloppy thing to do.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.279
And usually, if I was
grading, that paper

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:52.279
would get like a C or a D and
it wouldn't get an A or a B.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:56.390
And I'm not going to be a
hard-nosed guy about 10 words.

01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:59.870
But if you extensively
plagiarize a couple hundred

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.930
words in a 900-word
paper, you're

01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:05.300
going to get an F on the paper.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.370
Now, you can recover
on the group paper.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.417
But don't plagiarize
on your group paper

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:11.750
because you're also going to
bring down your colleagues.

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:15.080
I don't know in pass-fail
land what I will do.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:18.770
But if somebody really is
trying to test the limit,

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:22.100
you would test it by
extensive plagiarism.

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:22.820
Enough on that.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:26.330
I've had it in the
past occasionally.

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:30.380
So I got to say it.

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.750
I would say speak up
in class if you can.

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:34.940
Keep your videos on,
as most of you have.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.770
Keep your audios muted.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:38.360
But please speak up.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:44.440
I mean, don't be
hesitant at all.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.050
And then I do have office hours.

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:50.800
And the crazy thing was
I set up office lunches.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.860
So on those following Tuesdays
and Thursdays, I had--

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.590
there's a spreadsheet.

01:10:56.590 --> 01:11:00.160
Romain, maybe we should send
it around to this group.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.520
There's a Google Spreadsheet
if you wanted to sign up.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:08.390
And right before we left, before
SIP week, a student said hey,

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.430
I'm signed up for the 31.

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.020
Will you still do the lunches?

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:12.770
I laughed.

01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:15.870
I said listen, I'm
willing to do it.

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:17.750
I'm willing to do
remote lunches.

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:20.480
It's crazy.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.540
So if you want it-- if
nobody signs up, I'm fine.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.310
I'll go for a run.

01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:28.190
I live in Baltimore and
I'm still able to run here.

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.510
They might shut that down,
too, at some point in time.

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:33.210
But for now, I'm
able to do my runs.

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:36.410
So I think that's
it on the slides.

01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:42.570
And then I think I'm supposed
to finish this class right now.

01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:43.288
I went over.

01:11:43.288 --> 01:11:44.330
I want to thank you all--

01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:45.460
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
Maybe just one--

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.470
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:47.580
ROMAIN DE SAINT PERIER:
Just one clarification,

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.230
because I'm getting a lot
of questions on the group

01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:49.860
formation.

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.940
So groups will be from
three to four students,

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.650
and you are supposed
to group yourselves,

01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:57.255
right, through the
Canvas function.

01:11:57.255 --> 01:11:58.630
If that doesn't
work out for you,

01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.210
we're going to send
out a link where

01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:02.700
you can find other
team members who also

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.390
are looking for team members.

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:06.533
So do not worry about
the group formation.

01:12:06.533 --> 01:12:07.950
GARY GENSLER: And
I thank you all.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.960
I know this is unusual.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.690
I see you on Wednesday
morning, 8:30 AM.

01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:17.480
And please stay
safe and be well.

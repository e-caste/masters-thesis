00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.850
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.370
lecture on Nonlinear Finite
Element Analysis of Solids and

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.700
Structures.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.770
In the previous lectures, we
discussed quite general

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.220
kinematic formulations and
numerical algorithms that we

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.210
use for nonlinear finite
element analysis.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.610
We also referred to and used a
stress strain matrix C, but we

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.580
did not discuss this matrix
in any depths.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.990
This is the topic of
this lecture and

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.420
the following lectures.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.340
The stress strain matrix C is
used in the calculation of the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.180
K matrix, and is schematically
shown on this graph.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.730
And of course, the stress strain
matrix is also used in

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.069
the evaluation of the force
vector F, as shown here.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.510
The stress strain matrix, of
course, will be different for

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.180
different material behaviors.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.980
It will be different for
different kinematic

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.500
formulations that we're using.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.260
And all these aspects we now
have to discuss in this and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.650
the following lectures.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.680
We notice that when we do finite
element analysis, we

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.540
have the choice of different
kinds of formulations.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.160
And we talked about the
formulation that takes only

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.030
into account infinitesimally
small displacements.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.920
But of course, material
nonlinear behavior, we

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.870
actually call that formation
a materially nonlinear only

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.770
formation, an MNO formulation.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.720
We may have or use a formulation
that takes into

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.580
account large displacements,
large rotations, but only

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.350
small strains.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.320
This, for example, would be a
total Lagrangian formulation.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.290
And we have also formulations
that take into account large

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.200
displacements, large locations,
and large strains.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.170
And here we use, once again,
the total Lagrangian

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.750
formulation or an updated
Lagrangian formulation.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.020
We discussed these formulations,
of course,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.610
earlier in the earlier
lectures.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.350
The applicability of material
descriptions is also very well

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.830
categorized in these
three categories.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.400
In other words, there are
certain material description

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.000
constitutive relations that hold
for infinitesimally small

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.560
displacements and small strains,
and that are not

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.020
directly applicable
to large strains.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.430
If, however, we have a material
description that is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.240
applicable to infinitesimally
small displacements and small

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.050
strains, then we will see that
same material description can

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.250
directly be used also in the
large displacement, large

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.520
rotation, but small strain
analysis, provided we use the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.920
proper formulation.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.970
We will discuss this
aspect just now.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.740
In fact, the formulation that we
are using in this category

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.330
of problems is a total
Lagrangian formulation.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.010
Let us very briefly once more
recall that we have the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.790
materially-nonlinear-only
formulation, as I just

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.580
mentioned, the total Lagrangian
formulation and the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.570
updated Lagrangian formulation,
which we

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.120
discussed in earlier lectures.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.960
And that really kinematically,
these formulations here

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.120
kinematically, for the analysis
of two dimensional,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.150
three dimensional solids, using
isoparametric finite

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.690
element formations, we include
all large displacement, large

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.380
rotation, and large
strain effects.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.730
Of course, whether the
formulation will actually be

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.550
applicable to model a particular
problem, will also

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.680
depends on whether we use and
have the right constitutive

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.450
relation for that problem.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.460
And that is an aspect that we
will concentrate on now in

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.480
this and the following
lectures.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.530
But notice that kinematically
these formations include all

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.780
nonlinearities.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.780
If we look very briefly at
various material descriptions,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.340
we have here typical models that
I used and examples of

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.529
applications, materials,
practically all materials

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.370
behave elastically as long as
the stress and the strains are

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.348
small enough.

00:04:26.348 --> 00:04:28.620
A hyperelastic material
would be, for

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.696
example, a rubber material.

00:04:30.696 --> 00:04:33.540
A hypoelastic material
would be the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.780
concrete material model.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.870
And elasto-plastic material
would be applicable to model

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.900
metals, soils, rocks under
high stresses.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.800
A creep material model would be
applicable to model metals

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.430
at high temperatures.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.820
When the temperatures are
high, then metals are

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.110
subjected very easily
to creep.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.070
A viscoplastic material model
really takes into account the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.670
elasto-plasticity and the
creeping effect of the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.720
material and is used frequently
to idealize or to

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.280
represent polymers and metals.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.140
We will talk about a number of
these material models in this

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.660
and the following lecture.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.670
We will not go into depths of
concrete material models and

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.130
rock material models, but still
whatever we are talking

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.770
about is applicable to a wide
range of material models.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.130
Let us first look now, in this
lecture, at the elastic

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.120
material behavior.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.250
Elasticity means that for a
particular strain, you are

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.710
given a particular stress.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.010
The history does not enter
in the solution.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.770
And a linear elastic
stress strain

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.380
relationship is shown here.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.450
Notice for the strain, tE, we
are given a stress t sigma.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.320
And it's a unique stress.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.840
It is a unique stress.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.520
And of course, the history
of the formation does

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.920
not enter at all.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.010
Notice that in this particular
case, we would have that

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:20.126
typically t sigma here is
equal to E times te.

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:24.340
te being of course this value
here, t sigma there.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.430
Notice that an increment in
stress is given by d sigma

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.370
equal to E times de.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.260
Linear elasticity, a linear
elastic material description,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.695
means E is constant.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.880
For nonlinear, as a nonlinear
elastic material description,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.600
we might have schematically in
a one-dimensional analysis,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.440
this relationship here,
the red curve.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.560
Notice that, once again, for a
particular strain, we pick up

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.660
a unique value of stress.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.420
And this relationship here
shows that t sigma is

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.804
given tC times te.

00:07:05.804 --> 00:07:10.320
tC is the slope of
this line here.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.020
Now, an increment in stress
is obtained by this

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.510
relationship here.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.680
d sigma equals C times de.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.220
Notice that C is not
the same as tC.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.690
This is here, relating
the total stress

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.930
to the total strain.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.790
Here we talk about an increment
in stress related to

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.430
an increment in strain.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.820
It's important to note that
C is not the same as tC.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.750
Unless, of course, we have a
linear elastic relationship.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.420
In a computer program, we would
represent such a curve

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.510
typically by a series of
straight lines, as shown here.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:59.330
And the input, of course, would
be these points here,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.460
and the corresponding points
on the stress curve.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.670
Notice that if you take a large
number of such straight

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.010
segments, you can really
approximate a continuous curve

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.620
such as this one here
quite well.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.930
We can generalize this elastic
material behavior using the

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.350
total Lagrangian formulation,
as shown here.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.320
Notice that the total stress,
second Piola-Kirchhoff

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.380
stress-- we talked about
this stress measure

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.580
in an earlier lecture--

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.679
is given by the stress strain
law times the total strain.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.400
Green-Lagrange strain-- once
again we talked about this

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.610
strain measure in an
earlier lecture.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.130
Incrementally, we have
this relationship.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.510
The increment in the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress is

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.130
related to the increment in the
Green-Lagrange strain via

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.890
this constitutive law.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.690
Notice that this tensor or the
components of this tensor are

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.400
not the same as those components
in general.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.790
This material description is
frequently employed in two

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:12.460
types of analysis, the usual
constant material moduli for

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.570
infinitesimal displacement
analysis.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.120
Or for rubber-type analysis,
rubber-type materials, I

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.890
should say, where of course this
matrix is not constant.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.090
And that matrix is not
constant either.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.550
I like to now spend
time on discussing

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.410
these type of analyses.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.980
The use of the constant material
moduli means, for

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.500
example, for an isotropic
material, that we use these

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.610
matrices given via this
relationship here.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.750
Notice lambda and mu are the
Lame constants, that you're

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.780
probably familiar with, and data
ij is the Kronecker data,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.570
defined as shown down here.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.430
These are the same constants
that are used

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.410
also in linear analysis.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:09.530
So no new parameters are
introduced here.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:15.100
As examples, here we have the
stress strain law for the 2-D

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.190
plane stress analysis.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.880
I've written it in matrix form,
and this zero here means

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.640
total Lagrangian formulation.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.550
And notice that there could
also be a t up here.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:35.150
In other words, we use the same
matrix for the increment

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.440
in the stresses and for
the total stresses.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.590
So I could very easily put a t
up there, and we notice then

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:51.640
that the last row corresponds
to this relationship here.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.770
It's important to recognize that
on the right hand side

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.970
here, we have the Green-Lagrange
strain, t0 zero

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.240
epsilon 12 plus t0 21.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.200
In other words, we take the
total sharing strain into

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.510
account here.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.340
And that gives us then
this row and

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.590
that column, of course.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.090
For 2-D, access symmetric
analysis, we would use this

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.180
stress-strain law, once again,
for the increments in the

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.670
stresses and for the
total stresses.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.850
For an orthotropic material, we
would typically have this

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.316
stress strain law in plane
stress, plane strain analysis.

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:37.630
And there you see
again, the zero.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:42.880
Notice Ea, Eb are the material
and nu ab are the material

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.790
moduli corresponding to the
a and b, directions and

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:51.020
similarly the sheer
modulis Gab.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:56.880
The material being orthotropic
means Ea is not equal to Eb.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.680
This once again is the material
law that we are quite

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.610
familiar with from
linear analysis.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.240
Now let's look at the sample
problem, the sample analysis.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.950
And I would like to choose a
very simple problem to just

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.050
demonstrate some of the aspects
of using a total

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.980
Lagrangian formulation with
a constant material law.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:27.230
Here we have a bar, with cross
sectional area A bar.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.380
We use the material constants E
and nu, the ones that we are

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.530
used to you in liner analysis.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.550
And we want to use this stress
strain relationship.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.650
We assume that the area A bar
remains constant when we pull

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.740
the bar out, or when
we push it in.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.370
This E curl here is given via
this relationship here, E

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.750
being the Young's modulis nu
being the Poisson ratio.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:04.090
In tension, the bar would be
pulled out as shown here.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.370
Notice the area, the
cross sectional

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.740
area, remains constant.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:14.860
And the displacement is
measured as t delta.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:22.050
In compression, the bar would be
pushed into, as shown here.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.930
Notice here now t delta and the
bar has been pushed in as

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.530
shown by the blue outline.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:39.810
If we now apply this stress
strain law, to the problem and

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:45.700
develop a relationship between
the force required here to

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:51.190
pull the bar out or push
it in, by delta,

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.400
we obtain the following.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.330
Here we have the Green-Lagrange
strain.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.830
And of course, the right hand
side involves derivatives that

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.410
we have been discussing in
the previous lecture.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:09.950
Notice t0u1,1 is nothing else
than this relationship here.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.070
It's given by the current length
and the original length

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.630
of the bar.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:20.470
Substituting into here, we get
directly this right hand side.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:25.340
We also remember that we can
calculate or we have a very

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.300
clear relationship between the
Cauchy stress, which is the

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.910
force per unit area, which
we are interested

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.250
in calculating here.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.560
And the second, Piola-Kirchhoff
stress, this

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.750
is the inverse of the
deformation gradient.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:46.100
We substitute for here, the
Cauchy stress of course being

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.490
simply the force divided by
A bar, the inverse of the

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.440
deformation gradient
being given by this

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.400
relationship here.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.740
And therefore we can evaluate
the second Piola-Kirchhoff

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.730
stress in of the externally
applied force, the physical

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:07.650
force, divided by the constant
area, cross-sectional area, A

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:12.520
bar, and the original length
and the current length.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.370
We therefore have now the
Green-Lagrange strain and the

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:20.020
second Piola-Kirchhoff stress,
in terms of current lengths

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:25.160
and original lengths
and force applied--

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.900
and of course the cross section
area goes in there.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.950
Substituting these relationship
and that

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.680
relationship into our stress
strain relationship of the

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:43.530
previous view graph and using
this fact here, we directly

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:49.600
obtain this red curve in the--

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.750
which gives us the force
applied to the bar as a

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:59.240
function of the displacements
at the end of the bar.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.340
Now notice that this is
a nonlinear curve--

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.190
the expression is actually
given here--

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.270
and that it is quite
unrealistic, certainly in this

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.300
region here.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.340
It's not a realistic material
description for large strains.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:24.070
You see here at this point, we
have a 0 force to be applied

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:29.060
when the displacement, the end
of the displacement, is minus

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.010
the original lengths
off the bar.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.920
Quite unrealistic, of course.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.410
And therefore, we recognize
that really this use of a

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:43.730
constant E and nu, going in
here, constant Young's modulus

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.710
and Poisson's ratio,
going in here.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:53.060
It's really not a proper or
realistic way to proceed for

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.310
large strains.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.260
The usual isotopical and also
orthotopic material

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:05.020
relationships, meeting constant
E, nu, Ea, et cetera,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.020
the way I just showed it on a
few previous view graphs are

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.520
really almost exclusively
employed in large

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.234
displacement, large rotation,
but small strain analysis.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.300
We should now recall one very
important namely that the

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.849
components of the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor,

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.470
and of the Green-Lagrange strain
tensor are invariant

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:35.610
very under a rigid body motion
of the material.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:41.560
And this is most important
because we use this fact to

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.770
apply material descriptions that
are applicable to small

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:51.090
strain analysis directly also
to large displacement, large

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.210
rotation analysis.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:58.350
You see, E nu, Ea are material
constant that applicable to

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.940
small strain analysis.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.230
And we can directly them some
also in large displacement,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.710
large quotation analysis,
but small strain

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.410
analysis using this fact.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.950
And this means--

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.590
another way of saying it is
that the actual straining

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.990
increases only the components
of the Green-Lagrange strain

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.060
tensor through the material
relationships.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.610
Let's look at this
equation here.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.810
We have here the nodal point
force vector being equal to

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:36.980
the stress strain--

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:42.280
the strain displacement matrix
times a stress vector, the

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.030
second Piola-Kirchhoff
stress vector.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.310
Now this vector is invariant
under rigid body rotation.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.670
And of course, this vector
is calculated using the

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.750
constitutive relation.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.030
This strain displacement
matrix takes

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.570
into account the rotation.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:05.690
Let's look at this fact
a little bit closer.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.050
Here we have pictorially an
element, a four-node element

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:14.050
say, that originally is in this
configuration, the black

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:24.110
configuration, and we are
pulling it out and sharing it.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.850
If this length here is 1
originally, and that length

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:32.550
here is 1 originally, then this
distance here corresponds

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.870
to the Green-Lagrange strain in
the 1:1 direction, in the

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.220
one direction.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.890
In other words, it's equal
to 1 0 epsilon 1 1.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:46.560
Similar, this distance here is
equal to 1 0 epsilon 2 2, and

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.800
the total sharing is equal
to the sum of these two

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.790
components here.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:59.170
This is the deformation that
brings the element, say, from

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.730
the original configuration
to state 1.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:10.470
Now, going from state 1 to state
2, we rotate the element

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.290
rigidly, as shown here.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:19.740
Then we know that this distance
here is still 1 0

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.690
epsilon 1 1.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.230
Same as what we have had here.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:30.010
This distance here is the same
as what we have seen here.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:35.810
And the total sharing is still
the same as what the total

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.060
sharing was here.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:44.140
Notice the Green-Lagrange
strain components

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.480
corresponding to the stationary
coordinate axes.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.300
1 and 2 have not changed.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:59.170
Because here this 1 and that 2
refer still too the stationary

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.420
coordinate frame.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.425
On this view graph, we summarize
this information

00:21:06.425 --> 00:21:10.330
once more for small strains,
we have of course this

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:16.570
relationship here, which means
that these strain components

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.280
are much smaller than 1.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.340
And we can directly say that
the second Piola-Kirchhoff

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.710
stress in configuration 1 is
given by the Green-Lagrange

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.030
strains in configuration 1.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.290
Notice the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress is

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.860
approximately equal to the
Cauchy stress in state 1.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.680
Now since state 2 is reached by
just a rigid body motion,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.620
we find that this holds, as I
already pointed out on the

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.850
earlier view graph.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.290
We also find that this holds.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.575
And of course, the Cauchy
stresses in state 2 are

00:21:55.575 --> 00:22:01.040
obtained by a rotation of the
Cauchy stresses in state 1.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.320
But the second Piola-Kirchhoff
stresses and Green-Lagrange

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.620
strains, the components of
these two tensors are

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.790
invariant under the
rigid body motion.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.270
And that means that we can
directly apply material

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.360
relationships that are
applicable for small strains

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.710
and infinitesimal
displacements.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.750
Those that we are, say, already
familiar with from an

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.660
MNO analysis.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.070
We can directly apply these to
large displacement, large

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.160
rotation, but small strain
analysis, by simply using

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.000
Green-Lagrange strains instead
of engineering strain

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.590
components, and second
Piola-Kirchhoff stresses

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.950
instead of the engineering
stress components.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.270
Applications are really all
large displacement, large

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.290
rotation, small strain
analyses of

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:54.700
beams, plates, and shells.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:02.565
We can use for this analysis
frequently simply the 2D and

00:23:02.565 --> 00:23:06.040
3D elements that we
discussed earlier.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.070
But we may want to use beam and
shell elements, and those

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:14.070
we will discuss in
later lectures.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.860
We also have a very large
application area here, namely,

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.700
the linearized buckling analysis
of structures.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.520
We have already performed the
analysis of shells, or shown

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.250
how we analyze shelves
and beams

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.670
using continuum elements.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.800
You might recall it from
the earlier lectures.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.500
Here you have just schematically
how we would

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.530
model say a frame using
plain stress elements.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:47.960
And here you should see
schematically how we are

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.170
modeling using axisymmetric
continuum elements and

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.420
axisymmetric shell.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:24:01.100
Here we use 3D elements to
model a general shell.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.590
But as I pointed out, we will
talk in later lectures about

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.290
actual beam and shell elements
that are frequently much more

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.135
effective in the analysis of
beam and shell structures.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.970
This completes the first large
item that I wanted to talk to

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:24.220
you about, namely, the use of
constant material moduli, E,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:31.590
nu, Ea, Eb, et cetera in large
displacement, large rotation

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.900
analysis, but small
strain analysis.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.210
We found that the applicability
of constant

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:43.610
material moduli to large strain
analysis is really very

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.260
questionable.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:52.340
For large strain analysis, we
use frequently a hyperelastic

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.210
material model.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:58.180
And that is very widely used to
analyze rubber materials.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.670
Here we have the relationship
that is basic to this

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.500
description.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.160
We have the Piola-Kirchhoff
stress, given in terms of the

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.710
partial of the strain energy
density function, W, this

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.510
respect to the Green-Lagrange
strains.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:20.030
So we get one component here,
by taking this t0W and

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.460
differentiating it with respect
to the corresponding

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.930
component of the Green-Lagrange
strain.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.810
And of course this right
hand side gives

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.460
us this tensor t0Cijrs.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.860
Incrementally, then, we have
an increment in the second

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.010
Piola-Kirchhoff stress is given
by this stress strain

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:46.400
law here, involving a tangent
material description and an

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.140
increment, a differential
increment, in the

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.960
Green-Lagrange strain.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.720
This 0Cijrs is nothing else
but the second partial

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.210
derivative of W with respect to
these Green-Lagrange strain

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.670
components.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.390
W is a strain energy density
function per

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.170
unit original volume.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.700
And of course that has to be
defined for the particular

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.200
material that you're looking
at and will involve certain

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.180
material constants.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.290
For rubber, we generally use
this kind of description here,

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:23.140
where W is a function of I1,
I2, I3, and the Is are the

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.340
invariants of the Cauchy-Green
deformation tensor.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.975
We discuss the Cauchy-Green
deformation tensor in an

00:26:29.975 --> 00:26:31.720
earlier lecture.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.600
Of course, it's given in terms
of the deformation gradient.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.280
So I1 is equal to this.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.590
I2 is equal to this relationship
here on

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.700
the right hand side.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.530
And I3 is simply the
determinant of the

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.900
Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.665
For example, one material law
that is quite widely used is

00:26:52.665 --> 00:26:56.050
the Mooney-Rivlin material
law, where two

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.260
constants enter here.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.140
And of course, we have
here I1 and 12.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.270
These are material constants
that have to be determined

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.960
depending on what rubber
you're dealing with.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.880
And the incompressibility
constraint is imposed onto the

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.720
formulation by having
I3 equal to 1.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.930
Of course, rubber is an
incompressible material, at

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.060
least almost an incompressible
material, and is modeled as an

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.240
incompressible material.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.930
And so we want to have
I3 equal to 1.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.100
In general, if you deal with
incompressible materials, it

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:38.260
is effective to not use the
displacement-based finite

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.700
element formulations the way
I've been discussing it in the

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.210
previous lectures, but to amend
that formulation, you

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.340
should really extend that
formulation to have an

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.630
effective formulation
to deal with

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.120
incompressibility in the analysis.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.430
Except for the plane stress
case, we can directly use what

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.680
we discussed earlier.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.570
The formation for
incompressibility, or for

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:10.840
analysis of incompressible
materials, such formulations

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.700
of course are very valuable
but the discussion of such

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.010
formulations really deserves
another lecture.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:26.680
Well, we like to now show how
this material law is used in

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.400
the plane stress case.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.130
There we can directly employ
the formulation that we

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.010
discussed in the earlier
lectures.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.360
Time 0, for example, we would
have a piece of material as

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.330
shown here.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:44.210
At time t, this piece of
material has deformed, as

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.230
shown here.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.070
Notice plane stress of course
means stress is

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.300
0 through the thickness.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:56.630
For this two-dimensional
problem, the Cauchy-Green

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:01.100
deformation tensor
is as shown here.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.840
0 components here.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.890
And we imposed the
incompressibility of the

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:14.980
material by simply setting the
determinant of this matrix

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.170
equal to 1.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.770
And this gives us then a
constraint on T0C33.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.330
Basically, we are saying
physically that we constrain

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:30.110
the material to shrink into this
33 direction such that

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:34.000
for the applied stresses in the
plane of the material, the

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.270
material acts as
incompressible.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.770
And that's what's being done
here mathematically.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:45.010
We can now evaluate with this
constraint I1 and I2.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.280
Here you see the expressions.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.965
And if we have I1 and I2, we
can go back to the material

00:29:53.965 --> 00:29:59.070
law, substitute and directly
octane obtain our second

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:05.940
Piola-Kirchhoff stresses, in
terms of the Cauchy-Green

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.160
deformation tensor components.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.290
And of course, we also have
a relationship between the

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.100
Cauchy-Green deformation tensor
components and the

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.690
Green-Lagrange strain
components.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.380
Those we use.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:24.370
That relationship we use, and
that actually brings into it

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.800
this relationship here.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.640
And if you performed then the
differentiation, the final

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.220
result is shown on
this view graph.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.730
This is the stress strain
relationship that gives the

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:45.280
total stresses in terms
of the Cij components.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:56.010
You similarly proceed to also
calculate the tangent

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.850
relationship, the tangent
stress strain law.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.780
As I pointed out earlier, you
need to now take second

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.290
derivatives of W with respect
to the Green-Lagrange strain

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.740
components.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.310
And if you also use the
relationships between the

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.530
Green-Lagrange strain components
and the components

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.590
of the Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor, you

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.590
directly arrive at
this expression.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:19.090
And of course now, you would
have to substitute as we did

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:23.600
earlier for calculating the
total stress strain law, in

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.580
other words, the stress strain
giving us a total stress as a

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.930
function of the total
deformations.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:34.110
You proceed in the same way, and
obtain the tangent stress

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.790
strain law.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.080
Let us now look at an example.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.280
In this example, we are
considering the analysis of a

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.080
tensile test specimen.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.830
The specimen is shown here.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.490
All dimensions are given
in millimeters.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:53.270
The thickness of the specimen
is one millimeter, and the

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:57.540
Mooney-Rivlin constants
are given here.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.720
We need to model only one
quarter of the specimen

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.850
because of symmetry
conditions.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:07.930
And in the analysis, we used
14 eight-node elements to

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.370
represent this quarter
of the specimen.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.550
Notice that on the right hand
side, we constrained all

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.370
material particles to move
together and only move to the

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.840
right, as shown by delta here.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.890
This represents 1/2 the gauge
length of the specimen, and

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.040
one is particularly interested
in seeing the deformations in

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.990
that gauge length.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.880
This view graph now shows
the calculated response.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.510
The applied node
is given here.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.930
The extension is given here.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.240
This is the gauge response.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.330
And that gives us--

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.910
this curve gives us the
total response.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:54.620
Of course, quite nonlinear,
because the material is a

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.840
nonlinear elastic material.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.900
The deformed mesh is shown on
the next view graph here.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.975
At the force 4 Newton, we
have this deformed mesh

00:33:05.975 --> 00:33:08.110
here shown in red.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.640
And notice here, we have the
undeformed mesh in dashed

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.090
black line.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.860
Notice that the displacements
are large, and the strains

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:23.010
certainly are very large
in this problem.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.270
Finally I would like to share
with you some analysis results

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.400
that we obtained in the analysis
of a rubber sheet

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.640
with a hole.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.590
And these analysis results are
shown on the slides, so let me

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:40.240
walk over here so that we can
share that information.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.330
Here, we show the
rubber sheet.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:47.970
It's a square sheet, 20 inch
by 20 inch, that contains a

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.970
hole of diameter 6-inch.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:56.460
Notice the sheet is subjected
to a force on the left hand

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.460
side, the distributed
pressure, uniformly

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.960
distributed pressure on the
left hand side and on the

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.330
right hand side.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:09.590
The mass density is given over
here also, and the thickness

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.940
off the sheet is given
here as well.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.545
We will use the mass density
later on when we perform also

00:34:15.545 --> 00:34:19.960
or look at the results of
a dynamic analysis.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.980
The next slide now shows the
finite element mesh that we

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:27.120
used to model one quarter
of the sheet.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.590
We only needed to model one
quarter because of symmetry

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.969
conditions.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:36.860
Notice we used four-node
elements in this mesh, and

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.040
that the distributive pressure
on this right hand side is

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:47.590
modeled by concentrated
loads at these nodes.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.350
The next slide shows
now the solution

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.050
results that we obtained.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.250
Notice down here, we have a
little key for the points that

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.070
we want to look at.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:07.330
Here is point B. Here is point
A. And here is point C. The

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.500
graphs here shows the
displacements at point B, at

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:17.110
point A, and point C. In each
case, the W displacement,

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:23.180
which at point B is into this
direction, at point A is into

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:28.700
this direction, but at
point C is downwards.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.210
Notice the very large
displacements, W here, going

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:39.050
up to 10, 11 inches for
the load applied.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:44.500
Remember the sheet is a square
sheet of 20 inches, so we have

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.215
very large deformations here.

00:35:46.215 --> 00:35:50.990
We are computing our solution
results obtained in the total

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:55.960
Lagrangian formulation, with the
hyperelastic Mooney-Rivlin

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.320
material law, with the results
obtained by Iding.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.220
In fact, there is almost no
difference between our

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.020
results, and the results of
Iding, so that we could not

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:07.830
plot the difference.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.040
And these curves here
refer to our results

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.290
and the Iding results.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:18.150
The next slide now shows the
deformations that the sheet

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:21.490
has undergone at maximum load.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:25.870
Here is the original
configuration of the sheet,

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.560
the initial configuration.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.670
And here, we show the deformed
configuration of the sheet.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.720
Notice that the sheet has
undergone very large

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.750
displacements and very large
strains, particularly of

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.620
course here in the region
of the hole.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.900
The final slide then shows the
dynamic response that the

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.740
sheet undergoes when we subject
the sheet to a step

00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:00.980
loading, where the static
loading was applied before.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.340
Notice the step loading is
applied over 10 delta-t where

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.560
delta-a is 0.0015 seconds.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:16.850
It goes up linearly to 75 pounds
per square inch, and

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.440
then it stays constant.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.730
Once again, we're looking at the
displacements at point B,

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:29.450
point A, W displacements here,
and at point C downward

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:33.860
displacement, again denoted
as W. Here you see

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.470
the solution response.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:42.700
Point B, point A, and point C.
In this particular analysis,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:47.640
we used first the Newmark method
with data equal to 1/2

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.870
and alpha equal to 1/4.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.450
In fact, that is nothing else
than the trapezoidal rule,

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.090
which we discussed in
an earlier lecture.

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:58.430
We also performed the analysis
once with the Wilson theta

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.680
method, theta being 1.4.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.720
This method we did not discuss
in the earlier lecture, but it

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.020
is described in the textbook.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.080
Notice that the results obtained
using the Newmark

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.600
method and the Wilson theta
method are really very close

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.280
to each other.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.820
It's also interesting to see the
static response that the

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.130
sheet undergoes for this load
level at the points A, B, and

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:28.940
C, and that is given by these
horizontal lines.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.790
Once again, you have here a
large displacement and very

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.890
large strain problem.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.550
This brings me to the end of
what I wanted to discuss with

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:38.580
you in this lecture.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.900
Thank you very much for
your attention.

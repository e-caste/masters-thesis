WEBVTT

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:12.880
PROFESSOR: Let the minutes of
the proceeding show that I

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.540
re-entered the room
at 3:00 and 12

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.090
seconds, true to my word.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.980
OK, I wanted to give you one
example of a screw axis that

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.570
you're probably familiar
with in everyday life.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.150
That was a telephone pole that
I was very familiar with when

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.050
I was a little kid because we
used to love to wait until it

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.220
got dark and our parents
couldn't see us.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.660
And then, we'd climb
up the thing.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.770
And wow, you could see all over
the whole neighborhood.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.280
I'm surprised nobody
said, what?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.640
They had electricity when
you were a little kid?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.850
Yes, they did.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.530
But now it's all underground.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.880
So kids, I don't know
what they do for

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.090
recreation these days.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.750
OK, let me pursue this question
of screw axes.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.390
We've seen what a 2 sub 1
screw access looks like.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.960
I just erased it.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.920
But it consists of objects of
the same chirality extending

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.180
left and right on either side
of the principal axis.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.160
The symbol for a twofold
axis is this.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.300
The symbol for a twofold screw
axis is the symbol for a

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.030
twofold access with alternate
sides extended like a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.720
propeller, a very descriptive
symbol.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.380
The thing is rotating around.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.180
And you can think of these as
the little ribbons that you

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.646
used to have on the handle bars
of your bike when you

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:37.320
were a little kid.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.310
And as you pedaled along, these
things fluttered out

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.280
behind, and it was
really cool.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.350
OK, let's move on to the next
family of screw axes.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.880
And let me look at an operation
A2 pi over 3 with a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.210
translation component, tau.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.870
And these things are going
to get awfully

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.380
cumbersome to draw.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.120
So let me use a device--

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.199
I wish I could claim
credit for it.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.605
But actually, a student in my
class one year said, hey, I've

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:15.560
got a really cool way to draw
these things for you.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.720
Let's imagine that this
is a screw axis.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.580
We put a cylinder of paper
around the screw.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.150
And then, let's divide up the
surface of the paper in terms

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.660
of end segments.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.200
So if this were a threefold
screw axis, these would be 120

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.760
degrees segments.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.960
And then, let's draw horizontal
lines on the sides

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.220
of the cylinder.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.750
Then, if we want to see how the
screw axis reproduces a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.450
pattern from a given motif, you
just fill in these boxes.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.200
And then when you're all done,
cut the cylinder and you can

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.810
draw the pattern quite nicely on
a two dimensional surface.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.220
So this is what I call the
unrolled cylinder device.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.620
Somebody very imaginative
invented it.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.960
His name, unfortunately,
is lost to history.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.360
But I didn't want to claim
credit for it myself.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.935
So what is the pattern
of a threefold screw

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:21.110
axis going to be?

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.550
Let's let the difference
between boxes be the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.610
translation component, tau.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.520
And so what we will do is take
an initial motif, rotate it

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.150
120 degrees, slide it up by tau
relative to the axis about

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.630
which we're rotating.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.650
Performing the operation again
would involve rotating 120

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.580
degrees, sliding up by tau.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.340
Doing it yet get again brings
us back down full circle.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.480
So this would be the
translational periodicity

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.260
along the direction
of the screw axis.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.540
And this would be the value
of tau equal to 1/3 of the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.790
translation.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.030
So that is what a threefold
screw access would look like.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.040
And the pattern obviously, if
we would keep repeating it,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.760
would do something like this--

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.670
so perfectly interpretable,
easy to draw.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.540
But things are actually more
interesting and more

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.790
complicated than this.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.790
We are stating two things
about this operation.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.510
We're specifying
a translation.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.170
But then the other thing that
we're specifying is the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.200
translation component tau.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.180
And why should we be constrained
to say that tau

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.275
can only be one nth of
the translation?

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.560
If we do the operation n
times, then doing the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.400
operation n times would
give us a total

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.780
translation of n tau.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.150
But there's no reason why that
has to be one translation.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.534
Why not two?

00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:22.500
Why not three?

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.740
Why not four?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.750
So the only real constraint is
that n tau has to be some

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.220
integer, m, times the
translation that is parallel

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.370
to the screw axis.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.190
And this means that the value
of tau is not just

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.710
equal to 1 nth of--

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.390
restricted to 1 nth--

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.770
of t.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.370
Tau can be m/n times T.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.590
And that is perfectly
compatible.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.200
You do the operation n times.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.580
You're going to be directly
above where you started.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.120
That's going to be a
translation vector.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.350
But why not two translations, or
three translations, or four

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.130
translations?

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.900
So there are infinitely more
screw axes than just the n

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.800
subscript something
translations.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.300
So let's look at some of
the possibilities.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:24.220
For a threefold screw axis, tau
could be equal to 0T Tau

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.810
could be equal to 1/3 of T. Tau
could be equal to 2/3 of a

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.380
translation.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.050
Tau could be equal to 3/3 of the
translation, 4/3, 5/3, and

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.710
so on, on and on and on.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.080
We could fill the whole board
with possible screw axes

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.550
having different
values of tau.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:57.940
Now, let me convince you,
hopefully easily, that if tau

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.030
is equal to 3/3 t, tau would
be an integral number of

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.060
translations--

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.330
in this case, one.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.540
Down here, 6/3 t would
be two translations.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.880
We're already going to have
those operations in the

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.830
pattern when tau was
equal to 0T.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.090
So let me show you what I
mean if it's not clear.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:30.750
Here's a trio of objects on
either side of the rotation

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.000
part of the operation.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.750
So what I'm saying is tau
would be equal to two

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.000
translations.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.450
That would, for some perverse
reason, defining this as the

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.700
pitch of the screw.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.970
Is it clear that that is going
to be an operation that I

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.170
already have when I say there's
a threefold axis and a

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.910
translation, T, parallel
to that threefold axis?

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.400
That's going to give all sorts
of screw operations.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.300
But they are going to be
integral multiples of the

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.290
translation that's parallel
to the axis.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.730
So the rule is that we can
always subtract off one

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.480
translation from any of these
definitions of tau and reduce

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.430
it to something smaller.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:34.970
So we can always define tau
less than or equal to T

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.870
without any change or artificial
restrictedness on

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.730
the nature of the pattern.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:52.290
So that says that for a
threefold screw, for a

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.380
threefold screw axis,
there are only three

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.530
that we should consider.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.560
Tau equal to 0, and that's a
pure threefold rotation axis.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:07.380
tau could be equal to 1/3
of a translation.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.830
And now, we introduce
the notation used

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.200
to designate screws.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.360
If n tau was equal to mT, the
symbol for the screw axis is

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.435
n, the rank of the axis,
with m as a subscript.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.420
So the pattern that we just drew
here would be designated

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.080
3 subscript 1.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.350
And that's says automatically
that the value of tau was

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.380
equal to 1/3 of the
translation that's

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.930
parallel to the axis.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.650
So the only other ones we have
to consider besides 3 and 3

00:09:54.650 --> 00:10:03.520
sub 1 is 3 sub 2, where tau
would be equal to 2/3 of T.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.850
Let's see what that looks like
by quickly drawing it out

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.686
again using this dandy little
unrolled cylinder device.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.570
Let's let this be
my first motif.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:26.430
And I'll take this as the value
of tau, two boxes up.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:32.720
So I rotate, slide up by tau,
rotate, slide up by tau,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.610
rotate, slide up by tau,
and I'm back up here.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:43.050
And here is my translation.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.850
tau is equal to 2/3
of a translation.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.090
And my translation, then,
should be equal

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.560
to 3/2 times tau.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.790
But this is supposed to
be the translation.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.630
And there's nothing
in this box.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.640
OK, this introduces another very
important aspect of the

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.850
patterns produced
by screw axes.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:17.260
And it's sufficiently important
we must use first

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:30.290
the basic screw operation, A
alpha tau and the translation

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.240
in terms of which we
have defined tau.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:54.200
So use the spiral that you
have defined by stating A

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.160
alpha tau is the basic
operation.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.720
But then, don't quit.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.270
You're saying another thing,
that tau is a certain fraction

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.670
of a translation.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.970
And you have to use that
translation to generate

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.640
additional objects
in the pattern.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.990
So in this pattern that we've
drawn here, this is supposed

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.350
to be a translation.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:18.520
So I have to take this one and
slide it up by T. I have to

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.730
take this one and slide it up by
T. I have to take this one

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.200
and slide it down by T. So I'm
using a different kind of

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.110
shading to indicate the ones I
produced by A alpha tau and

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.550
the ones that I produced from
that helix by using the

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.710
translation, T.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.260
So this is the final pattern.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.910
It has a basic screw operation
that's equal to 2/3 of the

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.910
translation.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.620
And it has a translation
that's 3/2 of tau.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.100
So everything's fine.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.868
Yeah?

00:12:52.868 --> 00:12:55.856
AUDIENCE: For the very top one
where you have it colored in,

00:12:55.856 --> 00:12:56.860
[? should that stay ?]
outside the box?

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well, it's
supposed to be another row.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.240
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't that be
a box lower [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.800
PROFESSOR: Yes, it
should indeed.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.050
Thank you.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.530
When your nose is right in the
middle of the thing, sometimes

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.950
you don't notice that
as readily as

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.870
somebody in the audience.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.850
OK, so that's the pattern
of 3 sub 2.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.300
And now, if we realize that
we must use both the basic

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.050
operation, A alpha tau, and
translation to fill things in,

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.690
it's clear that if we try to
have tau greater than the

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.540
translation, the translations,
when we apply them, would give

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.100
us a screw that had the
possibility of being redefined

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.480
in terms of a shorter tau.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:58.120
OK, one thing that is apparent
if you look at this pattern is

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:06.290
that 3 sub 2 produces the same
sort of helix but in an

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.690
enantiomorphic sense.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.580
This one is a spiral
that goes this way.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:18.140
And this one increases when we
rotate in a clockwise fashion.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.390
So are they distinct?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.880
Yeah, they really are because
you can have both the left

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.860
handed spiral and the right
handed spiral together in the

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.270
same space group.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.600
I don't remember whether that's
true for the threefold

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.110
screw axes or not.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.210
I'm not sure.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.030
I have to check that.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.340
Yes?

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.770
AUDIENCE: So really
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.410
enantiomorphic because they're
all left handed.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.646
So it's just minus
1, isn't it?

00:14:45.646 --> 00:14:46.730
PROFESSOR: Good for you.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.430
I was about to make
that point.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:53.320
The sense of the spiral is
enantiomorphic in the sense

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.810
that this one is a right
handed spiral.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.960
This one is a left
handed spiral.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.890
But they're not truly
enantiomorphic patterns

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.800
because if we start with a right
handed motif, this one

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.060
also has a right handed motif.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.820
So I should qualify that
statement, which I

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.730
was about to do.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.560
It's the sense of the spiral
which is enantiomorphic.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.810
This is not to say that one has
motifs of one chirality

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.024
and the other one has to have
the opposite chirality.

00:15:22.024 --> 00:15:24.016
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you
just [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:24.016 --> 00:15:26.506
being minus 1?

00:15:26.506 --> 00:15:29.510
Just [INAUDIBLE] minus 1?

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:34.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I could do
that, I could do that.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.990
And remember that we can add or
subtract a translation at

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.490
will from tau.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.830
And if I took a full translation
and subtracted it

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.330
from 3 sub 1, I would get--

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.370
I get tau equal to minus 2.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.164
Nope, doesn't work that way.

00:15:58.164 --> 00:16:00.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's the
same tau but in the

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.668
opposite sense, yeah.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.470
OK, so what comes out of this is
that there are three kinds

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.710
of axes that involve a
120 degree rotation.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:21.280
Three, which we can view as
3 sub 0, 3 sub 1, 3 sub 2.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.560
The symbols that are used for
them now, we know and love the

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.410
triangle that represents the
locus of a threefold axis.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:35.590
Four 3 sub 1 and 3 sub 2, what
one does is to extend the

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.950
edges of the triangle.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.700
There's the streamers on
the bike handle again.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.670
And if you look down on the
pattern and use a right handed

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.850
spiral, then you extend the
streamers, the edges of the

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.940
triangle, that goes down into
the board this way.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.592
And 3 sub 2 would--

00:16:57.592 --> 00:17:00.080
if it was in the same pattern--
you would indicate

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.400
by extending the opposite pair
of the opposite set of edges.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.900
AUDIENCE: So would they be
different space groups?

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.470
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:21.819
PROFESSOR: Yes, there
is a P3 sub 1.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.970
And there is a P3 sub 2.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.211
And they are distinct
space groups.

00:17:30.211 --> 00:17:33.995
AUDIENCE: So how can you
distinguish [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.200
PROFESSOR: You would find
out where the atoms sit.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.170
And in one case, the spiral
would occur in a

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.300
right handed fashion.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.290
And in the other one, from
a left handed fashion.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.615
You can determine the position
of the atoms unambiguously.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.650
OK, let's do one that's more
interesting where the rank of

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.575
the rotation part of the
operation is higher.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.190
And let's look at fourfold
screw axes.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:28.270
So here, we would consider tau
equal 0, tau equals 1/4 of a

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:34.350
translation, tau equal to 2/4
of a translation, and tau

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.200
equal to 3/4 of a translation.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.990
So let's take our cylinder
that was formerly wrapped

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.835
around the rotation access,
straighten it out.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.480
And I won't bother to draw the
pattern for a fourfold access.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.290
But for a 4 sub1 1 screw axis,
this would be tau.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.360
And that would be one, two,
three, one quarter of a

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.630
translation that's
parallel to tau.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:19.040
Or conversely, so T
is equal to 4 tau.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.860
Or conversely, how is equal
to one quarter of the

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.000
translation.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.240
So start with a first motif,
rotate 90 degrees, slide up by

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.760
one quarter of the
translation.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.620
Rotate and slide, rotate
and slide.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.450
Now I've come full circle.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.420
Rotate and slide.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.760
So this, then, is the pattern
for the screw axis that I'll

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:53.540
label as 4 sub 1 by analogy to
what I've done with threefold

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.790
screw axes.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.220
Over here, let me immediately
jump to 4 sub 3.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.800
I'm going to have to be a little
more stingy with the

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.560
spacing of my boxes or I'm
going to run out of room.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:22.120
So if this is 4 sub 3, turns out
that tau should be equal

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.720
to 3/4 of a translation.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.920
And conversely, the translation
should equal to

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.520
4/3 of tau.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:38.540
So that's the situation that
I would obtain if one, two,

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:46.510
three boxes gives me the length
of tau and four boxes

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.650
give me the length of
the translation.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.750
OK, so again I'll use different
sorts of shading to

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.500
indicate which way I
have gotten this.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.290
I would rotate 90 degrees.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.650
I would jump up one,
two, three boxes.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.870
So here's the next one.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.530
Rotate, one, two, three boxes
up brings me to here.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.770
Rotate, one, two, three boxes
brings me up to here.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.450
Rotating again, sliding up three
boxes brings me to here.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.920
OK, so there's the
basic helix.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:34.536
And how is indeed equal to
4/3 of the translation.

00:21:34.536 --> 00:21:36.040
But I can't quit yet.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.000
I've used the basic operation,
A alpha tau.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.020
Now, I've got to fill
in with translation.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.950
And according to my rule, the
translation should be

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.450
equal to 4/3 of--

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:56.130
I'm sorry, this should be the
translation is 4/3 of tau.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.640
So this should be the
translation running up one,

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.710
two, three, four boxes.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.690
So that's--

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.050
I'll use a different
shading here.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.000
That would fill in one here.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.390
One, two, three, four boxes
up brings me to here.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:22.630
One, two, three, four boxes
up would bring me to here.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.750
Go down by four-- one,
two, three, four--

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.280
brings me to here.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.520
And let me use still a different
shading here.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.280
One, two, three, four brings
me down to here.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.910
Filling in quickly, one,
two, three, four.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.400
Another one would sit here.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.140
One, two, three, four, another
one would sit here.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.570
One, two, three, four, another
one would sit here.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:23:00.040
And you can see what is
happening here, that 4 sub 3

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:07.540
looks exactly like 4 sub 1 but
in the opposite sense.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:14.640
So it's the same relation as
between 3 sub 1 and 3 sub 2.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.590
What do we use as symbols?

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.950
This is a 4 sub 1 screw.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:25.125
And again, if we look down on
the pattern from the top, use

00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:33.750
a right handed rule and extend
every edge of the square, that

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.030
would be the symbol
for 4 sub 1.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.210
4 sub 3 is the same sort
of spiral, but in

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.390
the opposite direction.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:46.430
So we will, with a right handed
rule and going between

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:51.060
neighboring closest motifs, we
would extend this, extend

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.310
this, and extend this.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.860
So that's the symbol
for 4 sub 3.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.740
With that, we come back
over to here.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:09.000
And that is everything
except 4 sub 2.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.470
And again, I'll mark up a
cylinder that's been split

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:28.225
into quadrants, draw reference
horizontal lines.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.500
This is 4 sub 2.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.365
And we define this as tau.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.730
Then, the translation, this
should be equal to 1/4 of the

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.790
translation parallel
to the axis.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.550
And conversely, the translation

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.846
should be four halves.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.720
So let's draw the pattern.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.000
This was the first one.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.060
Rotate, slide up by tau.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.430
This is the next one.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.440
Rotate and slide, rotate
and slide.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:23.340
Rotate and slide begin,
rotate and slide.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:27.520
So this turns out to be the
nature of the helix that is

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.854
produced by A pi over 2 tau.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:40.160
But this is not yet a pattern
that has the translational

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.380
periodicity that
I have claimed.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.340
That's supposed to be
the translation,

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.280
twice tau, up to here.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:54.220
So I would have two slide
this one up to here.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.380
I'd have to slide this
one up to here.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:06.302
I'd have to slide this
one up to here.

00:26:06.302 --> 00:26:10.270
And something's wrong here--
one, two, three, four.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.960
I think I went too far
up for one of them.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.305
This one was one, two, three.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.040
This one, I went up too far.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.290
I skipped one.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.090
What did I do wrong?

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.572
AUDIENCE: You did the
rotation wrong.

00:26:34.572 --> 00:26:36.054
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:26:36.054 --> 00:26:37.536
AUDIENCE: The two [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:42.476 --> 00:26:45.165
PROFESSOR: OK, let me do
this all over again.

00:26:45.165 --> 00:26:47.420
Again, I can't see standing
right on top of it.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.740
It's not a very good attempt
to make it look easy.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.230
Let's split this up into
four quadrants.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.300
If this one comes out quite
differently, I'll make sure I

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.420
have it right.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.515
So this is my translation,
one, two, three.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.640
This is the translation.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:29.010
And that should be equal
to four halves of tau.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.390
So this, then, is
my value of tau.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.490
It should go up two
boxes to here.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:48.390
And that should be equal to 1/2
of T. So I want to rotate,

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:55.300
slide up two boxes, rotate,
slide up two boxes, rotate,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:00.570
slide up two boxes, rotate,
slide up two boxes, rotate,

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.300
and slide up two boxes.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.310
And now, I have to fill
in with translation.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:11.240
So I will take this one and go
up one, two, three, four

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:11.990
translations.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.870
That's what I did wrong.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.190
I'll take this one and go down
one, two, three, four

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:17.620
translations.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.030
Take this one and go up one,
two, three, four translations.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.690
Take this one and go one, two,
three, four translations.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:28.090
Take this one and go one, two,
three, four translations.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:35.680
And now, lo and behold, what I
have is one, two, three, four.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.190
Curious sort of thing--

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.090
I have two motifs
at every level.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.970
And they are 180
degrees apart.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:50.380
So a 4 sub 2 screw axis
produces a pattern

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.440
that looks like this.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.350
Pair of motifs like this 180
degrees apart, pair of motifs

00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:00.990
skewed by 90 degrees to that
pair, another pair

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:02.950
translationally equivalent
to the first.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:12.120
But what is the chirality
of this spiral?

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.570
3 sub 1 was right handed.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.260
4 sub 1 was right handed.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.290
4 sub 3 was left handed.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.670
4 sub 2 was right
in the middle.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.110
Is that right handed
or left handed?

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.420
The answer is it's both.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.390
It's both.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.170
There's one spiral that
goes up this way.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.020
And there's another spiral
that goes up in

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.120
the opposite sense.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.280
So it's both.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.270
It's a left handed spiral and a
right handed spiral together

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.520
in the same pattern.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.800
And the pattern for this screw
axis, the symbol for this

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:52.230
screw axis if it occurs in a
pattern, is every other edge

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.350
of the square extended.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.360
Which do you extend?

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.800
Well, it really doesn't matter
because it's both left handed

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.480
and right handed
simultaneously.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.030
So you can use either one.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.748
Yes, a couple questions?

00:30:04.748 --> 00:30:06.212
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
why you explain

00:30:06.212 --> 00:30:07.676
you did that shading?

00:30:07.676 --> 00:30:09.930
PROFESSOR: I just wanted
to differentiate

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.010
the ones that I used.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.630
They're all the same.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.650
And where they come from doesn't
affect what the basic

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:16.800
pattern looks like.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.990
But I tried to make clear which
ones I got by using the

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.200
operation A alpha tau.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.480
And for 4 sub 2, which I just
did twice, once correctly and

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.190
once incorrectly, these with
shading were produced by the

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.660
operation of rotating and
sliding up by 1/2 of the

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.700
translation.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.780
The other ones, the ones for
which I used this shading, I

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.690
filled in by using what
the translation was,

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.950
namely twice tau.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.740
So it's just a way of keeping
track of what operations I

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.090
used to produce everything
that's in the pattern.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:58.740
And for 4 sub 3, I had to use
three kinds of shading.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.535
Yes, sir?

00:30:59.535 --> 00:31:01.960
AUDIENCE: Should I [INAUDIBLE]
the fact that this was

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.900
actually two superimposed
twofold axis

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.780
separated by 1/2 T?

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.040
PROFESSOR: Yes, you could
read that into it.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:19.160
And you would be very observant
because a 4 sub 2

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.700
screw axis contains a twofold
rotation as a subgroup.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:32.190
PROFESSOR: And since you were
shrewd enough to deduce this--

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.620
we ask the question with glide
planes when we're dealing with

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.240
two dimensional plane groups.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.400
Is a glide plane a candidate
location

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.170
for a special position?

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.495
In other words, if I move the
atom directly onto a glide

00:31:48.495 --> 00:31:50.030
plane, is there coalescence?

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.040
The answer was no.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.730
Suppose I asked the same
question now of a screw axis.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.150
Is a screw axis a candidate
location

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.720
for a special position?

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.827
The answer is sometimes
yes, sometimes no.

00:32:05.827 --> 00:32:09.810
AUDIENCE: Well, only if
you have [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:13.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so actually if
I move the atom, the first

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:17.070
atom, onto the locus of the
rotation part of the

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.280
operation, I get pairwise
coalescence.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.150
And instead of getting all of
these, I'll have just a string

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.610
of single atoms separated
by half a

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.650
translation, half as many.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.100
So that's a special position.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.140
I don't get the full number out
when I throw one into the

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.390
space group.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:46.120
Now, there are an infinite
number of screw axes.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:52.050
My old friend, the saguaro
cactus, which has a 19 to

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:57.090
maybe 23-fold rotational
component to its symmetry,

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:01.620
does not, if I look at it
carefully, have the same thing

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:08.180
on every one of these ribs
because the tufts of spines

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.500
spiral up like this.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.380
So a saguaro cactus, if I take
the spines into account,

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.840
doesn't have 22-fold rotational
symmetry.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.480
It has some sort of 22-fold
screw axis.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.510
And I've never been determined
enough to risk puncturing my

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.180
finger by going down around a
saguaro and seeing if there's

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.670
some other tuft at the same
level and whether it's a 22

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.670
subscript 3 or 22 subscript
2 screw axis.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:39.410
But a saguaro cactus does
have a screw axis as

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.660
its symmetry element.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.690
OK, let us generalize
on the basis of what

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.940
we've done so far.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:34:00.740
For any screw axis whatsoever,
crystallographic or not, we

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:07.390
will have an n sub 1 screw, an
n sub 2 screw, where tau is

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:18.790
equal to 1 nth of a translation,
tau equal to 2

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.760
nths of a translation.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:27.300
And we will go all the way
up n sub n minus 1,

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.610
n sub n minus 2.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:38.020
And always, regardless of n, the
ones at either end tend to

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.590
be spirals in an enantiomorphic
sense.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:45.485
And n sub 2 and an n sub
n minus 2 are spirals.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:53.830
If you end up with an odd one
in the middle, this has no

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:55.540
chirality to the spiral.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:59.320
There's a left handed one
and a right handed one.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.880
On the other hand, for something
like two and four

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:12.580
and six, the ones at opposite
ends of the series are

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.790
enantiomorphs in the sense
of the rotation.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:24.220
For any six-fold screw axis--

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.250
and I will pass out the nature
of the pattern without taking

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.080
time to draw it--

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.660
6 sub 1 and 6 sub 5 are
enantiomorphous.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.620
6 sub 2 and 6 sub 4 are
enantiomorphous.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.020
And 6 sub 3 stands alone.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:45.610
6 sub 3 consists of a pattern of
three objects on a triangle

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:49.860
pointing in one sense, three on
a triangle pointing in the

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.460
opposite sense.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.430
This is the value of tau.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.030
And that is equal to 3/6
of the translation.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.970
So no left handed or
right handed sense.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:05.270
6 sub 2 consist of
pairs of objects

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.850
separated by 60 degrees.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:20.880
6 sub 4, exactly the same pairs,
but they go in the

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.130
opposite sense.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.390
6 sub 1 is just a single spiral
going up with atoms at

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.680
intervals of 1/6 of
the translation.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.340
6 sub 5, a spiral in
the opposite sense.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:53.090
OK, with that, let me pass out a
sheet that has patterns done

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.440
in a decent fashion
for all of the

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.880
crystallographic screw axes.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.360
Bear in mind that there are
fascinating, interesting, and

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.690
intriguing patterns for

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.570
non-crystallographic screw axes.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.220
And let me say a few words about
the symbol used in the

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.910
space group for glide planes.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:27.470
Any questions on this,
by the way?

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:30.730
I don't want to have beat
it into the ground.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:31.950
Yes?

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.375
AUDIENCE: I have a question
on symbols.

00:37:34.375 --> 00:37:37.770
How do you know which way the
arrows point on the triangle

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.435
or the squares?

00:37:41.435 --> 00:37:42.140
PROFESSOR: Oh, here?

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.170
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.910
Probably the best thing to do
is to look at the patterns

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.100
that I just passed around
if you got one yet.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:56.210
If you look at 3 sub 1 and look
down on it from the top

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:02.140
and indicate the sense of
rotation that gets you from

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:06.180
the one above to the one that's
directly below, your

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.040
hand will curl around in
a clockwise fashion.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.440
And the little tails on the
symbol for the threefold axis

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.770
trail out behind the way in
which you're rotating.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:23.230
If you look at 3 sub 2 and look
down on it, you would

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.330
have to, using your right
hand, rotate in a

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.820
counterclockwise sense.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.650
And therefore, the streamers
go out again in

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.950
the opposite direction.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.440
Same for 4 sub 1.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.390
There, every edge of the
square is enclosed.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.360
If you look at how you have to
rotate to get from the one on

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.510
top to the one immediately below
using your right hand,

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:50.830
again, you have to rotate
in a clockwise sense.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:56.770
And therefore, the edges that
are elongated trail out in the

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.780
opposite direction.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:03.770
And finally, drawn in a decent
fashion are 6 sub 1, 6 sub 5,

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.240
which are spirals in
the opposite sense.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.160
6 sub 2, 6 sub 4, pairs of
things at each level.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.340
And the level is 1/3
of the translation.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.700
6 sub 3, triangles of objects at
intervals that are equal to

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:26.920
1/2 of T, 3/6 of T. OK,
does that answer?

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.650
That is really a convention
of some higher order.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.630
But nevertheless, it is
a convention and it is

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.880
consistent.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.481
Other questions about
screw axes?

00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:37.968
Yeah?

00:39:37.968 --> 00:39:40.403
AUDIENCE: So in nature, is there
a difference between the

00:39:40.403 --> 00:39:41.864
right handed screw
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.940
PROFESSOR: That's like asking
is there something like a

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.660
Coriolis effect in crystals.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.000
You know the Coriolis effect
that if you're in the southern

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.640
hemisphere, the water gurgles
down the drain one direction.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.870
If you're in the northern
hemisphere,

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.120
the opposite direction?

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.080
There was actually a very
famous scientist,

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.320
what was his name?

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.370
I think it was Serret.

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.200
Serret, so famous I can't
think of his name.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:22.660
I remembers his name, Serret
He developed a very famous

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.150
theorem in kinetics, and that
was thermal migration,

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.250
migration driven not by a
chemical potential gradient

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.120
but by a temperature gradient.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.820
And it's very difficult
to measure.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.620
And only recently have people
been testing that theory and

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.710
making measurements.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.590
He asked this very
same question.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:46.900
And he said, I think it was
potassium chlorate that he

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.670
looked at which has no mirror
plane or inversion in it.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.690
So it occurs in left handed
and right handed forms.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:57.250
He asked, is there something
like a Coriolis effect that

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.660
would give you more right
handed crystals in the

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.130
northern hemisphere and more
left handed crystals in the

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.260
southern hemisphere?

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.350
So what he'd do, he drew
a lot of crystals.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:07.560
And he started counting.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.320
And he counted, and he
counted, and counted.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.990
And he couldn't tell if there
was a difference.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.170
And counted, counted, counted.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:17.770
And still, after lots and lots
of counting, still could not

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.150
get a result that was
statistically significant.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.445
And he went nuts.

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:23.590
Sorry to tell you this.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.190
So I think it remains to be seen
whether there is indeed a

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.335
Coriolis effect in
crystal shapes.

00:41:29.335 --> 00:41:29.970
And that's true.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:30.760
It's tragic.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.410
We're all laughing
at the poor guy.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.060
But he actually just
couldn't stand it.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.470
He counted so many
crystals, poof!

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.820
That's a true, unfortunate
story.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.400
No, I don't think there is any
difference between left handed

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.000
crystals or right
handed crystals.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.640
Remember my story about sugar
and its chirality and the

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.610
little bugs that can only
eat one chirality.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.980
Other questions of the less
frivolous nature?

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:05.420
That was not frivolous.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.670
That was a good question.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.490
OK, well let's say a little bit
about glide planes and how

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.500
they appear in space groups.

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:20.140
Things were very easy in two
dimensions because the glide

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.930
plane was a glide line.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:26.470
And everything had to
be confined to a

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.150
two dimensional space.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:32.970
So we used a solid line to
indicate a mirror plane, the

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.740
locus of the operation, sigma.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.980
And we use a dashed line to
indicate the locus of an

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.900
operation, sigma tau.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.510
And tau was in the direction
of the dashes.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:46.930
Well, I've given it all away
with the little diagram that I

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:47.550
passed around.

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:49.900
Things are much more complicated
in three

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.540
dimensions.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.670
If this is the locus of a glide
plane and this is the

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:58.500
direction of tau in a space
group, we could be looking at

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:04.570
that glide plane in a total
of four different ways.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:07.780
We could be looking at the glide
plane from the side,

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.090
edge on, and perpendicular
to tau.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.460
We could be looking at the glide
plane edge on and along

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.230
the direction of tau.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:21.170
Or we could be between these two
orientations and looking

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.290
at the glide plane edge on but
in between normal to tau and

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.690
parallel to tau.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.310
And finally, we could look
at the glide plane

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.560
down from the top.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.270
If we view the glide plane
from above, for example

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:42.040
suppose we have a monoclinic
crystal and we put a glide

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.040
plane in the base of the cell
which has tau in this

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.250
direction, the way you indicate
that is with a little

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.610
chevron off to the side.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:54.560
And if this is the direction of
tau, you put a little barb

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.830
on the chevron that indicates
the direction of tau.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:03.200
So the three possibilities for
a monoclinic crystal is that

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.020
how could be this way, in
which case you use a

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.610
chevron like this.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.660
Or how could be in
this direction.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.817
And then, you use a chevron
with a barb

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:15.660
attached like this.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:21.310
Or how could be a diagonal
glide, in which case the atoms

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.040
would be up and opposite
chirality and

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.010
down and back up again.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:33.000
In that case, you add a little
barb in between the two

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.550
directions to indicate
the direction of tau.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:44.280
We put some labels on this,
this a and this b.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.250
This situation would be a tau
that is equal to 1/2 of b.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:54.300
In this case, how would
be equal to 1/2 of a.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:00.580
In this case, how would be
equal to 1/2 of a plus b.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:10.140
This is designated
as a b glide.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:14.060
And rather than having the
symbol n appear in the symbol

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.800
for the space group,
a b would appear.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.260
This is an a glide.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.510
And the a would appear
in the symbol.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.695
And this is a diagonal glide.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.780
And that, for reasons that I
have never found anyone able

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.600
to explain to me, is
called an n glide.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.065
I know of no language in which
the word for diagonal

00:45:44.065 --> 00:45:45.315
begins with an n.

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.710
But that's what it's called.

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:54.120
Now, those same glides can be
viewed from directions that

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.110
are parallel to the plane
of the glide plane.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:01.020
Looking normal to tau is exactly
the same situation we

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.190
had in plane groups.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:05.710
So one uses the dash.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:08.620
If you're looking along the
glide plane end on but in the

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:13.140
direction of tau, you
use a dotted line.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.850
It's easy to keep straight
which is which.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:16.800
If there's a little arrow in
there and you look at it from

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.300
the side, you see
a line segment.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.780
If you look at it from the
end, you see a dot.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:24.340
So it's easy to remember
this convention.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.900
If you're neither perpendicular
to nor parallel

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.080
to the glide plane, you just
mix the two symbols.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.690
So you use a dashed dot line.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:39.830
So those are the symbols
for glide.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.460
Glide plane is something
like a piece of wood.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.240
It's got grain to it.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.950
The direction of the grain
is the direction of

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:48.200
tau, if you'd like.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:59.050
All right, in the hand out, I
give you some examples of the

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.620
way in which a pattern of
objects that has glide in it

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.780
would be interpreted in terms
of a geometric symbol.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:11.040
At the bottom right of the page,
the left hand diagram

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.550
has atoms related by a glide
plane in the base of the cell

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.920
where tau is running
left to right.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.800
And so you have a chevron
with an arrow on

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.400
the right hand branch.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.400
If you have atoms alternately
left handed, right handed at a

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.140
level and 1/2 plus that
elevation, then you're looking

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.840
at a glide plane edge on
and down along the

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.060
direction of tau.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:40.200
So you would indicate the locus
of that glide plane by a

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.500
series of dots.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.150
What other type of glide plane
is possible, not for

00:47:53.150 --> 00:48:08.330
monoclinic, but for lattices
that have a centered lattice

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:10.480
point in the middle
of the cell?

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:19.480
So this takes a special type
of Bravais lattice.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:29.900
And this would be a lattice, for
example, that had lattice

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:33.210
points at the corners of the
cell and another lattice point

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.080
in the middle of the cell.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.960
One face of the cell
is centered.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.860
Then, you have not only
translations a, b, and a plus

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:47.080
b, which can serve as directions
for glide.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.890
But you have another translation
that is not

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.540
present in the primitive
lattice.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:58.090
And this is 1/2 of
a plus 1/2 of b.

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:01.500
And if that's a translation, you
could have a glide plane

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:06.545
parallel to the base of the cell
and have tau equal to 1/2

00:49:06.545 --> 00:49:10.955
of 1/2 of a plus b, namely have
this little vector in

00:49:10.955 --> 00:49:13.830
here be tau.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:17.340
And the symbol for that
kind of glide is d.

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.270
And I do know what
that stands for.

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:24.160
That stands for a diamond glide
because diamond, one of

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.030
the very simple structures for
an element or any compound and

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:33.990
one of the early structures to
be determined experimentally,

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.110
does have a d glide in it.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.310
So the name of the compound,
diamond, gave its name to the

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.560
type of glide plane.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.770
OK, I've got still
10 more minutes.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.610
What I would like to do next
is to look at some of the

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:03.810
other monoclinic space groups
and also examine the way in

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.730
which this information is
presented for you in the

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.320
international tables.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:14.580
So I've got a big, fat pack of
material that shows you all of

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.210
the monoclinic space group,
that is the space groups

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:21.510
derived from point group two,
the space groups with point

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:24.970
group m, and the space groups
with point group 2/m.

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.620
And we've done a few of these.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:36.020
But what we haven't looked at
is the Shcoenflies notation

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:41.610
for the result or the way in
which this information is

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:45.005
presented in the international
tables.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:52.990
To introduce you to these
gradually, this is the

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:54.570
monoclinic space group--

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.940
these are the monoclinic space
groups as presented in the old

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:01.430
international tables for
x-ray crystallography.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:05.360
A little bit later, I will pass
out to you a few higher

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:11.690
symmetry space groups that are
represented in both the old

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:15.100
international tables and the
new international tables.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.780
And as I indicated somewhat
disparagingly earlier on,

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.920
there is so much information
in the new version that

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.860
they're very, very
hard to use.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:33.070
But OK, if you open the hand
out, you find space group P2.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:35.160
So that's a twofold
axis added to a

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.600
primitive monoclinic axis.

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:44.440
You see on the left hand page
this situation, this

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.790
ridiculous situation, that
exists only for monoclinic

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:53.920
crystals the first setting,
where the axes are a on the

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.020
left hand side running down, and
b on the top running from

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.970
left to right, and c coming
straight up out of the page.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:08.110
And the second setting, where
the unique axis is b, and that

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:12.880
means if you're going to draw
the space group with c coming

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.460
up, a down, and b to the right,
b now is the direction

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.450
of the twofold axis.

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:22.100
So the diagram looks completely
different.

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:27.770
But it's the same space group
except that the first setting

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:33.050
is tilted on its side so that
a comes down, b is from left

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:37.390
to right, and c, which is now
not a direction of the twofold

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.010
axis, comes out.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:44.060
So there's some jargon here,
that geometric jargon.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.300
The atoms occur at different
elevations.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:52.190
So in these two cases, the atoms
occur only at elevations

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:54.490
plus z or minus z.

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:57.970
And you see next to the little
circles that represent the

00:52:57.970 --> 00:52:59.880
symmetry equivalent
positions for the

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.980
general position a plus.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:05.360
And that means elevation
plus z.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.980
And for the first setting,
all the atoms occur at an

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:12.170
elevation plus z for the
general position.

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.880
For the second setting in the
right hand diagram, you're

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.090
looking at the twofold
axis from the side.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:20.470
And therefore, one atom
is at plus z.

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:22.940
The one that's related by
symmetry gets rotated

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.080
down to minus z.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.750
So you see a little plus next
to one atom, a little minus

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:31.550
next to the next to it.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:36.670
We need a symbol for a view
down along the locus of a

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:37.650
twofold axis.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.520
And that's the little pointed
oval that we became familiar

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.710
with with the plane groups.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:45.800
When you're looking at the
twofold axis from the side,

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.300
how are you going to
indicate that?

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:50.420
Well, the convention
is to use an arrow.

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.950
And that's what you see on the
right hand side for the second

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:55.910
setting of P2.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:59.990
If this were not a twofold axis
but a 2 sub 1 screw axis,

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.720
it would be a one-sided barb.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:09.090
So looking down at these two
axes with rotations of 180

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:13.020
degrees, this is the symbol for
two viewed from the side.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.030
And a one-sided barb would
be the symbol for a

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:19.030
2 sub 1 screw axis.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:23.510
Mercifully, these are the only
screw axes that need to be

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.810
depicted in a view
from the side.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:30.520
So there's no standard symbol
for a sixfold access or a

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.650
fourfold axis looked
at from the side.

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:40.240
In boldface, in the outer corner
of these pages, you see

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.590
the international symbol, which
is what we used for the

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:49.610
plane groups, the symbol for the
lattice type, primitive,

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:52.970
except now we use uppercase
symbols for the lattice type

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:56.890
to distinguish the space groups
from the plane groups.

00:54:56.890 --> 00:55:02.590
Underneath it, you see
a C2 superscript 1.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.560
This is the Schoenflies
symbol.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.700
You'll recognize C2 as the
Schoenflies symbol for a

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.470
twofold axis.

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:13.580
Schoenflies' symbol for the
space group was to add a

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:17.240
superscript, namely the first
one that old [? Artur ?]

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.740
got, the second one that
[? Artur ?] got from this

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.720
point group, the third one
he got from the point

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.880
group, and so on.

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.560
So it's pretty much an arbitrary
order, except he

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:32.140
starts with, as you'll see, a
twofold access, then replaces

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:36.130
the twofold axis with
a screw access.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:40.790
So if you turn to the next page,
you see symbols for not

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:44.810
twofold axes, but 2 sub
1 screw axes along the

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:47.040
edges of the cell.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:51.420
You see now a different sort of
symbol alongside the atoms.

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.720
There's one at plus z.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.200
That's the representative
one at x, y, z.

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.620
If you repeat it by a screw
rotation, you rotate it 180

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.030
degrees and slide it up
by 1/2 of [? c. ?]

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:05.320
So you see the symbol
1/2 plus.

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.770
So plus is plus z.

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:11.580
1/2 plus is 1/2 plus z.

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:16.630
Over to the second settings,
trying not to sneer too

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:20.910
vigorously, you'll see
pointed barbs.

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.740
That's the symbol for
a twofold axis

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.100
viewed from the side.

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.950
And then, one of them is plus.

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:30.990
The one that's a little long
parallel to the 2 sub 1 screw

00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:34.150
axis goes to the other side and
goes from plus z down to

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:35.400
the minus z.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:41.470
Let me ask you a question which
people usually don't

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.950
think about.

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:44.760
If you look at the first setting
and ask, what are the

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:48.020
lengths of the translations?

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:48.505
That's a.

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.100
And that's so many angstroms.

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:50.780
And that's b.

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:53.170
That's so many angstroms.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:57.180
If I ask you that for the second
setting, the answer is

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.720
a little trickier.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.170
What is the length of
this translation?

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.540
That's b.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.960
What is the length of
this translation?

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.120
I'm sorry, that's c.

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.430
And this translation
is a, right?

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:12.890
Wrong.

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:15.060
That is no longer a.

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:21.815
And the reason for that is that
when you have a cell with

00:57:21.815 --> 00:57:27.260
non-orthogonal angles in it, let
me indicate for the most

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:32.560
general case for a triclinic
crystal.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.310
So this is a.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:37.060
This is b.

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.915
And then the third translation
normal to that plane is c.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:51.610
And if we have a structure with
atoms in these locations

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:56.050
and we want to project the
structure along c, you do

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:57.340
exactly that.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:01.170
You don't plop the atoms down
onto the base of the cell when

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:07.820
you project it because if you
did so, the atom that is up in

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.470
the neighboring unit cell
would come down

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:12.980
to a different location.

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:16.750
And you would not have a pattern
that was periodic

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:18.640
based on a lattice.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:22.580
You get that only if, when
you're projecting in an

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:27.750
oblique lattice, you project
along the translation.

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:32.080
And then, and only then, can you
end up with a pattern that

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.320
looks like it has translational
periodicity and

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.640
really does.

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.190
So if a cell is oblique, you
do not project just by

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:42.680
plopping the atoms down on
the base of the cell.

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:46.450
You project them parallel to the
translation that extends

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:50.140
up above the direction onto
which you're projecting.

00:58:50.140 --> 00:59:01.730
So if our cell in the second
setting is monoclinic and this

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:09.000
is a and this b and c comes up,
if we look at that cell

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.960
from the side as is done in
the depiction on the right

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.590
hand, then we let this be
the direction of b.

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:20.080
So that is b.

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:29.980
But the thing that is at right
angles to b is going to be a

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:36.300
times the cosine of beta.

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.696
And it's not a itself.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.470
So this is a right angle.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:45.900
But this is not the lattice
translation.

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.510
It is the lattice translation
times a

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:51.570
trigonometric function.

00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:55.350
The triclinic case
is a hairy beast.

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:01.830
To calculate the length of these
axes and projection,

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:03.910
it's clear what they are.

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:07.210
But to get these values
involves alpha

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:09.040
and beta and gamma.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.950
And it's a very, very
complicated function.

01:00:14.842 --> 01:00:17.975
AUDIENCE: So the angle between
a and c in general is not 90

01:00:17.975 --> 01:00:19.670
degrees in monoclinics?

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.850
PROFESSOR: The angle between
depends on how

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:22.970
you label your axes.

01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:25.970
For monoclinic, if you do the
first setting, then by

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:30.620
definition this is a, and this
is b, and this is c.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.910
So these are always by
definition 90 degrees.

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:36.530
If you use the second setting,
then this is the

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.030
direction of b.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.220
And this is the direction
of a.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.940
And this is the direction
of c.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.800
That keeps the system
right handed.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.748
Then, this is a right angle and
this is a general angle.

01:00:50.556 --> 01:00:52.428
AUDIENCE: But all you're doing
is taking that top one and

01:00:52.428 --> 01:00:53.840
just [? tilting it over ?].

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.100
PROFESSOR: No, I'm doing more
than that because if there

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.330
were a twofold axis, that would
be the direction of the

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:01.490
twofold axis.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:03.610
Now, this is the direction
of the twofold axis.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:08.600
The other thing that happens
is the symbols

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.640
for the glides change.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.950
So if you look at space group
number seven, which is a case

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:20.830
where the mirror plane has been
replaced by a b glide in

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:23.760
the first setting, and that
means the glide is

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.650
perpendicular to the
twofold axis.

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:31.050
If the twofold axis is now the
direction of b, the glide

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:32.500
plane turns into a b glide.

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.820
But let's just thumb through
them quickly.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.780
And then, we're actually two
minutes past my promised

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.370
quitting hour.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.340
First one, P2.

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:51.485
Then, replace the twofold access
by a 2 sub 1 screw.

01:01:51.485 --> 01:01:57.190
So that's Schoenflies symbol
C2 superscript 2.

01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:00.275
Then, do this with centered
lattices.

01:02:00.275 --> 01:02:03.170
The international table
chooses to use a

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.900
side centered cell.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.230
So that's the third one you can
get from a twofold axis.

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:13.950
So Schoenflies calls it C
subscript 2 superscript 3.

01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:17.860
And if you add that to a side
centered lattice, you get

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:22.950
screw axes interleaved between
the twofold axes.

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:27.300
Put it on its side, it stays
C2 superscript 3 in the

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.630
Schoenflies notation.

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:36.720
But the side centered d become
side centered c because it's b

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.330
that comes out of
the oblique net.

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:42.470
So the international
symbol tells you

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:45.140
exactly what you have.

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:48.080
The Schoenflies symbol
is arbitrary.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.520
It tells you the point group and
it tells you the order in

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.170
which Schoenflies
derived them.

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:56.990
But that non-informative
nature to the

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:58.750
symbol has a blessing.

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:02.520
And that is it doesn't change
with different labellings of

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.170
a, b, and c.

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:09.075
It doesn't change with a being
shortest, b being shortest.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.580
It just sits there and its dumb,
uninformative fashion.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.770
And that is nice.

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:17.450
So both of them have survived.

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:21.910
OK, so could we get another
space group out of this by

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:24.540
replacing the twofold
axis by a 2 sub 1?

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:29.060
No, because we've already got
2 sub 1 screw axes in C2

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.420
superscript 3.

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:35.470
So then, Schoenflies moves on
and begins to work with

01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:36.700
symmetry planes.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.010
So number six puts a mirror
plane in the primitive

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:42.690
monoclinic lattice.

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:44.330
That becomes CS.

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:47.470
That's the Schoenflies symbol
for point group m.

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:49.790
And it's the first thing
you can get.

01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:53.820
Another piece of convention
for displaying the

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.650
representative pattern of atoms,
in the first setting,

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:01.070
the two atoms sit directly
above one another.

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:02.960
So there are two new
things here.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.210
A vertical line through the atom
indicates that there are

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:10.350
two of them that are
superimposed in projection.

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:14.640
And moreover, the little tadpole
has appeared inside

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.230
the frog eggs in the
left hand part.

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:20.740
So this says on the right hand
side of that split circle, the

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.900
atom is at plus z.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.490
On the left hand side with the
comment to indicate an

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:29.810
enantiomorph is 1 at minus
z that sits directly

01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:31.360
below the first one.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.210
And you'll notice in the
diagram of the symmetry

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:36.230
elements is a chevron working
off the lower right hand

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:37.150
corner of the cell.

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:39.330
And that's the symbol for a
mirror plane that's being

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:42.110
viewed directly from above.

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:43.880
And then I'll just
go a couple more.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.400
You could replace the mirror
plane with a glide plane.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.810
And that's a b glide.

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:54.340
Now, you can see the atoms
going up at plus z, slide

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:58.550
along by 1/2 z, and popped down
to minus z, going down to

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:02.630
an enantiomorph, so there's
a comma inside the circle.

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:06.890
The chevron in the lower right
hand corner of the diagram of

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:09.990
symmetry elements now has
acquired an arrow, a barb,

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:14.060
that indicates the
direction of tau.

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:19.430
The second setting, again, flops
the thing on its side so

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:23.660
that you're looking now down
along the b glide.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:27.240
And so you see a dotted line
that indicates a glide plane

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.070
viewed edge on in the
direction of tau.

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:34.230
Then, you can put a mirror plane
for number eight into a

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.960
side centered b lattice.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.870
And that gives you another
space group.

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:46.520
And then, you can put a glide
plane into the b lattice.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.180
And that, interestingly, gives
you a different space group.

01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:57.650
Number eight has an alternating
mirror plane with

01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:00.120
an axial glide.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.680
Number nine has an alternating
axial glide alternating with a

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.690
diagonal glide-- two
glide planes.

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:09.820
Not a mirror plane and a glide,
but two different kinds

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.180
of glide planes.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:14.200
And then, you've used up all the
tricks you can pull there.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.260
So now, we take the last
monoclinic point group, 2/m,

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.430
drop it into a primitive
lattice.

01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:25.260
Replace the twofold axis with
a 2 sub 1 screw axis.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.650
That gives you P2
sub 1 over m.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:31.450
Then, leave the twofold axis
alone and leave the plane

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:34.830
alone and put 2/m in a
side centered cell.

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:39.290
And then, replace the mirror
plane by a glide.

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:41.610
That's number 13.

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:48.930
And then finally, the summa cum
ultra, replace the twofold

01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:52.576
axis y a 2 sub 1 screw and
replace the mirror plane with

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:55.280
a glide, number 14.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.410
And then, do the same thing
in a centered lattice.

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:04.600
So we get a total of 13
different space groups from

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.890
two lousy kinds of lattices
and three

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:09.310
possible point groups.

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:14.940
You get 13 different distinct
space groups.

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.275
OK, that's a quick overview.

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:23.140
Notice that just as was the case
for the plane groups, the

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:28.880
tables go on to list the way in
which atoms are related by

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.370
symmetry and the number per
cell and the site symmetry

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:36.100
just as in the plane groups.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.140
And the way a three dimensional
structure is going

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.450
to be described to you is
exactly analogous to what we

01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:43.370
did with two dimensions.

01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:53.930
Magnesium in position 3b,
symmetry 6/m, oxygen in

01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:58.710
position 12d, symmetry 1.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:01.730
And then, the tables give you
the coordinates of all the

01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:03.540
symmetry S atoms.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.550
OK, thank you for
your patience.

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:10.010
That was a long stretch
in one shot.

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:15.990
I'll say a little bit, very
little, next Tuesday about the

01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:22.029
convention for orthorhombic
space groups because there, no

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:25.080
one direction is any more or
less special than any other.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.290
So the symbol for the space
group changes all over the

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:31.130
place when the axes
take on different

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:32.660
lengths, relative lengths.

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.200
But the symmetry is
exactly the same.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.450
So we'll see you--

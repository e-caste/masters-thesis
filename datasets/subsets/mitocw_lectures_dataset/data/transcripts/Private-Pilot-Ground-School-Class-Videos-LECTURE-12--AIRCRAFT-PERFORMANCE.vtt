WEBVTT

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.100
PHILLIP GREENSPUN:
All right, we're

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.370
going to talk about
aircraft performance, which

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.660
is figuring out
all of this stuff

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.240
if you're an
airplane, basically,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.634
how much runway you're
going to use on both ends,

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.509
how long it's going to
take you to get there,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.634
which is another way of
saying how much fuel you're

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.040
going to use.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.770
If it's a helicopter, it's
a little bit different.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.170
Mostly, you're worried
about hover performance.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.282
So if you're going
to a friend's house,

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:47.740
are you going to be able to
park the helicopter in midair--

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.870
that's called an out of
ground effect hover--

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.660
and very slowly descend into
the backyard, dodging the trees

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.920
and power lines
and anything else?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.740
So these are all
things that can be

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.040
found in the aircraft manuals.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.940
And the FAA will test
you on them a little bit.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.060
This is important
partly because you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.590
want to be able to complete your
flight safely, and also because

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.030
of FAR 91.103, which is
that, before you do a flight,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.640
you've got to become a--

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.600
it's pretty all-embracing,
all-available information

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.470
concerning weather, and aircraft
performance, how the aircraft's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
going to perform given the
altitude of where you're going,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.040
and the temperature that's
prevailing there at the time.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.480
Wind also, you know?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.440
If you find out that there's
a 40 knot wind scheduled

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.680
for where you're going and
it's a direct crosswind

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.940
to the only runway,
then that might

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.940
to cause you to choose
a different airport.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.370
OK, here's a reminder
of the thrust and drag.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.530
Whenever you're
generating lift, you're

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.300
also generating some drag.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.400
And that's lifting the unwanted
direction of backwards,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.900
usually.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.210
So the aircraft is also
producing a parasitic drag

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.570
by trying to punch its way
through this vicious fluid

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.540
of air.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.400
Where these summed
up drag curves

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.750
intersect is pretty
much the bottom

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.635
of the total drag curve, the
minimum drag, or L over D max.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.030
The climb performance,
the best speeds to go

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.790
are all kind of tied
into this drag curve.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.850
And the best angle of
climb is what you use.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.880
That's a slower airspeed
and the best rate of climb.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.380
If you're in a small
airport, trying

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.420
to clear the trees at
the end of the runway,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.750
you're going to fly Vx,
the best angle of climb.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.310
This is one of
those few V speeds

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.700
that you're actually expected
to know the abbreviation for.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.780
And if you're going to just
take off out of a big airport,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.730
like Hanscom Field,
and just want

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.520
to get up to your cruising
altitude reasonably quickly,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.060
then you--

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.560
hey.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.150
Thanks, Richard.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.090
Richard's a Mooney pilot.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.656
Made it to California
many times.

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:34.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.430
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: So if
you actually look at the Vx,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.130
one thing to notice is that it
all depends a bit on the wind.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.643
Let's say there's 100 knot
wind blowing down the runway.

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:52.310
You don't need to fly
very fast in order

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.102
to clear the trees at
the end of the runway

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:56.010
because you're basically
already flying.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.680
And you can go straight up
like a helicopter in terms

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.100
of your path over the
ground, whereas Vy,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.290
just to gain altitude,
that doesn't depend

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.732
at all on the prevailing wind.

00:04:05.732 --> 00:04:07.940
So if you're trying to clear
something on the ground,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.648
the wind matters.

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:10.540
A tail tailwind would
be very destructive.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.950
It'll be pushing you
towards the obstacle.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.200
And a headwind will
be very helpful.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.880
Cruise climb, most
of the time you

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.880
don't actually push the
airplane to these speeds.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.829
They're pretty
far nose up, which

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.830
is a little bit
alarming to passengers.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.885
And it's harder to
see over the nose,

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:29.510
and the engine isn't getting as
much cooling air at these lower

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.600
speeds.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.660
So typically we'll fly about 10
knots faster in a GA airplane.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.300
So for the Cirrus, for example,
96 is the book Vy at sea level,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.120
and flying something like 105
knots is more conventional.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.980
The PC-12 climbs--
you know, it might

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.167
be able to do 3,000 feet
a minute at 120 knots.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.750
But if you're not
in a desperate hurry

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.410
to get up above the bumpy
clouds or something,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.770
then 150 knots is
more conventional.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:08.810
OK, so let's remember that
you've got thrust and power.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.120
So the thrust is
a force that lets

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.880
you climb up over the trees.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.200
The power is thrust
times the speed.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.120
And it's thrust operating
over a period of time.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.810
So the more excess power you
have, the higher the rate

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.670
at which you can climb.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.000
Anyway, we'll see some
more of that here.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.600
You've got a best glide ratio.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.350
If you want to get to
the decent place to land

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.230
and you've lost your engine,
what's a good speed to fly?

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.280
Well, L over D max is an
excellent speed to fly,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:06:00.540
because that's where
the lift over drag

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.132
is at its highest
point and you'll

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:03.590
make the best time
over the ground.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.600
Again, that has to be adjusted
a little bit for wind.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.710
If you're going into 100
knot wind and the Cirrus best

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.423
glide speed is 96
knots, that's not

00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:14.590
going to work out very well.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.590
You're not going to go
anywhere over the ground.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.193
That's a photo that I took
at the Newport Jazz Festival.

00:06:26.193 --> 00:06:27.610
I don't want to
say self portrait.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.030
Anyway, weight has a huge
factor on all these speeds,

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.530
because actually a lot of them
are related to angle of attack.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.870
And it certainly affects
your performance.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.290
So everything about higher
weight is pretty bad.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:54.880
Wind, you might think that
a tailwind is always good.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.690
But really, the tailwind is only
good for extending your cruise

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.560
range.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.000
Everything else, pretty much,
the headwind is better for.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.250
So think about the headwind.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.680
Again, think of
these extreme cases.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.160
If you've got 100 knot
wind right in your face,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.380
then you can fly without moving.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.830
That's basically a wind tunnel.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.110
OK, center of gravity.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.670
This is also a little
bit counterintuitive.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.170
If you load the airplane up so
that all the way to the back,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.930
and it's super
nose up, and you're

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.220
having to push the stick
forward to keep the plane level,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.010
that actually is where you
get your maximum performance.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.740
Everything is better about
having an aft center of gravity

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.850
with one exception, which is
the stability of the handling

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.320
of the aircraft.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.900
And obviously, if you load
it up so much in the back

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.800
that you can't
push the nose over,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.400
that would be outside of the
CG range, or well outside

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.930
of this range, let's hope.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.710
Then you wouldn't even
be able to control

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.950
the aircraft because you can't
get the nose down enough.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.640
So having that forward CG
gives you more stability.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.425
That's where you're going to
be when you're a student pilot.

00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:11.550
If you're in a four-seat
aircraft and it's just you

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.790
and the instructor in front
and the back seats are empty,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.950
then it's pretty
obvious that it's

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.510
going to be a somewhat forward
CG, because the aircraft is

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:26.730
designed to hold at least
some weight in the back seats.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.790
One thing you can do is sort of,
just as a first approximation,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.260
you know, pay attention--

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.480
we're going to have a
talk on weight and balance

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.289
later from Tina.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.070
But just keep in mind that the
aircraft is kind of designed

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.440
for, you know, two
adults in the front

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.330
and maybe one adult in the
back, or two kids in the back.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
So if you load it
up that way, it's

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.100
almost always going to work.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.020
If, on the other hand, you
have a big, heavy friend

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.970
and, you know, his other
big heavy friend or his box

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.805
of anvils, and the
guy says, well, look,

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.180
I just want to
sleep in the back,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.630
I don't want to be up
front and get distracted,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.110
and you're a lightweight
person all by yourself

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.330
from the front, you know,
that's the situation where it's

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.980
important to really
do the calculations

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.480
and think carefully about it.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.910
Because that wasn't something
that Cessna and Piper

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.590
were thinking about when
they designed the aircraft.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.625
OK, atmospheric pressure.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.180
Remember we talked
about how the atmosphere

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.920
is going to be
expanded when it's hot

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.840
and contracted when it's cold?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.000
And the altimeter is
really telling you

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.560
how much of the atmosphere
you've climbed up through.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:47.910
So you can see here on the
right, if you look over here,

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.860
and you're measuring
your altitude,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.620
you're basically getting
this whole stack of molecules

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.170
contributing to the
pressure, whereas if you're

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.660
up high in the
stratosphere or something,

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.050
only a handful of molecules are
on top of you putting pressure

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.417
into your altimeter.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.820
OK, here's that standard
atmosphere again.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.880
So you can see it's two
niner niner two and 15

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.410
degrees at sea level.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.240
So the aircraft performance
is hugely affected by changes

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.850
in air density, which themselves
are affected by the prevailing

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.480
pressure, which is mostly
a function of altitude,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.630
the temperature,
and the humidity.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.830
Usually, the conditions
are referenced to the ISA,

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.762
the standard atmosphere.

00:10:38.762 --> 00:10:40.220
The summertime,
it'll be, you know,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.340
ISA plus 15 or ISA plus 20.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:49.230
And if it's the wintertime, it
might be ISA or ISA minus 20.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.460
When the air density is reduced
and there are fewer molecules

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.360
around, the engine is not taking
in as much air for combustion.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.630
Remember that the jet engines
are normally aspirated.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.170
And the piston engines also
that are without a turbocharger,

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.703
they're just trying to burn
up a fixed volume of air.

00:11:06.703 --> 00:11:08.870
And that's going to correspond
to a different number

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:14.990
of molecules of air and fuel
depending on the altitude.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.490
The only good thing
about going up high--

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.890
the propeller's
also not grabbing

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.795
as much air for thrust.

00:11:21.795 --> 00:11:23.420
The only thing good
about going up high

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.460
is that drag is
reduced, and that's

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.250
why you see the
airliners up high.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.460
They go faster and they
save a lot of fuel.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.050
OK, some definitions.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:39.370
The pressure altitude
is just the--

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.430
it's going to be your
height above sea level

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.240
with the altimeter set
to two niner niner two.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.680
You just have to take
the two niner niner

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.950
two minus the actual altimeter
setting that's being published,

00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:00.480
multiply that by 1,000, so
a full inch of altimeter

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.555
adjustment, from two niner
niner two to three zero

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:06.690
niner two would correspond
to 1,000 foot difference

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.800
in pressure altitude.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.265
And you can calculate
that by a chart.

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:14.640
Here's a chart
that they give you

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.890
if you don't like the formula.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.860
So this is something, again,
you might have to do on a test.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.960
I'll say, OK, at two nine
niner two, the correction is 0.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.800
At 30.0, the
correction is minus 73.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.340
So up here you can see
we've got this formula where

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.610
we interpolated between the
two to try to figure out,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.010
what would the
pressure altitude be

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.077
if we start with a
field elevation of 3,563

00:12:42.077 --> 00:12:44.160
and the altimeter is two
niner niner six, which is

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.080
just a little bit non-standard?

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.310
We would expect a
40 foot difference.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.000
If we look at the table
and we interpolate,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
we come up with a
36.5 foot difference.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.100
And we find out
that the airplane

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.450
feels as though it's only at
3,526 feet above sea level,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:05.900
assuming the temperature
matches that ISA standard.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.530
All right, so density altitude
is a lot more important.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:13.260
And oftentimes it will be
reported on the ASOS or ATIS.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.780
So the airport will
actually tell you

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.560
density altitude is
3,000 feet or 2,000 feet

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.990
or whatever it is.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.860
That you get from
correcting what's usually

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.550
a relatively small correction
for pressure altitude compared

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.430
to the actual altitude,
but correcting it

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.680
for the non-standard
temperature.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.908
I think, as I said
earlier, you know,

00:13:36.908 --> 00:13:39.450
flying is a lot more popular in
New England in the summertime

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.110
than in the wintertime, so it's
usually warmer than standard.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.670
Density altitude has a
huge effect on performance.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.130
And it's a non-linear
relationship,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.110
so you have to look
it up in a table

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.490
or calculate it with the E6B.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:54.990
We'll see.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.980
Maybe I'll play
around with the E6B

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.105
so people can look
at it during breaks.

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:05.508
I have the slide rule and
the manual right here.

00:14:05.508 --> 00:14:07.800
And I think we'll try to get
the document camera going,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.380
so maybe I can show you
guys some exciting slide

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.150
rule activities.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.590
OK, so you can calculate
it, though, using the E6B,

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.930
like I said, using charts.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.540
And there's various web
and app way of doing it.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.390
So the density altitude,
here's a chart.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.085
So again, this is
the kind of stuff

00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:27.210
that's on the written exam.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.580
You guys are all pretty good at
working with charts and tables,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.230
so I'm sure you won't
have any trouble.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.360
They're giving you these
initial conditions up here

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.930
on your left.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.750
So you look to find
where the pressure

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.610
altitude is on the chart.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.200
And it says to, you
know, add 626 feet, which

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.990
is interpolating
between those two.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.360
Then you've got this
pressure altitude

00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:03.250
line of going from here
down to here at 5,856.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.240
And now we've got to correct
that for temperature.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:12.760
So here's our temperature of
about 80 degrees, 81 degrees.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.670
And then we go over to the
left, and we can read that--

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.710
I think I told you guys
that, in the summertime,

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.270
usually the density altitude
is about 2,000 feet higher

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.500
than the pressure altitude.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.900
And sure enough,
here it's 8,250,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:35.080
which is about 2,400 feet higher
than the pressure altitude.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.790
So the density altitude gave us
a little more than a 2,000 foot

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.100
boost for that
non-standard temperature.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.570
The reason it's so much,
I guess, is it's not--

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.980
80 degrees at sea
level wouldn't be

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.560
that high above the
standard temperature.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.830
But 81 degrees Fahrenheit
at a mile above sea level

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.975
is quite a spectacular
temperature compared

00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:01.100
to the standard atmosphere.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.285
Let's go back to the
standard atmosphere.

00:16:06.285 --> 00:16:09.800
Yeah, so at 5,000
feet, it's only

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.125
supposed to be seven
degrees Celsius.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.520
And here we said it was
about 27 degrees Celsius.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.100
So that's ISA plus 20.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.680
Just like I said, if you look
at a lot of jet performance

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.980
charts, you have ISA minus
20 ISA and ISA plus 20.

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:34.770
Oh, flight computer
demo if there's time.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.100
Let me just futz with that
at the end of all this.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.102
I'll give you an E6B intro.

00:16:41.102 --> 00:16:42.060
When are they the same?

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.640
I think this is an FAA test
question, when the temperature

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:54.490
distribution is the same as
that of the standard atmosphere.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.370
OK, humidity is also another
enemy, a little bit more

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.350
surprisingly.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.560
The water vapor molecules,
actually, in the air

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.260
actually reduce the
density of the air.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.628
You might think that
they would increase it.

00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:09.170
I don't know.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.290
Maybe there's a chemist or a
physicist in this crowd who

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.190
can explain why.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.170
I'm not exactly sure myself.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.839
But it's just something to
remember, that contrary--

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.690
if the air feels
heavy to you, it

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.440
feels light to your aircraft
engine and to your wings.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.990
It's a smaller effect
than temperature,

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.730
but the engine
performance supposedly

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.210
can be reduced by about 7%.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.210
This is not something that
we normally correct for.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.210
However, there is this
nice web calculator

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.294
that I found for free
on pilotfriend.com.

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:47.510
And you get to enter the
relative humidity of the air.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.230
So where is that?

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.270
We have the air temperature.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.920
Oh, we have the
dew point, right?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.520
So we said it was a 30 degree
temperature and a 28 degree dew

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.520
point.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.050
So that's a pretty
narrow spread.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.200
And therefore, it's a
pretty high humidity day.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.980
So they say, well,
it's 78% humidity,

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.290
and we're correcting
that up to 8,107.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.040
You can play around
with this on your own.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.662
If you reduce the dew point
to 10 degrees Celsius,

00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:20.120
which is going to
be a really dry--

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.290
you know, 30 to 10 split
is a nice, dry day out west

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.760
or, you know, here
occasionally a crisp day--

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.650
then it's only 7,735.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:37.130
So the change in humidity
had about a 300-foot effect

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.570
on the altitude.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:48.160
But the change in temperature
was nearly 3,000 feet.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.660
OK, the maximum convenience
way to do this is with apps.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.560
So ForeFlight, for example,
will just tell you.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.260
The density altitude--
this was, I think,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.910
Sunday night at Bedford.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.200
Let's look at this beautiful--

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.617
I don't know how many people
will come to [INAUDIBLE] now.

00:19:05.617 --> 00:19:09.440
So Bedford's approximately
at sea level, about 130 feet

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.520
above sea level.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.790
It was minus 4 degrees,
and the density altitude

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.640
was minus 1,400.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.833
So we were flying,
you know, skimming

00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:21.500
the surface of the
Dead Sea or something

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.730
in terms of performance.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.420
So the airplane will be
really happy about flying

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.790
all wintertime, and
it'll climb better

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.450
than the book, most of
the numbers in the book.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.900
OK, the density
altitude is often

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.195
just kind of baked into
the performance chart.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.070
Pipers normally take
off with no flaps.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.320
But if you want to get off
the ground really quickly,

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.110
like taking off over
grass or mud or something,

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.720
you can put down
the flaps and try

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.060
to have less time on
the ground and not be

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.920
going so fast over the ground.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.650
Your ground rill
will be shortened.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.760
Anyway, so here,
they don't actually

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.730
ask you to ever calculate
the density altitude.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.500
They just say, OK, it's
almost 30 degrees outside.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.650
And it looks like we're up
here at about 1,500 feet.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.050
So we'll start here on
the performance chart.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.200
These people are virtuous.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.900
The only weigh 2,175 total,
so we come down a little bit.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.940
And we can come
over here, and we

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.540
find that it's going to take--

00:20:28.725 --> 00:20:30.320
is there a wind here--

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.040
15 knots of headwind.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.180
So we come down
this graph and we

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.650
find that it will
take us 1,500 feet

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:44.450
to take off over a
50 foot obstacle.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.220
Fair enough?

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.580
So anyway, we never figured out
what the density altitude was.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:21:01.110
It was just something
that affected

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.360
where we started on the chart.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.920
I guess, maybe it's
implicit in here.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.820
I think it is implicit, right?

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.130
Because we're starting up high.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.350
Maybe somebody who is
smarter can figure this out.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.835
Yeah, so sea level at 0--

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.673
Yeah, I think we can pull
it out of those graphs.

00:21:21.673 --> 00:21:24.090
But nobody would, because what
you're really interested in

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.940
is the number of how long you're
going to be on the runway.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.660
All right, you'll have to slow
down if you're in turbulence.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.570
So if you plan for some kind of
flight a certain amount of time

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.220
and it's going to
be very bumpy--

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.440
I remember we talked
about maneuvering speed.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.100
Depending on your weight,
you'll have to slow down

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.140
to avoid bending the aircraft.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.140
Or, you know, turbulence
that's severe enough

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.600
to bend the aircraft
is extremely rare.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.530
But turbulence that's sufficient
to make you and your passengers

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.810
unhappy is a lot more common.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.260
And in both cases, you know,
you pull away back on the speed.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.510
So in the Pilatus,
for example, you'll

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.580
pull back to 150
knots from 200 knots.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.080
In the Cirrus, you know, you
might pull back from 130 down

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.715
to 100.

00:22:09.715 --> 00:22:11.890
And in a helicopter,
you know, you'll

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:16.500
pull back from 110
knots to maybe 70.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.190
OK, pilot technique.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:23.260
So all the book numbers
depend on the pilot

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.180
doing what the book says.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.060
So think about
clearing an obstacle

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.440
at the end of the runway.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.280
That's dependent on the pilot
rotating within a couple

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.910
knots of the specified rotation
speed, getting the gear

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:41.110
and the flaps retracted
if they've been deployed,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:46.150
or if the gear are retractable
at the recommended airspeed,

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:50.100
and just generally having the
pitch attitude and the air

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.690
speeds where the manufacturer
tested the aircraft.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.605
And think about it.

00:22:55.605 --> 00:22:57.730
You might say, well, you
know, anybody can do that.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.420
You're rolling down the
runway at Hanscom Field.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.900
It's a mile and a half long.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.472
You know, you're fresh,
so that performance

00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:07.930
is-- you're probably going to
come pretty close to the book

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.730
performance.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.260
But think about
doing a go-around.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.210
You've just done
a two hour flight.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.960
You were trying to
land at the airport.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.910
You know, somehow, either there
was somebody else on the runway

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.160
or, you know, you didn't
get the approach just right,

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.530
so you decided you're going
to go around and try again.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.988
At that point, you
know, you've got

00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:27.640
to reconfigure the airplane,
change the flap configuration,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.140
change the gear configuration.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:38.248
There's a couple interesting
incidents that have happened.

00:23:38.248 --> 00:23:40.290
Well, it was, unfortunately,
not very interesting

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:41.140
for the people involved.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.960
But there was an
American Airlines flight

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.590
that got disoriented in
Colombia in the clouds.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.690
And the terrain warning
system said, you know,

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.850
terrain, terrain,
pull up, pull up.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:54.840
And so they advanced
the thrust levers.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.000
You can follow that
link and read about it.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.150
They advanced the thrust
levers and had maximum power,

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.330
but they neglected to-- they
had the spoilers deployed

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.590
for a descent.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.170
They didn't retract
the spoilers,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.720
so the airplane was
climbing but not nearly as

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.080
well as it would have without
the spoilers retracted.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.000
So that's an example
where, you know,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.470
in a critical situation
or a fatigue situation,

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:20.130
you may not--

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.540
I wish I could get this--

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.540
I don't know if I can
move this onto the screen.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.040
I want to show a picture of
this crazy airplane that I flew.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.660
Tada!

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.450
Look at that Russian seaplane.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.370
It's got two Cirrus
engines in there.

00:24:45.932 --> 00:24:47.390
I don't even see
the second engine.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.020
Well, there it is.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.603
You can see that
propeller over there.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.320
So sorry.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.000
There's one propeller
sticking up.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.020
There is the other one.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.920
So it's got two Cirrus engines,
200 horsepower each mounted

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.150
on pods.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.090
And if you say, how
can that airplane climb

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:07.250
after an engine failure on
one little Cirrus engine

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.048
when it has--

00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:08.590
I don't know.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.310
I think it could
seat seven people.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.780
The answer is it really can't.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.360
So I tested that airplane out
because I thought it was cool.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.790
And I went flying with
an airline captain.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.520
And piston twins
aren't really required

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.160
to demonstrate any kind
of climb performance.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.170
For jets, there are
certain minimums.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.560
On one engine, it has to
be able to still climb 750

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.970
feet per minute or something.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.570
But for these piston twins,
the FAA says, you know,

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.570
you should know that
you're buying a pig anyway.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.420
And if you care, go and
get yourself a turbine,

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.230
or don't load
everybody in there.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.020
But anyway, this
[INAUDIBLE] thing, it

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.750
could not climb on one engine.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.388
We couldn't even maintain
altitude on one engine.

00:25:49.388 --> 00:25:50.930
And it turned out
that we'd forgotten

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.270
to close the cowl flaps.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.210
It had these extra
openings for cooling

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.370
to provide extra cooling
at high power settings.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.370
And if you don't close
them, there's extra drag.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.912
And that extra drag was enough
to turn what should have been,

00:26:03.912 --> 00:26:10.460
you know, 150 foot climb rate
or something into 150 foot sink

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.870
rate or something.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.730
So that's another thing
that can affect performance.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.520
OK, runway condition.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.792
This really affects
your planning,

00:26:18.792 --> 00:26:20.750
whether you can take off,
whether you can land,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.040
how much weight you
can put in there.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.320
So for example,
if it's dry grass,

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.560
you need a longer runway
than if it's paved.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:35.390
Alternatively, you can
take off at a lower weight.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:39.300
If it's wet grass, you need
a lot more room to land

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.610
and, you know, yet
more room to take off.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.310
At the airline,
if the runway was

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.460
grooved, which almost all
bigger US airports have

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.300
these grooved runways, we
didn't make any adjustments.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.043
Didn't matter how
heavy the rain was.

00:26:55.043 --> 00:26:56.960
It didn't matter how
long it had been raining.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.110
We just assumed it was going
to perform exactly the same as

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.590
if it were dry.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.320
If it's not a grooved
runway, though,

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.020
and water can sit
on the runway, it

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.830
can have a big effect
on performance.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.650
So here are some
numbers that I pulled.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.960
I'm type rated in the
Cessna Mustang, which

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.880
is an interesting
little business jet.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.820
It lands at about the same
speed as the Beechcraft Baron,

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.040
so it's a great beginner jet.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.180
Anyway, so in conditions where
you need 3,000 feet of runway,

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.240
that's up at pretty
high altitude,

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.730
you're going to need 4,240,
Cessna says, if it's wet.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.480
If water is actually standing on
it, I think 0.1 inches of water

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.810
was even more, you'll
need yet more runway.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.360
If it's snow, a little bit more.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.270
Wet ice, it was
just off the chart.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.390
But if you started at
2,200 feet of dry runway,

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.360
you would need 16,600 feet.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.830
So actually, oftentimes, when
the surface is contaminated,

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.080
that's one reason why
even fairly small business

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.600
jets may need a long
runway, like at Logan

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.100
or at Hanscom Field.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.340
Even an airport like
Nashua, which has 6,000 feet

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.160
may not be enough if they're
reporting that there's

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.260
snow on the runway.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.550
OK, what about slope?

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:14.910
So going downhill is obviously
a lot easier than going uphill.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.740
And you can see here-- and
also stopping going uphill

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.750
is a lot easier.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.170
So here are some numbers
from the Cirrus book

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:26.550
that every one degree of slope
increases your takeoff run

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:30.750
by 22% at sea
level, for example.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:39.200
And you also get a 9% reduction
in the landing distance.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.700
OK, ceiling.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.290
The service ceiling
of the aircraft

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.050
is a little bit below
the absolute ceiling.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.760
That's where the FAA
says the plane will

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.010
climb 100 feet per minute.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.970
The manufacturer has
demonstrated to the FAA

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.260
that the airplane could, at
least when it was brand new,

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.540
make 100 feet per
minute in climb rate.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:02.820
So that's 13,500 feet
for a 172 Cessna.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.340
And I think that's pretty
typical for these normally

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.870
aspirated four-seaters.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.920
Somewhere around there is
where it'll stop climbing.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.480
The Cirrus, there's
a limitation in there

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.620
that says maximum operating
altitude is 17,500 feet.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.570
I think that's more
regulatory, because you

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.490
can't take the Cirrus up
into the flight levels.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:25.740
They need extra equipment to
go up above 18,000 feet, maybe.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.140
I don't think it's really
practical to get up

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.800
to 17,500 feet at
maximum gross weight

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.270
in the standard atmosphere.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.110
I've gotten into about 13,000
feet out west in the summer,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.320
so that is more like
being at 15,000 feet.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.730
But it was barely climbing.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.320
OK, range versus endurance.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.850
So we're going to get back into
the power and drag curves here.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.400
The max range airspeed is
going to depend on the wind,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.720
like I said earlier.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.990
If you have 100 knot
headwind, then you

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:03.320
have to go faster than 100
knots in order to go anywhere.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.860
If you want to loiter for some
reason-- this year at Oshkosh

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.470
was a nightmare for
people who didn't go IFR.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.390
They had a lot of
marginal VFR weather.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:15.970
So for the first couple of
days, when people were arriving,

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.640
there were these short
windows, just an hour or two,

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.980
when people could
really get in legally,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.000
the VFR homebuilder types.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.970
So they were just holding.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.460
People were literally
holding for three hours

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.190
and then finally had to give
up and go and refuel somewhere.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.690
But if you're in
that situation, you

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.260
want to set your speed to
whatever the minimum fuel

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.280
consumption speed is.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.330
And it can be quite different.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.190
The Robinson R44 manual talks
about 100 knots for max range.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.820
I believe that's assuming a 10
knot headwind, since usually

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.320
we're suffering
with a headwind more

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.150
often than with a tailwind.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.080
And you might say,
how is that possible?

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.870
How is it possible
to have a headwind--

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.740
unless God hates you, how
is it possible to have

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.240
a headwind more
than half the time?

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.000
If you think about it--

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.320
Richard, you know the answer?

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:02.903
RICHARD: I do.

00:31:02.903 --> 00:31:04.153
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: What is it?

00:31:04.153 --> 00:31:05.508
RICHARD: Here's the question.

00:31:05.508 --> 00:31:08.540
You're flying 100
miles to an airport.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.300
In zero wind, how
long does it take

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.920
to fly-- you're on an airplane
that flies 100 miles an hour.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.620
How long does it take
to fly round trip?

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.037
PHILLIP GREENSPUN:
Trick question.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.910
RICHARD: 100 miles apart,
100 miles an hour airplane,

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.950
no wind.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.808
How long is a round
trip going to take?

00:31:26.808 --> 00:31:27.764
AUDIENCE: 2 hours?

00:31:27.764 --> 00:31:28.720
RICHARD: Yeah.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.772
Let's say you have
a 50 knot headwind.

00:31:31.772 --> 00:31:33.340
It's exactly on your nose.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.920
You can get 50 knots
headwind on the way out

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.223
and 50 knot tailwind
on the way back.

00:31:38.223 --> 00:31:39.140
How long does it take?

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.440
AUDIENCE: 2 hours.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.560
RICHARD: Wrong.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.788
Work it out.

00:31:43.788 --> 00:31:45.580
PHILLIP GREENSPUN:
Well, that's one aspect.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.510
You're going to spend more of
your time, as Richard's saying.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.990
It's going to take you two hours
to get there in one direction,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.630
and then it won't take
you zero time to get back,

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.050
so you're spending more of
your time in the headwind

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.225
than in the tailwind.

00:32:00.225 --> 00:32:01.600
But there's
something even worse.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.225
I saw this the other
day in the Cirrus.

00:32:03.225 --> 00:32:07.833
There was about a 70 knot
wind that was actually

00:32:07.833 --> 00:32:09.250
a little bit-- it
should have been

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.570
a little bit of a tailwind.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:14.770
It was more than 90 degrees
off my desired track.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.930
But if you think about
it, the airplane's

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.500
constantly having to fight
its way back into that wind,

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.910
so it's effectively taking
a longer flight path.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:28.300
So even the wind is directly
a beam wind 90 degrees off,

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.910
there's actually-- the
majority of the circle,

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.350
the 360 degrees circle
of wind directions,

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.110
the majority of
that is subtracting

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:44.000
from your performance and has at
least some headwind component.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.590
Sound crazy?

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:46.640
Think about it, yeah.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.780
So if you're going 100 miles and
there's also this 100 knot side

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.480
wind, you're having
to spend quite

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:59.930
a bit of your energy continuing
to steer into that side wind.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:07.010
OK, here is a power and
drag curve for an RV-6A.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.700
The experimental guys
are, in this case,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.880
more aggressive about
producing charts.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.480
So if you actually care
about where you're going,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.160
you want to be a little bit
up the power required curve.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.040
You want to find out where it's
tangent to one of these lines

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.360
going back to zero.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.037
And if all you care about
is maximum endurance,

00:33:29.037 --> 00:33:30.620
you just want to be
at the point where

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.720
the curve is at
its bare minimum,

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.300
because then you're consuming
the least power and, in theory,

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.600
burning the least
amount of fuel.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.660
Does that make sense?

00:33:43.962 --> 00:33:46.490
All right, The terms.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:51.860
Ground roll, these
performance charts

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.140
in the book that you
get with the airplane,

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.890
they will assume a static start.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.770
So that means you're
holding the brakes,

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.980
you slam the power forward,
you let off the brakes,

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.980
and you're going to get the
book numbers, because there's

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.460
no acceleration
time for the engine.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.217
And actually, that's how jets
are supposed to take off, too.

00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:12.800
But you probably remember from
your commercial flights, that's

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.489
not really how it happens.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.300
The pilots don't hold the
brakes, you know, spend--

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.870
it takes maybe 10 seconds
for a really heavy jet engine

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:21.969
to spool up to full power.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:24.344
They don't just sit
there holding the brakes,

00:34:24.344 --> 00:34:26.130
engine's at the max,
and everything's

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.130
screaming in the airplane,
shaking, because it's

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.360
just uncomfortable.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.113
So they usually cheat--

00:34:31.113 --> 00:34:32.780
technically, they're
not really supposed

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.050
to do it because, you know, at
that point, your test pilots.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.409
You don't really have any
data for a rolling takeoff.

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.090
But, you know,
again, it would be

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.840
kind of unnerving for
passengers, I think,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.048
if they are sitting there
with the airplane straining

00:34:46.048 --> 00:34:46.850
against the brakes.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.583
OK, same deal here.

00:34:51.583 --> 00:34:53.000
Ground roll and
the total distance

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.409
to clear the 50
foot obstacle, this

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:56.951
is what I was telling you about
the other day with the Cirrus

00:34:56.951 --> 00:34:59.420
hero who wanted
to go to, I think,

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.340
about 2,500 feet of runway.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.920
Actually, we had
to subtract some.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.510
I think it was 2,700 minus 400.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.900
He had about 2,300
feet of runway.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.090
And he wanted to go there in the
Cirrus, which takes 2,100 feet.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:12.720
Another guy actually
wanted to go to--

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.340
there's a private air park
in Falmouth, Massachusetts

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.680
where you can have a house
right next to the runway

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.530
and keep the airplane
in your garage.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.260
And that airport's
only 2,300 feet long.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.200
And another east
coast aero club guy--

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.000
I was handing the
airplane over to him

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.542
and he had this huge
friend with him.

00:35:30.542 --> 00:35:32.960
This guy was like
a NFL linebacker.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.820
So it was just the
two of them, but big.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.255
And he wanted it also at
full, topped off on fuel,

00:35:38.255 --> 00:35:40.130
so they're going to be
right at gross weight.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:41.297
I said, where are you going?

00:35:41.297 --> 00:35:42.700
He said Falmouth.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.020
He'd just gotten his
private pilot certificate

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.580
a few months earlier.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.930
This guy was not commercial
IFR rated like the other.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.620
And I said, look, you know,
if you do everything perfect,

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.950
you're going to use
up 92% of that runway

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:57.780
because it's hemmed
in by these obstacles.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.270
So don't do it.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:03.110
So he did end up going
to Hyannis, I think.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:07.400
All right, landing
technique can actually

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.250
affect the performance.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:14.790
So they talk about, an average
pilot, the book numbers,

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.060
they're predicated on
extremely aggressive braking,

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.810
like right to the point where
you would flat spot the tires.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.480
So don't count on getting those
book numbers unless you're

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:28.010
willing to be more
aggressive than probably you

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.000
would want to be.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.600
And actually, I'll tell you a
story about my airline days.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.180
I did a visual approach
in the Laguardia.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.430
And with jets, it's
not conventional to try

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.430
to do the really greaser
landings that you would

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.140
do in a little
airplane, because you

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.410
need to get the airplane down
and the spoilers to pop up.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.000
The jets are very
efficient gliders.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.710
They don't have a
big prop in front.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.010
And when you pull the power
back on a piston aircraft,

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.410
it really slows down
dramatically because the prop

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:55.777
has a lot of air resistance.

00:36:55.777 --> 00:36:57.860
None of that's going for
you with the jet which is

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.750
more efficient to begin with.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.720
So basically, the task
of an airline pilot

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.530
is really to slam it on, and
that way the spoilers pop up

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.780
and then the brakes start
really working effectively.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.850
And you turn off the
runway in Laguardia

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.250
before you go into the river.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.960
So I landed like a
Cirrus, because it

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.770
was my first month on
the job, and I chewed up

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.700
by 1,500 feet of runway before
the airplane touched down.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.520
And I applied fairly gentle
braking and thrust reverse

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.980
and turned off after about
5,000 feet of runway.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.480
And the captain's
like, that sucked.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.030
I'm going to show you how
it's done the next leg.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:36.860
So we did Laguardia to
Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.323
Who else did that leg?

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:40.585
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:40.585 --> 00:37:41.960
PHILLIP GREENSPUN:
Captain Sully.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.330
So he dumped his passengers
into a filthy cold river

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.170
and they called him a hero.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:50.250
I got my passengers to
Charlotte warm and dry,

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.070
and where was my medal?

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.940
Where is my fame?

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.630
Nowhere.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.980
All right, so life is unfair.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.190
You've learned that.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.460
Anyway, so the captain
takes this one.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.840
Air traffic control lines us up.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.010
Instead of the
visual approach where

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.593
you're doing everything by eye
and following another aircraft,

00:38:04.593 --> 00:38:07.020
and you can't use any
of the fancy automation,

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.190
we were lined up 10 or 15 miles
out for a straight in approach

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.370
to this angled
runway at Charlotte.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.280
And all the captain had
to do was-- on autopilot,

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.328
all he had to do was
tweak the thrust levers

00:38:19.328 --> 00:38:20.370
for the perfect airspeed.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.850
The autopilot's flying.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.180
He disconnects the autopilot a
couple feet above the ground.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.070
Now he's hand flying.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.500
All he has to do--
the CRJ doesn't have,

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.790
the 50-seater, any
leading edge devices,

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:33.930
so it has to be pointed
down a bit like a lawn dart.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.560
It's not that different
from landing a Cirrus.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.350
It's unconventional
for an airliner.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.380
The airliners, you
notice they usually--

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.270
because of the
leading edge devices,

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:43.950
even when they're
going 120 knots or so,

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:46.900
they can be kind of nose up
and they still fly pretty well.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.990
So the airplane
almost can be flown--

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.570
and it can auto
land, in some cases,

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:54.510
onto the runway by itself with
just a slight additional flare

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.410
at the end.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:59.670
The CRJ has to be kept nose
down 145 knots faster than all

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:04.170
but the very biggest jets, and
then it has to be, you know,

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.740
flared from minus five to
maybe plus five or plus

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.210
seven at the end.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:13.440
So the captain, after telling
me what a bad job I had done,

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.190
he flared about
five feet too high,

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.100
and the airplane just sailed
over 4,500 feet of runway,

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.860
I think, before it
finally touched down.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.270
And he slammed on the brakes,
maximum thrust reverse.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.290
We barely made it off.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.430
I think we made it off
after 7,200 feet of runway,

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.700
so we would have been, I think,
in the water in Laguardia.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.850
So that's the kind of thing
where, you know, you can't--

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:38.970
that's why these
safety margins are

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.385
good to build into your own
flying, because, you know,

00:39:42.385 --> 00:39:44.010
the book number said
the airplane would

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.557
land a lot shorter than that.

00:39:46.557 --> 00:39:49.140
Also, in a jet, there's really
not a good go-around technique.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.515
Once you're below
50 feet, you're

00:39:50.515 --> 00:39:53.970
not supposed to try to
add power and go around

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:57.030
because it takes a while
to spool the engines up.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.100
All right, in
turbulence, you usually

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.580
will increase your
approach speed,

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.240
which means you're going
to chew up more runway.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.670
You're supposed to add half the
gust factor as a rule of thumb.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.570
So if the wind is 15
gusting 25, you're

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.790
going to speed up your
approach by five knots.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.550
And I got the numbers
here for the Cirrus.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.530
75 is kind of a
good overall number,

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.330
and then you'll
beef it up to 80.

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:21.210
But that means, unless it
really is a headwind when you're

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.540
landing, you're going to
chew up a little more runway

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.060
than expected.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.520
OK, flaps, as Tina
mentioned, they

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.440
enable you to keep
your approach speed

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.920
low while having a nice
steep approach angle.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.335
So that's good for getting
over trees and stuff.

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:40.710
If you're in an aerobatic
airplane or something else that

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.210
doesn't have flaps,
you can actually

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.180
slip and go sideways
down towards the runway

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.060
and get over the obstacles,
but it's a lot easier

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.720
just to put the flaps down.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:57.840
OK, the charts come in all
kinds of variations in the POH,

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.880
especially for the
bigger airplanes.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.680
You'll have, you
know, 10 charts that

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.930
look identical except
for a couple of numbers,

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.590
like the exact flap position,
whether the anti-icing is

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.250
on or off.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.330
The Piper Warrior
POH is a lot simpler,

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:15.180
and that's some of
the charts we're

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.260
going to cover in addition to
some of the anonymous airplane

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.500
charts that the FAA
gives you with the test.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.140
So one thing to remember if
you're a renter, in addition

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.410
to the fact that you want to
build in maybe some charter

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.290
and airline minimums
into your flying,

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.390
is that all those numbers
were with the brand

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.180
new airplane that was
perfectly straight

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.870
and had a perfect engine.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:42.300
OK, so wind components.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.580
You're going to get a
shorter takeoff and landing

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.300
distances with a headwind.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.260
A tailwind, actually,
it may not be

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.240
legal to operate
a high performance

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.533
aircraft on a runway
with a tailwind of more

00:41:53.533 --> 00:41:54.450
than a certain amount.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.220
I think for the c.r.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.030
It was 10 knots.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:03.000
We just simply could not land
with a 10 knot tailwind or more

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.040
than a 10 knot tailwind.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.088
Crosswind is a
little bit different.

00:42:09.088 --> 00:42:11.130
You'll get a max demonstrated
crosswind component

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:11.850
in the manual.

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.760
So it'll tell you a
test pilot managed

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.520
to hold this airplane straight
on the runway with full flaps,

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:23.280
or whatever the normal landing
configuration is, and there

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.380
was enough rudder to land
with a 15 knot crosswind.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.180
So that's max demonstrated.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.800
It's not a limitation.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.550
So if it is, it'll say,
this is a limitation.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:39.000
But max demonstrated just
means a test pilot did it.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.540
It'll probably work for
you too if you manipulate

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.280
the controls in the same way.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.160
And beyond that,
you can't be sure.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.000
So one thing that
people will do is

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.440
they will adjust the
flap amount to have--

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.670
a reduced use of flaps
in a heavy crosswind,

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.350
that keeps the airspeed up.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.853
You will chew up more runway.

00:43:02.853 --> 00:43:04.770
But when the wheels
actually touch the ground,

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:09.338
the wheels provide a little
bit of stabilization and help

00:43:09.338 --> 00:43:11.130
keep you from getting
blown off the runway.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:16.810
You're going to see tomorrow
Dojo from the Brazilian Air

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:21.030
Force is going to tell you about
testing the various airplanes,

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:25.980
but especially the Super Tucano,
in very heavy crosswinds down

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.900
there in South America.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.820
They have some
pretty heavy winds.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.782
I think they went
to Chile to do that.

00:43:31.782 --> 00:43:32.490
I could be wrong.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.770
Or maybe it was just right
next to the Andes in Brazil.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.310
OK, crosswind chart.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:46.650
So this here shows you that, if
you have a 40 knot wind at a 30

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:51.510
degree angle, you go over here
on the chart to the 30 degree

00:43:51.510 --> 00:44:00.030
line, you use this 40
knot ring, and then

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:04.050
you can find that it's a 35
knot headwind and a 20 knot

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:04.650
crosswind.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:06.780
Does that make sense?

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.640
I will tell you when
I was getting a type

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.430
rating for this Cessna
Mustang flight safety,

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:14.220
there were a couple of
Boeing 737 pilots there,

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.410
and they had no idea
how to use this chart.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.740
And they couldn't even
give the right answers.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:23.610
If you said, you know,
you're landing on runway 27

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:27.690
and the wind's coming
from 315, is that

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.880
a tailwind or a headwind?

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.290
And they couldn't answer
that question either.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:36.640
Basically, all they do is
go from towered airport

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.560
to towered airport.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.212
The tower tells them
what runway to use.

00:44:40.212 --> 00:44:41.670
They are from the
Philippines, so I

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:43.900
guess it's not
insanely windy there

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.020
like it would be in Argentina.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.170
I once landed in
Argentina in Ushuaia

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.860
on a commercial airline
flight, and it was 50 knot--

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.400
the wind was, I
think, 35 gusting 50.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.102
And the pilots, you know, I
talked to them afterwards.

00:45:00.102 --> 00:45:01.560
They said it was
just a normal day.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.160
They wouldn't even bother
talking about that.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:09.330
So anyway, these
skills apparently rest.

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.760
I'm sure those guys, you know,
had used a chart like that

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.710
at one point in their training.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.102
They did get their type
rating, so the good news

00:45:16.102 --> 00:45:18.060
is you can get your type
rating without knowing

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.030
how to use that.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.655
OK, here's one of
the FAA charts.

00:45:20.655 --> 00:45:22.280
This is what they
give you on the test.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.620
It's a lot easier
to use than the POH.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.560
Here's a problem.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.250
They're giving you
an example problem.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:29.820
Let's see.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.750
We're at somewhere in Colorado,
apparently 5,650 feet.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.270
We weigh 2,950 pounds
in this airplane

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.250
that they won't
tell us what it is.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:43.230
It's nine knots of headwind.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.730
Notice these
associated conditions.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.230
These are really critical.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.780
And again, if they give you
a choice of multiple charts,

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.890
that's where the trick is.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:53.130
You know, they're trying to
get you to use the wrong chart.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.380
That's more on the AP exam
than on the private one.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:01.960
But yeah, see here, powerful
throttle, cowl flaps are open.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:07.590
This is some kind of
more complicated plane,

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.440
that you got the right mixture
set even before you take off

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.910
for high altitude.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.100
All right, so what
do we got here?

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.767
We got temperature of 15.

00:46:17.767 --> 00:46:19.350
We go up to the air
pressure altitude,

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.162
pretty close to 6,000.

00:46:21.162 --> 00:46:22.620
We come over here,
we're apparently

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.787
right at gross weight, so
at least that's realistic.

00:46:24.787 --> 00:46:30.840
Most aircraft take off right at
gross weight for most flights.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.730
There's nine knots
of wind, so that's

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:35.830
going to subtract a little bit
from our runway requirements.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:41.240
And here we can see it's
1,500 feet of ground roll

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.920
and a little over--

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.645
what is that, 2,300?

00:46:44.645 --> 00:46:47.000
Yeah, 2,300 to clear
the 50 foot obstacle.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.500
So these charts are
not hard to use.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.550
And in the real world,
maybe in the FAA figure,

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:54.050
they actually give
you this example.

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:56.450
So you can see how it's
done and then, you know,

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:59.190
you just draw the lines
in a different place.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.350
So they're not
trying to trick you.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.610
Here's a chart for
the Pilatus PC-12.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.490
There's also apps
to do it, which

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:10.300
I'll show you a
little bit later,

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.700
similar to that Piper
chart we saw earlier

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.700
where you calculate the density
altitude without realizing

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.650
that you've calculated it.

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:20.660
Yeah, so here you've
got pressure altitude

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.670
and temperature, and
you're implicitly

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:24.620
calculating density altitude.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.042
Then you go over to weight.

00:47:26.042 --> 00:47:26.750
Look at this one.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:30.730
The Pilatus guys, I think
they are having some fun here.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:33.580
They're saying you're
taking off at 7,000 pounds.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:39.400
So you're missing almost 3,000
pounds of people and bags.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.290
You paid all this
money for this airplane

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:43.643
and you're barely using it.

00:47:43.643 --> 00:47:46.060
So I don't think that happens
too often unless you've just

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.470
dropped everybody off at
an airport with no fuel

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:50.572
and you're repositioning.

00:47:50.572 --> 00:47:52.030
Anyway, so you've
got the headwind.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:54.655
They've got uphill and downhill
all baked into this nice chart.

00:47:54.655 --> 00:47:56.620
You can get all
these good numbers.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.570
This is why Cirrus is better,
why they're the best seller.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.433
They just say, look,
here is this table.

00:48:02.433 --> 00:48:03.850
There's a few
corrections that you

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:07.490
can use if you want to up
there in the upper right

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.890
for headwind, tailwind, grass.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:13.400
But basically, they make
the usual case very simple

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.540
of a level runway,
a paved runway.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.210
It's always more
conservative to go more.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.950
You know, you don't
have to interpolate.

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:24.450
You can just say,
well, it's 25 degrees,

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:26.360
so I'll use the
30 degree number.

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:36.210
OK, what is the
rate of climb here?

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.630
We're in a gross
weight of 1,670 pounds.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:42.290
It's 2,000 feet.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.190
How do we figure that out?

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.810
This is one of the
FAA example tables,

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:52.850
and it's as simple as finding
the right row in the table, row

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:55.230
and column in the table.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:56.510
Or actually, have a look here.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.135
So they're saying
the mixture has to be

00:48:58.135 --> 00:48:59.410
lean to get these numbers.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:00.490
The flaps have to be up.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:01.907
You've got to be
at full throttle.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.810
OK, same deal,
max rate of climb.

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:09.931
I forget if this a--

00:49:09.931 --> 00:49:14.090
this might be a
paper chart, but you

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:15.950
can see that associated
conditions up there

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.150
in the top left.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:20.560
That's absolutely critical.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.030
You know, The gross weight--

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:24.640
Cirrus, actually, a lot
of the performance numbers

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.470
in the Cirrus for cruise
speed are at 2,600 pounds

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:34.070
and you're flying along at 2,950
because you took off at 3,000.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.580
You're wondering, how come
I'm not getting these numbers?

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.420
But of course, you know,
they're being optimistic about--

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.420
they're putting their
airplane in the best light

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:46.510
by positing some
weight that probably

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:48.430
doesn't exist in real life.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:53.230
All right, here they give us an
example of 5,000 feet pressure

00:49:53.230 --> 00:50:01.410
altitude, OAT of 16 degrees, so
ISA plus 11, max rate of climb,

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.950
374.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:06.300
So I guess, yeah, 5,000 feet.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.390
Here's ISA plus 11.

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:12.040
It says 376 with some kind
of elaborate interpolation.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.680
I guess you find that last
couple feet per minute

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.430
that you subtract.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:20.590
Here's cruise charts.

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:23.725
I think, again, this is from
the FAA test supplement.

00:50:23.725 --> 00:50:25.600
They're just giving
you-- remember I told you

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.160
it would be ISA minus 20?

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.380
That's the chart on the left.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.410
The one in the middle
is the standard day.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:34.460
And on the right is a
summer day, ISA plus 20.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:40.210
Notice that they'll give you
fuel flow and the true airspeed

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:43.340
given various engine speed and
manifold pressure settings.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.800
This looks like it's
for a piston twin.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.008
OK, landing performance is a
pretty similar kind of chart.

00:50:50.008 --> 00:50:51.550
Not going to go
through this exactly,

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.580
but you can see they're
giving you the worked example.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.720
And you come up with--

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.220
let's see.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:02.270
It's going to be about a little
over 1,000 feet of ground

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:11.070
roll and 1,700 feet, they claim,
to clear a 50 foot obstacle.

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.540
Here's an FAA
question, actually.

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.308
So let's see.

00:51:14.308 --> 00:51:16.350
Determine the total distance
required for takeoff

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:18.420
to clear a 50 foot obstacle.

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:21.990
Standard temperature, sea level.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:23.700
So actually, this
is testing you.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.470
This is pretty advanced, right?

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:30.070
They're saying it's the standard
temperature at sea level,

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:34.770
so you have to know
that it's 15 degrees.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:44.700
We only weigh 2,700
pounds, so we're

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:50.190
going to have to ride down
this curve a little bit.

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:51.600
And the wind's
calm, so we're not

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.690
going to get any
boost from the wind.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.870
So what do you guys think?

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.580
Have any of you been
able to kind of see

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.520
what the most likely number
is by following these?

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.560
Somebody says A?

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.510
Let's see.

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.350
It's a little bit lighter.

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:14.875
That kind of makes sense.

00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:16.250
But on the other
hand, the wind's

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.980
calm, so we didn't get that
reduction from the wind.

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.682
Let's see.

00:52:20.682 --> 00:52:22.140
So if we came down
here, it's going

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:28.270
to start from sea
level, 15 degrees.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.080
Come over here.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:36.640
Come down here over
a 50 foot obstacle,

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.600
then we have to go up.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:43.300
Anybody want to
revise their estimate?

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.470
A, we heard A last time.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:47.750
It seems a little short to
clear the 50 foot obstacle.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:50.060
I agree with you that you'd
be well off the ground

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:54.418
by 1,000 feet.

00:52:54.418 --> 00:52:54.918
Tada!

00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.940
All right, obviously,
you know, if you

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:05.850
have a pencil and a little more
time to do that, it's easier.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:07.660
That's kind of the hard way.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.740
Let's look at the easy way.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.620
Getting the runway numbers
for low performance aircraft,

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:16.140
it actually remains pretty
common to just use the POH.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.233
People aren't usually
in a situation

00:53:18.233 --> 00:53:19.650
where they have
to worry about it.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:21.942
If you're going from Hanscom
Field or Martha's Vineyard

00:53:21.942 --> 00:53:23.370
and back, you
know, both airports

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.730
are big enough for a
Boeing, and you're not

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:29.940
going to be carefully
calculating these numbers

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.060
unless you really don't
have much else to do.

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:36.263
Apps, though, are available even
for low performance aircraft,

00:53:36.263 --> 00:53:37.930
and they're very
useful if you're going,

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:40.020
you know, into tighter
airports And you

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.350
might have to worry about that.

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.440
The time and fuel
stuff is everywhere

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.550
on the web and the apps.

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.572
But the actual runway numbers
are a little bit less common.

00:53:50.572 --> 00:53:52.030
Let me show you a
couple of things.

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:53.190
Here's Gyronimo.

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:59.450
So they sell these for
different aircraft.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:02.800
This is just off their website.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:07.130
And for an SR22, you
can see you put in--

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:08.330
they must be European.

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:11.890
They say aircraft mass 3,359.

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:15.100
And you've got your temperature,
your takeoff elevation,

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:18.620
your altimeter,
runway conditions.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.890
I don't know what
that plus 5% is.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:26.370
Maybe they're saying-- oh, I
don't know if that's between--

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:28.960
is it half grass and half paved?

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.110
Anyway, you can put
in everything relevant

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:34.140
and it's going to tell
you how much ground roll

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.600
and how much takeoff distance.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.770
So that's pretty slick.

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:42.500
It's a lot easier than
relying on the POH.

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.660
The calculator for
the Pilatus is free.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.150
That's the good news.

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:50.970
And here, same deal.

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:55.650
You put in your weight,
the temperature,

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:58.380
if there's any headwind,
the airport elevation,

00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.820
and you get the numbers.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:10.110
All right, we can try to
get the doc camera working

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:11.390
for a demo in a minute here.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:14.010
But in the meantime, first
of all, are there questions?

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.795
And secondly, what
is this aircraft?

00:55:15.795 --> 00:55:16.920
And what's it designed for?

00:55:20.315 --> 00:55:21.770
AUDIENCE: Question
about the test.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:28.725
Will it be on the
[INAUDIBLE] for this class?

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:30.240
Because it's online, right?

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.240
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.650
Well, you can print out
the test supplement.

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:33.310
That's public.

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:34.270
It's in our Dropbox.

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:36.700
And also, the FAA makes this
chart supplement public,

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.450
so you can see all the
figures that you're

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:41.945
going to see before the test.

00:55:41.945 --> 00:55:44.070
I think, actually, when
you're done with your test,

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.460
I think you can print
out all the questions

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.116
and it'll show you
what you got right.

00:55:47.116 --> 00:55:47.658
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:47.658 --> 00:55:50.665
Because for the grass, this
is going to be harder for me

00:55:50.665 --> 00:55:51.290
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.940
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: Oh, yeah.

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:53.260
Yeah, just print out the chart.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.793
Yeah, sure, another
chart supplement.

00:55:59.212 --> 00:56:01.420
Anybody have any brilliant
ideas about this aircraft?

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:08.880
It says Grizz on it.

00:56:12.233 --> 00:56:17.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:19.970
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: That's a
Burt Rutan design, the climate

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:20.750
change denier.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:27.620
And this is a super
short field airplane.

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.130
It actually doesn't land as
short as you might think.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:31.880
I think it might be a
four-seater, though,

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.570
so I guess it is pretty darn
short for a four-seater.

00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.280
But it has huge flaps
and a lot of wing area,

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.140
and it's got that--

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.040
I think it has ordinary--

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:45.220
Yeah, see, it has essentially
three surfaces right?

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:49.010
It's got kind of a
helper wing or a canard

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:52.700
out in front, the
regular wing, and then

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.650
an ordinary
conventional tail plane.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.510
Let me see if I can get
this doc camera working.

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.190
All right, so let's say we want
to know how much fuel we're

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:09.600
going to use.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.190
See that fuel pounds there?

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.160
Where is that?

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:23.740
Somewhere along here--
well, actually, I

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:29.470
happen to know it's got to be
somewhere-- we're 10 pounds.

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:31.720
Yeah, see, there's US
gallons right there.

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.730
So we line this up.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.100
And you can tell this was
designed for piston folks,

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.750
because their idea
of fuel weight

00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.440
is six pounds per gallon,
and jet fuel weighs 6.7.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.690
But at this point, now we've
got our handy slide rule.

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:50.280
So we know, if we load on, for
example, 10 gallons of fuel,

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.600
it's going to be 60 pounds.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:59.170
And the Cirrus holds
56 gallons, so that's

00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:02.770
going to weigh 300 and--

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.640
looks like 345.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.130
Oh, sorry, 335 gallons.

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:08.470
335 pounds.

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:18.290
More to the point, you can
calculate density altitude.

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:19.940
So over here, for
example, you can

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:24.050
say the pressure altitude is--

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.520
let's call it sea level.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.160
And it's very hot, though.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.850
It's plus 40 degrees.

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:32.240
So now you see the
density altitude up there

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.190
is about 2,000 feet.

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:36.050
Does that make sense?

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:39.980
So you've set the pressure
altitude at the bottom

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.330
or inside this little
window at zero,

00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:44.900
and then the density
altitude gets read out here

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:49.350
after you line it up
with a temperature.

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:53.130
There's also something
that you can do, well,

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.460
just with the basic rate.

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.727
So let's say you decide that
you're going to be going--

00:58:57.727 --> 00:58:59.310
this is more for
performance planning.

00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:05.250
But let's say you're a Cirrus
and you're going 150 knots.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:11.250
If you end up needing to go,
let's say, 300 nautical miles,

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:14.310
it tells you that'll
take you two hours.

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:20.290
Not too exciting, but the wind
side is a little more exciting.

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.597
I'll bring a pencil tomorrow
for the flight planning talk

00:59:23.597 --> 00:59:25.680
and we can play around
with wind vectors on there.

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.870
But anyway, fortunately,
a lot of this stuff

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:29.160
is explained in the book.

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.580
You guys are free to come up
and play around with it anytime.

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:37.250
There's a temperature conversion
scale here on the bottom.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:39.470
And it's a fun toy.

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:43.110
Tina, anything else that
we should cover here?

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:44.070
Or should be segue?

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:45.400
What's the next--

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.750
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So we're
going to take questions,

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.656
and then there's a short
break, and then weather data.

00:59:48.656 --> 00:59:50.970
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: OK, the
next one's weather data.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:54.000
You'll need a
break for that one.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.080
That's how you find
out all this stuff.

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.050
Let me go back to the PC.

00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:01.660
Who else has questions?

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.473
AUDIENCE: Can you
go [INAUDIBLE]??

01:00:06.877 --> 01:00:09.210
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: Go back
over and look at a POH graph?

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:09.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:11.610
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: Which one?

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:13.640
You want to do with
the FAA exam ones?

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.417
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the last one.

01:00:15.417 --> 01:00:17.250
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: Lane
landing performance,

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.470
or this one from
the actual test?

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:20.637
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:20.637 --> 01:00:21.803
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: This one?

01:00:21.803 --> 01:00:23.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:25.140
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: OK,
so I don't think they

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.940
ever give it worked out for you.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.210
Let me switch to the
laser pointer mode.

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:37.110
OK, so what do they tell us?

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:38.990
They told us it was
standard and sea level.

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:40.907
That's the one part of
the standard atmosphere

01:00:40.907 --> 01:00:43.270
that people, I think,
are expected to remember,

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:46.600
that at sea level it should
be 15 degrees Celsius.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.240
So we come down here.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.310
We say it's 15 degrees out.

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:53.670
We're going to hit the sea
level pressure altitude.

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:57.090
We're going to slide over this
way, just like in the example.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.490
And then we're going to slide
down, following this curve,

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:07.590
to 2,700 pounds.

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:11.320
And we're going to go
over here, and we're going

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.620
to say, look, there's no wind.

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:16.720
The wind's calm, so we'll
keep going over here,

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.360
and we find that we need about
a little less than 1,000 feet,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.932
maybe 800 feet,
for a ground roll.

01:01:27.932 --> 01:01:30.140
But to clear the 50 foot
obstacle, look at the bottom

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.040
there.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.650
We need to go up, following
one of these lines,

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:37.190
and that's how we get
to the 1,400 number.

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:40.280
Did that help?

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.590
You still look a
little bit skeptical.

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:45.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it just doesn't
look like that line [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.540
PHILLIP GREENSPUN:
Well, remember, we

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.882
would be doing this
with a virtual pencil.

01:01:50.882 --> 01:01:52.340
These lines are
just for reference,

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.670
telling you kind of what slope
to follow with your pencil.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:02:02.980
So it's not like these are
the only available points.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.560
So it's not like it's going to
be either this for the answer,

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.560
or this for the answer,
or this for your answer.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.970
Even in their
worked example, you

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:12.340
can see their red line for
the answer is just parallel

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:16.780
to that gray line.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.010
They're not picking
one of the gray lines.

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:21.640
So they're guidelines
for how you should

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.910
move your pencil in each phase.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:28.210
I hope this motivates you
to buy that Gyronimo app.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.363
It certainly would
motivate me to do it.

01:02:30.363 --> 01:02:32.780
TINA SRIVASTAVA: If you want
to look at it on a real book,

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:39.890
I'll pass around-- again,
this is my POH for Cessna 172.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.930
So this might be
the type of plane

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:45.020
that you're using as
your training aircraft.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.540
And I have a couple
of pages that are

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.280
marked with a piece of paper.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.360
So one talks about how you
calculate the takeoff distance.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.815
And one is weight and balance.

01:02:54.815 --> 01:02:56.690
We'll actually have a
whole section dedicated

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:57.740
to weight and balance.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.720
But just to give
you a sense of how

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.030
you can follow with your
pencil, and you'll actually

01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:05.840
see some pencil markings
of my own fairly

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.920
close to the limits here of
our center of gravity moment

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.970
envelope here, but
still within the box,

01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:14.240
so just to give you an
idea of how you can do that

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.165
with a real paper and pencil.

01:03:18.165 --> 01:03:19.139
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:19.139 --> 01:03:34.390
[INAUDIBLE] So within that
[INAUDIBLE] Is that the reason?

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:35.390
PHILLIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:40.280
So the question is, you know, we
don't have any kind of readout

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.940
in the aircraft for
density altitude.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.450
So is that why we're always
calculating with our handy E6B

01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:49.380
or listening to the
ASOS or whatever?

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:49.880
So, yeah.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.880
Yeah, basically your
instruments in the aircraft

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.760
can tell you the temperature,
outside air temperature,

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.280
maybe not quite as accurate
as the one from the airport

01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.750
if you're on the ground.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.540
And they can also show you,
if you set your altimeter

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:07.730
to two niner niner two, you
can see the pressure altitude.

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:10.300
But the relationship between
the two is not simple.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.310
And there's nothing onboard
the aircraft conventionally

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:14.730
that will calculate it for you.

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:16.230
And I don't think
that's quite true.

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:17.960
I think a lot of
modern GPS boxes

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.760
will do that
calculation for you.

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.140
But you have to type
in all the numbers.

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.170
They don't usually just grab it.

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:29.630
They will give you things
like true air speed.

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:31.130
They'll definitely
calculate that.

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:33.703
So if you're indicating 150
but you're up really high,

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.120
they'll tell you,
well, now you're

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.308
going 200 knots
in true air speed,

01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:39.350
and then they'll give you
your ground speed, too.

01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:41.360
And they'll even show
you with a wind vector.

01:04:44.678 --> 01:04:46.220
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Any other questions?

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:50.870
OK, great.

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:53.180
So we'll just take
a 10 minute break

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.360
and start up again at
2:15 with weather data.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.640
And that's the one you guys
seem to keep asking about,

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.130
so we'll talk about
also, towards the end

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:05.890
of that talk, how you build
your own ADS-B receiver.

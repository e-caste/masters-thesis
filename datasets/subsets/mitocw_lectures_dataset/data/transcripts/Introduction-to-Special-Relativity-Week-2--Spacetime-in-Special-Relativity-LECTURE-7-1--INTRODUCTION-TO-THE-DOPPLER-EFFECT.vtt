MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.350
In this section, we're going to
discuss the classical Doppler

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.400
effect.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.370
The Doppler effect was first
noted by Christian Doppler,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.512
hence the name, in 1842.

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:34.470
And what we're discussing
as the Doppler effect

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.130
is a frequency change when
moving from one reference frame

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.010
into another.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.240
So this can happen, for example,
if the source of a sound wave

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.440
is moving like we experience
when a car is passing by.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.963
The application of the
Doppler effect are numerous.

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:52.630
We can use the Doppler
effect to measure

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.952
the velocity of a speeding car.

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:57.160
We can use the Doppler effect
to measure the distance

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.920
of distant galaxies.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.880
As a reminder, the velocity
of a wave, so the velocity

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.040
in which the wave
is propagating is

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.660
equal to the frequency
times the wavelength.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.820
So when we move relative
to the source of the wave,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.190
we see this apparent
change in frequency.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.980
But let's introduce this
topic not in my words,

Hey, what's Sheldon
supposed to be?

- Oh, he's the Doppler effect.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.573
- Yes.

00:02:34.573 --> 00:02:36.990
It's the apparent change in
the frequency of a wave caused

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.400
by relative motion
between the source

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.608

Doppler effect.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.670

[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.510
MARKUS KLUTE: The Doppler
effect, so now we have it.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690
All right, so let's look
at a specific situation

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.140
here, in which we have a sound
wave emitted by a moving car.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.660
The car is moving
with the velocity u,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.440
and it's emitting sound, via the
engine or the horn of the car.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.410
If you then look at the
wavelength as we observe,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.670
so we have an observer here.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.980
As we observe the
wavelengths, the wavelength

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.490
is actually modified because
the crests of the moving

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.330
car, the horn, the engine,
they are moving themselves

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.280
with the velocity u times
to 0, which is a period,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.140
which is equal to u times
1 over the frequency

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.990
as the frequency emitted
by the car addressed.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.680
So the wavelength is modified to
lambda minus u times 1 over f0.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.710
So then we can use
this equation here

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.620
to calculate the wavelength
at the frequency as

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.780
observed by this
person here, which

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.970
is the velocity of the
moving wave divided

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.470
by the modified or the
observe wavelengths.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.370
And so that's v over
lambda minus u times 1

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.430
over f0 or f0 times
1 over 1 minus uv.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.970
All right, so we see that
the frequency is modified

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.430
when we observe the moving car.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.320
And you have all
experiences in life

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.959
already, so let's look at a
few more examples of this.

00:04:26.803 --> 00:04:28.220
I'll just share
this little video.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.220

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:08.310
So this is interesting now.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.900
So you've heard exactly what
I was describing before,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.270
the sound of a moving vehicle.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.060
In the first case, a car
honking, in the second case,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.120
a European fire
truck passing by.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.030
And so there is an additional
part of the story here.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.200
If I would ask you, please do
make the sound of a fire truck,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.280
I think not many of you
would say nina, nina, nina,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.268
which is the sound of this
fire truck for European.

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:35.810
There's a few more
of those examples,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.010
which are really weird.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.460
If I ask you to make
the sound of a rooster,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.180
you and I will probably disagree
on the sound of a rooster.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.360
I would say [NON-ENGLISH] and
you would make a sound which is

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.130
rather unfamiliar to me.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.110
So that's just a fun
fact on the side,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.110
but this was a
short introduction

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.000
to the classical Doppler effect.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.530
And in the next
video, we will look

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.670
at the relativistic
Doppler effect.

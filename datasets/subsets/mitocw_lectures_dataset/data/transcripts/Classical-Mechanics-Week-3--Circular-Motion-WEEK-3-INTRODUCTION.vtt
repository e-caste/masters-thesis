00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.900
This week, we will
consider the special case

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.640
of circular motion.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.820
The case where we know that the
motion is exactly constrained

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.240
to have a circular geometry.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.530
This will consist of two parts.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.160
First, we will consider the
kinematics of circular motion.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.860
How do we describe the
trajectory, velocity,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.890
and acceleration of a particle
undergoing circular motion?

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.830
We will consider
both the simple case

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.920
of uniform circular motion,
where the object moves

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.480
with constant speed, and also
nonuniform circular motion,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.460
where the object is speeding
up and/or slowing down

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.520
as a function of time.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.750
We will see that a
Cartesian coordinate

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.510
system proves awkward for
describing circular motion.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.720
And instead, we will introduce
the so-called polar coordinate

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.900
system in terms of
the radius vector

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.600
from the origin and its
position angle, which

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.720
provides a much more
elegant description

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.330
for circular motion.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.600
We will then examine the
dynamics of circular motion

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.960
using Newton's second law to
understand what sorts of forces

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.170
are required in order to
cause circular motion in both

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.539
the uniform and
nonuniform cases.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.620
This will be the first
of several examples

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.400
we will see in this course
of constrained motion.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.900
In this case, the constraint
is that the object

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.260
moves in a circular path.

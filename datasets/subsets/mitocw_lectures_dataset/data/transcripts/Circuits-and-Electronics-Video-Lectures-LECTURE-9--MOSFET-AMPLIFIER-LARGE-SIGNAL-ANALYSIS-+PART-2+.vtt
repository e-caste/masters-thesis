WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Good morning,
all.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's get going.
So I guess you had your quiz

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
review yesterday.
I hope you guys didn't beat up

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
on (name of TA) and who else was
it?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Name of TA) too much.
As you know,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the quiz is tomorrow.
And unfortunately MIT couldn't

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
give us one big room so we are
broken up into three rooms.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And you will go to your room
based on the first letter of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
your last name.
OK, so today we shall cover a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
topic called "Large Signal
Analysis".

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So in the last couple lectures
we looked at one dependent

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
sources abstractly,
and then we looked at an

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
amplifier built using a
practical dependent source

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
called the MOSFET.
Now, the MOSFET had to be

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
operated in a given region of
its operation in order to behave

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
like a current source.
And while it behaved like a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
current source you would get
amplification or a FET

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
amplifier.
So that was in the past two

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
lectures.
What you are going to do today

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is called large signal analysis,
and this is a loaded term.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So large signal analysis means
something very specific in our

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
business, and I will describe to
what that is.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This analysis involves looking
at a circuit containing,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
for example,
a MOSFET and figuring out how

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to get that device to operate in
a way that the MOSFET was always

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in saturation.
So you had to figure out,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
based on parameters that you
could control,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
how to establish those
parameters so that the circuit

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
operated in a way that the
MOSFET was always in saturation.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So large signal analysis
involves that.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And although the examples we
use, use the MOSFET,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the same kind of analysis can
apply to any other device.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Remember, your MOSFET is a
primitive element that we use as

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
an example in this course.
There are other primitive

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
elements that you can use.
The course notes,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
for example,
discusses a couple other

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
devices.
One is the "bipolar junction

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
transistor", the BJT,
and works through a complete

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
example from start to finish
involving a circuit containing a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
bipolar junction transistor.
And you can do a large signal

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
analysis of that device as well.
It turns out that you need to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
operate that device in an
interesting region of its

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
operating space,
and so you can conduct a large

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
signal analysis of a circuit
containing that device and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
figure out how best to operate
that circuit.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So that is large signal
analysis, and we will do an

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
example and explain how this is
done using an example today.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So to quickly review where we
have been so far,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
we looked at this little
structure here,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
our MOSFET amplifier.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Notice that when I write a
voltage at a node,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that's a short form for saying
I am looking at the voltage

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
between the ground node and the
node at which the voltage is

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
written down.
So VO here and VI applied here.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
This is a very,
very common circuit that we

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
use.
To emphasize one more point,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
in general, in the kind of
circuits we look at both in this

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
course and in real life,
there are a few patterns that

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
we use very commonly that keep
repeating all the time.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Very often you don't have to
look at every possible

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
permutation and combination of
how things could be connected.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
This sort of connecting thing
is very, very,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
very common.
And you will see a lot of this

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
pattern.
And we do the equivalent

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
circuit for this.
In the equivalent circuit we

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
replace the MOSFET with a
dependent source provided this

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
operated in the saturation
region.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So I will just say while
operating under saturation the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
equivalent circuit would look
like this, VO,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
VI.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And IDS for the dependent
source was given by K/2

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
(VI-VT)^2.
So this was an amplifier.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Here was the equivalent circuit
while this device was in

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
saturation.
And to operate in saturation,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I said that certain properties
need to be true for the MOSFET.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And there are two properties
that need to be true for this to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
be operating in saturation.
One is that its gate to source

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
voltage needs to be greater than
VT, so VGS for the MOSFET should

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
be greater than VT.
And the second one was that the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
output voltage needed to be
greater than the input voltage

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
minus one threshold drop.
And this was the same as VDS

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
for the MOSFET,
this was the same as VGS for

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the MOSFET.
So what are we really saying

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
here?
What we are saying is that

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
look, we built this circuit
using a MOSFET,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and it is up to us as engineers
to choose its operating points

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
in a way that these two
properties hold.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
For example,
to make the first condition

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
true, I can discipline myself to
operate such that VI is always

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
greater than VT.
Similarly, I can choose VS,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
RL and VI in a way that this
condition is true,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
which says that the drain to
source voltage across my MOSFET

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
drain and source should be
greater than VI minus VT.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
As an example,
if VI was 2 volts and VT was,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
say, 1 volt,
then what I am saying is that

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000
VO should be greater than or
equal to 2 minus 1 or 1 volt.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So I need to keep this high,
2, 3, 4, 5, whatever,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
a high voltage so that this guy
stays in saturation.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The relevant readings for the
material that we are going to

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
cover in the course notes are in
7.5.1 and 7.6.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So that is pretty much a review
of where we were.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We said we could build an
amplifier.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Its equivalent circuit was
shown on the right.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And, provided that,
I discipline myself to operate

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
in the saturation region or to
have the MOSFET operating in the

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
saturation region,
then this would work like an

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
amplifier and all would be good
with the world.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So today --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
-- we look at large signal
analysis of a circuit.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And an example would be this
circuit up here containing a

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
MOSFET.
And, again, as I mentioned

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
earlier, a large signal analysis
is a loaded term in 6.002,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
or for that matter in circuits.
And large signal analysis

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
involves two steps.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The first step involves writing
down the transfer function of

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
your little circuit.
In our case,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
VO is the output,
VI is the input,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
so involves writing down VO
versus VI.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Simply write down the transfer
function.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
In other words,
the relationship between the

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
output and the input for that
circuit.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And, in our case,
again, we've disciplined

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
ourselves to adhere to the
"saturation discipline".

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And the second part of large
signal analysis is to find out

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
the valid input operating range.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Find out for the given circuit
parameters, let's say I apply a

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
VS and I use some value of RL
and I use a given MOSFET,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
which has a given value of VT.
The question then is that what

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is a valid set of input voltages
that would operate the circuit

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
in a way that I would be in
saturation.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And so find out the valid input
range, and this would give me a

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
corresponding output range --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
-- for saturation operation of
the MOSFET.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
That is what we will dwell on
in the lecture today.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So what we are saying here is
that if I am careful with how I

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
apply VI for a given value of RL
and VS and for a given choice of

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
my MOS transistor then I can
stay within saturation provided

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I select my input voltages
carefully.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And the analysis that we will
go through today will figure out

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
what that range of input
voltages is.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And, again, I will use this as
a motivating example,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
the MOSFET amplifier.
But in general large signal

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
analysis would apply to any
other circuit as well.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
For example,
in recitation you may learn

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
about other circuits containing
a MOSFET.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And you can do a large signal
analysis of other circuits

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
containing a MOSFET or you might
learn about some other devices

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
like the bipolar junction
transistor, and you could do the

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
same kind of analysis for that
device.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So remember that the MOSFET
amplifier here is an example.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I will be using that as a
driving example to explain large

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
signal analysis.
So the first step,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
as I mentioned earlier,
is to get the VO versus VI.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And in general for some circuit
that you build the output will

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
not even be a voltage.
There are certain circuits

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
where the output might be some
kind of a current.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Let's say I am building some
kind of a circuit where I would

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
like the output current or the
current through some edge of the

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
circuit to depend on some input.
In that case the transfer

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
function would be the output
current versus VI.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And if I had an input current
here it would be output current

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
versus input current,
you know, whatever the given

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
problem tells you.
So this is under the saturation

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
discipline.
And I will not rederive this

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
for you.
You can apply a good old

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
technique like the analytical
method.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Or you can use the graphical
method to get the appropriate

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
answer here.
I wanted to point out in a

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
quick aside that why do we care
about graphical analysis?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Once you have the analytical
method, why do you care about

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
the graphical method?
And a student asked me a

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
question after lecture last
Thursday, and it occurred to me

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
that it's not obvious why you
need the graphical method.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So it turns out that often
times you do not have an

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
equation describing the device.
So let's say,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
for example,
I am a manufacturer.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Let's say I am AMD.
As AMD I sit down and my

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
semiconductor division builds a
MOSFET.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And when you build a MOSFET
your experiments and your

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
fabrication division often times
doesn't give you an equation

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
with the MOSFET.
They build something and then

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
you look at it and you
experiment with it.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
You apply various input
voltages and you measure

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
currents and output voltages and
so on.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And so what you end up getting
is a graph that describes the

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
behavior of the MOSFET.
And you have seen this in your

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
lab as well, your 2N7000 or was
it 2000?

01:56:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
So your 2N7000,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the MOSFET you use in the lab
also gives you a data sheet.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And in that data sheet you see
a bunch of curves.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So very often devices come with
data sheets.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And when you have a data sheet
but no equation then you can

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
apply the graphical method and
solve your circuits.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
In this example,
assuming I can apply the

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
analytical method,
here was the expression that I

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
had derived for you in the last
lecture.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So VO was related to VI using
the square law relationship.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And we can plot and do other
fun stuff with this equation.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So here is the input voltage
VI.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
That is my VT.
So notice that VO is VS.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
This is true when VI greater
than or equal to VT and VO

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
greater than or equal to VI
minus VT.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So these are the constraints of
the saturation discipline.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And in our particular situation
when VI was less than VT output

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
would simply be VS.
If VI is less than VT the

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
MOSFET would turn off,
switch off, and I would have no

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
current flowing through RL,
and VS would appear at the

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
output.
So until VT,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I have VS, and then following
that I get the square law

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
behavior articulated by this
equation.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And this was simply VS-K/2
(VI-VT)(RL^2).

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So that's the first part.
You have seen this before.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
The transfer function shows
that I have a square law

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000
dependence between VI and VO.
So now I can embark on the

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000
second step of my large signal
analysis, and my goal is to find

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000
the valid input operating range.
So what does that mean?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
What I am looking to do here
is, for this little circuit,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
is drain, source,
gate, VI, VO,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
RL and VS.
What I am looking to do is that

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
given the value of the supply
VS, RL and a MOSFET,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
in our case given a MOSFET
implies that it is a given value

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000
of K and a given value of VT for
that MOSFET.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So what I am going to do is
find out, let's assume VI is my

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
free variable here.
So my goal will be to find out

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
the range of VI for which this
device stays in saturation.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And I will use a couple of
methods to do that,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and I will use both a
combination of a graphical

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
method to give you intuition and
then apply analytical analysis

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
to get down to specific answers.
So let's start with the

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
intuitive part.
So here is VI,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
VO.
I will use the transfer curve

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
VO versus VI to help build
intuition here.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So that is what it looks like.
So the first step,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
looking at this graph,
we know that this point here,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
that VI needs to be greater
than VT to satisfy the first

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
equation.
Let me just write down both

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
equations here.
So VI greater than or equal to

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
VT is one of them,
and VO is greater than VI minus

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
VT is a second equation.
And just remember that this is

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
the same as VDS and this is the
same as VGS.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
So VI must be greater than VT
for the MOSFET to turn on.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And so therefore the valid
operating range starts at this

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
point and is somewhere up here.
So the first part is pretty

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
easy.
Somewhere here --

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Somewhere at that point,
my output voltage VO.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I'm not quite sure what that
point is.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
My output voltage VO,
as this keeps falling down,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
my output voltage VO goes lower
than one threshold below VI.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And at that point it goes into
its triode region,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and I need to find out what
that point is.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
So somewhere here I go into my
triode region and begin to show

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
a different behavior than the
amplifying square law

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
relationship there and go into
my triode behavior.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
So I need to find out what this
point is.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Once I find out what that point
is then this will be my valid

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
operating range.
So let's figure out what that

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
point is.
At that point the following is

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
true.
Certainly VI is greater than

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
VT.
And at that point the output

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
goes below one threshold,
the input minus one threshold.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000
So at this point the following
is true, VO is equal to VI minus

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
VT.
At that point the output

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
voltage is equal to the input
minus VT.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And if the output goes lower
then it will violate this

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
equation here.
It is no longer greater than

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
that number.
So how do we find out what this

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
point is?
The principle intuition.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Let's draw some lines here.
Let's assume that VI and VT use

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
the same scale,
say, volts.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000
So if I draw a straight line at
45 degrees then that is a curve

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
representing VI equals VO.
We all know that.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
No big shakes.
So the line at 45 degrees here

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
is the line at which VI equal
VO.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
And if I take that line now,
the VI equals VO line,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
and I begin translating it to
the right.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
So let's take a line here.
Let's take a line there.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:33.000
That line will be simply equal
to VO equals VI minus VT.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I have translated that to the
right.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And so this line is simply VO
equals VI minus VT.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
So this line is a locus of
points at which VO is equal to

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
this value.
This minus VT shows up as a

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
translation to the right.
So I take my VO equals VI line,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
translate that to the right and
it becomes VO equals VI minus

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
VT.
Elementary geometry 101 or

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
whatever.
So what do we have here?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Above this we have the
condition VO greater than or

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:24.000
equal to VI minus VT,
and below that we have VO less

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.000
than VI minus VT.
If we look at this graph here,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
this is the valid input
operating range.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Starting at this point greater
than VT, and at this point my

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
output equals VO equals VI minus
VT.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
This must be the valid
operating range for the input

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
here to here.
And correspondingly the outputs

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
are from here to this point to
here like so.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
So this is my valid input
operating range and this is my

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
valid output operating range or
the corresponding valid output

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
operating range.
So what does this say?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
What this is saying is that if
I, as the designer of the

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
circuit, am disciplined enough
to apply inputs that are in this

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
range, VT to some value here,
graphically shown here.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Then my MOSFET will remain in
saturation.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And correspondingly my outputs
will go between VS and some

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
value here.
So hopefully that gives you

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
some of the intuition behind how
we get it.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And let's continue.
Let me label this point X.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
So continuing with two to get
the valid operating range.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I have shown you intuitively
where that point is,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
but what I will do next is
actually compute that for you.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
It is a pretty simple
computation.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Note that point X is the
intersection of two curves VO

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000
equals VI minus VT.
And the second curve is VO

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:44.000
equals VS minus K divide by 2,
VI minus V2 all squared RL.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.000
So the point X iss at the
intersection of these curves,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.000
and I can very easily get that
as follows.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.000
What I will do is I will simply
substitute for VI minus VT from

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
this equation here and then
solve for it,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000
so I get VO equals VS minus K
divide by 2 VO squared RL.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And so this gives me a
quadratic in VO.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
And I can solve for it pretty
easily.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And I get for a quadratic AX
squared plus BX plus C equals 0.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
The solution is given by VO is
minus B plus/minus square root

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
of B squared minus 4AC divided
by 2A.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And so I am just going to get
those numbers here.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
So the coefficient of VO,
that is B, is minus 1.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Take the positive root because
we are up in the positive

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
voltages here.
And square root of B squared,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:06.000
that is 1, minus 4AC.
So I get a plus 4 times K

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:17.000
divide by 2 RL.
And 2A is simply 2 times K

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:30.000
divided by 2 times RL.
So that is what I get.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
That gives me VO.
So it tells me that VO,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000
at the point where the output
just equals one threshold drop

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000
below VI is given by the other
circuit perimeter such as VS,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
RL and so on.
Oh, I am missing a VS here.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
I just forgot the VS up here.
That is my VO.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:12.000
So what is VI equal to?
Remember that at this point VO

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:22.000
equals VI minus VT,
so VI is simply VT plus --

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I have not taught you anything
earth shattering here.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I have just done some grubby
math here to solve these two

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
equations.
So this is a straight line at

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
45 degrees from VT and this is
the transfer function.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
And I need to find the
intersection.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
And the intersection is given
by this point.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
So that point,
VI being VT plus something,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
is simply the second dot on the
X axis.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
So therefore I am pretty much
done.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000
My valid input range for VI
goes from VT.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
So it starts at VT.
That is where the transistor

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
just turns on.
And then goes all the way to

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000
this point, VT plus minus 1 plus
square root of 1 plus 2 K RL VS

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
K RL.
So this is my valid operating

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
range.
And again remember I won't

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
dwell on this equation because,
in some sense,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
you will get a different set of
limits for other devices,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
for other circuits containing a
MOSFET.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Or, for that matter,
for other outputs that one may

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
be focusing on.
So what is more important here

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
is not so much the results that
you see but the process that I

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
have gone through.
So what is more important here

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
is how did I get here?
And the way I got here was

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
looked at the graph and said
look, the MOSFET is in

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
saturation in that regime.
And I am finding the bounding

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
points of the regime of
saturation operation.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
So now, as an engineer,
I can say that hey,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
look, if you build a MOSFET
circuit like so,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
with a given value of RL,
a given MOSFET and a given VS,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
then if you limit yourself you
are operating with input

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
voltages in this range thou
shalt be happy.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
If you go beyond that range
then you will be violating the

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
saturation discipline.
So the corresponding output

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
range --

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
I can write the corresponding
output range,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
and that goes from VS,
when the input is at VT the

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.000
output is at VS and goes from VS
down to the input minus VT.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Which is simply minus 1 plus --

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Let me go back and quickly show
you a little MOSFET circuit,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
amplified circuit so you can
stare at a real transfer curve

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
yourselves.
And indeed convince yourselves

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
that roughly at the point where
proportionately shown in the

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:17.000
curve up there the MOSFET indeed
goes into its triode region and

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
begins heading out of its
saturation region.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Notice that here that is the
same curve, the transfer

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
function.
And the amplified output is at

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
VS until input reaches a
threshold voltage VT.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And once input goes beyond VT
the output begins to drop

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
precipitously.
And at some point here this

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
begins to go into its triode
region.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
And what I am going to do is
simply increase the input

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
voltage VI, and you will see
that the output them begins to

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
go into its triode region.
It keeps dropping.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And, as you can see,
the output begins to go into a

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
space where the gain is no
longer more than 1.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And this is a triode region of
MOSFET operation.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:29.000
So the MOSFET is in saturation,
things are going great.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
As I increase my VI notice at
some point I begin to go out of

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
my saturation region of the
MOSFET.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And somewhere here I go from
the saturation region and

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
transition into the triode
region.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
And this value shown here gives
you the corresponding input

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000
voltage and the output voltage.
Other practical devices like

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
bipolar junction transistors or
MOSFETs and other circuits and

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
so on can be subjected to a
similar analysis.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And you can find out the valid
operating regions for that

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
device as well,
or for that circuit.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
So as a next step what I would
like to do --

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Out here I began by looking at
the transfer function,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
the VO versus VI curve,
and used that to drive the

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
intuition behind how we
calculated the bounding regions.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
You can do the same kind of
analysis intuitively looking at

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
yet another curve,
another set of graphs that you

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
are familiar with,
and that is a load line

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
characteristic.
And it is interesting to get

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
two interpretations.
And you can use whichever one

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
you feel comfortable with.
So I will do two alternatively

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
and show you another set of
curves that you can use to get

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
that.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Here I am going to plot IDS
versus VDS, which is the same as

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
VO.
This was the load line graph

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
that we had seen earlier.
And, just for our reference,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
remember that VI must be
greater than VT for saturation

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
operation.
Similarly VO should be greater

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
than or equal to VI minus VT for
saturation operation.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Those are my limits.
The way we got the load line

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
graph was we superimposed the
load line equation over the

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
device characteristics.
And so let me plot the device

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
characteristics in the
saturation region.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Remember that this constraint
could be related to the current

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
as I derived for you in the last
lecture as follows.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
IDS being less than or equal to
K divided by 2 VO squared.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
So in terms of my IDS versus
VDS relation,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
this lateral constraint is
equivalent to IDS being less

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000
than K by 2 VO squared.
So this is that equation.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
So this line is IDS equals K by
2 VO squared.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.000
And in this region I have the
valid operating region where IDS

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:56.000
is less than that quality.
So here are all my other curves

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
for various values VGS.
So here are my devices curves,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
IDS versus VDS.
Remember that these curves come

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
down like this,
for the MOSFET,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
right?
Just that we focus on the

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
right-hand side because that is
where the MOSFET is in

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
saturation.
And on this side the MOSFET is

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
in its triode region,
and we discipline ourselves not

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
to operate the MOSFET such that
it is in its triode region.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
So those were the device
characteristics.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
And then I could plot my load
line equation.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
My load line equation,
if you recall,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
was IDS = VS/RL - VO/RL.
This was simply obtained by

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
writing KVL at the loop
containing the output node and

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
the supply VS.
Notice there that VO is equal

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:06.000
to VS minus IDS times RL.
And that is simply by dividing

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
by RL on both sides and moving
IDS to the left-hand side we get

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
this equation.
And this equation gives rise to

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
a curve that looks like this.
And what is this point here?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
This point is where VO is 0.
So when VO is 0 my IDS is

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
simply VS divided by RL.
And this point is obtained when

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
IDS is 0.
And under those conditions VS

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
and VO are equal so this is VS.
This is my saturation region

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.000
and this is the triode region.
This was another interesting

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
graph.
We often times fondly call it

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
the load line graph.
So here is a load line

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
superimposed on the MOSFET
device IDS versus VDS curves for

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
a variety of values of VGS.
So by looking at this curve,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
we can also intuitively
determine the valid operating

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
range.
So what are the two points

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
here?
I will let you stare at it for

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
a couple of seconds yourselves
to figure out what two points

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
here bound the valid operating
range of the MOSFET,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
the valid operating range of
the circuit.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
I will start.
One is this point,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000
because at this point the
output is VS and VGS has just

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
begun to equal VT.
So think about where the second

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
point is for valid operation.
It is here, and,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000
somewhere along that load line.
Remember the load line is a

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
constraint that must be met by
the output VO.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
It is the constraint imposed by
KVL on the output.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
So the output is constrained to
operate in this regime for

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
various values of VGS.
So as the output keeps going

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
from here all the way here,
at some point I exit my

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
saturation region.
And that other point is given

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
by this one.
So notice that this is the

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
curve that bounds.
On the left-hand side of this

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
the MOSFET is no longer in
saturation.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
It is on the right-hand side,
and so therefore this is the

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
valid operating region.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Here to here.
This is good.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
This is VS.
That is good to know.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:17.000
And for this point I know that
VI, which is VGS,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
equals VT.
I know VO is equal to VS.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000
And IDS, at this point,
is 0.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.000
So VO and IDS being VS and 0
correspondingly are the output

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
operating perimeters when VI
equals VD.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
So that is one point.
And let's find out what this

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
point is.
At that point I get my output

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:03.000
just entering the range of the
MOSFET triode region operation.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Notice that this point is the
intersection of two curves,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
this line and this curve.
So this curve here is given by

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
IDS equals K divided by 2 VO
squared.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
And this is my load line
equation.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000
So that is VS divided by RL
minus VO divided by RL.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
That's it.
So I won't go ahead and solve

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
that for you.
You can go and check it out and

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
convince yourselves that if you
solve these two equations and

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
find out the VO for this,
it should be the same VO that

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
you obtained using the other
graph.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
What I have done here,
obtaining the valid regions of

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
operation is no different from
what I did here.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
The two are alternative
approaches to getting to the

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
same place.
Just that over the years what I

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
have discovered is that there
are one class of people that are

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
output transfer function people,
this graph, and another set of

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
people that are load line people
that like to think that way.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
I have always been a transfer
function person myself,

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
but some of you may be load
line people and so you can use

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
that to drive your intuition.
It is pretty amazing.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
As we get into this business
and keep going down the path,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
it is amazing how some people
really kind of get the load line

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
thing and others feel much more
comfortable with the transfer

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
function.
So pick whatever you want.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
So what we have so far is we
have conducted a large signal

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
analysis of a MOSFET amplifier.
It is an analysis of a circuit,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
and we found two things.
One is the transfer function

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
under saturation operation,
and we found the valid input

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
operating ranges and the
corresponding valid output

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
operating ranges for the
circuit.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
In the last five or six minutes
let me talk about a couple of

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
other issues.
And the first issue is what we

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
have done so far is intuitively
and mathematically shown you

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
what the valid regions are.
Now you are thinking that's

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
fine, but how do I get there?
This region is good,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
VT through that other point,
that's good,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
but how do I get there?
How do I make my amplifier

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
operate in that region?
The answer is pretty simple,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
and let me drive the intuition
again using a graph.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
So this is a graph.
And I showed you that --

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
That was my valid region here.
Take a 45 degree line,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
find out where it intersects
the transfer function,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
then this is the valid region
here, VT through that

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
coordinating function that we
developed out there.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:45.000
If I have an input that looks
like so, some input whose

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:54.000
gyrations fall within this
range, will constantly keep the

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.000
MOSFET in saturation.
And the corresponding output

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
will look like this.
If my input is in this range,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
my output will be within this
range.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
And how do I get my input to be
here?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Let's say I have a sinusoid
that is 1 volt peak to peak or

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
whatever.
How do I get my sinusoid up

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
there?
Well, you have learned the

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
trick on how to boost things.
Remember boost?

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
All you have to do is boost up
your signal by some value

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
capital VI.
And the way you do that is as

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
follows.
VS, RL, VO.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000
What you do is you apply a DC
offset to your input.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000
You take your sinusoid and
boost it up so that all the

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:04.000
gyrations of the input are in
the valid range.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
This is my input,
some VA.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Then I apply some DC offset
capital VI given by this value

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
here.
And boost up the interesting

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
input?
My interesting input is the VA.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.000
And I boost it up by capital VI
so that this guy is always in

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
saturation.
I would like to show you a

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
little demo now.
I am going to show you an input

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
that is a triangular wave.
And what we will do is I'll

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
play with a wide variety of
offset voltages.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000
This guy is a triangular wave.
And what I am going to do is

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
apply a triangular wave and
we'll look at the output and

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
convince ourselves that I get
amplification when VI is big

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
enough that the input goes into
a valid operating range.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
And we will look at a variety
of ranges here.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
You can put it a little larger.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
OK.
So the triangular wave is my

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
input.
And this is my output.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
This looks nothing like a
triangular wave.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
And the reason is that I do not
have the right offset.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
So what I will do is gradually
increase the offset on the

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
MOSFET.
So at this point the offset is

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
very low, a very small near zero
offset.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
And so therefore my output is a
disaster.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
My MOSFET is not in saturation
all the time.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
So what I will do here is apply
some sort of offset.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Is this the one?
We want to switch.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
This is the input.
You can see I am applying an

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000
offset by bumping and boosting
up the input.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
I don't have clipping happening
at both ends,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
but I get something.
And I get amplification.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Now let me apply way too much
of an offset.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
With this offset I am kind of
operating here.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
What I will do now is apply an
even higher offset so that this

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
triangular wave begins to move
here.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
If I apply a very high offset
what I am doing is overdriving

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
the amplifier,
boosting it so high that the

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
MOSFET is going to go into its
triode region and you are going

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
to see that I won't have any
gain.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
My output is going to shrink
noticeably if I overdrive the

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
input.
You will notice the input going

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
higher and higher.
Pull the trigger point down.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
There you go.
Notice that as I boost up my

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000
input even higher notice that
the output is a really small

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000
image of what the right input
should be.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
The right answer here,
of course, is that I apply some

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
right amount of offset to boost
up the input into the right

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
regime so that the output is
seen to be some amplified

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
version of this input.
So I showed you three things.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
One is very little offset.
That was like so,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
as the thing comes down.
A very high offset,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
it gets killed again.
And the right amount of offset.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000
But notice that we still have a
problem, even with the right

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
offset.
The output is not linearly

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
related to the input.
It is nonlinear.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000
And the answer to get a linear
response is good old small

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
signal stuff.
And we will be looking at the

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
small signal part in the next
lecture.

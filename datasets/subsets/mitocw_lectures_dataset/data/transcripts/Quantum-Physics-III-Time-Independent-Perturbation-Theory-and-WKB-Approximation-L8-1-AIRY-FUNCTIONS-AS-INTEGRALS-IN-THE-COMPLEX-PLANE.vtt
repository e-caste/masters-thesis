WEBVTT

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.260
PROFESSOR: We're going to
complete our study of WKB

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.270
today.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.140
There's a lot of important
things we haven't said yet.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.410
And in particular,
we have not explained

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.480
how it all works, really, in
the sense of the connection

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.890
formulas.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.490
That's the most non-trivial
part of the WKB story.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.940
And in some ways it's some of
the most interesting things

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.220
that you have to
learn from this.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.020
It's an opportunity to learn
something about differential

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.580
equation, Fourier
transforms, and the limits

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.875
of the quantities you
can really compute.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.150
So we will begin our discussion
with some reconsideration

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.790
of these Airy functions.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.330
You've started to
hear about, probably

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.019
some in the homework,
some in recitation.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:17.500
So this relates to this
person, George Biddle

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.970
Airy from the Airy
functions, who

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.780
lived in England for 90 years.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.720
He was the seventh
Royal Astronomer.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.930
And he was an astronomer
from 1835 to 1881.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.520
Was located, his work
area, in Greenwich.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.415
It's a little bit
outside of London.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.860
And that's where astronomers
were working hard

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.210
to establish all the data
associated with the Prime

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.490
Meridian.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.050
France also tried to make the
their own meridian the most

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.850
important one.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.660
But at the end of
the day, it all

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.630
depended of which
astronomers did

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.780
the most work in measuring
precise, accurate determination

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.400
of times, motion of the
moon, Jupiter's satellites,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.570
all kinds of things that were
pretty important at that time,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.130
especially also
the manufacturing

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.150
of good telescopes
and good clocks.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.550
So Mr. Airy also
worked in optics.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.630
And that's where he discovered
these functions we're studying.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.170
And they're very relevant
to the WKB approximation.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.550
So let me remind you a
little of what you've

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.570
been considering in the homework
and extend some of those ideas

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.180
as well.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:10.260
So you considered a differential
equation, d 2nd PSI du

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.900
squared equal u PSI.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.540
Pretty innocent looking
differential equation.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.890
I'm always surprised how a
differential equation that

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.250
looks so simple can
be so intricate.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.280
But anyway, it is.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.310
And that's the Airy equation.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.390
And it shows up for this problem
that you have, for example,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.400
an infinite wall and a
potential goes up like that.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.060
The bound states are controlled
by solutions of this equation

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.270
at the end of the day.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.770
This is after you clean up all
the units and do all the work.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.040
But it shows in
other places as well.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.600
And you probably found already
that this PSI function, PSI

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.180
of u, is given as a constant
times an integral that

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.320
came from Fourier
transformations of e

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.959
to the ik cubed
over 3 e to the iku.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.190
And so this is our integral.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.080
This is our solution
of this equation.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.450
And the nice thing is that
this integral tells you

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.030
a lot about the function.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.230
It's a perfectly nice
definition of the function.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.730
You may have
noticed, and I think

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.280
it was discussed to some
degree in recitation

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.450
as well, that the Fourier
transform converts

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.080
this equation to first
order differential equation.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.190
Because this becomes
p squared times PSI.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.610
Well, you know from
Schrodinger equations

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.290
this part of the differential
equation comes from p squared.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.980
On the other hand,
multiplication by x

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.050
is the same as dvp
in Fourier space.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.830
Therefore, you get
the dvp of PSI equal p

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.840
squared PSI equation.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.690
And that equation is a first
order differential equation.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.100
First order differential
equations have one solution.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.880
So you would say, OK, I tried
to do this by Fourier transform,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.290
and I'm getting just
half of the solutions.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.560
And that's true.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.300
The reason is that the other
solution of this differential

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.720
equation doesn't quite
have a Fourier transform,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.170
so it's a little more
difficult to get at.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:09.160
But once you think
of this integral,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.850
it is kind of useful to try
to be a little more general

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.001
and think of it in terms of the
complex plane, the complex k

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:17.500
plane.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.760
So here is the k plane.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.040
And this integral is over k
from minus infinity to infinity.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.190
So this is the standard
countour of integration.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.110
We can call it the countour c1.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.610
When you're doing this
integral, and you're

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.350
doing this in the
complex plane you

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:58.810
may want to consider that
if you go off the real line,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.200
maybe things are even better.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.530
In particular, as
you're integrating

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.310
u is a fixed number,
it's a fixed coordinate.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.650
We usually think of u
as real, but we could

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.500
think of u as complex as well.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.000
And this integral
has these factories.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.260
It's an oscillatory factor
that becomes faster and faster

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.320
oscillating in time.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.050
But the magnitude of the
integrand is 1 at every place.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.740
It oscillates very fast,
but the magnitude is 1.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.750
Not the best situation possible.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.510
You know?

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.520
When you're doing
an integral, you

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.180
have the feeling
that eventually you

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.720
get 0 because it's
oscillating so fast.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.970
But it would be nicer
if you had a decay.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:00.610
So for that, consider
that this function

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:15.610
would be k if k, if the
imaginary part of k cube,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:22.770
is positive, the ky.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:27.540
If the imaginary part of k cube
is positive, you have a k cube

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.289
would be i times a positive
number. i items i is minus 1,

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.010
so you get the
suppression factor,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:40.280
if the imaginary part
of k cube is positive.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.370
So if you're integrating
over a region

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.870
where the imaginary part
of k cube is positive,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.390
you will be in good shape.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:58.700
Now, if you think of k
as a complex number, e

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:09.020
to the i theta k, k
cube would be this.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:26.750
An imaginary part of k
cube is positive requires

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:39.740
that this angle 3i theta
k be between pi and 0.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.240
Why?

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.840
Because if you have a complex
number, any complex number,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.930
its imaginary part is positive
if the argument of that angle

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.610
goes between 0 and pi.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.310
Moreover, if you get
an imaginary part

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:11.450
positive for some angle
theta k, if m of k cube

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:20.700
is positive for some
theta k, it is also

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:29.130
positive for theta
k plus 2pi over 3.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.710
Because if you add 2
pi over 3 to theta k,

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.230
you change this by 2pi.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.420
And therefore, the
exponential doesn't change.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.550
From this inequality, I'm sorry,
I have an i too many here.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.560
The imaginary part
of this requires

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.490
that the argument of
this be between 0 and pi,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:11:01.400
or theta k between
pi over 3 and 0.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.700
So actually, here, I
should draw 0 to pi over 3.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.015
This is at 60 degrees.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.680
And that's the region
in k space where

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.600
the integral is suppressed.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:35.680
Now, we also said that
this region is unchanged

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.230
if you add 2pi over 3.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:48.340
So if I add 2pi over 3, that's
precisely 1/3 of a turn.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.990
This is 30 degrees.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.870
It goes this area into this.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.770
And finally, if I add,
again, 2pi over 3,

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:12.080
it goes into 30, 30,
30, and to this region.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.700
I guess the sign of nuclear
material, hazardous materials

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.450
or something that.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.510
It's not hazardous
to our health.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.970
We'll survive this lecture.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.250
So what's happening
here actually

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.560
is something quite interesting.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:49.810
For example, you're
doing this integral here.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.700
If you started
doing this integral,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.760
once you are far, far
away, you start going up,

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.880
the integral over here
is going to give nothing,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.490
because you're very far away.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.500
And therefore,
you're in the region

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.410
of absolute exponential
suppression.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.667
We said this thing has a
positive imaginary part.

00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:17.250
And therefore, you
have a suppression.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.550
It's k cubed, so
it's becoming like e

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.860
to the minus radius cubed.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.180
It's killed.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.110
So it's no problem to go up
here, and you get nothing.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.240
So what it means is
that actually there's

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.720
no singularities in
the integrand either.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.300
This integral that
we've done here

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.210
could have been done over
this contour like that.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.930
And then you could
have gone like that.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.050
You could do it in Mathematica.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.240
The answer will be the same.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.980
Or you could have
gone like that.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.140
Or you could have
gone here like this,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.040
also you're
suppressed over here.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.150
And you're suppressed over here.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.940
And actually, by contouring
the formation, you could

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.460
instead of doing
this in theory, you

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.610
could have come here
and gone up like that.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.700
And done that.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.570
That also would have been the
same result. There's nothing,

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.810
the integrand is analytic here.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.310
So this you can push it
down and nothing goes wrong.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.745
Or you could have done even
this integral like that.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.520
Because the integral here is
0 and the integral here is 0,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.442
so you can bring them down.

00:14:35.442 --> 00:14:37.980
In fact, if you
did this, I think,

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.710
with Mathematica,
Mathematica when

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.430
you try to do this
integral, kind of does it.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.050
But it complains a little.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.120
It's worried that,
you know, it's

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.021
not getting the answer right
because the integrand is still

00:14:53.021 --> 00:14:53.520
big.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.890
It's oscillating very
fast, but it's big.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:59.930
If you go here, I think
Mathematica will complain less

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.110
and will give you
the same answer.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.800
So this is the power
of complex analysis

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.740
that allows you to do this
integral in all kinds of ways.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.490
And there is something even
more important about this

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.520
that I will explain
in the notes,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.475
but I can convey the idea here.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:30.030
When you prove that
this is a solution,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.050
and when you went
to Fourier space,

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.600
you had to do an
integration by parts.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.020
And an integration by
parts is always dangerous.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:46.400
And if you're trying to find a
true solution of your problem,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.625
you have to make sure it works.

00:15:48.625 --> 00:15:54.890
P, the operator P, is
supposed to be her mission.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.990
And here what happens is
that you turn this into dvp.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.700
And you have to fall
back this factor.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.770
And here is where this
discussion is very relevant.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:14.050
Because when you fold out this
factor, you have to integrate.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.090
You couldn't get contributions
from the boundary.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.590
And you have to make sure
those contributions are 0.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.710
Otherwise, you're not solving
the differential equation

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:24.460
really.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.280
And the happy thing
about these contours,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.920
and now that you
understand these regions,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.620
is that, yes, the
boundary contributions

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.740
are going to be 0 from
the two sides because

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.985
of this suppression factor.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:47.560
So this analysis actually turns
it into a rigorous analysis.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.370
And the part that has
to do with the boundary

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.930
conditions, the fact that the
operations that you're doing

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.720
are illegal when you try
to solve the differential

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.520
equation, require--

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:07.480
this is the details that
I will not derive now--

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:16.390
require precisely that e to the
i k cubed over 3 e to the iku

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:28.020
vanish at the ends of
the countour gamma that

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.440
you're using to
solve the problem.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.950
So if you're in the
wave from here to here,

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.100
it should vanish at this
end and at that end.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.560
Rigorously speaking,
this thing only

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.760
vanishes if you're
a little bit up.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.570
But this is what you really
need for the equation

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.374
to be a solution.

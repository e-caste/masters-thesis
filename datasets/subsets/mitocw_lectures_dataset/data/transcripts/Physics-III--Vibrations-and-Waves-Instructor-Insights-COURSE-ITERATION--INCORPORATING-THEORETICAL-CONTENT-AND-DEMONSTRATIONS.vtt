YEN-JIE LEE: I
have been teaching

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.340
8.03 for more than
three years already.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.650
So I was given a charge
to change the course

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.960
to make it even better than what
was actually done previously

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.810
in previous years.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.190
And we actually made
a lot of adjustment

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.480
during this few years
with many other professors

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.490
in the physics department.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.870
So what we actually did
is to change the textbook.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.040
The textbook is actually now
much more theoretical-oriented

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.450
so that we benefit from
that for the preparation

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.510
for the other courses, like
8.04, which is actually

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.880
the quantum physics and also the
other courses which are related

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.340
to waves and vibration.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.300
The benefit is the following.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.580
So the students who are
equipped with more mathematics

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.930
background will also finding it
much more interesting compared

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.290
to previous years because
in the previous years,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.020
we are mainly focusing on very
practical, problem-solving.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.550
Introducing a more
theoretical-orientated content,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.110
that can help us to
systematically understand

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.030
single oscillator,
coupled oscillator,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.990
infinite number of
coupled oscillator

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.840
to where continuous
and infinitely coupled

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.550
system in the very,
very well-defined

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.590
theoretical framework.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.250
And finally, I
think what we really

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.220
did is to introduce a lot
of demos, much more demos,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.990
actually, than previous years
so that it goes with the lecture

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.110
so that people can actually
look at those demos

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.410
and compare to our
theoretical calculations.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.150
And I think that is actually
evolving as a function of time,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.510
and we were adding
or subtracting

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.240
the demos, which we think
is more useful or less

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.950
useful during the semester.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.716
And that is actually what you
see now in the 2016 version.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.440
DENNIS FREEMAN: Hello, welcome.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.030
So as you might expect, there
is yet another announcement.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.990
So this time, Exam 3, the last
of the midterms, same rules--

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.120
everything is roughly the same.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.300
Walker, next Wednesday,
7:30 to 9:30.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.010
No recitations on
the day of the exam.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.880
Coverage through Lecture 18,
which is next lecture, coverage

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.150
through Recitation 16--

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.890
that's tomorrow--
homeworks 1 to 10.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.300
Homework 10 won't be graded--

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.410
there will be solutions posted.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.240
3 pages, your old 2 plus 1.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.680
No calculators, blah, blah,
blah-- same as last time.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.190
Designed to be one
hour, two hours

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.320
to complete-- same as last time.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.450
There'll be a review session--

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.171
there'll be one on
Monday at 3 PM in 36-112

00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:23.170
and, of course, you can
ask any review questions

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.480
you'd like at any of
the open office hours,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.960
but there'll be a formal review
in 36-112 on Monday at 3:00.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.850
Prior term exams have
already been posted

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.620
and if you have a
conflict, please tell me

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.640
because I have to find
rooms and a proctor.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.780
OK, questions, comments--
completely routine

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.920
at this point, right?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.770
No problems-- everybody
knows what they're doing?

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.606
It'll be fun, it'll
be enjoyable--

00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:51.105
smile.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630
Questions, comments?

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.350
OK, so what I want to talk today
about is DT, signal-processing.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.120
So formerly, I'm going to talk
about things like DT Fourier

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.690
series.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.530
Next time we'll talk about
DT Fourier Transform,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.300
but the context for that--
the reason we do this--

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.540
is because the discrete
time approaches are so

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.430
useful for processing signals.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.740
And I want to motivate
that by thinking

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.510
about how signal processing
has been viewed historically.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.790
For over the past
20 or 30 years,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.410
there's been enormous
interest in signal processing

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.760
and most of that interest
evolved out of CT applications

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.800
that we wanted to make better.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.836
We wanted to make our
radio reception better,

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:44.710
we wanted to make
telephone reception better,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.922
we wanted to make
hi-fis work better,

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:48.630
we wanted to make
television work better,

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.600
photography, x-rays,
blah, blah, blah.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.220
There were lots
of reasons why we

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.780
wanted to be able to
alter the signals that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.620
were available to us.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.140
So for example, in radio--

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.020
how do you alter the signal
so as to reduce static?

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:08.860
In the early radios,
there was a big problem

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.120
with automatic gain control.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.180
So as you went over
the hills, the line

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.520
of sight to the
radio station changed

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.505
and that changed the gain
so there was an interest

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:20.170
in controlling gain.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.630
So there were lots
of applications

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.610
where we wanted to account for
deficiencies in the hardware

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.860
and that gave rise to the
notion of signal processing.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.360
Those signal
processing applications

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.370
were largely in continuous
time, because the signals were

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.500
largely in continuous time--

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.780
all that's changed.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.580
Now when you say
signal processing,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.840
you're almost always
mean discrete.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.473
And there's a very
good reason for it

00:03:47.473 --> 00:03:49.260
and it's digital electronics.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.720
Digital electronics
are very inexpensive

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.030
and they work very well.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.920
I want to give just one
example chosen from my history.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.540
So like most teenage people--

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.000
I was teenage once, right?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.330
It was a long time ago,
but I was one once.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.840
And like most teenage
types, even then

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.360
we got afflicted
with the audio hi-fi

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.010
listen to music virus problem.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.260
The good news is I recovered--

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.640
I'm fully functional,
it's gone, right?

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.250
So you have every reason to
think that you'll recover,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.960
but that was a problem.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.970
I was interested in hi-fi
and that was a hard problem.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.789
So if you think about how do
you make a speaker system,

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.330
one of the problems
that you get when

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.070
you try to design
a speaker system

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.761
is reproducing low frequencies.

00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:46.260
And my guess is that you're as
interested in low frequencies

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.772
as we were back then.

00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:49.230
The problem with
low frequencies is

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.100
that if you have just
a speaker, the speaker

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.090
has an electromagnet.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.610
The electromagnet moves so
that it pushes the cone.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.080
The cone pushes air this way,
but if cone is coming out,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.130
it also pulls air that way.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.880
So that's a problem because
that means it can do that

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.984
and the person who is
over here hears nothing.

00:05:14.984 --> 00:05:17.150
That's especially bad at
low frequencies for reasons

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.010
I won't go into because
the wavelengths are long,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.040
but that's the problem.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.330
So what do you do?

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.710
Well, you put it in a box.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.820
So instead of having
your speaker in space,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.790
you put the speaker in a box.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.710
Now when the cone
goes that way, the air

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.110
gets compressed
toward the person--

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.300
that's our second person.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.541
And now the air that goes
this way is constrained

00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:46.040
to the box, so it
doesn't interfere,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.180
but what's the new problem?

00:05:51.937 --> 00:05:53.770
So putting it in the
box solves one problem,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.103
but it introduces a new problem.

00:05:55.103 --> 00:05:57.606
What's the new problem?

00:05:57.606 --> 00:05:59.090
AUDIENCE: Box vibrates.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.820
DENNIS FREEMAN: The
box will vibrate--

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.570
even worse.

00:06:06.564 --> 00:06:07.730
AUDIENCE: Negative pressure.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.063
DENNIS FREEMAN: Native pressure.

00:06:09.063 --> 00:06:11.270
So how does that show up
as a performance problem?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.770
That's exactly right.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.800
What's the problem
that's generated

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.338
because of the negative
pressure in the box?

00:06:19.338 --> 00:06:20.282
Yes?

00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:22.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.040
DENNIS FREEMAN: So there's
something to do with gain--

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.060
that's exactly right.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.140
Because of the
negative pressure,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.550
what happens to
the speaker cone?

00:06:31.376 --> 00:06:32.670
AUDIENCE: Not be able to push.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.850
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Yes, it can't move--

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.750
you put a load on it.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.804
If in order to
come out, you have

00:06:39.804 --> 00:06:42.220
to generate negative pressure,
but the negative pressure's

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.240
going to pull it back in.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.110
So the problem is that you
put the speaker in the box,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.140
now you no longer have the short
circuit of the acoustic path.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.120
However, you've now
introduced a load,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.660
which makes the speaker
much harder to move.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.580
Everyone with me?

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.680
So the problem was you
put the speaker in the box

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.300
and now the speaker, which was
making a lot of air motion,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.330
makes very little air
motion because of the box.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.280
So what do you do next?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.320
Make the box big.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.330
OK, well that works for a while.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.120
Ideally if you were trying to
build a speaker for this room,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.870
you would make a box this size.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.030
Well, that's kind of
an architectural waste,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.250
so that's not really
the right solution.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.990
So here's an acoustic
solution that was very popular

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.510
when I was your age.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.670
So this is called a reflex port.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.730
So the idea is make
a hole in the box--

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.986
so if you make a
hole in the box,

00:07:46.986 --> 00:07:48.610
OK, now you're back
to the same problem

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.610
that if the speaker
comes out this way, then

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.930
it sucks air that way--

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.550
that's bad.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.464
So what you do instead
is you put a tube

00:07:57.464 --> 00:07:59.380
and if you make the
length of the tube exactly

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:06.010
the right size, there is
mass entrained in the tube.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:12.520
And then you have a system
where the air is springy,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.540
but there's mass in here and
you get a mass spring dashpot.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.390
So now when this is
going in and out,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.130
the air goes in and
out of this tube,

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.920
and if you adjust the
length of the tube

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.690
so you get the mass right, you
can get them going in phase.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.870
Anyone have a clue what
I just talked about?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:38.210
The idea was to use mass
spring dashpot resonance theory

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.120
to change the acoustics
of a speaker box

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.110
so you get more low
frequencies out.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.120
That was the way we thought
about speaker design back then.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.620
The speakers that I bought were
the Electric Voice Interface

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.800
A's, right?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.200
At that time, they
cost about $1,500,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.300
I was making $600 a month--

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.970
so times have changed slightly.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:03.400
So $1,500 was then a fortune,
but I had to have them, right?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.470
There was any question.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.590
And the way these worked
was like the reflex design.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.320
So in the reflex
design, we had the port

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.380
that was tuned so the mass
resonated against the stiffness

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.680
of the air.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.740
Here what you did--

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.920
this was not a speaker.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.660
This is the speaker--

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.554
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:26.554 --> 00:09:27.970
DENNIS FREEMAN:
--and the idea was

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.790
that you adjust the
mass and stiffness

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.414
of this big passive thing.

00:09:33.414 --> 00:09:35.080
There were no electrical
wires hooked up

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.200
to that thing-- that was
called a passive resonator.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.110
It was tuned so that when the
8-inch speaker up here was

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.580
trying to move, it would
move in resonance so that it

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.160
was out of phase with the
8-inch speaker up on the top

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.520
so they were both going
in and out the same time.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.110
Same idea as the reflex, but
you could get a bigger motion

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.120
from this passive
resonator than you

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.755
could with the acoustic reflex.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.420
So the next big advance
was by Amar Bose.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.120
Bose was here at
the time-- he was

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.000
a professor in
electroengineering at that time

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.920
and he invented the
Bose 901s, which

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.800
is something
everybody had to have.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.920
What Bose did that was
extraordinarily clever was

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.870
he used really
chintzy speakers--

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.705
CTS speakers, 4-inch diameter.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.560
They had absolutely crummy
frequency response--

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:45.120
flat up to a couple of hundred
Hertz and then their response

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.670
fell roughly with one pole--

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.250
so that by the time you get
out to the highest frequencies

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.830
that we can hear, the
response is greatly

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.810
attenuated-- like 40 decibels.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.600
40 decibels is a factor
of 100 in pressure.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.479
So the problem is
that these speakers

00:11:04.479 --> 00:11:06.020
had exactly the same
problems that we

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.154
had in the acoustic
reflex problem,

00:11:09.154 --> 00:11:10.320
except they were even worse.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.520
This was an 8-inch speaker,
this is a 4-inch speaker,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.520
so they were even worse.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.800
But what Bose did--

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.160
he took advantage
of electronics.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.520
He put an electronic
signal processing box

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:31.680
to put the inverse filter, so
the box preprocessed the sound

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.690
to boost the
frequencies that he knew

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.750
the speaker would attenuate.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.580
So this box was filled with
op-amps, gains, buffers--

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.650
all the kinds of
things you know about,

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.390
which were then just
barely available.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:50.400
That box cost $1,000 back
then because that was very

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.240
state-of-the-art.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.600
So the idea was that
he switched the problem

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.020
from being acoustics problem
to an electronics problem--

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.770
very clever.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.750
Today we go one more step and
we do the signal processing

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.640
digitally.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:16.450
So any modern stereo system has
a discrete time filter in it.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.680
The idea is that you take
the signal that's coming off

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.920
the source, like an MP3--

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.150
you take an MP3-type source,
you run it through a digital

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.940
filter--

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.740
this is a filter that works
on numbers, not on volts--

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.580
and so you convert the
source from the MP3

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.680
into a stream of
numbers that gets

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.485
crunched digitally, giving
rise to a different stream

00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:47.110
of numbers, which
you then convert back

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.860
into an analog signal.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.960
This is the approach you find
in every modern stereo system.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.620
The reason being that
it works so well.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.940
Here's a chip, the Texas
Instruments TAS3004,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.510
which was specifically
designed for car stereos.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.340
It's got amazing specs--

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.220
it has two channels,
state-of-the-art converting

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.870
rates, state-of-the-art
digitisation.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.870
It has a processor
internally that

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.920
runs at 100 mega
instructions per second.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.160
It implements all the common
things-- treble, volume,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.190
loudness, everything
you can imagine--

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:33.130
and it costs $9.63 off
Digi-Key in units of one.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:38.425
And if you buy units of
500, they are $5.20 apiece--

00:13:38.425 --> 00:13:42.400
a trivial amount of
money by any standard.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.570
So the idea then is that
it's just very effective

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.052
to do number-crunching
digitally.

00:13:49.052 --> 00:13:51.010
So that's where we want
to talk about-- we want

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.490
to talk about the same
kinds of Fourier transforms

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.330
and so forth that we've
talked about with CT signals,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.320
but we want to know
the new set of rules

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.846
that apply when the signals
are discrete in time.

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.060
OK, everybody with me?

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:15.290
So this is just a
little bit of review.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.480
You'll remember that we
started with discrete time,

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.030
we did examples in
discrete time when

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.254
we were thinking about feedback,
then we went on to the CT

00:14:24.254 --> 00:14:25.670
and thought about
feedback systems

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.310
and so forth, then
we did CT Fourier

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.600
because I think the Fourier
stuff is easier to see in CT.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.640
Now we're folding back to do DT.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.080
So it's been about six weeks
since we talked about DT,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.170
so a little bit of a refresher.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.690
We're going to be thinking about
frequency responses, right?

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.579
That was the basis of the
Fourier transform, that's

00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:49.370
going to be the basis
of the Fourier signal

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.660
processing in discrete time.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.990
And the idea of
frequency analysis

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.080
starts with the idea
of an eigenfunction.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.930
The eigenfunctions for
a discrete time system

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.700
are very similar to
the eigenfunctions

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.450
for a continuous time, but
they're different, right?

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.870
The eigenfunctions
for a CT system

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:14.050
are complex exponentials, e
to the st. Nod your head--

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.090
it'll make me feel good to think
that you can remember that we

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.430
did e to the st at one point.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.890
So the eigenfunctions
for CT systems

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.880
are complex exponentials, e to
the st. Eigenfunctions for DT

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.870
systems are complex geometrics.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.600
Complex geometrics in
DT play the same role

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.990
as complex exponentials in
CT, and they play that role

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.000
for exactly the same reason.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.200
So when we wanted to prove that
the complex exponentials were

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.620
eigenfunctions of LTI systems,
we took the complex exponential

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.600
and we convolved it with the
impulse response of an LTI

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.680
system.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.200
All LTI systems can be
represented by their impulse

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.910
response.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.570
If you convolve any
real-valued function

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.590
with a complex
exponential, you get back

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.550
a complex exponential
of the same shape,

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.540
but possibly different
complex amplitude.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.910
The same thing happens in DT.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.980
So in order to see
that that's true,

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.350
we think about the input
to an LTI system being

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.350
z to the n-- complex
exponentials,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.290
so z is some complex
number, z to the n

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:26.520
is the evolution of
the complex geometric

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.750
as a function of time.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.680
We let the system be
represented by the unit sample

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.960
response, which is analogous
to the unit impulse response.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.620
And we simply convolve
the unit sample response

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.640
with the complex
geometric, and if you

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.970
go through the
convolution's thumb--

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.130
it's a thumb now
because it's DT--

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:57.500
you find that the output
has the same base, z,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.830
that the input did
but now the amplitude

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.710
has been modified by
the value of the system

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:09.880
function evaluated at
the location, z, OK?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.460
We did this before--
this is review.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:19.200
Similarly, if you think about
representing a discrete time

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.589
system in terms of
a linear difference

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.540
equation with constant
co-efficients,

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.450
you can see that type
of system can always

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.360
be represented by the
ratio of polynomials in z.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.620
The same as with CT--

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.470
we had the ratio of
polynomials in s.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.740
Here it's the polynomials in z.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.450
And if we want to evaluate
that h of z thing, the system

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.460
function, there's
a very easy way

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.100
to do it since
it's a polynomial.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.600
There's nothing different
about polynomials in z

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.074
and polynomials in s in far
as their being polynomials.

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:57.490
The fact that
they're a polynomial

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.948
means you can factor
the numerator,

00:17:58.948 --> 00:18:00.640
you can factor the
denominator, you

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.520
can think about poles and zeros,
and you can evaluate the system

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.170
function.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.690
After you've factored the
numerator and the denominator,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.780
think about each contribution.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.360
So z0 minus q0--

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.420
so if I have a zero
at q0 and I want

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.560
to know how big is
the eigenvalue at z0,

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.330
I think about the
arrow that connects

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.789
the 0 to the point of interest.

00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:27.580
And I can say something
about the magnitude

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.410
by the length of the
arrow and the phase

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.420
by the angle of the arrow--

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.320
same as CT.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.590
And I get the same
divide and conquer idea.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.860
If I know how one 0 works and
if I know how one pole works,

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.520
I can combine the responses
to the numerous poles

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.000
in a complicated system
in order to figure out how

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.570
the complicated system works.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.320
I can think about the poles
and zeros one at a times,

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.210
just like I did for CT.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:04.230
So the magnitude is determined
by the product and division

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.580
of all the magnitude
factors and the angle

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.210
is determined by the sum and
difference of all the angle

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.029
factors.

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:14.820
OK, I'm going over this
quickly, but that's

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.590
because I'm expecting
that you know this,

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.798
you just need to be reminded.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.300
If we want to think about
the frequency response,

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.010
we do the same
thing we did in CT.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.970
We like complex
geometrics, so we

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:35.620
try to think about the
eternal cosine waves

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.310
as being expressed in terms
of complex geometrics.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:44.930
The difference is that
now we think about this e

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.890
to the j omega 0 end-term.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:59.074
So we had the same form--
we had e to the j omega 0 t.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.990
We thought about that
as a complex exponential

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.180
with a frequency omega 0.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:09.660
Now we're thinking about
e to the j omega 0 n as z

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.690
being this e to the
j omega 0 thing, OK?

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.540
It's the same thing-- it's
still Euler's equation,

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.680
we're just parsing
it differently.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.370
We used to think of it as
a complex exponential, now

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.740
we think of it as a
complex geometric--

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.300
that's the only difference.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.225
So now what we
need to do if we're

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:30.240
thinking about the response
to the cosine of omega 0 n,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.290
we have to think about adding
two complex exponentials, one

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.780
at z0 and one at z1, where
z0 is e to the j omega

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.480
0 an z1 is e to the
minus j omega 0, OK?

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:52.570
Then the response, since the z0
to the n is an eigenfunction,

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.090
the answer is just
that same eigenfunction

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.780
premultiplied by the system
function evaluated at z0

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.470
and similarly here for z1.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.300
So we get an expression here
that looks for all the world,

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:10.840
except that this is the base
of a geometric sequence.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.790
Except for that, it looks just
the same as the CT example

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.220
from before.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.190
Just like CT, the
system function

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.290
has conjugate
symmetry and, in fact,

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.260
that's for the same reason too.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.190
So you can see that
there's complex symmetry

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.810
just by thinking about
the expansion in terms

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.760
of the z transform.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.700
And if you think about the fact
that the h of n's are all real,

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.890
taking the complex
conjugate of this side

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.530
is the same as taking the
complex conjugate of that.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.270
The complex conjugate
of a sum is the sum

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.380
of the complex conjugates.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.970
The only thing that's
imaginary is that.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.430
So the only thing that happens
is that the sign changes.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:59.240
So it's those complex
conjugates' relationship in DT,

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.180
just the same as there is in
CT for exactly the same reason.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.620
And finally, we get
our final answer,

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.360
which is that if we want to know
about the frequency response,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.410
we therefore think about what
was the magnitude and angle

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.120
of the system function.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.220
We only need to look at
one of the frequencies

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.930
since we know the
frequency response has

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.870
conjugate symmetry,
and we can figure out

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.380
the response to cos omega n.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:32.120
It's still cos omega
n, except the magnitude

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.370
is different by the magnitude
of the system function

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.934
and phase delayed by the
angle of the system function--

00:22:37.934 --> 00:22:39.350
everything looks
exactly the same.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.660
The one thing that's different--
now we're getting something

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.520
a little more interesting--

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.860
the one thing
that's different is

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.680
that we evaluate
the system function

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.279
when we're interested to
find the frequency response.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:56.570
The thing we need to do is
evaluate the system function

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.910
on the unit circle.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.660
If we wanted to know the
frequency response for a CT

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:10.714
system, the frequency response
for a CT system lives where?

00:23:10.714 --> 00:23:11.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.020
DENNIS FREEMAN: J
omega-axis, right?

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.810
Here, the frequency response
lives on the unit circle.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:23.790
That's the only
difference and that

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.630
means that the vector
diagrams work precisely

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.680
the same way, except that
we don't connect them up

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.730
to the j omega-axis.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.560
We connect them up
to the unit circle.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.370
So where is DC?

00:23:40.325 --> 00:23:43.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:49.770
DENNIS FREEMAN: DC means cos
omega n where omega is 0.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:50.625
Where is that?

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.095
Where was DC in CT?

00:23:57.095 --> 00:23:58.970
Frequency response lives
on the j omega-axis.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:59.967
Where is DC?

00:23:59.967 --> 00:24:01.220
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.200
DENNIS FREEMAN: 0.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.255
Where is DC in a DT system?

00:24:04.255 --> 00:24:05.470
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.234
DENNIS FREEMAN: 1, OK?

00:24:07.234 --> 00:24:08.900
It's because we've
shifted from thinking

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.670
about complex
exponentials to thinking

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.700
about complex geometrics.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:19.580
So now DC lives on the
unit circle at the place

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.910
where the angle is 0, right?

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.330
So now we have to think
about things of this form.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.210
If we want omega
0 to be 0, we need

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:35.460
to have this number be
e to the 0, which is 1.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.180
So the DC response--

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.204
the thing that we plot--

00:24:38.204 --> 00:24:40.370
we're going to plot frequency
response just the same

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.560
as we did in CT.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.350
They're going to have the
same trick they had in CT.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:50.420
In CT, the system function
has a non-zero answer

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.410
throughout the entire s-plane.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.220
In DT, the system function
has a non-zero response

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.240
in the entire z-plane.

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:04.050
The frequency response in CT
lives on the j omega-axis,

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:08.070
the frequency response in
DT lives on the unit circle,

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.390
right?

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.590
But the frequency
response itself

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.800
is simply a plot of
the magnitude and angle

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.080
as a function of omega.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.530
I should mention
that I sneakily use

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.230
a different symbol for omega.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:30.050
I like to use a little omega for
a CT and capital Omega for DT.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.540
The reason I like to do
that is that the dimensions

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.500
are different, right?

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.390
When we think about
little omega 0,

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.222
we're thinking about
cosine of omega 0 t.

00:25:39.222 --> 00:25:40.680
When we think about
this one, we're

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.394
thinking about
cosine of omega 0 n.

00:25:45.394 --> 00:25:47.310
Can somebody tell me
something different about

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.000
little and capital Omega 0?

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.710
What's different about them?

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.100
Anything?

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:56.703
Yes?

00:25:56.703 --> 00:25:58.870
AUDIENCE: The little
one goes to infinity.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.328
DENNIS FREEMAN:
The little one goes

00:26:00.328 --> 00:26:02.017
to infinity, that's correct.

00:26:02.017 --> 00:26:03.717
Yes?

00:26:03.717 --> 00:26:05.300
AUDIENCE: The little
one [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.580
DENNIS FREEMAN: So you
can think about omega 0--

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:19.670
omega 0 has dimensions
like radian per second,

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:26.630
where omega 0 has the
dimensions of radians, right?

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.860
So the dimension will be
completely different--

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.550
that will be very important
when we think about systems.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.700
So the last two
weeks of the course,

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.245
we'll think about systems that
convert CT to DT and back.

00:26:38.245 --> 00:26:39.620
When we're doing
that conversion,

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.150
it's very important
to keep track

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.320
of how the frequencies change
and this dimensional difference

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.980
will be very handy to help us
remember how to convert one

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.760
into the other.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.820
So that's the reason for
keeping them separate--

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.320
so they're
dimensionally distinct.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.570
So all we need to do then
to think about the frequency

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.910
response-- in CT, the
frequency response

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:03.260
would be the magnitude and angle
plotted versus little omega 0.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.650
All we do that's different is
we plot against capital Omega 0.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:14.250
Capital Omega 0 specifies
the angle on the unit circle.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:18.260
So if the angle is 0,
we pick out 0 frequency.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.950
We think about that
as having two pieces--

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.910
there's the piece
associated with the pole,

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.410
there's the piece that's
associated with the 0.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.770
The 0 is in the top,
so we take the length

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.837
of the top divided by
the length in the bottom,

00:27:29.837 --> 00:27:32.420
and that tells us the magnitude
is 0, which is a number bigger

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.290
than 1, right?

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.630
Because the pole's
in the bottom--

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.380
pole's the short one,
pole's in the bottom.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.160
And as you increase
capital Omega,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.680
you sweep out the
frequency response.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.090
So by the time you
get over to pi,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.184
the length of the vector
associated with the pole

00:27:55.184 --> 00:27:57.600
is bigger than the length of
the vector associated with 0,

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.240
so now you're less than 1, OK?

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.037
So everything's
exactly the same as CT

00:28:02.037 --> 00:28:03.870
except that we're looking
at the unit circle

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.580
rather than looking
at the j omega-axis.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.640
The same sort of thing happens
for negative frequency,

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.140
just like it did in
CT, the only difference

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:23.650
being that in CT, we were
computing the frequency axis

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.110
by looking at the j omega-axis.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.570
In DT, we're computing
the frequency axis

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.330
by looking at the unit circle.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.000
There is one huge difference.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.710
OK, so summary,
everything's the same

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.090
except we look at
the unit circle--

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.960
except frequency responses
are now periodic.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.330
Someone previously said
that one of the differences

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.060
between little omega big Omega
is that little omega goes

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:52.700
to infinity.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.340
That's absolutely true.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.788
What happens when big
Omega goes to infinity?

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.480
Well, angles wrap.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.030
So if you think
about this diagram--

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.130
if you start with
capital Omega being

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.070
0, by the time you get over
here capital Omega is pi.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.680
If you keep increasing,
you'll come back here--

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.870
if you keep increasing,
you go again.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.830
The big difference
between CT and DT

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:22.360
is that the DT
complex exponentials

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.380
are periodic in 2 pi--

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.990
every 2 pi, they
repeat themselves.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:36.890
Because of that DT system
functions repeat themselves.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.980
So if you think about
evaluating the system

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.200
function at some
frequency omega 2,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.560
which happens to be
omega 1 plus 2 pi k,

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.500
you get the same thing as if
you had evaluated the system

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:56.250
function and omega 1 because
the frequency e to the j omega

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.210
2 is the same as the
frequency e to the j omega

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.400
1 because of the
periodicity of angles.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.710
Is that clear?

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.690
So we get something that's
very different in DT.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.300
In DT, the frequency
response we only

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.955
ever plotted up to pi because
above pi it repeats itself.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.370
By plotting it between
minus pi and pi,

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.320
I've showed a two pi range
and the frequency response

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.550
is always periodic in 2 pi
because discrete frequencies

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.990
are always periodic in 2 pi.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.694
Yes?

00:30:33.694 --> 00:30:35.444
AUDIENCE: How does
that affect the filters

00:30:35.444 --> 00:30:37.920
if the number repeats itself?

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.980
DENNIS FREEMAN: How does
that affect the filters?

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.130
That's an excellent question
and not a trivial one to answer.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.390
So one of the big
important differences,

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.390
which you will
under-appreciate right now,

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.370
is that because of
this repetition,

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.180
there's no equivalent
thing to bode.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:01.120
Now I know you all love bode and
because you like it so much--

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.580
I'm being slightly sarcastic.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.220
I like it a lot because
it's easy, right?

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.200
You haven't quite got
over the barrier yet

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.180
and so I've heard some
negative feedback about bode.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.630
Bode's wonderful, but
in case you haven't got

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.840
that message, one of the
biggest problems in DT--

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.810
which comes about exactly
because of the thing you said--

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.700
that the DT frequencies
are periodic.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:27.400
We don't have an
analog of bode, which

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.380
means that when we try
to sketch the magnitude

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.140
and phase for a
discrete time filter,

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.180
it's a much harder problem.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.220
One for which we almost
always use a computer

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.100
because we don't know
any good rules to let us

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.354
think about it in our heads.

00:31:41.354 --> 00:31:42.770
So that's one of
the implications,

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.770
but there's a lot of
others and, in fact, that's

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.690
one of the main themes for
the rest of the course.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:53.219
So the important difference then
is two important differences,

00:31:53.219 --> 00:31:55.010
frequency response
lives on the unit circle

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:59.030
and discrete frequencies
are periodic.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:03.330
OK, I've talked way too
much, so finally I'm

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.740
going to ask you
to do something.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:13.350
I want you to think about
three CT frequencies--

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.980
cos 3,000t, cos
4,000t, cos 5,000t--

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.400
and think about sampling
them with a sampling

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.550
interval capital
T who is at 0.001

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:29.380
and put them in order from
lowest to highest DT frequency.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.478
So first, look at your
neighbor, say hello.

00:32:33.478 --> 00:32:34.394
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:32:37.395 --> 00:32:39.770
DENNIS FREEMAN: And now choose
an answer between 0 and 5.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:38.074
OK, so which list goes from
lowest to highest DT frequency?

00:35:38.074 --> 00:35:39.490
So raise your hand
with the number

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.440
of fingers equal to the
answer between 0 and 5.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.605
High, high.

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:52.320
OK, so I see people
disagreeing with their partner.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.410
I think that's always good.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.290
OK, the correct answer
is in the minority.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:06.600
So let's ask, according
to the theory of lectures,

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.600
what's the right answer?

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.520
If you were the lecturer
asking this question,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.328
what would you
make the answer be?

00:36:20.328 --> 00:36:22.817
AUDIENCE: Probably none of them.

00:36:22.817 --> 00:36:25.150
DENNIS FREEMAN: None of them,
except I don't have none--

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:29.570
but that would be the kind
of thing I would do, I guess.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.610
If you were the
lecturer and you wanted

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:38.030
to make a point about x1,
x2, x3, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000--

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.838
what would you want
the answer to be?

00:36:40.838 --> 00:36:42.630
AUDIENCE: Number 5.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:47.600
DENNIS FREEMAN: Sure, you'd
like to be number 5, completely

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.420
backwards.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.830
OK, talk to your
neighbor-- figure out

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:53.947
why it's completely backwards.

00:36:53.947 --> 00:36:56.030
That is the right answer--
the theory of lecturers

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.780
always works.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.340
So why is 5 the right answer?

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.730
Is 5 the right answer?

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.610
5 is the right answer--

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:19.780
why is 5 the right answer?

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.500
OK, the corollary to the
theory of lecturers--

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.890
always look at the last line.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:28.890
What was the last point?

00:38:31.818 --> 00:38:34.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
wrap [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.040
DENNIS FREEMAN: Things wrap.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.520
So obviously these things
must be wrapping, right,

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.170
because according
to the corollary

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.560
to the theory of lecturers,
it has to do with wrapping.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.146
According to the theory of
lecturers, it's number 5.

00:38:49.146 --> 00:38:50.270
Why would it wrap that way?

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:57.390
Well think about after
you do the sampling,

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:02.520
if you substitute
capital T equals 0.001,

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.820
you look up x1 of nT.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:09.420
So x1 of T is this, so
substitute nT every place there

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:14.220
was a T. So you get 3,000 nT.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:18.900
3,000 times capital T is 3.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:25.510
So x1 of n is cos of 3n,
right, and that's written here.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:30.060
Similarly, the second one is
4n and the third one is 5n.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:38.210
So the discrete frequency,
capital Omega, is 3, 4, or 5.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:45.320
Think about where 3, 4, or 5
are on the unit circle, OK?

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:50.530
3 is a number just less than
pi, so that puts 3 here.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.920
4 is a number that's bigger
than pi, so you go around,

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.370
you pass pi, and you
go a little further.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:05.210
And 5 is a number that is
slightly bigger than 3/4

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.760
of 2 pi, OK?

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.380
So by that logic, right,
this is low frequencies--

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.150
positive and negatives
are both necessary because

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.560
of Euler's rule.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.020
In order to make a real
value cosine function,

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.900
right, we need e to the plus
and we need e to the minus.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.790
So we start at 0 frequency.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.530
As we increase
frequency, we're thinking

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.600
about conjugate
frequencies, like so.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.075
So this is the highest
frequency, then they cross--

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.130
so which is the highest
frequency among 3, 4, and 5?

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.050
Oh, doesn't make any sense.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.966
According to the rules
I just said, the answer

00:40:50.966 --> 00:40:52.830
must be 3, right?

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.970
3 is closest to
the high frequency,

00:40:54.970 --> 00:41:00.240
then the next closest is 4, and
the lowest frequency must be 5.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.240
Why does that make any sense?

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.910
The intuition comes from it
if you think it about what's

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.310
happening when you're sampling.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:13.390
Think about what would happen
if capital Omega were a quarter.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:20.080
Then if we plotted cos omega
t and compared the samples,

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:28.020
cos 0.25n, you would see that
at the discrete frequency,

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:32.410
the samples are a very good
representation of the unsampled

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.100
signal.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.280
I'm trying to compare the
CT signal to the DT sampled

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.230
signal, OK?

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:45.590
If you changed the discrete
frequency-- if you double it--

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.390
you still get a
good representation

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.340
of the CT signal.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.940
If you double it again, you
can still see the CT signal.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.450
I'm up to 1--

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:59.330
double it to 2, you can
still sort of see it.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:00.770
Increase it to 3--

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.760
OK, now it's getting a
little harder to see.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.840
Go a little higher to 4--

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.320
in this plot, the
red line is showing

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.710
the CT signal that was sampled.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.440
Here, the red curve is still
showing the CT signal that

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.970
was sampled, but the green curve
is showing an alternative way

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.340
to think about that
set of samples.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.710
That set of samples
could alternatively

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.030
have come from the
frequency 2 pi minus 4n.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.590
If you go to an even
higher frequency--

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.530
if you go to 5, the
problem is even worse.

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.960
There's an alternative
way of thinking about it

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.100
that's a much lower frequency.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:52.260
If you go to 6, it's
absurd to think about 6

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.630
as being the frequency, right?

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.260
The thing that your eyes sees
is this low frequency thing.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.391
You would never guess that I
had sampled the high frequency

00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:01.890
thing.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.780
That's what we mean by
the frequencies wrapping.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.690
There are two
different waveforms

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.050
that you can sample and
get the same blue circles--

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.340
the same samples.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:19.460
You could sample of
6n or 2 pi minus 6n

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.170
and you would get
the same thing.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:27.020
That's the reason we say that
the discrete frequencies wrap,

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:27.860
OK?

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.900
So that's the reasoning
behind thinking about this.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:35.480
So there's a way of thinking
about 5 as this whole distance

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.240
around like that, but
there's another way

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.180
of thinking about it as just
the negative frequency coming

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.770
this way.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.236
And since they come
in pairs, regardless

00:43:46.236 --> 00:43:47.610
of the way I think
about it, I've

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:51.240
always got the pair
there to make sense out

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.010
of either interpretation.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.750
That's the hardest part
in DT-- it's not hard,

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.690
it's just the hardest part, OK?

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:01.450
If you get that, that's
the only trick in DT.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:06.826
So the answer then is number 5.

00:44:06.826 --> 00:44:08.200
So what kind of
a filter is this?

00:44:12.102 --> 00:44:14.060
You remember, we want to
have an intuition just

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.670
like if we look at CT, right?

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:22.880
If I told you that I had a CT
and I looked at the s-plane,

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.800
and I told you that
there was a pole there--

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.320
what kind of a system is that?

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.660
High-pass, low-pass,
band-pass, stop-band.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.030
High-pass, low-pass,
band-pass, what?

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:37.380
CT system, single pole.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.080
Low pass-- it's a low pass
because of bode, right?

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.850
Right, you like bode, right?

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:46.870
It's because if we think
about frequencies near 0,

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:49.120
we get one gain and if we
think about frequencies

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.130
becoming very large, the gain
falls off linearly after that.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.470
What kind of a
filter is this one?

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:04.010
1, 2, 3, 4, 5?

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:07.290
Yes, it's a high-pass
filter, right?

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.590
It's a high-pass filter
because this pole

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.700
is in the denominator,
this vector is large

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.327
when we're at DC,
and it's short where

00:45:15.327 --> 00:45:17.285
we're into high frequencies
in the denominator,

00:45:17.285 --> 00:45:20.610
so that makes the filter be big
for high frequencies compared

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:24.600
to low frequencies, OK?

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.820
So that's the only thing
that's different about DT.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.230
OK, in the last 10
minutes what I want to do

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.954
is introduce the idea
of a Fourier series

00:45:33.954 --> 00:45:36.120
because that's where we're
going with all this junk.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.540
We want to understand DT
frequency responses so that we

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.340
can generate a Fourier series.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:47.010
So the idea is exactly the
same as what we do in CT.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:55.000
We want to represent a DT signal
as a sum of complex geometrics,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:55.500
right?

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.370
We want to think of it as a sum
of frequencies and the trick

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:03.300
is to find out what that sum is.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:08.630
The thing that's different
is that frequencies wrap.

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.940
Because the frequencies wrap--

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.620
in CT the frequencies
don't wrap.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.910
In CT, how many harmonics
do we have to think about

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.690
for an arbitrary CT signal?

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:20.370
Infinite, right?

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:25.092
When we think about
a CT Fourier series,

00:46:25.092 --> 00:46:27.300
you think about the fundamental,
the second harmonic,

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.924
the third harmonic, the fourth,
fifth, sixth, seventh they find

00:46:29.924 --> 00:46:31.530
10th, through infinity.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.180
In principle, they all matter.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.890
In DT, because of
the wrapping, there

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.610
is a finite number of them.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.610
It's pretty easy to see that--

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:49.280
choose any frequency, assume
that that's periodic in capital

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:49.780
N--

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.550
I'm just choosing the period to
be capital N just like we would

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.460
say the [INAUDIBLE]
NCT is capital T.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:59.550
If the signal is
periodic in capital N--

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:05.420
if it was originally a
complex geometric, then--

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.880
because of the factoring
properties of the complex

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.320
geometric--

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.870
it must be the case
that this number,

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:14.315
in order to make it equal to
that-- this number must be 1.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:18.900
The only way that
number could be 1

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:24.556
would be if capital Omega
is a submultiple of 2 pi.

00:47:24.556 --> 00:47:25.930
That means that
if we're thinking

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:29.260
about periodic
signals in 8, there

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.360
are exactly eight
frequencies we need

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.920
to worry about and no more.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.270
The ninth one aliases
back to the first,

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:40.580
the 10th one aliases back
to the second, et cetera.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.210
There is only eight of them.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.960
That's the big difference
between CT and DT.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:51.400
In DT, if we were thinking
about sequences of length 3,

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.390
there would be three frequencies
we'd have to worry about.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:48:00.070
If we were thinking of sequences
of length 4, there's 4.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:03.250
The number of frequencies and
the number of samples matches.

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:05.389
In fact, that's
not too surprising

00:48:05.389 --> 00:48:07.180
because if you just
think about it in terms

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.210
of knowns and unknowns, if we
want to represent an arbitrary

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:13.810
signal of length 4 in
terms of frequencies,

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.580
we better have four of them--

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.590
here they are.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.930
The idea is precisely
the same as CT

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:24.580
except that there is a
finite number of harmonics

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.340
that we have to worry about.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.070
The rules for figuring out
what the harmonics are--

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.690
and there is also a convenient
way to think about--

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:38.820
DT Fourier series as matrices.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.680
Since we have a finite
number of frequencies

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.880
and a finite number
of times, there

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.470
is some relation
between the two--

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.540
you could have an arbitrary,
linear relationship

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.650
between those sets of numbers
expressed by a matrix.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.290
So matrix turns out to be a
very convenient way of thinking

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:55.140
about DT Fourier series.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.720
And there's an orthogonality
principle exactly

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.050
like there was in CT.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.960
The orthogonality looks
just like an inner product,

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.350
just like it did in CT.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:10.140
In CT, it was the integral
over any time of length capital

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:14.190
T of the product
of two frequencies

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:17.070
is either 0 or
capital T depending

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.320
on whether the frequencies
are the same or different--

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.910
same thing happens here.

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.270
And because of that,
there is a very simple way

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:29.250
to sift out the k-th
element of the series,

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.710
just like there was an
analogously simple way

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:34.440
to sift out the k-th
element of a CT series.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:40.080
All of this is precisely the
same as what we did in CT.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.080
The result is analysis
and synthesis formulas

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:48.120
that look similar, except there
are sums instead of integrals.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.740
They look just like the CT--

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:53.580
the interesting thing is that
they both have a finite length.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:58.230
In CT, there was an
infinite sum over k.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:04.200
In DT, there's a
finite sum over k.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.650
And so that means that there
is a very convenient matrix

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:11.910
way of looking at how would
you construct an arbitrary

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:15.390
signal in time from
frequency components

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:18.750
and how would you compute
the frequency components

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:21.420
from the time components?

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.120
It's just that in DT, the
convenient way to express that

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.730
relationship-- you can still
express it as an analysis

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:27.840
and synthesis formula--

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.030
that's what these are.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.230
But a much more friendly
way of thinking about it

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.800
is as a matrix.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.350
Those two representations
are absolutely identical.

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:42.555
So the idea then for today
was generalize CT to DT.

00:50:42.555 --> 00:50:44.510
DT is really useful
when you're trying

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.060
to do signal processing
with digital electronics.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.250
Digital electronics is the
way to go because they're

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.750
so inexpensive and powerful.

00:50:54.230 --> 00:51:00.050
So unit circle wrapped,
finite length--

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.880
and that finite
length one is really

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.240
the key to signal processing
because we can represent

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.270
a finite length signal in
time with a finite number

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.970
of samples.

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.200
There is a match and
that's the reason that's

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.840
the method of choice when we
do digital signal processing,

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.780
and we'll talk more
about that next time.

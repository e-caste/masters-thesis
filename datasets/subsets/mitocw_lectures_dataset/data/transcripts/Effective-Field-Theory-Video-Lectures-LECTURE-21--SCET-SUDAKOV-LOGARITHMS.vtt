00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.390
PROFESSOR: So here's
where we were.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.110
So we were talking about
this example of b to s gamma

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.370
and a heavy to light current.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.830
In terms of this chi
field, our current

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.470
was chi, which is going
to have some label,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.630
in a heavy quark field.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.060
And we did the one
with diagrams in SET.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.020
We saw that after we take
into account also the 0 bin

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.950
contribution that it
breaks up as follows.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.450
There's a piece
that I've underlined

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.395
in orange that matches
exactly with the IR of QCD.

00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:05.660
There's a piece
that I underlined

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.390
in blue which is the
ultraviolet divergences

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.740
in the effective theory.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.150
And so what we do
with that is we

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.290
add a counter-term
for the operators

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.257
and the effective theory to
cancel these divergences.

00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:17.840
And then there's
whatever is left over

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.940
after doing that,
which is this pink.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.520
And the difference
of the analog pink

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.610
in the full theory and this
pink will give you the matching.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.990
So when I say
"matching," this is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.500
part of what goes
into that matching.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.250
So what I want to spend
today's lecture on

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.560
is really discussing
renormalization

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.840
in the effective theory
and summing logarithms

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.300
in the effective theory.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.670
It's kind of interesting
and different than things

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.280
we've encountered before,
because we see even

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.290
at one loop order,
we have 1 over

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.880
epsilon squared divergence.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.250
And that wasn't something
that we encountered before.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.710
And so we have to see
how that plays out.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.660
But just at the
simplistic level,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.930
let's just say or
record for the record

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.390
that we could write
the following.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.730
There was a Wilson
coefficient of this operator.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.690
And we can divide it into
renormalize Wilson coefficient

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.292
in a counterterm.

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:27.125
And then we just think
that this counterterm

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:29.084
is canceling that divergence.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.327
And so the counterterm
we need is the following.

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:41.410
So with this minus sign
canceling that minus sign,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.640
you get plus.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.510
And so the counterterm
for the operator therefore

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.280
should have a minus
and just all--

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.330
exactly these terms.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.970
Because of kinematics
in this problem,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.570
this omega, which is a delta
function in this operator,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.910
is equal to actually mb.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.480
And I'll go through why that
is a little later today.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.290
So take it for granted for now.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.180
It comes about just
simply from kinematics.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.840
But I'm going to sometimes
write the mb as omega

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.160
because that reminds you that it
was this label in the colinear

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.368
field.

00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:33.160
So this is the type of
counterterm we have.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.702
It's got this 1 over
epsilon squared.

00:03:34.702 --> 00:03:39.790
It's got this log, so it
looks kind of different.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:52.240
And the notation
here is that we have

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:02.080
a coefficient that's
inside an integral, where

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.160
this thing meant that.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.290
So basically what I'm saying
when I say omega is equal to mb

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.250
is that this delta function
becomes omega minus mb.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.220
We'll come back to that.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.970
So if we have a counterterm like
that, then we can do running.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.320
So we'll come back
to this example.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.450
Let me first make a
few general comments,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.510
and then we'll come back and
see where this z leads us.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.500
So in general, you're going
to have this structure--

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.670
some integral, some Wilson
coefficients that depend

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.388
on some omegas--

00:05:00.388 --> 00:05:02.680
could be more than one of
them-- and then some operator

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.305
that has some delta functions in
it that pick out those omegas.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.690
And because of that
integral, in general,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:21.250
you have to be careful, because
that integral could also play

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.560
a role in the renormalization.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.030
So that delta function
is picking out

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.180
the total momentum of
the product of the quark

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.860
field times the Wilson line.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.520
And in our example, it's
fixed by external kinematics.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.590
So I'll come back
to this and show you

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.340
that not in every example is
it fixed by external kinematics

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.480
in a minute.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.850
But our example is special
because the integral actually

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.590
doesn't play an important role.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.850
So there's in some sense
two parts of this statement.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.500
There is the fact
that it's external,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.930
and then there's the fact
that it's fixed to something.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.520
So let me first deal with the
issue of it being external.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.100
And what that means is it
does not involve loop momenta.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:58.120
You see, when we
did the calculation,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.958
we were basically
doing a calculation,

00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.250
not worrying so much about
this delta function that was

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.250
sitting inside our operator.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.180
We ignored it.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.232
We didn't write it
down in our diagrams.

00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:10.690
Technically, we
should have written

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.150
that delta function, this
delta function, down, too,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.400
and included it in
our calculation.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.040
But actually that's OK because
that delta function just comes

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.630
outside the loop integrals.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.840
That's what I want to show you.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.930
So it does not
involve loop momenta.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.370
So in all the
diagrams we consider,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.220
that's trivial, except for
one non-trivial example.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.990
And that non-trivial
example is the example

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:48.000
where we had a colinear
vertex-type diagram like this.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.080
So we called the
external momentum here p.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.360
This was p plus k.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.270
And if I let this guy go this
way, we can call it minus k.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.710
You see, the Wilson coefficient
sits here at the vertex.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.420
And it acts on the
colinear fields

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.730
that come out of that vertex.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.340
But it gives some of the
momentum of those colinear

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:11.860
fields.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:22.850
So we get this guy, and
then we get this guy.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.700
And so we just kept
the external guy.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.620
So from this notation, the
same thing as saying this delta

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.700
function.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.919
We can see that it only
depends on the external p,

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.240
on the n bar dot k.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.590
And that's because of the
structure of this operator.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.500
So that won't always be true.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.010
It could be the case that the
Wilson-- in a more complicated

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.990
example, that the
Wilson coefficient

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.000
could depend on the k.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.750
And then that would
have some implications

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.160
for renormalization.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.640
And we will treat an example of
that sort in the near future.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.870
The second thing to ask
is, what does it fix to?

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.030
So if we put a little
more into our diagram,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.980
let's put the photon in.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.390
This is a b quark.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:31.140
This is a strange quark b
to s gamma, for example.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.120
Then the kinematics of the
external lines there is we

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.840
have mbv coming in for the
b quark, p of the photon,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.800
and p of the external
strange quark.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.190
And the photon is light-like.
p gamma squared is 0.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.850
And in the setup
here, we can just

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.630
think of it as e
gamma times n bar,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.230
because p is colinear to the
n direction, and it's going--

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.200
we have the photon
going this way.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.630
And it's back to back
with a jet that's

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:10.580
described by the
colinear n direction,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.070
just as the beam
goes on decaying

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.710
to a photon in a
back-to-back jet.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:20.281
And so if you dot into
this equation n bar,

00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:24.430
since n bar dot v is 1 in
conventional coordinates,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:30.940
we just get that mb
is 0 plus n bar dot p.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.570
And that's the statement
that omega was just mb.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.850
So when we were doing our
loop calculations last time,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.290
we kept writing mb.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.750
We could have been more
careful and written--

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.140
well, we couldn't have been more
careful, because kinematics was

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.000
demanding that this was true.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.940
But just in order to track what
the Wilson coefficients can

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.040
depend on, really what
they can depend on

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.680
is these labels of
these colinear fields.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.250
And so I'm going to start
writing omega for that reason

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.837
because that's the more
generic thing that happens.

00:10:59.837 --> 00:11:01.420
Even if we're not
in a situation where

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.660
it's fixed to be
some mass, we'll

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.500
be able to get
dependence on the values

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.300
of these parameters of omega.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.330
So any questions about that?

00:11:18.532 --> 00:11:20.740
All right, so this Wilson
coefficient just comes out,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.980
and we didn't have to worry
about this delta function.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.110
So how do we calculate
the anomalous dimension?

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.300
It's the usual story.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.110
So mu d by dbu of the
bare coefficient is 0.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.450
That implies a
renormalization group equation

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.326
for the ms bar coefficient.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.590
And it's got this familiar form,
where the gamma is products

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.486
of z's and z inverses--

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.230
just this.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.550
So this is an
all-orders formula.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.230
If we plug in our
one loop result

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:20.653
here, then on the left, if we
worked order by order in alpha,

00:12:20.653 --> 00:12:22.070
on the left-hand
side, we can just

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.580
take the 1 in the
zc universe here.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.940
And the zc, when we
take b by d by d mu,

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.010
there's mu in the alpha s,
and there's mu in this log.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.850
And we're going to have to
differentiate both of those.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.500
So let me write it out.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.090
So the minus sign
canceled the minus sign.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.772
The zc inverse is just 1.

00:13:02.772 --> 00:13:05.230
And then I have b db dbu over
the rest of this stuff, which

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.210
includes both the alpha
and the log mu over w.

00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:54.510
These are the type of
contributions we get,

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.860
where these guys here are
coming from using the fact that

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:04.650
mu d by d mu of alpha when
you're in d dimensions is minus

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.290
2 epsilon alpha plus--

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.660
order alpha squared term's
related to the beta function,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.580
which we can drop here.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.770
And then this guy comes
from the explicit--

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:22.110
differentiating the
explicit log mu over w.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.910
The divergent terms
cancel, and we're

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.170
left with a finite
anomalous dimension.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.380
And it's got two
types of terms in it.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.320
So the type of
anomalous dimensions

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.760
that we're used to are like this
guy, here-- this 5 times cf.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.920
That would be like a
standard anomalous dimension

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.157
for an operator.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:53.740
In this case, we
have this extra piece

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.500
that has this log of mu over w.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:03.370
And this guy is what's called
cusp anomalous dimension,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.140
the guy that multiplies the log.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.480
So with that language,
you could call this guy

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.690
the regular anomalous dimension.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.440
Now, if you're going to
do renormalization group

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.648
evolution, you're
going to sum logs.

00:15:26.648 --> 00:15:28.940
You could think that you're
starting at some hard scale

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.470
like w. w is mb.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.030
That's the hard scale.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.750
And then you want to run
down to some small-scale mu.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.040
When you run down,
if you take mu small,

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.060
this term is larger
than this term.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.390
So actually, this
term here gives you

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.300
the leading-- what are called
the leading logs in this case.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.670
And this term here is
actually only needed

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.250
for next leading log.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.320
Because this term here
grows when you go down,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.770
and that term doesn't,
this term here

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.467
is actually giving
you the leading logs.

00:16:03.467 --> 00:16:05.300
So I'll come back and
talk a little bit more

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.220
about leading log versus
next-to-leading log.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.410
And also, I'll explain to you
what this word "cusp" in this--

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.450
where's the cusp, since
we haven't seen it yet?

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.670
I'll come back and explain
where that is in a minute.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.680
For now, let's just take the
leading log anomalous dimension

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.673
and see just to solve the
anomalous dimension equation.

00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:31.340
So we'll just take
the leading long term

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:42.140
and not worry about
the other term,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.610
so just taking the cusp term.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.520
So plugging that back
into our equation for c,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.240
we have this differential
equation, which we can also

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.010
write as d log c by d log mu.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.210
And that's an equation
that we can basically

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:19.450
just integrate since there's
no c on the right-hand side.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.990
It's a homogeneous equation.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.235
We can integrate it with
some boundary condition.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.230
So we could specify
the boundary condition

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.570
at an arbitrary scale.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.530
Let me, for simplicity, use the
following tree-level boundary

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.561
condition.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.300
So at tree level, the
Wilson coefficient was 1.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.110
That we have to pick
some scale where

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.770
we make that statement true.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.710
And for convenience, I'm just
going to take that scale to bw.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.260
That makes things
a little simpler.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.760
In general, you could make
this any hard scale, ie,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.430
any scale mu of order w.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.610
So you could call
it something mu 0

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.750
and consider the renormalization
group from that scale.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.230
But for convenience, I'm just
taking that mu 0 to be w here.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.098
So we take that down
[INAUDIBLE] It's

00:18:32.098 --> 00:18:33.640
actually useful to
look at what would

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.057
happen if we didn't
have a running

00:18:35.057 --> 00:18:37.250
coupling on the right-hand side.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.570
So say we were doing QED, and we
didn't have any massless light

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.240
fermions, so there
was no running.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.325
Then this coupling would just
be alpha, and it wouldn't run.

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:47.950
And then you'd just
integrate this log,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.240
and you'd get a double log.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.830
You integrate one log by d
log, you get log squared.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.930
For each coupling,
you get log squared.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.480
This is the double log
series that I promised you--

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.340
the Sudakov double
logarithms that

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.440
were going to come out of the
renormalization group of SET.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:13.307
So QED with alpha fixed--

00:19:13.307 --> 00:19:15.790
I'm going to take cf to be 1.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:31.190
When you take the exponential
of what I just said,

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.935
then this is your result
for the Wilson coefficient.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.140
And this is what's known
as a Sudakov exponential.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:49.530
The leading log
Wilson coefficient

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.648
is the sum of these
alpha times double log.

00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:53.940
So if I expanded this out,
I'd have an infinite series,

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.450
where for each pair of
logarithms, I get one coupling.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.170
And that's the Sudakov
double logarithms.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.670
So if we expand out
the exponential,

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.840
that's what we would get.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.360
So really, I should make my
line go under the whole thing.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.270
So why did we get
something like this?

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.760
So physically the reason that
we got this Sudakov exponential

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.790
or Sudakov form factor
is related to the fact

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.370
that the whole theory
that we've developed

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.020
put restrictions on radiation.

00:20:58.614 --> 00:21:00.540
So there was
kinematic restrictions

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.875
put on the radiation by the
whole setup that we had.

00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:04.500
We had this jet, and
it was colonnaded.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.860
And the radiation was forced
to go inside that jet.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.840
In the effective theory, we're
seeing the Sudakov exponential

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.770
come out of UV renormalization.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.440
The usual picture
for it is that you're

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.388
thinking about IR divergences.

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.430
And you're thinking about
the real radiation, not

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.320
the virtual radiation.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.710
But as you may be familiar with
what the effective theory does,

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.790
is if you have an IR divergence
in full QCD or full QED,

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.440
then what the
effective theory does

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.110
is it takes the scale
corresponding to--

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.050
so the IR divergences
are logarithms.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.240
And they're logarithms of
something over something.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.160
And we've done in
the effective theory

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.620
is we've introduced a scale mu.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.360
We've introduced--
effectively, we've

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.120
taken the part of that
logarithm that was UV

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.860
and taken it to infinity.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.810
And in this standard
way, we've introduced

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:07.640
a scale mu that splits things
between Wilson coefficients

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.260
and operators.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.580
So there's this
factorization scale

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.220
that's splitting
the hard physics

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.880
from-- which is part of the
logarithm that we're capturing.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.998
It's separating the hard physics
from the infrared physics.

00:22:19.998 --> 00:22:22.040
And here, we're just
looking at the hard physics.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.180
And we can see the Sudakov.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.847
We could also look
at the real radiation

00:22:24.847 --> 00:22:28.100
and see the Sudakov by studying
real radiation diagrams.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.973
But in some sense,
this is easier,

00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:32.390
because this is just coming
out of a renormalization group

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.453
equation.

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:35.870
So the usual way
of doing it would

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.610
be to just look at
in the full theory,

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.060
and you'd see Sudakov logarithms
from ratios of two things

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.680
that you were thinking of as IR.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.890
Because the hard scale,
which is mbw here,

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.280
would also be an IR scale
from the point of view of QCD.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.100
But here, it's become part
of the Wilson coefficient.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.290
And now it can be treated by
the renormalization group.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.082
So QCD is not really
any more complicated.

00:23:01.082 --> 00:23:03.040
We just have to deal with
the running coupling.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.900
We've done that before.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.310
Let me remind you how it
works because it's slightly

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.450
more involved in this case.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.220
So for the leading logs, we
just need the beta 0 term.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.380
And we can switch
variables from d log to d

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.787
alpha in this equation, here.

00:23:25.787 --> 00:23:28.120
And so then we have to integrate
this thing with respect

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.120
to d alpha.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.630
And so what we can do
is we can take this log,

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.930
and we can also write the log
as an integral over alpha.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.790
Alpha in this equation
is some w variable.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:58.760
And so then just integrating
both sides of this equation

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:30.770
here, I can write
it out like that.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.330
So the log became this thing.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.030
And then one of these factors--

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.390
there was a minus sign.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.900
But then when I use
this formula twice,

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.850
the minus sign goes away, and
I get two of those factors.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.302
This is the other measure here
from the explicit d log mu.

00:24:46.302 --> 00:24:47.910
So we could underline things--

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:59.565
half of this guy,
all of that guy, d

00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:04.640
log mu, other half of
this guy and that guy.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.270
And then there's this
explicit alpha cf

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.150
over pi, which I've written
as cf over pi out front,

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.410
and this alpha here.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.020
So we do that integral.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.910
We do this integral.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.410
Well, all the
intervals are trivial.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.290
We do this integral, and then
we get integration variable

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.080
at fixed quantity.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.305
And then we can do
this other integral.

00:25:33.305 --> 00:25:34.055
We get a solution.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.510
So I'll show you what
the answer looks like.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.060
It's, again, an exponential,
because we're solving for a log

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:02.560
c.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.330
I'll write it like this.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.070
So we're familiar that
renormalization group

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.903
equations, when you
have a running coupling,

00:26:31.903 --> 00:26:33.980
can give you ratios of alphas.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.077
We saw that when we were
running for fermion operators.

00:26:38.077 --> 00:26:39.910
Here, it's just a more
complicated function,

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.500
but it's again a
function of that ratio.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.842
And this extra structure
is coming about just

00:26:44.842 --> 00:26:45.925
from the running coupling.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.480
So the only difference
between this and QED Sudakov

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480
is the running coupling.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:14.370
So if we were to take this
now, and we were to expand z,

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.100
we were, say, to expand
about alpha of w,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.430
then we would get logs
of mu over w, right?

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.920
And so what you should
think that this z dependence

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.610
encodes--

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:29.490
is an infinite series
in this exponential.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.720
And so the structure of
that infinite series,

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:38.490
if I was to expand, would be
alpha squared u over w alpha

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.960
squared log cubed u
over w, et cetera.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.850
So in the exponent, a
running of the coupling

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.620
is only giving you one
log for each alpha.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.280
So the series that I'm
solving in the exponent

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.270
by taking into account
the running coupling

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.720
is a series of this form,
where I go down by one alpha

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.950
and down by one log.

00:28:04.614 --> 00:28:09.533
So from the structure of what
we've been talking about here,

00:28:09.533 --> 00:28:11.950
it should become clear that
the right thing to talk about,

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.400
if you want to do
counting, is log c,

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.250
because the anomalous dimension
equation was simple for log c.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:22.180
It was mu d by mu or
d by d log mu of log c

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.620
is equal to something.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.945
That something on the right-hand
side is an expansion in alpha.

00:28:26.945 --> 00:28:28.570
And we could include
higher-order terms

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.090
in that expansion, but it would
always be of that structure.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.440
So to talk about what
terms we're summing,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.830
we can write the following
schematic equation

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.080
for different orders.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.040
So if we have alpha
s to the k log

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.430
to the k plus 1, which is
this series I've just denoted,

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.810
we'll call that leading log.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.360
And if we add some
higher-order term,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.295
like alpha s to
the k log to the k,

00:29:10.295 --> 00:29:11.920
then that would be
next-to-leading log.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.800
And if we had more
alphas than logs,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.740
then we call that
next-to-next-to leading log.

00:29:28.072 --> 00:29:30.280
And the structure of the
anomalous dimension equation

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.180
always guarantees that if
you solve it for this log,

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.580
that this is what the
higher-order terms would

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.810
give you.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.010
So you should think of it
that really, log counting

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.140
is kind of like normal log
counting, except for two

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.720
caveats in this theory.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.900
You're doing it in
the exponential.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.790
That's what taking the log did.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.270
And you start out with one
extra log, one more log

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.200
than you're used to.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.440
But after that,
it's kind of normal,

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.560
because I'm summing
here alpha times log,

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.100
and I just increment for
each alpha an extra log.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.940
And that's all the
running coupling effects.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.865
When I go to next-to-leading
log, of course,

00:30:08.865 --> 00:30:10.990
we write in coupling effects,
too, and other things

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.390
that are causing the series.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.100
But it's down from
this one because it

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.050
doesn't have that enhanced log.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.530
And then this one is down
again because it's, again,

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.828
one less log.

00:30:22.828 --> 00:30:24.370
So this is the kind
of terms that you

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.890
could sum by having
higher-order corrections

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.080
in the anomalous dimensions.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.010
And for example, this
cusp anomalous dimension

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:32.260
is known at three loop orders.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:37.880
So certainly, next-to-next-to
leading log is well within

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.760
the realm of things
that people talk about.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.110
So let's ask that question.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:45.220
What coefficients, if we
were to carry out this one

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.423
new calculation, and we
were to do higher loops,

00:30:48.423 --> 00:30:50.090
what coefficients do
we need to compute?

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.860
So remember the story when we
were summing single log series

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.480
was we would do
tree-level matching

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.018
one loop anomalous dimension.

00:31:02.018 --> 00:31:04.560
Then we'd do one loop matching,
two loop anomalous dimension.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.330
What's the analog
of that story here?

00:31:12.857 --> 00:31:13.940
Let's make a little table.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.220
So what information do
we need at tree level?

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.580
What information do
we need at one loop,

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.000
two loops, three loops?

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.390
So for a leading
log, what we did is

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.340
we put in tree-level matching.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.308
And at one loop, we
only actually took

00:31:40.308 --> 00:31:42.600
the information that came
from the coefficient of the 1

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.082
over epsilon squared, which is
the cusp anomalous dimension.

00:31:47.082 --> 00:31:49.350
[INAUDIBLE] here.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.270
If you go to one
higher order, it

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:56.580
turns out that this is the
story to get this series.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.140
We would need the two-loop cusp
anomalous dimension, the one

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.320
loop non-cusp, and still
the tree-level matching.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.500
So this next-to-leading
log coefficient, this 5cf,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.320
that's this 1 over epsilon.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.800
In our example,
this was the 5cf.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.100
And only when you get to
next-to-next-to-leading log,

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.540
then the matching is one loop.

00:32:26.508 --> 00:32:30.880
We have the two-loop
regular anomalous dimension,

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.380
and then the 1 over
epsilon squared

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.780
cusp anomalous dimension
from three loop.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.330
So it's kind of like
it's the usual story,

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.132
but we have an
enhanced-- because

00:32:39.132 --> 00:32:41.590
of the double logarithms, we
have an enhanced thing that we

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.603
can talk about here,
where we're not

00:32:43.603 --> 00:32:45.520
talking about the regular
anomalous dimension,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.372
but this cusp
anomalous dimension.

00:32:48.372 --> 00:32:50.080
So this is the
information that you would

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.030
need to go to higher orders.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.500
And this cusp
anomalous dimension

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.865
is actually a universal thing.

00:32:54.865 --> 00:33:01.680
So given that it's been
calculated, you can use it.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.933
And you don't have to
recalculate it every time.

00:33:03.933 --> 00:33:05.850
These pieces you have
to recalculate-- these 1

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:11.541
over epsilons, in general.

00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:12.041
Yeah?

00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:16.190
STUDENT: Can you
comment on the seemingly

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:20.690
arbitrariness of the
boundary condition you chose?

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so if I hadn't
chose that boundary condition--

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:24.910
sure.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.325
Let me write something.

00:33:41.802 --> 00:33:43.760
So the way that you could
think about the rg is

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.520
as follows-- that you have c.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.610
And really what the rg is
doing is determining some u.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:59.130
It allows you to run c from
some point to some other point,

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.610
like that.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:04.620
So in this formula, mu
0 in some scale that's

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.530
of order omega or w-- it
doesn't have to be equal to w.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.433
It could be 2w, 1/2w.

00:34:10.433 --> 00:34:12.600
And the way that you're
thinking about this equation

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.590
is you're going
to do perturbation

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.507
theory for this thing.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.330
And then in that perturbation
theory, you'll have alpha,

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.480
and you'll have log
squared of mu 0 over w.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.659
But as long as you're
saying mu 0's of order w,

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.610
those aren't large logs.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:33.280
And this thing here
in this formulation

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.880
would have the double log
series of alpha log squared

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.370
of mu over mu0.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.864
But then mu0's of order w.

00:34:40.864 --> 00:34:42.239
And mu you can
take much smaller,

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.464
and that's the large logs.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.659
So for simplicity, I
just took mu0 equal to w.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.560
Everything I've
said, I could repeat,

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.893
and this story would really
be the same if I just

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:56.810
used an arbitrary mu0.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.140
And the reason you actually
want to use an arbitrary

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.560
mu0 in general is that you
want to do scale variation

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.430
to think about uncertainties.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.060
And so the mu0 dependence,
just like in our--

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.370
when we were talking about
electroweak operators

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.190
and electric Hamiltonian,
the mu0 dependence

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.200
cancels between
these things here.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.770
But that calculation is in order
by order an alpha cancellation.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:25.410
There's no large logs associated
with that cancellation.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.915
And so what it
allows you to do is

00:35:26.915 --> 00:35:28.790
if you've truncated this
to some fixed order,

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.070
and you've worked to some
fixed order over there,

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.590
then you can probe how
much uncertainty you

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.230
have by varying the mu0.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:40.880
This mu here will get tied up
with the mu in the operator.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.270
So we can talk more about
where that mu goes later on.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.660
But at the level of this
formula, it is-- in general,

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.450
it's the case that you would
do it with an arbitrary mu0,

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.670
and then only fix
mu0 at the end.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.935
And you'd even vary mu0 to get
an idea of how much uncertainty

00:35:55.935 --> 00:35:58.310
you have in your leading log
calculation, because varying

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.640
mu0 would probe the next
term in the series, here.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.620
STUDENT: So when you say
tree-level matching, you mean--

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.880
PROFESSOR: I mean this c.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.797
STUDENT: --equal to 1.

00:36:08.797 --> 00:36:10.220
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.520
I mean this guy, here.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.020
Right.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:12.645
STUDENT: Right.

00:36:12.645 --> 00:36:15.007
And if you want to go
to nnll, you'd take 1--

00:36:15.007 --> 00:36:16.340
PROFESSOR: Then you'd have this.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.650
That wouldn't have this term.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:18.150
Yeah.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.020
All right, any other questions?

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.020
OK, so what is this
cusp that we've

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.640
been saying the words for?

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.870
I'll answer a couple of
questions that have come up.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.760
Where's the cusp?

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:57.540
So if we look back at our
operator, we had this operator.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:03.100
And we could make a field
redefinition, if you remember,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.310
and put the ultrasoft
effects into a Wilson line.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.250
Now for this heavy quark
here, remember what that--

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.070
the theory for
that was with hqet.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:23.560
So the field theory for this
heavy quark was an iv dot dhv.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.940
And if we actually make a
similar field redefinition

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.430
to the one we talked
about to get this y,

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.520
but on the heavy
quark field, then we

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.050
can actually, in
terms of this guy

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.540
here, get a free
Lagrangian as well.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.770
So actually, all the effects
from ultra soft gluons

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.390
in this operator can be
encoded in Wilson lines.

00:37:51.872 --> 00:37:53.130
So let me do that.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.990
So that just says
that actually, when

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.330
we talked about static
sources, static sources

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.870
could also be encoded
as Wilson lines

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.310
by a kind of
similar manipulation

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:11.210
to what we did when
we talked about SET.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:13.010
So if we look at the
ultrasoft sector here,

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.230
we have a Wilson line
that actually has a path.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.020
So there's a Wilson
line that comes

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.080
from minus infinity along
v to whatever position

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.070
we put our operator at.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.810
Let's take it to be 0.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.490
And then we have
a yn dagger which

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:43.340
is extending out to plus
infinity from 0, like that.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.345
And the cusp is this
fact that there's

00:38:45.345 --> 00:38:46.470
a kink in this Wilson line.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:47.660
It's not a smooth path.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.640
It actually has a sharp angle.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.660
And that's the cusp.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.580
So there's actually a general
renormalization theory

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.670
for renormalizing
Wilson lines with cusps.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.890
So this is something
that at some point

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:15.770
in the history of QCD, people
tried to reformulate QCD

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.750
in terms of Wilson
lines, entirely

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.280
in terms of Wilson lines.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.890
Then they realized that
they could have these cusps

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.760
in the Wilson lines.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.380
And the renormalization
of that theory

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.588
became much more complicated
than the renormalization

00:39:26.588 --> 00:39:28.460
of the QCD action
because they couldn't

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.627
prove that in general, these
cusps wouldn't come out

00:39:30.627 --> 00:39:31.880
of the dynamics.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.260
And then people dropped it.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.560
But along the way,
anyway, they formulated

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.085
a general renormalization
theory of cusps in Wilson lines.

00:39:41.085 --> 00:39:42.710
And whenever you have
a cusp like this,

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.450
you end up having, in
our language, this log,

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.350
single log, in the
anomalous dimension.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:59.880
So if one of the lines here
is light-like, and one of them

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:06.390
is, because n squared was 0,
then the anomalous dimension

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:14.520
for this cusp will have a single
log like our log of mu over w.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.770
So that actually holds
not only to one loop,

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.650
as we talked about, but
actually to all orders

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.730
in perturbation theory.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.210
If we'd gone to higher orders
in perturbation theory,

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:29.167
then what would happen is that
the coefficient of that log

00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:30.000
would get corrected.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.750
But there'd still be only one
log in our anomalous dimension.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:39.900
That's also something that you
can argue from SET directly.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.920
But originally, it falls
from this general theory

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.500
of the renormalization
of cusps of Wilson lines.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.160
So if you were thinking
about our calculation,

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.830
you may remember actually that
we got 1 over epsilon squared.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.450
It's from the
ultrasoft diagrams.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:02.630
And that's in some sense
what we've just talked about,

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:05.090
because these are the
ultrasoft diagrams,

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:07.197
and they have 1 over
epsilon squareds.

00:41:07.197 --> 00:41:09.530
There was also 1 over epsilon
squareds from the colinear

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.350
diagrams, right?

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:17.750
So if you like, this piece
here also in some sense

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.910
has kind of a cusp.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.625
And in this case, it's not--

00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:23.000
it's actually what
we're doing is

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.510
we're taking a Wilson line
along the n bar direction, which

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:27.085
is our wn.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:34.610
And then we're attaching
it to a quark field.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.760
So this is a full
cn quark field.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.820
It's not a Wilson line.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.300
So you can think of it as
just ending on a quark field.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.160
But even just ending
on a quark field,

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.780
the quark field
also has dynamics.

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.640
It's not as simple as
Wilson line dynamics,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.350
but it has dynamics.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.080
And we have interactions
between these.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.040
And this is also kind of a cusp.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.013
Although it's not a
simple Wilson line cusp,

00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:56.055
it's also kind of a cusp.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.250
So even the colinear graphs
with the Wilson lines

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:12.940
ended on quarks also produced
these q over epsilon squareds

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.010
and have this kind of structure.

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.870
And they actually have similar--

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.660
very similar relations to the
cusps in regular Wilson lines.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:26.540
So that was one question--
what was this cusp?

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.420
Another question that
came up was this fact

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.390
that the w got fixed.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.010
And so we could
ask the question,

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.600
in general, when
will that happen?

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.390
So when will the w's
that are showing up

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:53.790
in our Wilson coefficients be
fixed by external kinematics?

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.660
And actually, that's going to
happen in the following case.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:12.975
We can actually state when it
will happen quite generally.

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:21.250
So imagine that we had an
effective theory SET that had

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.800
multiple colinear directions.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.300
So then we could
build operators out

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.540
of all those different
colinear fields.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:33.980
And we would do it with our
building blocks, which are

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:41.120
chi n or curley bn for each n.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.800
And if our operator only
involves one building block

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:51.170
for each direction,
then it's going

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:56.630
to be the case that the value
of those labels or those omegas

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.850
are always going to be fixed
by external kinematics.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.520
So let me just write
down another example.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.880
Imagine we had something
like an LHC process,

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.800
where we had two gluons coming
in and two quarks going out.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.863
But we'll think about
this as protons colliding,

00:44:20.863 --> 00:44:22.530
coming in from two
different directions.

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.140
Let's call them n2 and n3--

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.980
and then going to two jets
transverse to the axis

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:29.800
by a large amount.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.560
So there are also two
different directions,

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.680
which I can call n1 and n4.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:40.430
So this process of glu-glu
goes to qq bar, which

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:45.110
is really pp goes to dijets.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.110
As long as those dijets are
well-separated from the b

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.750
maxes, which is the case we're
interested in, then we have

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:54.080
this situation, where we
have four different n's.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.750
And so what kind of operator
would you write down for that?

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:04.550
Well, you have
dw1, dw2, dw3, dw4.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.270
You'd have a Wilson coefficient
that could depend on four

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.350
different w's.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:12.140
And you'd then write
down some operator

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.730
out of building blocks, n1w1.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.583
I'm not going to worry
about all the indices,

00:45:20.583 --> 00:45:22.000
but I'll worry
about some of them.

00:45:32.177 --> 00:45:33.260
That would look like that.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.050
So I just put down some operator
that's got the right structure.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.450
It's got two quarks, two gluons.

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:41.330
I make the gluons
these b [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:43.555
I've chosen to contract them.

00:45:43.555 --> 00:45:45.180
Each of them has a
different direction.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.630
This is in n1.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:51.260
And each of them also gets a
corresponding large momentum.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:55.183
And the Wilson coefficient can
depend on those large momenta.

00:45:55.183 --> 00:45:56.600
So this would be
the operator that

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.260
would describe that process.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.930
But again, if you think
about the renormalization,

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:06.290
then if you think about the
renormalization for a minute,

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:07.983
the colinear
diagrams aren't going

00:46:07.983 --> 00:46:09.650
to involve contractions
between this guy

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:11.150
and any of these other
guys because these guys are

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.930
totally independent.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.010
They're a different Lagrangian.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.093
So the contractions are,
again, just like the kind

00:46:15.093 --> 00:46:16.550
of calculation that we did.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:20.400
The colinear diagrams are just
coming from this thing alone,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.268
and they don't care
about that stuff.

00:46:22.268 --> 00:46:23.810
So it's actually
the same calculation

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:26.120
that we already did
for b to s gamma

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.110
if I wanted to do the
colinear diagrams here.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:29.777
And then I would have
to do the colinear

00:46:29.777 --> 00:46:32.600
diagrams for each of these guys,
but it's kind of independent.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.970
And again, the w1 is external
for that calculation.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.330
So the anomalous
dimension would just--

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:39.800
it would be outside it.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.480
It wouldn't
involve-- it wouldn't

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:47.030
appear and get thrown into
some loop integral momentum.

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:49.730
And so if you think about
what can fix these w's, it's

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.920
really only external
information.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.580
So what are the
momentum fractions

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.460
of the incoming
quarks from the PDFs?

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.800
What are the energies
of the outgoing jets?

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.620
That's the type of information
that, even in this case,

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.520
would fix the w's.

00:47:20.208 --> 00:47:22.250
So if we were to calculate
the Wilson coefficient

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.710
for this operator and do
its renormalization group,

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:25.580
there would again--

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.260
it would again be
of a product form.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.340
There's no convolution,
just a product

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.900
for this Wilson coefficient.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.080
So when could that not be true?

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.900
It could not be true
if, for example, we

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.862
had a chi bar and a chi that
were in the same direction.

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:02.320
So if we're in a situation
where all the objects are

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:07.660
different directions,
that's what happens.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.710
And it's pretty simple.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:20.320
But let's also do an
example when is it not true.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.670
It's always good to
have a counterexample.

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.045
And it would not be true if
we had an operator like this.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.070
So here's an operator
with just two quark

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.950
building-block fields.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.450
I gave them different labels,
because in general, the Wilson

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:47.890
coefficient could depend
on their large momenta.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:54.662
But now, they're in
the same direction n,

00:48:54.662 --> 00:48:58.410
so they belong to the
same colinear sector.

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:01.380
And in this operator here,
we would actually no longer

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:05.100
be in the case where this
thing would totally decouple

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.650
from the loop integrals.

00:49:20.595 --> 00:49:22.470
So if we think about
inserting this operator,

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:25.100
then some of these guys here
will involve loop momenta.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.960
Actually, it turns out that one
combination of the w's is still

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.970
fixed by external kinematics.

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:38.640
And so there's an overall--

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.550
think about the overall delta
function on this product.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.730
That guy would be fixed.

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:47.130
And then some difference of
these w's would not be fixed.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:51.970
That's the true story about
at least one combination

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.220
that involve the loop momenta.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.050
And what does that lead to?

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.600
How does it complicate
what we've already said?

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:23.980
What that leads to is
that when we formulate

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:27.870
the anomalous
dimension equations,

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:29.802
they also involve integrals.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.205
So for this guy here, for the
one momentum that's not fixed--

00:50:53.205 --> 00:50:54.330
so in general, there's two.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.940
And this is the one
that's not fixed.

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.890
We would get an equation
that looks like this.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.310
Rather than the
simple product form,

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:11.615
there'd be an integral
on the right-hand side.

00:51:11.615 --> 00:51:13.740
And indeed, actually, if
you do the renormalization

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.280
of this operator that I wrote
up there, just that simple quark

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:23.370
operator, you actually
reproduce a bunch

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:31.140
of classical evolution
equations that are of this form.

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.730
So even just the
simplest possible case

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:44.780
we can think of where
things are not fixed

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:49.010
gives us a bunch of
interesting results.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.330
So for deep
inelastic scattering,

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:56.530
then what you're getting is
the Altarelli-Parisi equation

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:57.640
or DGLAP equation.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.140
And the evolution
of the operator

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.960
would be the evolution of
the part-time distribution

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.528
function.

00:52:13.528 --> 00:52:16.070
That's one thing that would be
encoded in the renormalization

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.030
of that equation.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:21.410
There's other processes
that are actually--

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.780
some of which we may
talk about later on--

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.107
that are also encoded
in the same type

00:52:26.107 --> 00:52:28.190
of operator, kind of a
different projection of it.

00:52:31.142 --> 00:52:32.850
And one of them leads
to something called

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.020
the Brodsky-Lepage equation.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.890
And then there's another
one that's showing up

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:45.270
in something called--

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.407
a process called deeply
virtual Compton scattering.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.540
So the one that's most
familiar is the renormalization

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.147
of the PDF.

00:52:58.147 --> 00:53:00.480
And you may remember that the
renormalization of the PDF

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.990
has this form of
having an integral.

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:07.750
That'll come out of
renormalization this operator.

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:08.790
And we'll do that case.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:25.870
So in general, the structure
of the effective theory

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:29.890
is leading us to find
out what the structure

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:32.620
of the renormalization is.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:36.010
And it can reproduce some
well-known, classic things,

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:37.920
but it comes out
actually pretty easy.

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:47.430
So I'm going to do
this case, but I'm

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.710
going to do this case
in complete-- with all

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.450
of the details filled in.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:53.550
So first, I have to
convince you that

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:57.010
in deep inelastic scattering,
you actually get that operator.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.130
And we'll see
precisely what kind

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.600
of matrix elements
of that operator

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.308
show up in deep
inelastic scattering, why

00:54:02.308 --> 00:54:03.455
we get that operator.

00:54:03.455 --> 00:54:05.830
And then once we're convinced
that we have that operator,

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:07.830
and we'll actually drive
a factorization theorem

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:09.420
that involves that operator.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.730
Then we'll talk about
its renormalization group

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:12.330
evolution.

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:14.520
And I'll show you that
it has this form that I'm

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.320
writing here.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.650
So probably for the rest of
today's lecture, certainly

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.350
for the rest of today's lecture,
we won't get to the running.

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.350
We'll do that next time.

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:27.540
But we'll at least get
to the point, I think,

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.315
where you'll see why that
operator is showing up in DIS.

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:35.480
So let's do DIS.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:52.900
So I'm only going to talk
in DIS about factorization,

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:58.060
and then the renormalization
group evolution.

00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:00.280
So no phenomenology, nothing
like that-- we'll just

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.770
talk about these two concepts.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:09.760
So DIS is electron-proton to
electron anything, so just

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.600
kinematics.

00:55:13.832 --> 00:55:15.415
Think about a virtual
photon exchange.

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:21.640
Proton comes in.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.290
I'll say that the
proton's momentum is

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:29.720
a capital P. Gets blown apart.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.765
Call the stuff that's
blown apart Px.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:40.420
And so Px is the sum
of all the particles,

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.635
all the final-state hadrons.

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:49.950
Q squared of the
virtual photon--

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:50.880
so this is q.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.400
Little q squared is
minus capital Q squared.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.260
And this thing is much
bigger than on QCD.

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:08.140
mu arc in x is capital Q squared
divided by this dot product.

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:17.680
And you can talk about
Px, which is the Px mu.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.450
And by momentum
conservation, that's

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:21.910
the proton momentum, plus
whatever momentum came in

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:23.080
from the leptons q.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:30.650
So Px squared--
if you square it,

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:33.750
well, this guy is giving you
mass of the protons squared.

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:36.570
And then there's a dot-- a cross
term, and this guy squared.

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:44.319
And if you put those
things together like this,

00:56:44.319 --> 00:56:47.912
so this is an exact equation.

00:56:47.912 --> 00:56:50.180
Px squared is that.

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.430
And so there's actually
different regions of DIS,

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:54.388
and we're only going to
talk about one of them.

00:56:56.870 --> 00:57:00.230
I have to enumerate what
I'm talking about carefully.

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:06.990
And I can do that by looking
at Px squared or this factor

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:12.140
1 minus x over x, which
I'll call 1 over x minus 1.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.652
If this thing is
of order q squared,

00:57:14.652 --> 00:57:16.610
then that means that this
thing you're counting

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:18.320
is of quarter 1.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.590
And in that case, it's what's
called the inclusive operator

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:23.790
product expansion.

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:28.010
So this is the case that
most books would deal with.

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.920
And that's the one we'll
deal with, actually,

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.320
where effectively, we're not
putting restrictions on x.

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.570
We're just saying it's
generic, and it's not

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:37.430
approaching any endpoints.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:42.740
There's also a situation
where the Px gets smaller.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:47.307
And then this thing is close to
an endpoint, lambda QCD over q.

00:57:47.307 --> 00:57:48.890
And that's called
the endpoint region.

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:54.530
And people talk about that.

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:56.740
Usually when people
say x goes to 1,

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.110
this is what they mean--
that the 1 minus x minus 1

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:03.730
is of that size
on the QCD over q.

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:07.000
There's even a third region,
where the Px squared becomes

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.410
hadronic lambda QCD squared.

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:16.690
And that's like
here, two powers.

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:18.670
So taking that factor
to be really small.

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:21.980
And that's the resonance region.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:25.300
And that's the case where
the final state x is just

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.445
another proton or an
excited state of a proton.

00:58:31.977 --> 00:58:33.810
So that's where elastic
scattering would be.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:39.750
And that's an exclusive process.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.393
It's not inclusive anymore.

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:50.660
So actually, all three of these
cases can be done with SET.

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.963
And the way that it works
is different in each case.

00:58:52.963 --> 00:58:54.380
And the case that
we'll do is just

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:57.950
the first one, which is kind
of a classic one, and also

00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:58.730
the simplest one.

00:59:04.618 --> 00:59:06.410
So our Px squared is
going to be of ordered

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:12.970
q squared for our analysis.

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.520
We also need some
partonic variables.

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:44.848
So the struck quark carries
some momentum fraction

00:59:44.848 --> 00:59:45.515
from the proton.

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.620
This is the familiar language.

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:57.010
And for our analysis, what
we're going to do is just

00:59:57.010 --> 01:00:01.180
take m bar dot
little p of the quark

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.945
to be something times n bar
dot big P of the proton.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.600
So the fraction is
this c variable,

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:18.080
and it's the ratio of the
quark momentum to the proton.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.570
But we'll do it in a very
particular component,

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:25.930
and we'll see why that's
the right thing to do.

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:28.200
And if we have our
picture here of the quark

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.960
kinematics, then this
P is the incoming P.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.950
And the outgoing P would
be P prime, let's say.

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:37.320
So I could think about an
analog of this equation, where

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.750
I square P prime.

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:43.360
And if you do that, it's kind
of similar to the hadronic case.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.170
The only difference is
that the c shows up.

01:00:47.988 --> 01:00:49.905
And, of course, there's
no mass of the proton.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:56.100
So P prime squared
would be that.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.390
So we'll see how this
variable c shows up.

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:10.310
Now, one thing that we
have to decide about

01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:12.110
is frames of reference,
because remember,

01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:15.080
when we were talking about
degrees of freedom in SET,

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.480
we had picked a frame
to do that discussion.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.050
And it was almost always a
center of mass frame so far

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:26.960
in our discussions, or the rest
frame of the initial state.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.900
And here, we're going to use a
slightly different frame, which

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.067
is the most convenient frame
for deep elastic scattering.

01:01:34.067 --> 01:01:35.150
It's called a Breit frame.

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:44.540
So we're going to do our
analysis in this frame.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.070
So what defines this frame?

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.380
This frame is defined
by taking q mu

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.040
to just have a z component.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.800
Remember, it's space-like,
so it has to be somewhere

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.180
in the space-like column.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.680
And we can choose
it such that it's

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.870
entirely in the z
component, and nowhere else.

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:06.525
And that's the Breit frame.

01:02:06.525 --> 01:02:07.900
If we want to
write that in terms

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.600
of our classic decomposition
of nnn bar, is we

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.450
can write it as a
difference divided by 2.

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.620
And that's giving
the z component.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.190
So in this frame
what's happening

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:24.710
is that your initial
state proton is coming

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:26.750
in with a very large momentum.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:29.606
And then it's being--

01:02:29.606 --> 01:02:32.270
you're killing that momentum
and then spitting it back out

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:34.380
in a different direction.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:40.470
So you're spitting back out
stuff in a different direction.

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:44.480
So the initial state proton is
coming in with a large momentum

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.940
in some direction.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:50.990
So if you work out the
kinematics given that for what

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:56.080
the proton would be,
the proton's momentum

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.960
would be in the following form.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.080
So it's got a large--

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.800
this is large,
and this is small.

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.150
And if you have
a large component

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.442
in some light-like direction,
that means it's colinear.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.450
So you could actually
write it as--

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:20.300
using momentum conservation,
you could write it like this.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:24.190
And it has a colinear scaling.

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:26.135
So what we have in
the deep inelastic

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.510
scattering in the Breit frame
is that the incoming proton

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:29.345
is a linear proton.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.310
And if we look at
Px, and we just--

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:38.980
again, I'm not going
through the details of this.

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:46.910
But if we just decompose Px
in terms of these coordinates,

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.590
then we get this.

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:52.400
And so as long as this factor
1 minus x over x is of order 1,

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.340
you see that there's
a large component in n

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.630
and a large component in n bar.

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:57.770
And that means it's hard.

01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:06.270
So what would happen in
these other cases here

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:07.930
is that you would
change that, right?

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:09.100
It would no longer be hard.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.300
And that's why these
cases here are different.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.550
But as long as we're in this
first case, this is hard.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.890
And we can say that we have
colinear modes and hard modes.

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.720
And then we just want to
write down an effective theory

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.595
for those two things.

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:23.810
You could also do
an analysis of DIS

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.660
in the rest frame of the proton.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.360
That's another case.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.150
And actually, the final
result that you would get

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:33.067
would be the same.

01:04:33.067 --> 01:04:34.650
That's what we'll
get from this frame.

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:36.442
But this frame is
actually a little easier.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.980
So we're really talking about
hard colinear factorization

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.670
in some sense.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.160
Colinear describes the
low-energy degree of freedom,

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.800
which is the proton.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.450
And hard describes the
off-shell final state

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:05.550
and the hard fluctuations.

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:09.210
And really, what we want to do
in DIS in this classic case is

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.372
just separate hard and
colinear fluctuations,

01:05:11.372 --> 01:05:12.330
at least in this frame.

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.875
So we can do that for
the cross-section.

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:26.800
So let me remind you something
about the cross-section in DIS.

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:34.190
So just using nothing
more than the fact

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:38.910
that we're treating the leptons
order by order in the photon,

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:41.600
we can work the first-order in
the electromagnetic coupling.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.100
And then we can
write down a formula

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.345
like this, where we split it
into electronic and hadronic

01:05:47.345 --> 01:05:47.845
tensor.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.050
And the hadronic
tensor can be written

01:05:55.050 --> 01:06:06.480
as the imaginary part of some T,
where T is the following thing.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.180
So this doesn't use
anything about--

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.700
we haven't used any sort of
perturbation theory or anything

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.580
to write this-- what
I'm telling you-- down.

01:06:19.846 --> 01:06:22.370
We just worked all
orders, and basically used

01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:23.210
the optical theorem.

01:06:28.238 --> 01:06:30.280
So T is the time order
product of the two curves.

01:06:36.248 --> 01:06:37.040
Let me call this z.

01:06:40.893 --> 01:06:42.310
Actually, I don't
know if that's--

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.110
before you start
doing anything in QCD,

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:50.940
that's how you could write this.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.620
And these are the
electromagnetic currents

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.082
for a quark.

01:06:56.082 --> 01:06:58.290
STUDENT: But wouldn't you
write it over that, though?

01:06:58.290 --> 01:06:59.250
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:07.676
PROFESSOR: Thanks, yeah,
because x was something else.

01:07:07.676 --> 01:07:08.710
Don't want to use x.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.790
All right, so for
this T mu nu, we

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:18.190
can also use
current conservation

01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:20.990
and decompose it
into two pieces.

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:25.120
So this is a classic
thing that we do in DIS.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.740
And nothing about
the fact that we're

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:31.073
using the effective theory
really changes during this.

01:07:31.073 --> 01:07:32.740
What you're after--
the effective theory

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:39.100
is calculating these T's,
which would be coefficients.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:44.455
And this part is all standard
stuff for any analysis of DIS.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:51.280
So if you're not familiar with
it, or you don't remember it,

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.640
it's actually not
that important.

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.170
But using the current
conservation of T,

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.060
the fact that when I
dot a q into the T,

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:02.230
you should get 0, because you're
dotting a q into the current.

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.512
The current is conserved.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.720
It's electromagnetic current.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.002
That tells you the possible
structure of this thing

01:08:07.002 --> 01:08:08.710
and that there's two
general terms if I'm

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.060
doing a spin sum, which I am.

01:08:18.151 --> 01:08:19.609
There's the sum
over spin up there.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.080
If we weren't summing over
spin, if we were picking out

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.270
particular spins of the
proton, then the formula

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:31.439
here could be a little
more complicated.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.398
So this satisfies
all the symmetries.

01:08:39.271 --> 01:08:40.979
And in general, what
you know is that you

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:43.529
want the imaginary part of
forward scattering graphs.

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:53.168
So pictorially, it's sometimes
useful to draw something.

01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.040
So here's a forward
scattering graph.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.170
And the thing that's
different that we have--

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:05.700
know now-- and the information
that we're going to use

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.990
is that we're assigning
the external guys

01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:12.910
to be colinear and the
intermediate guy to be hard.

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:15.570
So we want to integrate
out the pink guy, as usual.

01:09:15.570 --> 01:09:18.000
The guy we want to integrate
out is always pink.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.120
And we want to keep
these colinear guys.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.170
And so the operators in
the effective theory--

01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:27.420
we can already intuit what
they should look like.

01:09:32.858 --> 01:09:34.150
They're just going to involve--

01:09:37.024 --> 01:09:38.560
I have a current
with two photons

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.490
hanging out of it, and
then colinear quarks.

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:45.790
Those guys-- those are
the external lines there.

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:49.029
And there's actually
also an analogous thing

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:52.990
with colinear gluons.

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:54.550
And that's what
the type of-- so I

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:56.620
could have an operator
at higher orders, where

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.232
the external states
here were gluons.

01:09:58.232 --> 01:10:00.440
And that's what the operators
of the effective theory

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.823
are going to look like.

01:10:02.823 --> 01:10:04.490
Just contract that
pink line to a point,

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:05.782
and that's what they look like.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.300
So given that we know
what they look like,

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.258
we just have to write
down the lowest dimension

01:10:24.258 --> 01:10:25.337
operators of that form.

01:10:25.337 --> 01:10:27.295
And the lowest dimension
operators of that form

01:10:27.295 --> 01:10:28.840
are exactly the
operator that I told

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.030
you was going to be
the one that comes in.

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.570
So we can enumerate
the lowest dimension,

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:41.150
which where dimension here
is counted as lambdas, right?

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:44.720
So it's the lowest order in the
power counting operators, so

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.855
not the lowest order
in mass dimension.

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:57.320
Let me write out a few things.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:07.375
Yeah, I already switched
to this notation.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.340
Yeah.

01:11:32.393 --> 01:11:34.060
So the type of operator
we'd have that's

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.520
order lambda squared--

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.520
this guy's order lambda.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.520
This guy's order lambda.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.770
That's lambda squared.

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:42.610
And the most general thing
we can think of is this.

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:44.860
The reason why I wrote this
out rather than writing it

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.540
as a chi field is I
wanted to emphasize

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.707
that there's a flavor index.

01:11:51.202 --> 01:11:57.030
So i is up quarks, down quarks,
strange quirks, et cetera.

01:11:57.030 --> 01:12:06.660
And then we could
also have gluons,

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:19.485
and gluons are similar except
in terms of our curly v field.

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:35.460
And it is actually just a
contraction of two curly v's,

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.555
and then traced over.

01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:40.430
And then there's some
Wilson coefficient here

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:47.750
which is also just the Wilson
coefficient for the gluon.

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:50.000
So this is, again,
order lambda squared.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.810
The b perp field is
order lambda squared.

01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:53.990
So we just write down the
lowest dimension operators

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:55.352
that have this form.

01:12:55.352 --> 01:12:57.060
And that's going to
be the right answer--

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.240
the lowest order in lambda.

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:18.000
So it turns out actually
that in this case,

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.380
our lambda counting is exactly
the corresponding twist

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.350
expansion.

01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:27.410
I'm not going to--

01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:29.830
STUDENT: All j's correspond
to the operators that go

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:31.442
into the T1's and T2's?

01:13:31.442 --> 01:13:32.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.630
So now what's the
index j exactly?

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:37.860
There's a T1 and a T2.

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.480
And the T1 and the
T2, although they

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.940
have the same kind of quark
and gluon field structure,

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:45.480
they get different coefficients,
and that's what the j is.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:53.270
So when we think about doing a
similar kind of decomposition,

01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:56.210
the effective theory, we
can write it as follows.

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.030
So as an 01 and an 02.

01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:10.010
And I think if I'm getting
my mass detentions right,

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.880
it looks like this.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.070
So there's a piece that
multiplies a spin structure

01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:32.630
that's this g perp mu nu.

01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:34.052
That's transverse to Q.

01:14:34.052 --> 01:14:35.510
And there's a piece
that multiplies

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:37.790
this guy, which is also
transverse to Q in the Breit

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:39.920
frame.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.410
So that's the kind
of decomposition

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.610
we would do in the
effective theory.

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:44.170
There'd be two different
types of operators

01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:45.215
we could think about.

01:14:45.215 --> 01:14:46.840
But the only thing
that actually tracks

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.850
that-- because of
the spin relations,

01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:51.667
the only thing that tracks
that is the Wilson coefficient.

01:14:51.667 --> 01:14:53.875
And so that will differ in
these two different cases.

01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:01.550
So this guy here
is going to be--

01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:04.260
this will give the quark PDFs.

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.970
And this Wilson
coefficient will then

01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:14.852
be the thing that you convolute
with the quark PDF in DIS.

01:15:14.852 --> 01:15:17.310
And then likewise, this guy is
going to give the gluon PDF.

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:24.280
So let's do the quark--

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.060
we'll do the quark
contribution in detail.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.310
The gluon contribution
is not really any harder.

01:15:34.983 --> 01:15:36.400
So what I'm going
to do is I'm not

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.680
going to think about it
in perturbation theory.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.570
I'm just going to think about
it to all orders in perturbation

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:41.308
theory.

01:15:41.308 --> 01:15:42.850
And really what that
means is I'm not

01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:46.000
going to think about this c as
expanded in perturbation theory

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.565
or think about any of the
diagrams here as expanded

01:15:48.565 --> 01:15:50.260
in perturbation theory.

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.690
I'm just going to see,
if I manipulate things,

01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:55.150
what does it lead
to, using things

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:58.610
like momentum conservation
and stuff like that?

01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:00.130
So let me write--

01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:02.980
in order to do that,
let me write it

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:10.420
slightly differently than I
just did, which I apologize for.

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.170
But I'm going to--

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:17.080
I want the arguments of the c,
just for a later convenience,

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.450
instead of being w1
and w1 to be w plus

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.570
and w-- minus the sum of
the w's and the difference

01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:28.420
of the w's, but
everything else the same.

01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:34.390
It's convenient
to just talk about

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:37.900
the sum and the difference
rather than the individuals.

01:16:48.818 --> 01:16:50.610
So what's the parton
distribution function?

01:16:54.737 --> 01:16:56.320
Let me convince you
that it's actually

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.800
related to this operator.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:09.700
If you were in coordinate space,
the coordinate space for us

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.950
was z.

01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:15.110
We're just leaving x
for something else.

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:22.110
Then you could define the
parton distribution function

01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:26.857
as a proton matrix
element of quark fields

01:17:26.857 --> 01:17:28.190
with a Wilson line between them.

01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:39.720
So they're on the light
cone, and we have a formula

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.790
like that.

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:45.180
And also, one can
convince oneself

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:49.470
that if you want to write
down for the antiquarks what

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:51.690
the part-time
distribution function is,

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:55.710
it's the same formula
as the quark formula,

01:17:55.710 --> 01:17:57.520
just with an overall minus sign.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.529
And z goes to minus z.

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:12.540
So that's an operator definition
of the part-time distribution

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.020
function.

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:17.010
You can also define it by
moments of the operator.

01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:20.370
That's the way that, for
example, Peskin does it.

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:22.620
But if you put all the
information in those moments

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.140
back into a single operator,
then it becomes this thing.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:32.705
And if we Fourier
transform this,

01:18:32.705 --> 01:18:34.830
then it becomes the operator
that we have up there.

01:18:48.802 --> 01:18:51.010
So there's something special
about the matrix element

01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:52.870
we're taking here.

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:55.900
And that is that this
matrix element is forward.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.360
It has the same
kinematics for the--

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.330
so this is a colinear proton,
but we have the same momentum

01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:03.820
here and here.

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.290
In the in state
and the out state,

01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:08.830
you have the same momentum.

01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:11.445
And that leads to one
kinematic restriction

01:19:11.445 --> 01:19:12.570
on what I'm about to write.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:21.650
So what that imposes is that
w1 should be equal to w2.

01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:23.630
So there's a delta
function of w minus

01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:27.110
that comes from the momentum
conservation or the restriction

01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:30.110
that it's a forward
matrix element.

01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:33.170
But the sum of the two--

01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:35.780
with my sign conventions,
it's w minus.

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:39.960
The sum of the two
is unconstrained.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.645
Well, it's bounded,
but unconstrained.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.100
So we can write the
unconstrained part

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.680
as this interval of c parameter.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.390
The bounding just
comes from the fact

01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:10.130
that the quark can't
carry more momentum

01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:13.055
than the overall
momentum of the proton.

01:20:13.055 --> 01:20:14.180
So that's why it's bounded.

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:16.610
It can't carry negative
momentum, and it can't carry--

01:20:19.078 --> 01:20:20.870
negative physical
momentum, it can't carry,

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:23.600
and it can't carry less
momentum in the proton.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.350
That's where the
limits come from.

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:26.630
And then there's two pieces.

01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:28.550
The w plus could
either be positive,

01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:30.240
or it could be negative.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.120
If it's positive,
remember, positive

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.340
labels-- that was our quarks.

01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:35.690
So this is the quark piece.

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:40.020
And these are the antiquarks.

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.140
They come with negative labels.

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:47.470
Remember that we talked
about that earlier.

01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:55.292
And so both the f and the f bar
are hiding inside this formula.

01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:57.000
So there is a
simplification that there's

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.230
this delta function here.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.510
And so basically what
we're talking about then--

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:06.600
you can think of just
doing the integral

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.440
over that delta function.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:13.447
So then you're talking about
effectively an operator

01:21:13.447 --> 01:21:15.780
where you don't worry about
putting a label on this one.

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.410
You have only one
delta function left,

01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:19.640
which I can denote by
putting a label on this one.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.340
And this operator is
actually exactly the operator

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:26.760
that gives you the PDF.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.510
This operator is like
a number operator

01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:43.900
for quarks, where
you're thinking

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:52.550
about momentum, a number
operator with momentum omega.

01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:54.300
And if you want to
think about there being

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.760
some kind of field for a
parton, this is about as close

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.450
as you can get.

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:03.930
So this quark field
dressed by Wilson line

01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:07.820
is kind of like a parton
in the parton model.

01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:11.630
All right, so next time, we'll
take this, put it together

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:13.880
with this formula
here, with the c,

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.230
and just see where it leads us.

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.300
And it will lead us
directly to a factorization

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.820
theorem for deep
inelastic scattering

01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:22.280
involving parton
distribution functions

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.800
and some hard perturbatively
calculable thing, which

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:28.940
is actually a cross-section
in the parton model.

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:32.343
And then we'll talk about
renormalization [INAUDIBLE]..

01:22:32.343 --> 01:22:34.760
You can already see that we're
getting the operator that I

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.160
promised you-- that
DIS is described

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.010
by this, by a linear operator
with two different quark

01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:42.620
fields, and particular
labeling of the momenta.

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:50.130
Any questions?

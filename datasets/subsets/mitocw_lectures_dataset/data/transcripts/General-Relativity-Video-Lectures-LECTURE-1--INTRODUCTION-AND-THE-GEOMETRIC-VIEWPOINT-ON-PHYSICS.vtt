[CLICKING]

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:12.160
SCOTT HUGHES: The key
textbook for this class

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.372
is Sean Carroll's textbook
on general relativity.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.270
It's now almost 20 years old.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.830
I would say-- I
think it's listed

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.400
on the website as required.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.950
I would actually call it
sort of semi-required.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.120
It is where I will tend to
post most of the readings

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.980
to the course.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.740
It's a really good, complete
textbook for a one semester

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.193
course, which is what
we have, and I will not

00:00:44.193 --> 00:00:45.610
be going through
the entire thing.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.940
You can't in a one
semester course.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.680
And I will, from time to time,
there will be a few topics that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.195
I cannot go as in into as
deeply as I would like,

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:56.320
and if we had two semesters
maybe I'd be able to do

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.890
a little bit more.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.390
And so for those
who are interested,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.730
I will suggest readings in this.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.209
My personal favorite supplement
to this is a textbook

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.358
by Bernard Schutz , A First
Course in General Relativity.

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.895
OK, so these are all things
where-- so the MIT bookstore,

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:17.270
I'm not sure how
much they carry.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.650
They're all available
through Amazon,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.692
and you can definitely
find these kind of things.

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:23.570
If you get Schutz's
textbook, definitely

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.950
get the second edition.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.770
The first edition
contains errors.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.860
There is actually a very
important geometric object

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.320
that we are going to
introduce in a couple of weeks

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.092
that his textbook has a
really clever derivation of.

00:01:40.092 --> 00:01:41.800
I remember seeing that
and thinking, wow,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.690
that's really clever.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.232
The reason he was able do it so
simply is because it's wrong.

00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:46.080
AUDIENCE: [LAUGH]

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.050
SCOTT HUGHES: It's corrected
in the second edition.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.020
Another one is Gravitation by
Misner, Thorne and Wheeler.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.200
This is sort of a bit of
personal history for me.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920
I was Thorne's graduate student,
and I used this textbook

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.130
when I learned this
subject originally.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.560
I, frankly, do not
recommend this textbook

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.670
to somebody who is learning
the subject for the first time.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.040
It's a good place for a
reference for certain things.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.230
It's available in
the reading room.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.190
Know where you can get
a copy and pick it up.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.565
So first of all,
picking it up is

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:20.653
kind of a-- it's good exercise.

00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:21.570
It's actually like a--

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.790
you know, it's a huge book.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.030
It gravitates.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.420
So it's a great
reference and has

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.000
a couple of good sections
in it for new students.

00:02:44.438 --> 00:02:46.480
But I will indicate from
time to time, especially

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.940
some of the stuff we do in
the second half of the class,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.330
my lectures are kind of inspired
by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler--

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.640
known as MTW.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.310
And for those of you who have
sort of a more mathematically

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.960
minded approach to things,
General Relativity by Wald.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.210
In the course syllabus I
call this the uber book.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.430
This really is sort of
the self-contained book

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.720
that really pins down the
subject very, very well.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.090
It's quite terse and formal,
but also very, very clear.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.232
If you are a mathematically
minded thinker,

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.190
you will find this to be
a really good textbook

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.600
to refer to.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.200
There is one
particular derivation

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.837
that I'm going to do in
about a month and a half

00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:30.670
that I essentially take
from Wald's textbook

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.190
because it's just beautiful.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.023
Other things in it--

00:03:34.023 --> 00:03:36.440
to me, it's a little too terse
from my own personal taste,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.260
but others may find
it to be pretty good.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.530
Two other quick things.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.200
So there are 11 problem
sets and your grade

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.560
is determined entirely
on these problems sets.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.230
The syllabus gives the schedule
for when they will be posted

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.570
and when they are
to be handed in.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.560
11 does not divide evenly
into 100, so what we do is we

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.970
have 10 that are worth 9%
of your grade and the 11th

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.940
is worth 10% of your grade.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.735
Is that 11th one
really 1% longer?

00:04:20.735 --> 00:04:22.110
I don't know.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.020
Again, I'm taking the viewpoint
that you are graduate students,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.238
or at least you're playing one
for the next hour and a half,

00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:30.780
and if you're going to sweat
the difference of one percentage

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.160
point on that thing, come on.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.660
This is about
learning the material,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.080
don't worry about those
little details that much.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.013
That is where all
of your assessment

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:39.930
is going to come from.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:45.240
The very first time I lectured
this course I had a final exam,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.610
and it just turned to be a
complete waste of my time

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.560
and the students' time.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.830
You really cannot write--

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.400
you either write
problems that are

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.980
so easy that you can
do them in your sleep,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.840
or they're so difficult
you can't do them

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.290
in the time period of an exam.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.040
So we're just going to
stick with problem sets

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.000
and that's fine.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.720
Let's move into, then,
the way the course

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.610
is going to be structured.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.467
So my presentation
of this material--

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:31.270
the first half of the course
basically up to spring break

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.030
is essentially the
mathematical foundations

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.322
of general relativity.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.343
There are several
choices that need to be

00:05:48.343 --> 00:05:49.510
made when you're doing this.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.885
This often, in
some universities,

00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:52.930
if they have multiple
semester sequences, what

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.472
I'm going to cover
in this first half

00:05:54.472 --> 00:05:57.258
of our semester in some places
goes for a full semester.

00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:59.800
And what this means is there's
a couple of things that I just

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.800
cannot cover in
quite as much depth.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800
Those will be things
where, for those of you who

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.300
are interested in it, have that
kind of a mathematical thinking

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.490
of things, happy to push
you to additional readings.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.800
We can dive in and look
at it a bit more depth.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.350
My goal is to give
you just enough stuff

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.523
that we can do the most
important applications

00:06:17.523 --> 00:06:18.190
of this subject.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.750
And I'm an astrophysicist,
and to be blunt,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.460
most of my really
interesting applications

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.002
tend to be things that have to
do with things like cosmology,

00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:26.300
black holes, dense stars,
and things like that.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.630
And so I want to get
enough formalism together

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.510
that we can get to
that part of things.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.450
And so the goal of this
is that by the week right

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:44.380
before spring break what
we will do is "derive"--

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.020
I put that in quotes, and you'll
see why a little bit later--

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.920
the Einstein field
equations that govern

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.950
gravity in general relativity.

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:00.940
So there are several
things that we

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.360
could do that are not strictly
necessary to get there,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.140
and just because
of time limitations

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.290
I'm going to choose to
elide a few of these topics.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.030
The second half will
then be applications.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.800
We will use everything we
derived in the first half

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.070
to see how general relativity
gives us a relativistic theory

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.237
of gravity.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:35.320
We will begin applying it.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.870
We'll see how Newton's law
is encoded in these field

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.423
equations.

00:07:38.423 --> 00:07:40.090
We'll see how we go
beyond Newton's law,

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.550
get some of the classic
tests of general relativity,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.050
and then start
looking at solving it

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.460
for more interesting systems.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.310
Looking at the evolution
of the universe as a whole,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.610
looking at the behavior
of black holes,

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.485
looking for gravitational
waves, constructing

00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:53.450
the spacetime of neutron
stars, things like that.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.480
So it's a fun semester.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.277
It sort of works well to fit
these two things in like this.

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:00.610
And for those of you who are
interested in taking things

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.790
more deeply, there's a lot
of room to grow after this.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.880
And it does look like-- so
people who particularly would

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.855
like to go a little bit more
detail on some of the math,

00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:11.230
if you've looked
at the syllabus,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.360
I have one of my
absolute favorite quotes

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.730
from a course evaluation
is put on there.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.120
Where a student in
2007 or so wrote,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.670
"The course was fine as it
was, but Professor Hughes

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.530
as an astrophysicist
tended to focus

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.932
on really mundane topics like
cosmology and black holes."

00:08:27.932 --> 00:08:29.890
If you think those are
mundane topics, what can

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.613
I say, guilty as charged.

00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:34.030
But for those you who do want
to take a different approach

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.572
these sorts of
things, we'll probably

00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:38.169
alternate lecturing this course
in the future between someone

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.780
from the CTP who works
more in quantum gravity

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.820
and things related to that.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.600
That'll be Netta Engelhardt
in spring of 2021.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.280
We're now ready to
start talking about,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.160
after doing all
this sort of prep,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.767
we can actually talk about
some of the foundations

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:55.350
of the theory.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.225
So before I dive in,
are there any questions?

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.680
All right.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.820
What we're going to begin doing
for the first couple of weeks--

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.320
well, not really
first couple weeks.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.870
The first couple of
lectures, is we're

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:16.850
going to begin by discussing
special relativity,

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:26.410
but we're going to do
special relativity using

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:33.580
mathematical language that
emphasizes the geometric nature

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.409
of this form of relativity.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.000
What this does is it allows
us to introduce basically

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.270
the formalism, the notation,
all the different tools that

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.450
are important for when
things get more complicated.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.870
When we apply a lot of these
tools to special relativity,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.537
like we will be doing
in the first three

00:10:13.537 --> 00:10:15.350
or so lectures of
this course, it's

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.780
kind of like swatting a
mosquito with a sledgehammer.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.290
You really don't need that
much mathematical structure

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.330
to discuss special relativity.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.760
But you're going to be
grateful for that sledgehammer

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.580
when we start talking about
strong field orbits of rotating

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.480
black holes, right.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.760
And so the whole idea of this
is to develop the framework

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.530
in terms of a
physical system where

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.630
it's simple to understand
what is going on.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.130
These are sort of
a way to introduce

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.050
the mathematical
tools in a place where

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.260
the physics is straightforward
and then kind of carry forward

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.350
from there.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.200
I will caution that
as a consequence

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.530
of this many students find
these first three lectures to be

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.650
a little on the dull side.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.072
So, sorry.

00:10:58.072 --> 00:11:00.530
It's just some stuff that we
kind of have to get out there,

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.140
and then as we generalize
to more interesting

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.900
mathematical objects, more
interesting physical settings,

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.770
it gets more interesting.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.510
All right, so let's dive in.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.370
So the setting for everything
that we will be doing

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:17.270
is a geometric concept
known as spacetime.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.730
So we give you a precise
mathematical definition

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.580
of spacetime.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:37.580
A spacetime is a
manifold of events

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:45.245
that is endowed with a metric.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.920
So, a wonderful mathematical
definition, and I've

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.800
written it in a way that
requires me to carefully define

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.430
three additional terms.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.840
The concepts that
I've underlined here,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.400
I've not defined
them yet precisely

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.510
exactly what I mean by them.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.370
So let's go over
to the sideboard

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.190
and talk about what
exactly these are.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:14.628
So a manifold-- if you
are a mathematician,

00:12:14.628 --> 00:12:16.420
you might twitch a
little bit about the way

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.500
that I am going to
define this, and I

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.110
will point you to a reading
that does it a little bit more

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.980
precisely.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.960
But for the purposes
of our class,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.260
a manifold is
essentially just a set

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:44.810
or a collection of points
with well understood

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.340
connectedness properties.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.480
What I mean by
that, is I'm going

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.798
to talk about manifolds
of space and time.

00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:05.840
I haven't defined an event
yet, but I'm about to,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.610
but I'm going to say that
there's a bunch of events that

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.830
happen at this place and at this
time and a bunch of events that

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.810
happen at this place
and at this time.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.270
And the manifold, the
spacetime, gives me

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.150
some notion of how I
connect the events over here

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.770
to the events over here.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.410
A manifold is a
tautological concept.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.750
It's all about how one connects
one region to another one.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.880
So if you're working
on a manifold that

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.530
lives on the surface
of a donut, you

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.180
have a particular topology
associated with that.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.763
If it lives on the
surface of a sphere

00:13:33.763 --> 00:13:36.060
you have a different
topology associated with it.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.690
If you would like to see
more careful and more

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.880
rigorous discussion
of this, this

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.880
is one of the places where
Carroll is very good.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.380
So go into Carroll, at
least in the edition

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.170
that I have it's
on pages 54 to 62.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.640
He introduces a bit of
additional mathematical

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.190
machinery, discusses things
with a little more rigor

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.510
than I'm doing here--

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.880
this isn't rigorous at all,
so significantly more rigor

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.320
than I'm doing here.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.900
Those of you are into that,
that should be something

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.590
that you enjoy.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.570
So an event.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:26.045
This is when and where
something happens.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.140
Could be anything.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.540
From our point of view,
the event essentially

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.910
is going to be the
fundamental notion

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.030
of a coordinate in space time.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.780
We will actually,
in many cases--

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.940
actually, that's bad word
choice, I should say.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.160
Coordinates are
actually sort of labels

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.540
that we attach to events.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.180
We are going to
be free to adjust

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.200
those labels, but the underlying
geometric idea that the event

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.660
is here, that's independent of
the coordinates that we choose.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.909
So we will label these
things with coordinates.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:28.160
But the event itself exists
independent of these labels.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.620
Just to give an
example, there might

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.890
be one event which is I
punch myself in the head.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.980
And so I'm very
egotistic, so I will say

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.905
this event happened at time 0--

00:15:55.905 --> 00:15:57.300
x, y, and z equals 0.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.490
Because I define this
corner of my skull

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.990
as the origin the
coordinate system,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.032
and I always think whatever's
happening right now

00:16:03.032 --> 00:16:04.440
is the origin of time.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.140
Those of you out in the
room are also egocentric

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.840
and you would say whatever,
I'm going to call that--

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.810
let's say you are
at y of 3 meters

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.960
and I'm going to put the floor
as the origin of my z-axis,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.700
so z of 1.7 meters or whatever.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.700
You will come with your
own independent labeling

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.560
of these things.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.060
So you're all
familiar with the idea

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.453
that we can just change
coordinate systems.

00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:28.120
I'm going to harp on
this a bit, though,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.662
because there's going to be a
really important distinction we

00:16:30.662 --> 00:16:32.880
make between
geometrical objects that

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.830
live in this
manifold of spacetime

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.490
and how we represent them using
labels that might be attached

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.773
to coordinate systems.

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:41.190
And I'm going to
come back to this

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.770
when we start talking about some
additional geometric objects

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.420
in just a couple of minutes.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.410
So the last object that I
have introduced into here

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.330
is one that we
will begin talking

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.730
about in a lot more detail
in the next lecture,

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.700
but let me put it
into here right away.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.440
And so that is the metric.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.980
Metric comes from a
root meaning to measure,

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.050
and what this is
is it's something

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:18.589
it gives me a notion of distance
between events in the manifold.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:29.060
For physics to work,
this has to exist, right?

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.670
But it's worth knowing
that the idea of a manifold

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.250
is in some way more
primitive than this.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.110
You can have a manifold
without any notion

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.320
of a metric attached to it.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.408
And if that's the case--

00:17:38.408 --> 00:17:39.950
people like to joke
that if you don't

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.170
know what the difference
is between a metric

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.980
with a manifold
and without a man--

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.690
excuse me, a manifold with a
metric and without a metric,

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.940
feel free to drink
coffee out of a donut.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.610
Because topologically, those
are the exact same thing,

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.100
but their geometry, which is
encoded in the metric, which

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.710
tells me how the different
points on that manifold

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.040
are arranged, are
rather different.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.790
What this basically
does is it's going

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:09.702
to give me a mathematical object
that enforces or really conveys

00:18:09.702 --> 00:18:11.660
the idea that different
events in this manifold

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.490
have a particular
distance between them.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:28.330
So without this, a
manifold has no notion

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.000
of distance encoded in it.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.820
So the two things
together really make

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.460
this concept come to life.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:40.930
You can see a lot
more, like I said.

00:18:43.385 --> 00:18:45.760
You can get more information
about many of these concepts

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.300
from the readings in
Carroll, Wald's textbook

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.650
also goes into quite a lot
of detail about this stuff.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.280
So this is the venue.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.300
This is the setting in which we
are going to talk about things.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.020
And just cutting
forward roughly 2

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.760
and 1/2 months'
worth of lectures,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.680
what we are going to find is
that part of Einstein's genius

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.890
is that it turns out that
this notion of the metric

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.502
ends up encoding gravity.

00:19:13.502 --> 00:19:14.960
So that's kind of
where we're going

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.127
to end up going with things.

00:19:16.127 --> 00:19:18.580
The idea that the
mathematical structure

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.202
that tells me how far
apart two events are

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.410
is intimately connected to
the properties of gravity.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.140
It's pretty cool, and
it is something that--

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.500
physics is an
experimental science.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.430
All of our measurements
are consistent with it.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.000
So that's cool.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.630
So everything I have said
so far, nothing but math.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.490
Nothing but definitions.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.490
So let's start working with
a particular form of physics.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.066
So we are going to begin, as I
said, with special relativity.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.720
This is the simplest
theory of spacetime

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.500
that is compatible with
physics as we know it.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:13.610
Not fully compatible, but
does a pretty good job.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.090
And we'll see that it
turns out to correspond

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:25.220
to general relativity
when there is no gravity.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.540
So to set this up
we need to have

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.700
some kind of a way of
labeling our events.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.660
And so I'm going to introduce
kind of a conceptual--

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.370
you almost think of
it as scaffolding,

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.640
which we're going to use to
build a lot of our concepts

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.990
around.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.490
And in this one--

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.035
I mean that in a kind
of an abstract sense.

00:20:59.035 --> 00:21:00.660
There's going to be
sort of the edifice

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.660
that we use to help us
build the building that's

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.800
going to be the mathematics
of general relativity.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.883
But this one really is
kind of like a scaffolding.

00:21:06.883 --> 00:21:09.030
Because what I want
to introduce here

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:17.670
is a notion of what is called
an inertial reference frame.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.440
So I'm going to
sketch this quickly,

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.440
and I'm going to post
to the course website

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:38.040
a chapter from an
early draft textbook

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.920
by Roger Blandford
and Kip Thorne.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.660
So when I talk about the
inertial reference frame,

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.360
I want you to sort of
visualize in your head

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.620
a lattice of clocks--

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.200
clocks and measuring rods--

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:36.150
that allows us to label,
in other words, to assign

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:48.492
coordinates any event
that happens in spacetime.

00:22:52.717 --> 00:22:54.300
So just sort of, in
your head, imagine

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.710
that there's this grid of little
clocks and measuring rods,

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:03.420
and a mosquito
lands on your head.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.510
It's right near a particular
rod and a particular clock.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.890
It bites you, that's an event.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.750
You slap it, that's
another event.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.220
And the measuring
rods and events

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.110
are what allows
you to sort of keep

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.240
track of the ordering
of those events

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.520
and where they happen
in this four dimensional

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.240
manifold of spacetime.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.740
So I'm going to
require this lattice

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.746
to have a certain
set of properties.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:39.910
First, I'm going to say that
this lattice moves freely

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.220
through spacetime.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.900
What do I mean by moving freely?

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.410
I mean no forces act on
it, it does not rotate,

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.790
it is inertial.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.040
Every clock and every
measuring rod has no inertia,

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.850
no force is acting on it at all.

00:24:19.633 --> 00:24:21.800
You look at that, you might
think to yourself, well,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.810
why don't you make it at rest?

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:24.630
Well, I did.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.485
It's at rest in
respect to someone,

00:24:27.485 --> 00:24:29.860
but we might have a different
observer who's coming along

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.610
who has no forces acting on her,
and she's moving relative to me

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.630
at three quarters
the speed of light.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.930
It's not at rest with
respects to that observer.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.472
That's actually kind
of the key here.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.280
So this inertial reference
frame is at rest with respect

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:52.764
to someone who feels no forces
but not to all observers.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:11.810
I'm going to require that
my measuring rods are

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.040
orthogonal to each other.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:28.000
So they define an orthogonal
coordinate system,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.323
and I am also going to require
that the little markings

00:25:31.323 --> 00:25:32.990
on them that tell me
where things happen

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.880
are uniformly ticked.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.580
In other words, I'm
going to just make sure

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.093
that the spacing
between tick marks

00:25:39.093 --> 00:25:41.510
here is exactly the same as
the spacing between tick marks

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.440
here.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.730
You may sort of think well,
that's a result or an idea

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:50.270
worthy of the journal Duh, but
it's important to specify this.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.520
You want to make sure that
the standard you are using

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.000
to define length is the same
in this region of spacetime

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.463
as it is over in this
region of spacetime.

00:25:58.463 --> 00:26:00.380
When we start getting
into general relativity,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.750
we start to see there can be
concerns about this coming

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.090
about, so it's worth
spelling it out and making

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.718
it clear at the beginning.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.280
I'm also going to require
that my clocks tick uniformly.

00:26:31.978 --> 00:26:33.520
We're going to make
this lattice that

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.590
fills all of spacetime
using the best

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.450
thing that Swiss
engineers can make for us,

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.380
we want to make sure that one
second, an interval of one

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.660
second, is the same
here in this classroom

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.940
as it is somewhere off
in the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.730
We want to make sure that there
is no evolution to the time

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.280
standard when we do this.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.870
Finally, I'm going to
synchronize all these clocks

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.820
with each other in
the following way.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.040
This is going to use the
Einstein synchronization

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:13.996
procedure.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.430
This is the first place
where a little bit of physics

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.560
is actually beginning to
finally enter our discussion.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.463
I'll comment that--

00:27:30.463 --> 00:27:32.380
I'm going to go through
what this procedure is

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.470
in just a second.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.210
But an Easter egg here.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.963
Whenever you see a name
that has Einstein in it,

00:27:38.963 --> 00:27:40.380
your ears should
perk up a little.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.630
Because it probably means
this is something important.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.270
This is, after all, a
course in relativity,

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.300
and that tends to be the
things that end up mattering.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.540
Even when they end up
being really easy to--

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.840
things we look at now and
kind of see as fairly obvious,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.350
it's important, OK, and we often
attach Einstein's name to this.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.680
So this Einstein
synchronization procedure, this

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.502
takes advantage of the fact--

00:28:07.502 --> 00:28:09.960
and by the way, we're not going
to teach special relativity

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.543
in this course, 8.962.

00:28:11.543 --> 00:28:13.710
I assume you have already
studied special relativity

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.460
and you're all experts in this,
and so I can freely borrow

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.680
from its important results.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:29.440
This procedure takes
advantage of the fact

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:42.380
that the speed of light is
the same to all observers,

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.152
no matter what
inertial reference

00:28:44.152 --> 00:28:45.110
frame they might be in.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:56.980
So the speed of light
is a key invariant.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.410
It connects--
because it's a speed,

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.050
it connects space and
time, and because it

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:07.360
is the same to all observers,
it defines a particular standard

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.360
for relating space
and time that is

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.450
going to have important
invariant meaning associated

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.822
with it.

00:29:14.822 --> 00:29:16.780
Just to remind you what
this means-- let's see,

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.633
do I have a laser
pointer with me?

00:29:18.633 --> 00:29:20.050
I might, but don't
worry about it.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.700
I have a pretend laser pointer.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.650
My chalk's a laser pointer.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.150
I point my laser
pointer at the wall

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.120
and you all see it dashing
across the room at 300,000

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.950
kilometers per second.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.640
I then start jogging at half the
speed of light, as is my wont,

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.233
and continuing to point that,
you guys measure the light

00:29:36.233 --> 00:29:37.150
going across the room.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.330
You still measure 300,000
kilometers per second.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.990
I, on the other hand,
measure the light

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.490
coming out of my
laser pointer and I

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.630
get 300,000
kilometers per second.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.600
So just because my
laser pointer is

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.913
moving at half the speed
of light according to you

00:29:51.913 --> 00:29:53.830
doesn't mean the light
that's coming out of it

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.485
is boosted to a higher speed.

00:29:55.485 --> 00:29:56.860
If you studied
special relativity

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.260
you'll know that its energy
is boosted to a higher energy

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.610
level, but the speed of
light is always just C.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.440
So we're going to
take advantage of that

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.270
to come up with a way of
synchronizing our clocks.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.620
The way it works is this.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.310
So let's look at a two
dimensional slice of my lattice

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.810
here.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.600
Time, and let's make
this be the x-axis.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:28.390
And so I will have, let's say,
this is where clock one exists

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.855
and this is where
clock two exists.

00:30:34.635 --> 00:30:36.010
Let's go into the
reference frame

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.530
that is at rest with
respect to this lattice.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.950
We want to synchronize
clock one with clock two.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.580
So as time marches on,
these guys stand still.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.710
So here's the path
in spacetime--

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.920
the world line, traced
out by clock one.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.280
Here's the clock path in
spacetime, the world line,

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.480
traced out by clock two.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:03.280
So let's say-- let's
call this event--

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:09.100
let's say that this event
happens at a time t1e.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.840
t1 is when clock one
emits a pulse of light.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.730
So this light will just follow
a little trajectory a bit

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.020
through spacetime.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:44.110
This goes out and strikes
clock two at which point

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:48.070
it is bounced back to clock one.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.150
Let's ignore this point
for just a second.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.990
So let's just say for the
moment that this is then

00:31:52.990 --> 00:32:08.010
reflected back and then it
is received back at clock one

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.680
at a time t1r.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.760
Let's make this a
little bit neater.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.340
t1e, t1r.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.300
Clock one receives
the reflected pulse.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:40.510
So the moment at
which it bounces,

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:48.450
we'll call that t2b, that is
the moment at which the light

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.890
bounces off of clock two.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:52.440
And the way we
synchronize our clocks

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.970
is just by requiring
that this be

00:32:53.970 --> 00:33:03.090
equal to the average of the
emission and the reception

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:03.810
time.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.940
Totally trivial idea, right?

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.510
All I'm saying is I'm
going to just require that

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.310
in order for clock
one and clock two

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.180
to be synchronized
to one another,

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.460
let's make sure that when I
bounce light between any two

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.430
pairs of clocks they
are set such that when

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.560
the light bounces
it's the midway point

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.020
between the total light--

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.000
the halfway of the
total light travel

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.850
time that the light moves along.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.190
Very, very simple concept.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:33.810
So there's nothing
particularly deep

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.543
here, but notice Einstein's
name is attached to this.

00:33:36.543 --> 00:33:37.710
And I don't say that to be--

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:39.960
I'm not being sarcastic.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.460
It really points
to the fact that we

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.000
are using one of the
most fundamental results

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.800
of special relativity
in designing

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.910
how these clocks work in this
inertial reference frame.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:55.680
Believe it or not, this thing,
this really simple concept, it

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.440
comes back to sort of bite us
on the butt a little bit later

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.550
in this course.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.280
Because when we throw
gravity into the mix,

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.080
we're going to
learn that gravity

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.560
impacts the way light
travels through spacetime.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.500
We're going to get to some
objects where gravity is

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.150
so strong that light
cannot escape them.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.830
And we're going to find
that our perhaps most naive

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.940
ways of labeling time in the
spacetime of such objects

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.489
kind of goes completely haywire.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.949
Fundamentally, the reason
why time is going haywire

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.989
when you have really
strong gravity

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:30.510
is because we use
light as our tool

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.300
for synchronizing
all of our clocks,

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.889
and if the way that light
moves in your space time

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.110
is affected, the way
you're going to label time

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.590
is going to be affected.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:41.370
So this is a very
simple concept.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.620
Again, I sort of emphasize
these first couple lectures

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.929
you're swatting a mosquito
with a sledgehammer,

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.760
but we're setting
up this edifice

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.260
because this will
come back and it's

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.760
important to bear
this in mind when

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.949
things get a little
more interesting later

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.860
in the course.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.250
So let's start setting up
some geometrical objects here.

00:35:06.808 --> 00:35:08.600
Pardon me, let me do
one other thing really

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.340
quickly before I start setting
up some geometrical objects.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:15.290
So when I sketched this thing
called a spacetime diagram

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.950
here, I should have talked
a little bit about the units

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.200
that I'm going to
use to describe

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.660
the ticking of my clocks and
the spacing of tick marks

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.560
on my measuring rods.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.990
What we will generally
do in this course

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:47.270
is choose the basic
unit of length

00:35:47.270 --> 00:36:02.050
to be the distance light travels
in your basic unit of time.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:10.580
While you parse that sentence,
what that's basically saying is

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.450
suppose I set my clock so
that they tick every second.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.090
Well, if my clocks
tick once per second,

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.060
then my basic unit of length
will be the light second.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.380
Do you want to put this
into more familiar units?

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.160
That's about 300,000 kilometers.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.933
One of my personal favorites--

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:59.640
if the time unit
is 1 nanosecond,

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:05.760
the length unit is, of course,
one I will call it LNS--

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.930
Light Nanosecond.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.440
Students who are in
8.033 with me are not

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.273
allowed to answer this
question, does anyone

00:37:13.273 --> 00:37:17.330
know what one light
nanosecond is?

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:20.060
Actually, this is a
little bit ridiculous.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.080
But to within far greater
than a percent accuracy

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.940
it is one foot.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.000
The English unit that comes
on these asinine rulers

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.950
that those of us educated
the United States

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:34.040
learned in all of our European
friends sneer at us about.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.660
The speed of light is
to incredible precision

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.537
1 foot per nanosecond.

00:37:44.508 --> 00:37:46.300
To be fair, let's make
that a wiggly equal.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.170
So what this means is
that in the units that I'm

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:59.590
going to be working
with, if I then

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:03.685
want to express the speed
of light in these units--

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:22.360
So C is one light time
unit per time unit, which

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.640
we are just going to call 1.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.460
So we will generally set the
speed of light equal to 1.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.410
Just bear in mind what
this essentially means

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.618
is that you can think of,
if you want to then convert

00:38:31.618 --> 00:38:35.530
to your favorite meters per
second, furlongs per fortnight,

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.380
whatever it is that you're
most comfortable with,

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.670
C is effectively a
conversion factor then.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.870
And so what this means
is that when we do this

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.792
all velocities that we measure
are going to be dimensionless.

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:49.750
Really what we're doing
is we're measuring them

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.208
as fractions of
the speed of light.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.600
Now, with this system
of units defined,

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.490
let's talk about a
geometric object.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:18.640
So let's imagine
that O is an observer

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:25.190
in the inertial
reference frame that I

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.390
defined a few moments ago.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.810
This is a mouthful to say,
it's even more of a mouthful

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.710
to write, so I'm going to
typically abbreviate this IRF.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.360
So o observes two
events, which I

00:39:53.360 --> 00:40:14.710
will label P and Q. I'll just
go to a clean board for this.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:37.363
So let's say here in
spacetime-- so imagine

00:40:37.363 --> 00:40:39.280
I've got coordinate axes
that have been drawn,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.720
it's going to be
three dimensional,

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.053
for simplicity I'm not going
to actually write them out.

00:40:43.053 --> 00:40:50.650
Let's say I've got event P
here and event Q over here.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.792
Now if we were just doing
Euclidean geometry in three

00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:55.750
space, you guys have all
known that once you've

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.490
got two events written
down on a plane

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.795
or in a three dimensional
space, something

00:40:58.795 --> 00:41:01.212
like that, you can define the
displacement vector from one

00:41:01.212 --> 00:41:01.858
to the other.

00:41:01.858 --> 00:41:03.650
We're going to the same
thing in spacetime.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.100
So let's call delta x--

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.770
and I'm going to make a comment
on notation in just a moment--

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:34.300
this is the displacement
in spacetime from P to Q.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.400
We're going to
define the components

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:45.220
of this displacement vector
as seen by O. So when

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:51.190
I write equals with a dot on it
that means the geometric object

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.380
that I've written on
the left hand side

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.760
is given according
to the specified

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.090
observer by the following
set of complements, which

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.490
I'm about to write down.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:18.910
So this looks like so.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.935
So, couple things that I want to
emphasize that I'm introducing

00:42:24.935 --> 00:42:26.310
here, bits of
notation that we're

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.860
going to use over and
over again in this term.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.340
Notice I am using an
over arrow to denote

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.770
a vector in spacetime.

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.600
Different texts,
different professors

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.700
use slightly different
notations for this.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:42.150
Those of you who took 8.033
at MIT with Sal Vitale he

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.930
preferred to write a little
under tilde when he wrote that.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.810
For us working in four
dimensional space time,

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.250
it is going to be of
paramount importance to us,

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.820
and so we're going to use this
over arrow which you probably

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.250
have all seen for ordinary
three dimensional vectors.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.700
For us it's going to represent
a four dimensional vector.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:04.290
Now in truth we're not going
to use it all that much

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:07.190
after the first couple
of weeks of the class,

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.970
our first couple lectures even.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.220
Occasionally we'll
bust it out, but we

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:25.180
will tend to use a more
compact notation in which we

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:33.040
say delta x, that displacement
factor has the components

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:42.610
delta x mu, where mu lies
is in either t, x, y, and z,

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:48.195
or 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:43:48.195 --> 00:43:49.570
When we set up a
problem, we need

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.380
to make a mapping to what
the numerical correspondences

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:52.880
between--

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.760
I need to tell you that mu
equals 0 corresponds to time,

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.913
and mu equals 1
corresponds to x.

00:43:59.913 --> 00:44:01.580
We'll switch to other
coordinate systems

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.180
and I'll have to be careful
to say, almost always,

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.460
mu equals 0 will be time.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.877
But what the other
three correspond to,

00:44:08.877 --> 00:44:10.460
that depends on the
coordinate system.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.627
It might be a radius, it
might be a different angle,

00:44:12.627 --> 00:44:15.130
some things like that.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.920
Again, just sort of being
a little overly cautious

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.960
and careful defining these.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:27.210
I will note, though, that
generally Greek indices

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:38.390
in most textbooks,
they tend to be used

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.220
to label spacetime indices.

00:44:45.155 --> 00:44:46.530
And then there
are times when you

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.510
might want to just
sort of imagine

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.120
you've chosen a
particular moment in time,

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.030
and you want to look at what
space looks like at that time.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:45:10.750
And so you might then
go down to Latin indices

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:14.450
to pick out spatial components
at some moment in time.

00:45:32.373 --> 00:45:34.290
We'll see that come up
from time to time, just

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.248
want you to be aware
there is this distinction.

00:45:36.248 --> 00:45:37.840
And as you read other
textbooks, there

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.300
are a few others that are used.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.785
Always just check,
usually in some

00:45:41.785 --> 00:45:43.660
of the introductory
chapters of the textbook,

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.587
they will define these
things very carefully.

00:45:45.587 --> 00:45:47.920
Wald is an example of someone
who actually does anything

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.878
a little bit different.

00:45:48.878 --> 00:45:53.140
He tends to use lower
case Latin letters

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.670
from the top of the alphabet
to denote spacetime indices,

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:03.460
and those from i, j, k, he uses
them to denote Latin indices.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.880
If you're old
enough to get this,

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.110
this is often called by some of
us who grew up in the Dark Ages

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.240
it is sometimes called
the Fortran convention.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.210
If you've ever programmed in
Fortran, you know why that is.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.250
If you didn't, please
don't bother learning it,

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.820
it's really not worth the
brain cells it would take.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.970
So we've got this
geometric object

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.698
that is viewed by observer o.

00:46:25.698 --> 00:46:28.240
Let's now think about what this
looks like from the viewpoint

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.860
of a different observer.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.730
A different inertial observer.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.800
Let's say somebody comes
dashing through the room here,

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.990
and observer o sees them running
across the room at something

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.050
like 87% of the speed of light.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.090
You know, since,
as I have assumed,

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:12.890
you are all experts
in special relativity,

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:16.640
that they will measure intervals
of time and intervals of space

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.650
differently than
observer o does.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:33.570
So here's event P. Here's
event Q. Here is delta x.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:39.180
This is all as measured
by observer o bar.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.110
Something which I really
want to strongly emphasize

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:51.800
at this point is that this
P, this Q, and this delta x,

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.250
notice I haven't put
bars on any of them.

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.210
I haven't put primes
or anything like that.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:01.310
It is the exact same P and Q
and delta x as this over here.

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:11.790
That is because P, Q, and delta
x are geometric objects whose

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:15.330
meaning transcends the
particular inertial reference

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:20.320
frame used to define the
coordinates at which P exists,

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.860
at which Q exists, and that
then defined the delta x.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.670
These geometric objects
exist independent

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:33.186
of the representation.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:46.040
If I can use an
intuitive example--

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.370
if I take and I hold--
let's be careful the pose

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.190
I do with this-- let's
say I stick my arm out.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:56.493
I say that my arm is
pointing to the left, right?

00:48:56.493 --> 00:48:57.910
You guys will look
at this and say

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:59.360
your arm is pointing
to the right,

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.985
because you're using a slightly
different system of coordinates

00:49:01.985 --> 00:49:04.600
to orient yourself in this room.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.890
We're both right.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:09.100
We have represented this
geometric object, my arm,

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.070
in different ways.

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:12.888
But me calling this
pointing to the left

00:49:12.888 --> 00:49:15.180
and you calling it pointing
to the right doesn't change

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.970
the basic nature of my arm.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:20.790
It doesn't mean
that my blood cells

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:23.410
changed because of something
like this happening.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:25.620
This has an
independent existence.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.620
In the same way,
this delta x, it

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.210
is the displacement,
these two events.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:32.280
This might be mosquito
lands on my head,

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.410
this might be me
smacking it with my hand,

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:36.870
or flying near my head and
me smocking with my hand.

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.480
Those are events that
exist independent of how

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.700
we choose to represent them.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.810
So the key thing is we
preserve that notion

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:48.240
of the geometric object's
independent existence.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.870
What does change is
the representation

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.100
that the two observers use.

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:06.485
So I'm going to jump to
this Greek index notation.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:22.450
And so what I'm going to say
is that according to observer o

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:30.780
bar, they are going to represent
this object by a collection

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.080
of components that are not the
same as the complaints that

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.092
are used by observer o.

00:50:36.092 --> 00:50:37.550
And to keep my
notation consistent,

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:44.280
let's play a little o
underneath this arrow.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.040
So this is just sort
of shorthand for delta

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.970
x is represented according
to o by those components.

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:55.750
Delta x is represented according
to o bar by these components.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.300
And again, since
I'm assuming you all

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.610
are experts in
special relativity,

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:04.830
we already know how to
relate the barred components

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.060
to the unbarred components.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.539
They're related by a
Lorentz transformation.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:40.480
So what we would say is delta
x is zero bar component, or t

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.050
bar, if you prefer.

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:43.600
It's given by gamma--

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.260
I will define gamma in just a
moment, you can probably guess.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.670
So I'm imagining
an observer that

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:56.035
is just moving along the x-axis
or the coordinate one axis.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.640
So what went on in
that transformation

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:51.390
I just wrote down is O bar
moves with v along spatial axis

00:52:51.390 --> 00:53:04.340
1 with speed v as seen
by O. And of course gamma

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:10.200
is 1 divided by square
root of 1 minus v squared.

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.460
Remember, speed of light is 1.

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.540
We don't want to be writing
this crap out every time we have

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.820
to transform different
representations,

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.990
so we're going to introduce
more compact notation for this.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.960
So we're going to
say delta x mu bar--

00:53:38.264 --> 00:53:40.270
this is what I get
when I sum over

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:45.760
index nu from 0 to 3 of lambda.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:51.840
Mu bar nu, delta x nu.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.447
So that's defining a
matrix multiplication, ,

00:53:54.447 --> 00:53:56.530
and you can read out the
components of this lambda

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:58.072
matrix from what
I've got over there.

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:21.850
And even better
yet, delta x mu bar

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:28.090
is lambda mu bar nu delta x nu.

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:30.630
So in this last line, if you
haven't seen this before,

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:33.703
I am using Einstein's
summation convention.

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:49.300
If I have an index that
appears in one geometric

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.260
object in the
downstairs position

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:53.050
and an adjacent
geometric objects

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.370
in the upstairs
position and it's

00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:00.520
repeated-- so repeated indices
in the upstairs and downstairs

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.400
position are assumed to be
summed over their full range,

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.110
from 0 to 3.

00:55:10.278 --> 00:55:12.320
We're going to talk about
this a little bit more,

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:15.230
what's going on with this, after
I've built up a little bit more

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.410
of the mathematical structure.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:19.310
In particular, what
is the distinction

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:22.286
between through the upstairs
and downstairs positions.

00:55:37.913 --> 00:55:39.330
Some of you might
be saying, well,

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.390
isn't one way of writing it what
we call a covariant component

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:44.820
and wasn't one a
contravariant component?

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.730
If you know those
terms, mazel tov.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:49.973
They're not actually
really helpful,

00:55:49.973 --> 00:55:51.390
and so I kind of
deliberately like

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:53.520
to use this more primitive
wording of calling it

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.380
just upstairs and downstairs.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.630
Because what we're going to
find, the goal of physics,

00:55:57.630 --> 00:56:00.240
is to understand the
universe in a way that

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.390
allows us to connect this
understanding to measurements.

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:05.940
And measurements don't
care about contravariant

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.460
versus covariant, and all
these things are essentially

00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:12.000
just ways of representing
objects with our mathematics

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.940
that is sort of a go between
from some of our physical ideas

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.920
to what can eventually
be measured.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.093
So covariant,
contravariant, eh, whatever.

00:56:20.093 --> 00:56:21.510
At the end of the
day, we're going

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:23.700
to see as we put these
sort of things together

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.940
it's how these terms connect
to one another that matters.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.285
The name is not that important.

00:56:30.285 --> 00:56:32.160
I do want to make one
little point about this

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.970
as I move forward.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:39.400
It is sort of worth
noting that if I

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:44.830
think of how I relate the
displacement components

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:48.040
according to my barred observer
relative to those as measured

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:54.460
by my unbarred observer, I
can think of this Lorentz

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:59.890
transformation matrix as what
I get when I differentiate

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:03.040
one representation's
coordinates with respect

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.700
to the other
representation's coordinates.

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.160
Kind of trivial in
this case, and when

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.870
we are doing special
relativity there

00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:13.120
is a particular form of
the Lorentz transformation

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.220
that we tend to
use, but I just want

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.280
to highlight this because
this relationship between two

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.068
different representations
of a reference frame

00:57:21.068 --> 00:57:23.110
is going to come up over
and over and over again.

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:25.120
This is a more general
form, this idea

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.500
that you are essentially
taking the derivative.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.000
You're looking at how one
representation varies according

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.230
to the other representation.

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:34.870
So using that to think
about how to move

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:37.910
between one inertial
reference frame to another

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:40.610
is going to be very
important to us.

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:43.175
This is a more general form.

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:01.320
I want to make
one further point,

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:06.330
and then I will introduce a
more careful definition of what

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:08.910
is meant by a vector
and I think that will

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:11.140
be a good place for us to stop.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.130
So when I look at
this particular form--

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:16.260
so let's look at the
last thing I wrote there,

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.196
where I use the Einstein
summation convention.

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.800
This is just a chance for me
to introduce a little bit more

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.985
terminology in notation.

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:35.580
So when I wrote down
the relationship delta

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:45.670
x mu bar with lambda
mu bar nu, delta x nu,

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:49.220
how I labeled the index
that I was summing over

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.729
is kind of irrelevant.

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:14.460
This is exactly the same as
lambda mu bar alpha delta

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.960
x alpha.

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:22.400
I can switch to
something else if you

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.830
have enough fonts available.

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.950
You can use smiley faces
as your index, whatever.

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:32.280
The key bit is that as long
as you are summing over it,

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.292
it's kind of irrelevant
how you label it.

00:59:34.292 --> 00:59:36.750
I think that looks silly, so
I'm going to go back to alpha.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:54.020
When I have an index like that
that is being summed over,

00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:56.840
it's going to sort of disappear
at the end of my analysis.

00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.510
Its only role is to
serve as a place holder.

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:02.510
It allows me to keep
things lined up properly

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.490
so that I can do a particular
mathematical operation.

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:20.140
So in this equation, nu or
alpha is called a dummy index.

01:00:25.778 --> 01:00:27.320
Now, when I'm doing
it with something

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.200
like this, where I'm just
relating one set of one

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.020
indexed objects to another
set of one indexed objects,

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.067
it's kind of trivial to
move these things around.

01:00:35.067 --> 01:00:37.400
We're going to make some much
more complicated equations

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.270
later in this class, and
we'll find in those cases

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.020
that sometimes it's
actually really useful

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.120
to have the freedom to
relabel our dummy indices.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.070
It allows us to sort
of pick out patterns

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.730
that might exist
among things and see

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:53.280
how to simplify a relationship
in a really useful way.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.060
On the other hand, I
do not have the freedom

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.060
to change that mu bar
that appears there, right.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.340
I have to have
that being the same

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.030
on both sides of the equation.

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:07.730
Because I'm free to mix
around things where it's just

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:11.020
going to be summed over
and not play a role,

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.600
but in this my mu bar--

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.250
pardon me for a second--

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:20.440
mu bar is not a dummy index, and
so I do not have that freedom.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:31.660
We sometimes call
this the free index.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.150
As I write that down, it seems
like a bit of a strange name,

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:39.608
actually, and it's
really not free.

01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:41.755
You're actually constrained
in what it can be.

01:01:41.755 --> 01:01:43.880
What can I say, probably
there's some history there

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.880
that I don't know about.

01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:01.290
So let's do our last
concept for the day.

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:11.370
So let's carefully define
a spacetime vector.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.720
So a spacetime vector is going
to be any quartet of numbers,

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:55.390
those numbers we will call
components, which transforms

01:02:55.390 --> 01:03:00.242
between inertial
reference frames

01:03:00.242 --> 01:03:01.450
like the displacement vector.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:19.490
So if I represent some
spacetime vector A

01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:25.740
as some collection of
numbers that as observed by o

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.580
has components A0, A1, A2, A3.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:42.430
If a second inertial observer
relates their components

01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:43.300
to these by--

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.798
if that describes the components
for the observer o bar,

01:04:07.798 --> 01:04:08.590
then it's a vector.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.740
If you have taken
any mathematics,

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.950
they carefully
defined vector spaces,

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.520
this should be familiar to you.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.460
It's a very similar
operation to what

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:38.700
is done in a lot of
other kinds of analysis.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.020
The key to making this notion
of a vector a sensible one

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.830
is this transformation law.

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:52.950
So if I had a quartet of
numbers, which is say,

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:57.090
the number of batteries
in my pocket, the number

01:04:57.090 --> 01:05:01.440
of times my dog sneezed this
morning, how many toes I

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.827
have on my left foot, and--

01:05:02.827 --> 01:05:04.410
I'm sick of counting
so let's just say

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:07.020
0 for the fourth component--

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:10.020
that does not transform
between reference frames

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.680
by a Lorentz transformation.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.250
It's just a collection
of random numbers.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:16.530
So not any old
quartet of numbers

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:18.600
will constitute the
components of a vector.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.810
It has to be things that have
a physical meaning that you

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.852
connect to what you measure
by a Lorentz transformation.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:32.850
For it to be a good vector,
it also has to-- that A

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:36.030
has to obey the various
linearity laws that

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:37.570
define a vector space.

01:05:48.090 --> 01:06:02.160
So if I had two vectors
and I add them together,

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.620
then their sum is a vector.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:16.875
If I have a vector and I
multiply it by some scalar--

01:06:27.572 --> 01:06:29.530
by the way, you have to
be a little bit careful

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.730
when I say scalar here,
because you might think

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:36.700
to yourself something
like, you know,

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.570
the mass of my shoe,
that's a scalar.

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:42.060
But you be careful when
you're talking about things

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.250
in relativity, whether the
scale you're dealing with

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:47.622
is actually a quantity
that is Lorentz in variant.

01:06:47.622 --> 01:06:49.830
With quantity like mass, if
you're talking about rest

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.630
mass-- we'll get into the
distinction among these things

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:52.000
a bit later--

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:52.830
OK, you're good.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:56.880
You just have be
careful to pick out

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.430
something that actually
is the same according

01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:03.790
to all observers.

01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:09.850
So when I say scalar, this
means same to all observers.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.100
If this is the case,
then I can define

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:24.180
D to be that scalar times a
vector and it is also a vector.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.130
Question?

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:26.010
Oh, stretching, OK.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.720
I think, actually, I'm
going to stop there.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.590
There is one topic
that I just don't

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:42.925
feel like I can get enough of it
for it to be useful right now,

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:43.550
so I think yes.

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:45.620
I'm going to stop
there for today.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:48.430
When we pick it up
on Thursday we're

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:51.050
going to wrap up this
discussion of vectors--

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.550
again, I want to
kind of emphasize,

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:55.230
I can already see in some places
you're getting the 1,000 yard

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:55.730
stare.

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:59.358
There's no question we're
being excessively careful

01:07:59.358 --> 01:08:00.650
with some of these definitions.

01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:02.233
They are very
straightforward, there's

01:08:02.233 --> 01:08:03.650
nothing challenging here.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:07.460
But there will be a payoff
when we do get to times where

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.470
the analyses, the
geometries we're looking at,

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:12.440
get pretty messed up.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.410
Having this formal foundation
very carefully laid

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:17.520
will help us significantly.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.950
So all right, I'm going
to stop there for today,

01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:23.590
and we will pick
it up on Thursday.

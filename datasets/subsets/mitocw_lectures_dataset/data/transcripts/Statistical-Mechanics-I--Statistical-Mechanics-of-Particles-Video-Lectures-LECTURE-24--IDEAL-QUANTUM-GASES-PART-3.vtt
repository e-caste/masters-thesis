00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.620
PROFESSOR: We looked at
the macro state, where

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.915
the volume of the box, the
temperature were given,

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:35.620
as well as the
chemical potential.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.305
So rather than looking at a
fixed number of particles,

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.800
we were looking at the
grand canonical prescription

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.900
where the chemical
potential was specified.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.030
We said that when
we have a system

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.218
of non-interacting
particles, we can construct

00:00:53.218 --> 00:01:00.900
a many bodied state based on
occupation of single particle

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.984
states such that the action
of the Hamiltonian on this

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:11.450
will give me a sum over
all single particle

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.110
states, the occupation number
of that single particle

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.330
state times the energy of that
single particle state, and then

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.085
the state back.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.560
We said that in
quantum mechanics,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.210
we have to distinguish
between bosons and fermions,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.675
and in the occupation
number prescription.

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:52.260
For the case of fermions,
corresponding theta v minus 1

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.590
and k was 01.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.158
For the case of bosons,
corresponding theta

00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:02.116
plus 1 and k equals [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:14.450
We said that within this
planned canonical prescription,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.945
these occupation numbers
were independently given.

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:26.420
The probabilities
were independently

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.283
distributed according
to exponential rules

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:36.684
such that when we
calculated the average, nk.

00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:39.570
We commented on
the statistics what

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.221
are the very simple forms,
which was 1 over [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:49.820
into the beta
epsilon k minus eta,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.837
where z was constructed
from the temperature

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:57.827
and the temporal potential as
[INAUDIBLE] to the beta mu.

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.680
Now, for the case that
we are interested,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.491
for this gas that is
in a box of volume v,

00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:12.745
the one particle states
were characterized

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:16.435
by [INAUDIBLE] waves
and their energies

00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:19.800
were f h bar squared k squared
over 2m, basically just

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.140
the kinetic energy.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.750
And then at various
stages, we have

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.360
to perform sums over k's,
and for a box of volume v,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.289
the sum over k was
replaced in the limit

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:39.160
of a large box with an
integral over k times

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.851
the density of states, which
was v divided by 2 pi cubed.

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.710
And we said that
again, we recognized

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.580
that quantum particles have
another characteristic, which

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.330
is their spin, and there is a
degeneracy factor associated

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.300
with that that we can
just stick over here

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.920
as if we had [INAUDIBLE]
copies corresponding

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.130
to the different
components of the spin.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.640
Now, once we put this form
of epsilon k over here,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.670
then we can calculate what
the mean number of particles

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.310
is in the grand
canonical ensemble as sum

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.920
over k, the average nk, given
the appropriate statistics.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.280
Of course, this is a
quantity that is extensive.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.450
We then construct a
density, which is intensive,

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.870
simply by dividing by v, which
gets rid of that factor of v

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.148
over here, and we found
that the answer could

00:04:46.148 --> 00:04:52.700
be written as g over
lambda cubed, again,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.380
coming from this g, lambda cubed
from the change of variables,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.354
where we defined lambda
and h over root 2 pi mkp.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:16.370
And then a function that
we indicated by s 3/2,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.441
depending on the
statistics of z.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.570
And this was a member of
our class of functions

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.050
we defined in
general, f m h of z,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.535
to be 1 over m minus 1
factorial, integral 0

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:41.880
to infinity, ex, x to
the m minus 1, z inverse,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.110
e to the x minus eta.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.755
So for each m, we
have a function of z.

00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:52.550
In fact, we have two
functions, depending

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.510
on whether we are dealing
with the fermionic

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.590
or the bosonic variety.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.830
We saw that these
functions we could expand

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.953
for small z as z plus eta
z squared over 2 to the m.

00:06:08.953 --> 00:06:11.460
It's an alternating
series for fermions.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.802
All terms are positive for
bosons, zq, 3 to the m,

00:06:16.802 --> 00:06:21.194
eta z to the fourth, 4
to the m, and so forth.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.245
And we also noted
that these functions

00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:31.530
have a nice property
in that if you

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.190
were to take a derivative with
respect to z and multiply by z,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.006
you get the function
with one lower index.

00:06:38.006 --> 00:06:40.247
So this is, in
fact, the same thing

00:06:40.247 --> 00:06:44.978
as z divided by zz of
f m plus 1 [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:35.584
This just made the connection
between the number of particles

00:07:35.584 --> 00:07:37.000
and the chemical
potential that we

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.660
need to use when we go to the
grand canonical prescription,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.840
but we are interested in
calculating various properties

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.822
of this gas, such
as the pressure.

00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:50.880
We found that the
formula for the pressure

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.465
was simply g over lambda
cubed, very similar to what

00:07:55.465 --> 00:08:00.420
we had over here, except that,
rather than having f 3/2,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:07.220
we had f 5/2 of z to
deal with, and if we

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:13.050
were interested in energy,
we could simply use 3/2.

00:08:15.742 --> 00:08:20.795
Indeed, this was correct for
both fermions and bosons,

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:25.770
irrespective of the
difficulties or the variations

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.270
in pressure that you
would have, depending

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.400
on your bosons or fermions
due to [INAUDIBLE] gases.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.285
So what is the task
here, if you are

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:42.216
interested in getting
a formula for pressure

00:08:42.216 --> 00:08:45.370
or the energy or
the heat capacity?

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.380
What should we do if we are
interested in a gas that

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.970
has a fixed number of
particles or a fixed density?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.912
Clearly, the first
stage is to calculate

00:08:55.912 --> 00:08:59.800
z as a function of density.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:06.160
What we can do is to solve the
first equation graphically.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:14.510
We have to solve the
equation f 3/2 8 of z

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:20.030
equals the combination
m lambda cubed over g,

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.340
which we call the
degeneracy factor.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.270
So if I tell you what
the temperature is,

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.700
you know lambda.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.135
If I tell you what
the density is,

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:32.910
you know the combination
on the right hand side.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.110
There is this function.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.110
We have to plot this
function and find

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.800
the value of the
argument of the function.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.850
That gives the value of
m lambda cubed over g

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.200
as the value of the function.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.560
So graphically,
what we have to do

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:55.290
is to plot as a function of
z these functions, f 3/2.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:03.592
I will generically
plot f m 8 of z,

00:10:03.592 --> 00:10:06.930
but for the case that
we are interested,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.890
we really need to
look at m equals 3/2.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.000
As we will see in
problem set, if you

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.810
were to solve the
gas in d dimensions,

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.780
this m rather than the
3/2 would be g over 2.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.800
So pictorially, the
same thing would

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.510
work with slightly
different forms

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.180
of these functions in
different dimensions.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.270
How do these
functions look like?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:43.090
Well, we see that initially,
they start to be linear,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:49.120
but then, the case of the bosons
and fermions, the next order

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.020
term goes in
different directions.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.010
And in particular, for
the case of fermions,

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.710
the quadratic term
starts to bring you down,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.820
whereas for the case of
bosons, the quadratic term

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:09.640
is the opposite direction and
will tend to make you large.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.160
This is what these
functions look.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.280
For the case of fermions, I have
additional terms in the series.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.680
It's an alternating series.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.600
And then the question
is, what happens

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.560
to this at large values of z?

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.760
And what we found was
that at large values,

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.670
this function satisfies
the asymptotic form

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:41.690
that is provided by
Sommerfeld formula, which

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:47.150
states that f m of z, for the
case of fermions, so this is

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.790
eta equals minus 1,
is log z to the power

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.895
of m divided by m factorial.

00:11:54.895 --> 00:11:58.890
Of course, we are
interested in m goes to 3/2.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:07.490
1 plus pi squared
over 6 m, m minus 1,

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:14.980
log z squared, and higher order
inverse powers of log z, which

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.390
one can compute, but
for our purposes,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.060
these two terms are sufficient.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:29.960
And if I'm interested in doing
the inversion for fermions,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:36.420
what I need to do is to
plot a line that corresponds

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.680
to n lambda cubed
over g and find

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.740
the intersection of
that line, and that

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.870
would give me the value of z.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.415
When I'm very close
to the origin,

00:12:49.415 --> 00:12:52.310
I start with the
linear behavior,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.700
and then I can systematically
calculate the corrections

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.850
to the linear behavior, which
would have been z equals n

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.420
lambda cubed over g in higher
powers of n lambda cubed

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420
over g.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.620
And we saw that by doing
that, I can gradually

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.030
construct a visual
expansion that

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:14.670
is appropriate for these gases.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.790
I can do the same thing, of
course, for the case of bosons

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:23.060
also, but now I'm interested
in the limiting form where

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.510
the density goes higher and
higher or the temperature

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.030
goes lower and lower so that
this horizontal line that I

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:34.520
have drawn will go to
larger and larger values,

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.300
and I'm interested in the
intersections that I have

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.460
when z is large and this
asymptotic formula is

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.760
being satisfied.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:50.410
So what do I need to do for the
case of degenerate fermions?

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.850
I have this quantity, n lambda
cubed over g, which I claim

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:09.130
is much larger than
1, so I have to look

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:16.950
for values of the function, f
3/2 minus of z that are large,

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:21.520
and those values are achieved
when the argument is large,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.520
and then it takes the form
log z to the 3/2 divided

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:35.370
by 3/2 factorial, 1
plus pi squared over 6.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:40.160
m in this case is 3/2,
so I have 3/2 times m

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:47.660
minus 1, which is 1/2,
divided by log z over 2.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.560
And then I will have
potentially higher order terms.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:10.890
So I can invert this
formula to find log

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:15.730
z as a function of density.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.420
And to lowest order,
what I have is

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:29.710
3/2 factorial n lambda cubed
over g raised to the 2/3 power.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.450
If I were to ignore
everything here,

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.430
just arrange things
this way, that's

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.000
the formula that I would get.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.980
But then I have this
correction, so I divide by this.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.770
I have 1 plus-- this combination
is equivalent to pi squared

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:52.630
over 8, 1 over log z squared.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.370
I have taken it to the other
side, so I put the minus sign

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.615
and raise again
to the 2/3 power.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:12.980
Now, the way that I have defined
z up there, clearly log z

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.700
is proportional to beta nu.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:21.360
We can see that
lambda is proportional

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.600
to beta to the 1/2,
so lambda cubed

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.350
is beta to the 3/2, which,
when raised to the 2/3,

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.110
gives me a factor of beta.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:37.840
So basically, the quantity
that we have over here

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.610
is of the order of
beta, and then we

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.940
saw that the remainder,
which depends on properties

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.210
such as the mass
of the gas, gh, et

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:56.380
cetera, which is independent
of temperature, is a constant.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.440
That is the Fermi
energy that we can

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.720
compute by usual route
of filling up a Fermi c.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.819
And the value of
epsilon f is h bar

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:15.400
squared over 2m
times kf squared,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:21.430
and the kf was 6 pi squared
n over g to the 1/3 power,

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:26.510
so kf squared would be
something like this.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.230
So once we know the density
of the fermion, its spin

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.580
and its mass, we can figure
out what this quantity is.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.520
The zeroth order solution
for the chemical potential

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.520
is clearly this epsilon f.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.400
What do I have to do
if I want to calculate

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.372
the next correction?

00:17:58.372 --> 00:18:02.420
Well, what I can do is I
can put the zeroth order

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.800
solution for log z
in this expression,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.910
and then that will give me
the first order correction.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.940
I have to raise this whole
thing to the minus 2/3 power,

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:18.470
so pi squared over 8
becomes 1 minus 2/3

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.340
of pi squared over h, which
is minus pi squared over 12.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:32.595
1 over log of z squared--
log z is again mu over kt,

00:18:32.595 --> 00:18:38.540
so its inverse is kt
over the zeroth order

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:45.850
value of mu, which is epsilon
f raised to second power,

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.753
and we expect that there
will be higher order terms.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.710
So what have I stated?

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.680
If I really take
this curve and try

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:14.290
to solve for mu as a function
of temperature for a given

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:24.030
density, I find that at
very low temperatures,

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:31.460
the value that I
get is epsilon f,

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.070
and then the value
starts to get reduced

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.060
as I go to higher temperatures
and the initial fall

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.980
is quadratic.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.100
Of course, the function will
have higher and higher order

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.760
corrections.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.310
It will not stay quadratic.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:51.130
And I also know that
at very large values,

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:57.320
it essentially converges
to a form that is minus

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:04.270
kt log of n lambda cubed,
because down here, I

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:09.550
know that this solution is z is
simply n lambda cubed over g.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.910
So at low densities and high
temperatures, basically,

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.970
I will have something
that is almost

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.800
linear with logarithmic
corrections and negative,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:24.160
and so presumably, the function
looks something like this.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.350
Of course, I can always convert.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.590
We can say that
what I see here is

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.710
the combination of
kt over epsilon f.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.835
I can define epsilon f
over kv to be something

00:20:43.835 --> 00:20:47.820
that I'll call tf,
and this correction

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.340
I can write as t
over tf squared.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.456
So basically, I have
defined epsilon f

00:20:54.456 --> 00:20:57.580
to be some kv times
a Fermi temperature.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.730
Just on the basis of
dimensional argument,

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:12.500
you would expect that the place
where this zero is occurring

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.090
is of the order of this tf.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.820
I don't claim that
it is exactly tf.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.420
It will have some
multiplicative factor,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.080
but it will be of
the order of tf,

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.890
which can be related
to the density, mass,

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.420
and other properties of
the gas by this formula.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.540
And if you look at a
metal, such as copper,

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.820
where the electrons are
approximately described

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:43.120
by this Fermi gas, this tf
is of the order of, say,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.660
10 to the 4 degrees Kelvin.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.110
Yes?

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.750
AUDIENCE: So you were saying
that at a high temperature,

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:57.380
the chemical potential
should go as minus kvt

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.430
times ln of n
lambda cubed, yeah?

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.490
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.460
AUDIENCE: Now, the lambda itself
has temperature dependence,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.130
so how can you claim that
it is behaving linearly?

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.530
PROFESSOR: I said
almost linearly.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.760
As you say, the correct behavior
is something like minus 3/2 t

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.120
log t, so log t
changes the exponent

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.660
to be slightly different from 1.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.490
This is not entirely linear.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.920
It has some curvature
due to this logarithm.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.800
In fact, something that people
sometimes get confused at

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:41.620
is when you go to high
temperatures, beta goes to 0.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.060
So why doesn't z go to 1?

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.280
Of course, beta goes
to 0 but mu goes

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.600
to infinity such that the
product of 0 and infinity

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.520
is actually still pretty
large, partly because

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.402
of this logarithm.

00:23:05.709 --> 00:23:08.044
AUDIENCE: Could you just
explain again why it's linear?

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.730
PROFESSOR: Down
here it is linear,

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:20.000
so I know that z is n
lambda cubed over g.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.480
z is e to the mu over kt.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:35.490
So mu is kt log of n
lambda cubed over g.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.420
Remember lambda
depends on temperature,

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:43.430
so it is almost linear, except
that really what is inside here

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.570
has a temperature dependence.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:50.485
So it's really
more like t log t.

00:23:50.485 --> 00:23:52.370
AUDIENCE: When z is small?

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.160
PROFESSOR: When z is small
and only when z is small,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.860
and z small corresponds
to being down here.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.800
Again, that's what I was saying.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:06.330
Down here, beta
goes to zero but mu

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:11.160
goes to minus infinity such
that the product of 0 and minus

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:17.110
infinity is still something that
is large and negative because

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.413
of this.

00:24:18.413 --> 00:24:22.200
AUDIENCE: If the product is
large, then isn't z large?

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.300
PROFESSOR: If the product
is large and negative,

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.130
then z is exponentially small.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:44.120
In fact, if I were to
plot this function just

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.770
without the higher
order corrections,

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.600
if I plot the function, kt
log of n lambda cubed over g,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:58.890
you can see that it goes
to 0 when the combination n

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:04.770
lambda cubed over g is
1 because log of 1 is 0.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.830
So that function by
itself, asymptotically this

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:14.730
is what I have, it will come
and do something like this,

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:21.100
but it really is not something
that we are dealing with.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.400
It's in some sense
the classical version.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.620
So classically, your mu
is given by this formula,

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.190
except that
classically, you don't

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.530
know what the volume factor
is that you have to put there

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.464
because you don't
know what h is.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.020
So that's the
chemical potential,

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.550
but the chemical
potential is really,

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.380
for our intents and
purposes, a device

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.740
that I need to put here
in order to calculate

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.260
the pressure, to calculate
the energy, et cetera.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.940
So let's go to the next step.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.860
We are again in this limit.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:16.020
Beta p is g over lambda
cubed f 5/2 plus z.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:25.100
That's going to give me g over
lambda cubed in the limit where

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.770
z is large-- we established that
z is large-- log z to the 5/2

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.940
divided by 5/2 factorial
using the Sommerfeld

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:41.910
expansion, 1 plus pi over 6.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.400
Now my m is 5/2.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.280
m minus 1 would be 3/2
divided by log z squared

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.720
in higher order terms.

00:26:59.769 --> 00:27:00.560
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.620
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.960
AUDIENCE: Why is that plus?

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.912
PROFESSOR: Because
I made a mistake.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.390
Just to make my life and
manipulations easier,

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.470
I'll do the following.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:26.070
I write under this
the formula for n

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:32.280
being g over lambda cubed,
f 3/2 minus z, which

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:38.050
is g over lambda
cubed log z to the 3/2

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:43.170
divided by 3/2 factorial,
1 plus-- I calculated

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:50.670
the correction-- pi
squared over 6 divided

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.950
by various combination,
which is pi squared over 8,

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.800
1 over log z squared.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:07.480
Now what I will do is to
divide these two equations.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.340
If I were to divide the
numerator by the denominator,

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.080
what do I get?

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:20.300
The left hand side
becomes beta p over n.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.200
The right hand side, I can
get rid of the ratio of log

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.500
z 5/2 to log z.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:32.310
3/2 is just one factor of log z.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:37.350
What do I have when I divide
5/2 factorial by 3/2 factorial?

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.960
I have 5/2.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.510
This division allows me to get
rid of some unwanted terms.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.840
And then what do I have here?

00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:00.270
This combination here is 5
pi squared over 8 minus 1 pi

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.290
squared over 8.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.710
Because of the division, I
will put a minus sign here,

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.240
so that becomes 4
pi squared over 8,

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.480
which is pi squared over 2.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.660
So I will get 1 plus
pi squared over 2,

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.290
and at the order
that we are dealing,

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:20.650
we can replace 1
over log z squared

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.690
with kt over epsilon f squared.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:44.800
Now, for log z over here,
I can write beta mu,

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.940
and for mu, I can write the
formula that I have up here.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:58.970
So you can see that once I
do that, the betas cancel

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:04.080
from the two sides of the
equation, and what I get

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:11.270
is that p is 2/5,
the inverse of 5/2.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:15.990
The n I will take to the
other side of the equation.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.720
To the lowest
order mu is epsilon

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.515
f, so I will put epsilon f, but
mu is not exactly epsilon f.

00:30:25.515 --> 00:30:36.220
It is 1 minus pi squared over
12, kt over epsilon f squared.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.476
And actually, there was
this additional factor of 1

00:30:39.476 --> 00:30:45.250
plus pi squared over 2,
kt over epsilon f squared.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.770
So what do we find?

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:58.220
We find that to
the zeroth order,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:03.760
pressure is related
to the density

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:11.420
but multiplied by epsilon f, so
that even at zero temperature,

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.580
there is a finite
value of pressure left.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.590
So we are used to ideal
gases that are classical,

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.880
and when we go to
zero temperature,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.806
they start to stop
moving around.

00:31:21.806 --> 00:31:23.180
Since they are
not moving around,

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:28.430
there is no pressure that is
exerted, but for the Fermi gas,

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:32.390
you cannot say that all of the
particles are not moving around

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:37.805
because that violates this
exclusion of n being zero

00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:38.670
or one.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.520
You have to give particles
more and more momentum

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.670
so that they don't violate the
condition that they should have

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.030
different values of the
occupation numbers, the Pauli

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.160
exclusion.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.910
And therefore, even
at zero temperature,

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.610
you will have particles
that in the ground state

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.880
are zipping around, and
because they're moving around,

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.540
they can hit the wall
and exert pressure on it,

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.910
and this is the value
of the pressure.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.990
As you go to higher temperature,
that pressure gets modified.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.190
We can see that balancing
these two terms,

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.920
there is an increase
in pressure, which

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:27.688
is 1 plus 5 pi squared over
6, kt over epsilon f squared.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:42.100
So you expect the
pressure, if I plot it

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:48.195
as a function of temperature,
at zero temperature,

00:32:48.195 --> 00:32:53.400
it will have this
constant value, pf.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.420
As I put a higher
temperature, there

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.680
will be even more energy
and more kinetic energy,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.380
and the pressure will rise.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.190
Eventually, at very
high temperatures,

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.270
I will regain the
classical, rather

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.100
pressure is proportional
to temperature.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:24.230
That's the pressure of
this ideal Fermi gas.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:25.860
The energy.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.750
Well, the energy
is simply what we

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.940
said over here, always 3/2 pv.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:38.980
So it is 3/2, the pressure
over there multiplied

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:45.950
by v. When I multiply
the density by v,

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.650
I will get the
number of particles.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:56.480
3/2 times 5/2 will give me
3/5, so I will 3/5 and epsilon

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.930
f at the lowest order.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.790
Again, you've probably
seen this already

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:10.880
where you draw diagrams
for filling up a Fermi c.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.900
Up to some particular
kf, you would

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.600
say that all states
are occupied.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:23.810
When epsilon f is the
energy of this state that

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:28.110
is sitting right at the
edge of the Fermi c,

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.889
and clearly, the
energies of the particles

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:36.389
vary all the way from
zero up to epsilon f,

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:41.060
so the average energy is going
to be less than epsilon f.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.560
Dimensionally, it works
out to be 3/5 of that.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.750
That's what that says.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.540
But the more
important part is how

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.949
it changes as a
function of temperature.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:35:00.360
What you find is that it goes
to 1 plus 5 pi squared over 6,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.140
kt over epsilon f squared
in high order terms.

00:35:07.795 --> 00:35:08.586
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:35:08.586 --> 00:35:11.630
Should the 6 be 12?

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.240
PROFESSOR: 6 should be 12?

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.570
Let's see.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:23.560
This is 6/12 minus
1/12 is indeed 5/12.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.532
Thank you.

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:42.630
So if I ask what's the heat
capacity at constant volume,

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:49.060
this is dE by dT, so just
taking the derivative.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.110
The zeroth order term,
of course, is irrelevant.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.400
It doesn't vary the temperature.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.770
It's this t squared that
will give you the variations.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.190
So what does it give me?

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:04.680
I will have n epsilon f.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:11.810
I have 3/5 times 5
pi squared over 12.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.070
The derivative of
this combination

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:22.500
will give me 2kb squared t
divided by epsilon f squared.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.340
There will be, of
course, higher order,

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.130
but this combination you can
see I can write as follows.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.510
It is extensive.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:35.710
It is proportional to n.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:39.720
There is one kb that I can
take out, which is nice,

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.850
because natural units
of heat capacity,

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.610
as we have emphasized, are kb.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.590
This combination of numbers,
I believe the 5 cancels.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:56.030
3 times 2 divided
by 12 gives me 1/2,

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.710
so I have pi squared over 2.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.350
And then I have the
combination, kt over epsilon

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.730
f, which I can also
write as t over tf.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:15.080
So the heat capacity
of the Fermi gas

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:19.140
goes to 0 as I go
to zero temperature,

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.320
in accord with the third
law of thermodynamics, which

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.810
we said is a consequence
of quantum mechanics.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:32.050
So we have this result,
that the proportionality

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:36.440
is given by the inverse of tf.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:42.700
If I were to plot the heat
capacity in units of nkb

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:48.400
as a function of t, at
very high temperatures,

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:53.460
I will get the classical
result, which is 3/2,

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.770
and then I will start to
get corrections to that.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.430
Those corrections will
gradually reduce this,

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:04.580
so eventually, the function
that I will get starts linearly

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.630
and then gets matched to that.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:12.650
So the linear behavior is
of the order of t over tf,

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.860
and presumably at
some temperature

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.160
that is of the order
of tf, you will

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.390
switch to some
classical behavior.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:29.810
And as I said, if you look at
metals, this tf is very large.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:33.410
So when you look at the
heat capacity of something

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:37.580
like copper or some
other metal, you

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.240
find that there is a
contribution from the electrons

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.815
to the heat capacity
that is linear.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.750
Now, the reason for
this linear behavior

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.730
is also good to understand.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:56.890
This calculation that
I did is necessary

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.620
in order to establish what this
precise factor of pi squared

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.775
over 2 or appropriate
coefficient

00:39:03.775 --> 00:39:08.560
is, but the physical reason
for the linearity you

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.010
should be able to know.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:15.780
Basically, we saw that
the occupation numbers

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:20.310
for the case of fermions
have this form that

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:27.520
is 1 over z inverse, e
to the epsilon plus 1.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:38.980
If I plot the occupation
numbers as a function of energy,

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.050
for a case that is
at zero temperature,

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:45.635
you can see that the
occupation number is 1 or 0,

00:39:45.635 --> 00:39:49.810
so you have a picture
that is like this.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.130
You switch from 1
to 0 at epsilon f.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.890
Oops, there was a beta here
that I forgot, beta epsilon.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:08.360
When I go to finite
temperature, this becomes fuzzy

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.170
because this expectation
value for the number,

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:14.630
rather than being a
one zero step function,

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:19.040
becomes smoothed out,
becomes a function

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:27.040
such as this, and the width
over which this smoothing takes

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.910
place is of the order of kt.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:42.380
So what happens is that rather
than having this short Fermi c,

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:47.090
you will start having
less particles here

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:52.210
and more occupied
particles over here.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.300
To do that, you have
created energies

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.060
going from here to here
that you have stored

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.410
that is of the order of this kt.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.030
What fraction of
the total number

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.380
have you given this energy?

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:14.565
Well, the fraction
is given from here.

00:41:14.565 --> 00:41:19.230
It is the ratio of
this to the entirety,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.540
and that ratio is
t, or kt, divided

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:29.590
by epsilon f is
the fraction that

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.980
has been given energy this.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.290
So the excitation
energy that you have

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:39.840
is this number, the
total times this fraction

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.850
times the energy that
you have, which is kt.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:46.230
And if I take the
derivative of this,

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.490
I will get precisely
this formula over

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:51.670
here up to this factor
of pi squared over 2,

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:55.050
which I was very cavalier,
but the scaling everything

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.380
comes from this.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.120
And to all intents
and purposes, this

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.670
is the characteristic
of all Fermi systems,

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:08.990
that as you go to
low temperatures,

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:13.320
there is a small fraction
of electrons, if you like,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.180
that can be excited.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.780
That fraction goes to
0 at low temperatures

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:22.290
as kt over epsilon f, and the
typical energies that they have

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.060
is of the order of kt.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:29.590
So essentially, many of the
results for the degenerate

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:35.230
Fermi gas you can obtain
by taking classical results

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:38.390
and substituting for
the number of particles

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:41.710
nkt over epsilon f.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:45.330
You will see in the problem
set that this kind of argument

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:51.470
tells you something also
about the magnetic response

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:57.310
of a system of electrons,
what is the susceptibility

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:01.480
and why does the susceptibility
saturate at low temperatures.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.430
It's just substituting for
the number of particles

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.050
this fraction, nkt
over epsilon f,

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.240
will give you lots of things.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.990
This picture is also
valid in all dimensions,

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:19.230
whereas next, we'll be
discussing the case of bosons,

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.530
where the dependence
is on temperature.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.370
There is an exponent
here that determines

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.380
which dimension you are
or depends on dimensions.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:32.105
For the case of fermions, this
linearity exists independently.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.110
So now let's think
about bosons and what's

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:44.180
going to happen for bosons.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.980
For bosons, we saw that
the series, rather than

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.990
being alternating,
all of the terms

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:54.480
are adding up together so
that the parabolic correction,

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.110
rather than reducing
the function

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:01.130
for the case of bosons,
will increase it.

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:05.120
So for a particular
value of density,

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:11.640
we find that the z of fermions
is larger than the z of bosons.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.400
So for a given
density, what we will

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.850
find is that the chemical
potential, whereas for the case

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:24.300
of fermions was deviating from
the classical form by going up,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.540
for the case of
bosons, we'll start

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.735
to deviate from the
classical form and go down.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.930
Now, there is
something, however,

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:41.450
that the chemical potential
cannot do for the case

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:46.160
of bosons which it did it
for the case of fermions,

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.690
and that was to change sign.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.260
Why is that?

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.315
Well, we have that over
there, the occupation number

00:44:55.315 --> 00:45:01.480
for a boson is 1
over z inverse, which

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:06.500
is e to the beta
epsilon k minus mu.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.450
z inverse is e to the
minus meta mu minus 1.

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:17.480
Now, this result was
obtained from summing

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.970
a geometric series, and
the condition certainly

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:25.660
is that this object, that
is, the inverse of what

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.770
was multiplying different
terms in the series,

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:32.090
has to be larger than 1.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.410
Of course, it has
to be larger than 1

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:37.390
so that I get a positive
occupation number.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.850
If it was less than 1,
the geometric series

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.820
was never convergent.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:46.050
Clearly, the negativity
of the occupation number

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.520
has no meaning.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:55.600
So this being positive
strictly immediately implies

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:02.557
that mu has to be less
than epsilon k for all k.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.540
So it has to be certainly less
than the minimum of epsilon k

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:15.000
with respect to all k.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.700
And for the case that I'm
looking at where my epsilon

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:24.000
k's are h bar squared
k squared over 2m,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.350
the lowest one
corresponds to k equals 0,

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:32.930
so mu has to be less than 0.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:37.580
It can never go to the
other side of this.

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:42.420
Or alternatively, z
has to be less than

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.300
or approaches maybe 1.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.470
So there is certainly
a barrier here

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:56.870
that we are going to encounter
for the case of bosons at z

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:58.940
equals 1.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.200
We should not go
beyond that point.

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:19.196
So let's see what's
happening for z equals 1

00:47:19.196 --> 00:47:20.185
to this function.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.520
You see, my task
remains the same.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.700
In order to find z, I
have to solve graphically

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.350
for the intersection of
the curve that corresponds

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:46.870
to f plus 3/2 and the curve that
corresponds to the density n

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.630
lambda cubed over g.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:52.730
So what happens as I go to
higher and higher values

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.420
of n lambda cubed over g?

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.150
You can see one possibility
is that this curve just

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:02.020
diverges as z approaches 1.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.850
Then for every value of
n lambda cubed over g,

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.460
you will find some value
of z that will gradually

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.790
become closer and closer to 1.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:13.390
But is that the scenario?

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.580
For that, we need to know what
the value of this f function

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:27.840
is at z equals 1, so the limit
f m plus of z as z goes to 1.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.890
How do you obtain that?

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:35.810
Well, that is 1 over m minus
1 factorial, integral 0

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:44.770
to infinity, dx, x to the m
minus 1, z inverse, which is 1,

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:46.450
e to the x minus 1.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:54.040
I have to integrate
this function.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.050
The integrand, how
does it look like?

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:02.090
x to the m minus 1,
e to the x minus 1.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:04.770
Well, at large x,
there is no problem.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:06.365
It goes to 0 exponentially.

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:13.710
At small x, it goes to
0 as x to the m minus 2.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:19.800
So basically, it's
a curve such as this

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.350
that I have to integrate.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:27.710
And if the curve is like I have
drawn it, there is no problem.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.380
I can find the
integral underneath it

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.870
and there actually is a
finite value that has a name.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.920
It's called a zeta function, so
this is some tabulated function

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.560
that you can look at.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.280
But you can see that
if m, let's say, is 0,

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.490
then it is dx over x squared.

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:52.390
So the other
possibility is that this

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.710
is a function that diverges
at the origin, which

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:58.470
then may or may
not be integrable.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:07.800
And we can see that this
is finite and exists only

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:13.150
for m that is larger then 1.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:24.930
So in particular, we are
interested in the case

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:28.170
of m equals 3/2.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:32.160
So then at z equals 1,
I have a finite value.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.340
It is zeta of 3/2.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:44.010
So basically, the function will
come up to a finite value at z

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:48.650
equals 1, which is
this zeta of 3/2,

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.180
which you can look up in tables.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:59.610
It's 2.612.

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:06.010
Now, I tried to draw this
curve as if it comes and hugs

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:11.810
the vertical line tangentially,
that is, with infinite slope,

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.140
and that is the case.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.460
Why do I know that?

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:19.050
Because the derivative
of the function

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:23.750
will be related to the
function at one lower index.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:29.990
So the derivative of f
3/2 is really an f 1/2.

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.280
f 1/2 does not exist.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.490
It's a function that
goes to infinity.

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:40.394
So essentially, this curve
comes with an infinite slope.

00:51:40.394 --> 00:51:44.120
Now, it will turn out
that this is the scenario

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.710
that we have in
three dimensions.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:49.710
If you are in two dimensions,
then what you need to do

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:55.080
is look at f that corresponds
to m equals 2 over 2 or 1,

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:59.390
and in that case, the
function diverges.

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:05.050
So then, you have no problem in
finding some intersection point

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:08.850
for any combination of
n lambda cubed over g.

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:10.770
But currently in
three dimensions,

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.950
we have a problem because
for n lambda cubed

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:19.310
over g that falls
higher than zeta of 3/2,

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:24.940
it doesn't hit the
curve at any point,

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:29.110
and we have to interpret
what that means.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:44.100
So for d equals 3,
encounter singularity

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:52.780
when n lambda cubed
over g is greater than

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.760
or equal to zeta of 3/2.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:07.210
This corresponds at a fixed
density to temperatures

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:13.830
that are less than some critical
temperature that depends on n,

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:19.305
and that I can read
off as being 1 over kb.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.550
This is going to give
me a combination.

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:32.940
Lambda cubed is proportional
inversely to 3/2,

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:46.530
so this will give me nz
3/2 over g to the 2/3,

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:51.740
and then I have
h squared 2 pi m.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:53.695
I put the kb over here.

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:05.030
So the more dense
your system is,

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:13.050
the lower-- I guess that's why
I have it the opposite way.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:19.370
It should be the more dense it
is, the higher the temperature.

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:20.223
That's fine.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:30.920
But what does that mean?

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:38.210
The point is that if we go
and look at the structure

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:43.670
that we have developed,
for any temperature that

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:49.980
is high enough, or any density
that is low enough, so that I

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.270
hit the curve on
its continuous part,

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:57.930
it means that I can find the
value of z that is strictly

00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:01.670
less than 1, and
for that value of z,

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:08.040
I can occupy states according
to that probability,

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.830
and when I calculate
the net mean occupation,

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:15.260
I will get the actual density
that I'm interested in.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:22.540
As I go to temperatures
that are lower,

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.010
this combination goes up and up.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:34.010
The value of z that I have to
get gets pushed more towards 1.

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:39.830
As it gets pushed more towards
1, I see that mu going to 0,

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:46.718
the state that corresponds to
the lowest energy, k equals 0,

00:55:46.718 --> 00:55:47.884
gets more and more occupied.

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:55.460
But still, nothing special about
that occupation except what

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:59.080
happens when I am
at higher values.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.870
The most natural thing is that
when I am at higher values,

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:08.810
I should pick z equals
1 minus a little bit.

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:24.650
And if I choose z to be 1 minus
a very small quantity, then

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:28.470
when I do the
integration over here,

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:33.500
I didn't get a value
for the density, which

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.470
is g over lambda cubed,
the limiting value

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:41.130
of this f function,
which is zeta of 3/2.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:50.050
I will call this n star
because this is strictly

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:54.240
less than the total
density that I have.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.640
That was the problem.

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:59.550
If I could make up the total
density with z equals 1,

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:00.780
I would be satisfied.

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.160
I would be making
it here, but I'm not

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:10.770
making it up with the spectrum
that I have written over here.

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:16.000
But on the other hand, if
epsilon is incredibly small,

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.410
what I find is that the
occupation number of the k

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:25.840
equals to 0 state-- let's
write it n of k equals 0.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:26.670
What is that?

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:33.150
It is 1 over z inverse, which
is the inverse of this quantity,

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:36.280
which is 1 plus epsilon,
which is approximately

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:42.725
e to the epsilon minus 1.

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:51.510
Actually, maybe what I should
do is to write it in the form e

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:57.450
to the beta mu minus 1 and
realize that this beta mu is

00:57:57.450 --> 00:57:59.270
a quantity that is very small.

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:03.370
It is the same thing that I
was calling epsilon before.

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:08.770
And if it is very small, I can
make it to be 1 over beta mu.

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:20.195
So by making mu arbitrarily
close to the origin or epsilon

00:58:20.195 --> 00:58:24.340
mu arbitrarily close to
1, I could in principle

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:30.370
pump a lot of particles
in the k equals 0 state,

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:32.660
and that does not
violate anything.

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:36.470
Bosons, you can put as many
particles as you like in the k

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:39.160
equals 0 state.

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:46.090
So essentially, what I can do
is I can make this, but you say,

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:50.590
well, isn't this already
covered by this curve

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:51.760
that you have over here?

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.060
Are you doing
something different?

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:58.410
Well, let's follow this line
of thought a little bit more.

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:01.580
How much do I have to put here?

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:10.670
This n is the total number of
particles divided by volume,

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:19.030
and so this is going to be
this quantity, n star, which

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:27.270
is gv over lambda cubed
divided by volume.

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:35.140
Let's write it in this fashion,
z over lambda cubed zeta of 3/2

00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:39.670
and then whatever is left
over, and the leftover

00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:41.900
I can write as n0.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:54.680
So what we know is if
we take z equals 1,

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.140
this function will
tell me how many things

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:04.100
I have put in everything
except k equals 0

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.060
that I will
calculate separately.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.380
That amount is here.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:13.100
And I will put some
more in k equals 0,

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.340
and you can see
that the amount I

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:22.930
have to put there is going
to be n minus g over lambda

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:26.490
cubed zeta of 3/2.

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:28.310
Actually, I will have
to put a volume here.

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:34.880
Why is that?

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:43.350
The reason I have to put the
volume is because the volume

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:46.680
that I had here,
that ultimately I

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.660
divided the number of particles
by volume to get the density,

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.440
came from replacing the
sum with an integration.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.290
So what I have envisioned now
is that there are all of these

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:04.930
points that correspond
to different k's.

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:08.320
I'll replace the sum
with a integration,

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.266
but then there was
one point, k equals 0,

01:01:12.266 --> 01:01:13.515
that I am treating separately.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.650
When I'm treating
that separately, it

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:24.320
means that is really is the
same as the total number

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.210
expectation value without having
to divide by the volume, which

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:31.640
comes from this
density of state,

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.645
and I have something like this.

01:01:34.645 --> 01:01:38.860
Now, the problem is that you
can see that suddenly, you

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:43.410
have to pick a value
of mu that is inversely

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:45.500
proportional to the
volume of the system.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.410
This is a problem in which
the thermodynamic limit

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:03.210
is taken in this strange sense.

01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:08.800
You have all of these potential
values of the energy, epsilon

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.642
of k, that correspond to h bar
squared, k squared over 2m.

01:02:13.642 --> 01:02:18.970
There is one that is at 0, and
then choosing k equals 2 to pi

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:21.720
over l, you will have one
other state, another state,

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.680
all of these states.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.000
All of these states are
actually very finely spaced.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.790
The difference between
the ground state

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:34.990
and the first excited state
is h bar squared over 2m,

01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:36.730
2 pi over l squared.

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:41.480
So this distance over here is of
the order of 1 over l squared.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.250
But I see that in
order to occupy

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.610
this with the
appropriate number,

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:59.750
I have to choose my chemical
potential to be as close as 1

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:00.997
over the volume.

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.740
So in the limit where I
take the size of the system

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.960
go to infinity, this
approaches this.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.630
It never touches it, but the
distance that I have here

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:16.650
is much, much less
than the distance

01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:19.850
that I have in the spacings
that I made this replacement.

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:26.930
So I can indeed treat
these separately.

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:30.520
I can give a particular
weight to this state

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.510
where the mu has come this
close to it as 1 over v,

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:38.410
treat all of the
other ones as part

01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:41.640
of this replacement of the
summations with the integral.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.310
You can also see that this
trick is going to be problematic

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:50.970
if I were to perform it in
two dimensions, because rather

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:54.680
than 1 over l to
the third power,

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.380
that is, the volume
in three dimensions,

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.420
I would have had
1 over l squared.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.330
And indeed, that's
another reason

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.660
why two dimensions is special.

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.270
And as I said, in
two dimensions,

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:09.830
the curve actually does go
all the way to infinity.

01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:12.970
You won't have this problem.

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:15.220
So this is essentially
what happens

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:24.890
with this Bose-Einstein
condensation,

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:33.930
that the occupation number of
the excited state for bosons

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:37.730
is such that you encounter
a singularity in three

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:42.930
dimensions beyond a particular
density or temperatures

01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:46.530
lower than a certain amount
or highly degenerate case,

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:51.920
you have to separately treat
all the huge number of particles

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.445
that is proportional to the
volume that have now piled up

01:04:55.445 --> 01:04:59.870
in the single state, k equals 0,
the ground state in this case,

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.915
but whatever the
ground state may

01:05:01.915 --> 01:05:05.740
be for your appropriate
system, and all

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:11.930
the other particles go in the
corresponding excited states.

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:16.450
Now, as you go towards
zero temperature,

01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:18.120
you can see that
this combination

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.570
is proportional to
temperature goes to zero.

01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:25.780
So at 0 temperature,
essentially all of the particles

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:29.870
will need to be placed
in this k equals 0 state.

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:50.930
So if you like, a rough picture
is that the net density.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:03.200
This is the density,
n, at high temperature

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.860
is entirely made up as being
part of the excited state.

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:12.170
Let's draw it this way.

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:22.580
When you hit Tc, you find that
the excited state can no longer

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.290
accommodate the entire density.

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:26.580
This is a coordination
that, as we said,

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:31.440
goes to zero at zero
temperature as T to the 3/2.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.080
So there's a curve that
goes like T to the 3/2,

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.840
hits 1 at exactly Tc, which
is a function of the density

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.500
that you choose.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.640
This is the fraction that
corresponds to the excited

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.940
states.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.960
And on top of that, there
is a macroscopic fraction

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:54.720
that is occupying the
ground state, which

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.130
is the compliment to this curve.

01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:59.912
Basically, it behaves
something like this.

01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:08.110
One thing that I
should emphasize

01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:16.530
is that what I see here makes it
look like at high temperatures,

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:19.860
there is no occupation
of k equals 0 state.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.750
That is certainly not
correct because if you

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:26.250
look at this function
at any finite z

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.030
as a function of
epsilon, you can

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:30.240
see that the largest
value of this function

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.020
is still at epsilon equals 0.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.200
It is much more
likely that there

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.820
is occupation of the ground
state than any other state,

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:44.230
except that the fraction
that is occupying here,

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:47.770
when I divide by the total
number, goes to zero.

01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:50.980
It becomes macroscopic when
I'm below the BEC transition.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.990
Now, the properties of what
is happening in this system

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:06.310
below Tc is actually very
simple because below Tc,

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.240
the chemical potential
in the macroscopic sense

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.840
is stuck at 1.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.050
Essentially, what I'm saying
is that in this system,

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:17.950
the chemical
potential comes down.

01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:23.319
It hits Tc of n,
and then it is 0.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:26.340
Now of course, 0, as
we have discussed here,

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:32.600
if I put a magnifier here
and multiply by a factor of n

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.800
or a factor of
volume, then I see

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.710
that there is a distinction
between that and 0.

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:44.910
So it doesn't quite go
to 0, but the distance

01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:47.229
is of the order of
1 over volume or 1

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:49.100
over the number of particles.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.564
Effectively, from the
thermodynamic perspective,

01:08:51.564 --> 01:08:52.789
it is 0.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:00.920
But again, for the purposes
of thermodynamics, pressure,

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.560
everything comes
from the particles

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.360
that are moving around.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.149
The particles in the ground
state are frozen out.

01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:09.060
They don't do anything.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.950
So the pressure is very simple.

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:21.960
Beta p is g over lambda
cubed, f 5/2, eta of z

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.770
equals 1, which is some number.

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:29.770
It is g over lambda
cubed, the zeta

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:34.899
function at 5/2, which again
has some value that you can read

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:39.366
of in tables, 1.34,
something like that.

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:47.250
So you can see that this
lambda cubed is inversely

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:52.800
proportional to t to
the 3/2, so pressure

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.890
is proportional to t to the 5/2.

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:08.790
If I were to plot the pressure
as a function of temperature,

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:12.376
what I find is that
at low temperatures,

01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:17.350
the pressure is simply
given as t to the 5/2.

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:32.080
And you can see that this
pressure knows nothing

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.780
about the overall
density of the system

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:40.860
because this is a pure number.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.830
It is only a function of
temperature, mass, et cetera.

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:47.860
There is no factor
of density here.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.660
So what is happening?

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.870
Because we certainly
know that when

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:57.290
I am at very high temperatures,
ideal gas behavior

01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:59.090
dictates that the
pressure should

01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:02.720
be proportional to
temperature times density.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:09.240
So if I have two different
gases where the density here

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.176
is greater than
the density here,

01:11:13.176 --> 01:11:14.800
these will be the
form of the isotherms

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.920
that I have at
high temperatures.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:26.170
So what happens is that you
will start with the ideal gas

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:27.940
behavior.

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.100
We saw that for
the case of bosons,

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:33.090
there is some kind of an
effective attraction that

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:38.090
reduces the pressure, so the
pressure starts to go down.

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:45.260
Eventually, it will join
this universal curve

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:48.450
at the value that
corresponds to Tc of n2.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.860
Whereas if I see what's
happening with the lower

01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:00.245
density, at high
temperatures, again, I

01:12:00.245 --> 01:12:04.620
will have the linear behavior
of the ideal gas with a lower

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.280
slope because I have
a lower density.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.140
As I go to lower temperatures,
quantum corrections

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:14.520
will reduce the pressure.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.700
Eventually, I find
that this curve

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.400
will join my universal curve at
the point that would correspond

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.250
to Tc of n1, which in
this case would be lower.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.700
But beyond that, it will
forget what the density was,

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:36.146
the pressure would be the
same for all of these curves.

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:43.350
And I have kind of indicated,
or tried to indicate,

01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:48.970
that the curves join
here in a manner

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:53.750
that there is no
discontinuity in slope.

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:57.100
So an interesting
exercise to do is

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.990
to calculate derivatives
of this pressure

01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:02.610
as a function of
temperature and see

01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:05.720
whether they match coming
from the two sides.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.840
And you will find that if
you do the algebra correctly,

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.674
there is a matching of the two.

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:28.750
Now, if I have the pressure
as a function of temperature,

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:32.577
then I also have the energy as a
function of temperature, right?

01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:52.320
Because we know that
the energy is 3/2 PV.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.360
So if I know P,
I can immediately

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.150
know what the energy is.

01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:02.840
I know, therefore,
that in the condensate,

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.080
the energy is proportional
to T to the 5/2.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.935
Take a derivative, I know
that the heat capacity

01:14:09.935 --> 01:14:12.625
will be proportional
to T to the 3/2.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.980
That T to the 3/2 is a
signature of this condensate

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.720
that we have.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:30.430
Again, heat capacity will go to
0 as T goes to 0, as we expect.

01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:34.310
And as opposed to the
case of the fermions,

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:38.473
where the vanishing of the heat
capacity was always linear,

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:41.720
the vanishing of the
heat capacity for bosons

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:47.510
will depend on dimensions, and
this vanishing as T to the 3/2

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:51.390
is in general T to
the d over 2, as can

01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:56.000
be shown very easily by
following this algebra.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.650
I wanted to do a
little bit of work

01:14:58.650 --> 01:15:02.630
on calculating the heat
capacity because its shape is

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:03.830
interesting.

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:10.230
Let's write the formula a
little bit more accurately.

01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:30.490
I have 3/2 v. Pressure is
kTg over lambda cubed, f

01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:32.850
5/2 plus of z.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.515
This formula is valid,
both at high temperatures

01:15:40.515 --> 01:15:42.270
and at low temperatures.

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:44.430
At high temperatures,
z will be varying

01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:50.525
as a function of temperature.

01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:09.600
Let me also write the formula
for the number of particles.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:15.720
The number of particles
is V times g over lambda

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.920
cubed f 3/2 plus of z.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.520
Once more, I can get rid
of a number of things

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.680
by dividing these two.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:44.321
So the energy per
particle is 3/2 kT, f 5/2

01:16:44.321 --> 01:16:49.540
of z divided by f 3/2 of z.

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:52.255
Let's make sure I
didn't make any mistake.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.570
Now, I want to calculate the
heat capacity, let's say,

01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:15.228
per particle, which is d by
dT of the energy per particle.

01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:24.780
Now, I have one factor out
here, which is easy to evaluate.

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.380
There's an explicit
temperature dependence here,

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.990
so I will get 3/2 kb.

01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:45.260
I will have f 5/2 plus of z
divided by f 3/2 plus of z.

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.330
Something here
that I don't like.

01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:06.930
Everything that I have written
here is clearly valid only

01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:12.445
for T greater than Tc
because for T less than Tc,

01:18:12.445 --> 01:18:15.140
I cannot write n
in this fashion.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:18.950
So what I'm writing for you is
correct for T greater than Tc.

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:26.500
Point is that there is
also an implicit dependence

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:30.240
on temperature because z is
a function of temperature.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:38.010
So what I can do is
I can do 3/2 kbT,

01:18:38.010 --> 01:18:42.230
and this is a function of z, and
z is a function of temperature.

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:49.860
So what I have it is dz by
dT done at constant volume

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:54.580
or number of particles times
the derivative of this function

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:57.155
with respect to z.

01:18:57.155 --> 01:18:59.930
Now, when I take the
derivative with respect to z,

01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:01.770
I know that I
introduce a function

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:06.532
with one lower derivative
up to a factor of z.

01:19:06.532 --> 01:19:09.930
So I divide by the
1 over z, and then

01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:21.890
the derivative of the numerator
is f 3/2 plus divided by f 3/2

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:26.880
plus in the denominator
minus the derivative

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.550
of the denominator,
which is f 1/2 plus of z

01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:45.186
times the numerator divided
by f 3/2 plus of z squared.

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:56.540
So what you would need
to evaluate in order

01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.170
to get an expression
that is meaningful

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:05.420
and we can eliminate z's as much
as possible is what dz by dT

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.540
is.

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:11.910
Well, if this is our formula
for the number of particles

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:15.560
and the number of particles
or density is fixed,

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.025
then we take a derivative
with respect to temperature,

01:20:18.025 --> 01:20:24.600
and I will get that dN
by dT, which is 0, is v.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.390
And then we have to
take the temperature

01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:29.910
derivative of this
combination, g over lambda

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:34.200
cubed, f 3/2 plus of z.

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:41.910
Now, lambda cubed scales
like 1 over t to the 3/2,

01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:44.345
so when I take a
derivative of this,

01:20:44.345 --> 01:20:50.040
I will get 3/2 T to the
1/2, which I can again

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:57.520
combine and write in
this fashion, 1 over T,

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.655
f 3/2 plus of z.

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.540
Or then I take the implicit
derivative that I have here,

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:12.950
so just like there, I will get
dz by dT at constant density

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:15.310
times 1 over z.

01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:23.960
The derivative of f 3/2 will
give me f 1/2 plus of z.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.160
Setting it to zero,
we can immediately

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:34.960
see that this combination,
T over z dz by dT

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.890
at constant density over
the number of particles

01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:48.584
is minus 3/2, f 3/2 plus
divided by f 1/2 plus of z.

01:21:53.230 --> 01:22:03.910
So what I need to do is to
substitute this over here.

01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:07.930
And then when I want to
calculate the various limiting

01:22:07.930 --> 01:22:11.800
behaviors as I start with the
high temperature and approach

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:17.290
Tc, all I need to know
is that z will go to 1.

01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:24.140
f 1/2 of 1 is divergent, so
this factor will go to 0.

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:29.180
This factor will disappear,
and so then these things

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:33.580
will take nice, simple forms.

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:38.250
Once you do that-- we will do
this more correctly next time

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:40.310
around-- we'll
find that the heat

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:45.520
capacity of the
bosons in units of kb

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:52.120
as a function of temperature
has a discontinuity at Tc of n.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.470
It approaches the
classical result,

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:58.960
which is 3/2 at
high temperatures.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:02.140
At low temperatures, we said
it is simply proportional

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:08.030
to T to the 3/2, so I
have this kind of behavior

01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:11.080
just a simple T
to the 3/2 curve.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.820
And one can show
through arguments,

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:16.970
such as the one that
I showed you above,

01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:19.460
that the heat
capacity is continuous

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:23.450
but its derivative is
discontinuous at Tc.

01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:28.990
So the behavior overall of the
heat capacity of this Bose gas

01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:30.650
is something like this.

01:23:30.650 --> 01:23:34.770
So next time, we'll elucidate
this a little bit better

01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:38.560
and go on and talk about
experimental realizations

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.940
of Bose-Einstein condensation.

WEBVTT

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.780
PROFESSOR: So we're
building this story.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.620
We had the photoelectric effect.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.370
But at this moment,
Einstein, in the same year

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.400
that he was talking
about general relativity,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.380
he came back to the photon.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.030
And there there's actually a
quote of Einstein's saying,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.840
his greatest
discoveries, for sure,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.790
were special relativity
and general relativity.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.590
The photo-- he got
the Nobel Prize

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.100
for the photoelectric effect,
and he certainly helped

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.110
invent the quantum theory
and many important things

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.920
in this subject, but in
retrospect, his greatest

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.480
successes were that.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.360
But he may have not quite
seen it exactly that way.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.420
He wrote, that some
stage of his whole life

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.210
had been a difficult struggle
against the quantum, pulsed

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.100
by some small happy interludes
of some other discoveries.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.350
But the quantum theory
certainly made him very--

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.430
well, he was very suspicious
about the truth, the deep truth

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.200
of the quantum theory.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.930
So 1916, he is busy
with general relativity,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.620
but then he's more ready
to admit that the photon is

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.940
a particle, because he adds
that the photon now has momentum

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.580
as well.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.200
So it's a-- these photons that
were not called photons yet

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.550
are quanta for energy.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.320
But now he adds it's
also for momentum.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.250
So this already
characterizes particles.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.090
You see, there is the
relativistic relation, well

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.165
known by then, that e squared
minus p squared c squared

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:22.220
is equal to m squared
c to the fourth.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.120
You might say, well, this
is a little surprising.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.520
And If you don't remember
too much special relativity,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.960
this may not quite be
your favorite formula.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.700
Your favorite formulas might
be that the energy is mc

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.310
squared divided by 1 minus
v squared over c squared.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.930
And that the momentum
is the ordinary momentum

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.470
again multiplied by this
denominator like this.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.430
But these two equations,
with a little bit of algebra,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.790
yield this equation,
which summarizes something

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.800
about a particle,
that basically if you

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.590
know the energy and the
momentum of a particle,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.990
you know its mass.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.090
And it comes out from this.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.130
This is the relativistic
version of similar equations

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:29.780
in which you have energy one
half mv squared, momentum, mv,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.490
and then energy equal p squared
over 2m, a very important

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.000
relation that you can check.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.680
For out of these
two comes this one.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.650
And this is nonrelativistic.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:05.225
So for photons, we will
have particles of zero mass.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.420
Photons have zero mass, m
of the photon equals zero,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.485
and therefore e is equal
to pc for a photon.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.880
So we can look at what
the photon momentum is,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.190
for example photon momentum.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:41.980
We can treat it as some
particle and the photon momentum

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:49.050
would be e of the photon
divided by c, or h

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.570
Nu of the photon divided by c.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:00.310
And it's h over lambda
of the photon of gamma.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.470
So this is a very
interesting relation

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.860
between the momentum
of the photon

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.480
and the wavelength of photons.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.890
So the idea that the
photon is really a particle

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.660
is starting to gather
evidence, but people were not

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.480
convinced about it until
Compton did his work.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:35.200
So the same Compton that we
used this length over there,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.660
he works on this problem
and does the following.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.120
So is Compton scattering,
the name of the work.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.000
Compton Scattering.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.600
So what is Compton scattering?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:11.350
It is x-rays shining
on atoms again,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.130
but this time, these are
very energetic photons,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.070
energetic x-rays.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.940
X-rays can have anything
from a hundred EV

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.280
to 100kEV, 100,000
electron volts.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.000
And what are the energies,
of binding energies

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.280
of electrons in atoms?

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.720
10 EV, 13 EV for
hydrogen. So you're

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.330
talking about
100,000 EV coming in,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.200
so it's easily going to shake
electrons and release them

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.830
very easily.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.100
So you're going to have almost--

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.170
even though you're
shining on electrons

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.690
that are bound to
atoms, it's almost

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.640
like shining light on free
electrons if it's x-rays.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.090
So a few things happening.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.010
So this is photons
scattering on electrons.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:27.660
Scattering on electrons
that are virtually free.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.790
And the first thing
that happens is

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:36.450
that there is a
violation of what

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:46.380
was called the classical
Thomson scattering, that you

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.380
may have started in 802.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.600
So the reason Compton
scattering did

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.720
the job and physicists
finally admitted

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.480
the photon was a
particle is that it made

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.190
it look like particle collision
of a photon with an electron,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.370
it could calculate
and measure and treat

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.460
the photon as a particle, just
like another particle like

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.130
the electron, and out
came the right result.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.620
So the classical
Thomson scattering

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.230
was a photon as a wave.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.070
And what does that do?

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.900
Well, you have a free
electron, and here comes

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.340
an electromagnetic
wave, E and B.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.770
And if it's low frequency
wave, low energy electron,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.730
this electric--
the magnetic field

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.720
does very little, because this
election doesn't move too fast

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.810
and the velocity is being
small, the Lorentz force

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.180
is very small.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.740
But the electric field
shakes the electron.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.070
And as the electron is being
shaken, it's accelerating,

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.070
and therefore it
radiates itself.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:10.020
And it radiates in a pattern,
so you get photons out.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.840
And the pattern
is the following.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.430
I'll write the formula
with this cross-section.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.670
We'll maybe not explain
too much about what

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.330
this cross-section
means, it could

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.340
be a nice thing for recitation.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.610
This is the formula for
the Thomson cross-section

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:41.460
as a function of the
angle between the incident

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.360
direction of the photon and
the photon that emerges.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:53.920
So you detect photons out and
this is the cross-section.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.940
What does it mean,
cross-section?

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.500
Well this has units.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.120
I will say, very
briefly, units of area.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.040
Area per solid angle, but
solid angle has no units.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.560
So if you imagine a
little solid angle here

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.300
and you multiply by
this cross-section,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.290
it gives you some
area that represents

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.230
the solid angle you're
looking at to see

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.380
how many photons you get.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.330
And the solid angle that
you have multiplied here

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.880
to give you an area,
the area should

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.090
be thought of as the area that
captures from the incoming beam

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.290
the energy that is being
sent into this solid angle.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.030
So it represents an area, and
an area represents an energy,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.210
because if you have a beam
coming in from a magnetic wave

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.960
through a little area,
some energy goes in.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.910
So that area that
you get is that area

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.910
that extracts from
the incident beam

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.240
the energy that you need to go
in this solid angle direction.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.820
So basically, this is a plot
of intensity of the radiation

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.500
as a function of angle.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.080
But the most important
thing, not only-- this

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.430
is not quite accurate when
the photon is of high energy.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.680
The thing that is
pretty wrong about this

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:36.990
is that the outgoing photon
or wave has the same frequency

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.120
as the original wave.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.290
So that's a property
of this scattering.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.440
The electron is being
moved at the frequency

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.990
of the electric
field, and therefore

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.960
the frequency of the
radiation is the same.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.520
And this is all classical.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.980
But out comes, when
you have a high energy,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:12.050
this thing is not accurate, and
you have a different result.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.025
So what did Compton find?

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.587
Well, the first thing is
a couple of observations.

00:12:24.587 --> 00:12:25.087
.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.560
Treat the photon as a particle.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.560
OK, so it has some
energy and some momentum.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.460
The electron has some
energy and momentum.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.050
You should analyze the collision
using energy and momentum

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.200
conservation.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:13:00.260
So before the collision,
you have an incoming photon

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.050
that has some energy
and some momentum,

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.870
and you have an
electron, maybe here.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.330
And then after a
while, the electron

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.220
flies away in some
direction, E minus.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:21.250
And the photon also, a photon
prime of different frequency

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:21.930
flies away.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.270
It's like a collision.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.740
You can do this calculation
and maybe it could even

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.090
be done in recitation.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.730
It's a relativistic calculation.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:43.230
You were asked in first homework
to show that the photon can not

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.330
be absorbed by the
electron, and that

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.720
uses the relativistic
relations if you

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.870
want to show you
just can't absorb it.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.050
It's not consistent with energy
and momentum conservation.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.930
So it's something you
can try to figure out.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.470
The other thing that
should become obvious

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:06.210
is that the photon is
going to lose some energy,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.020
because as it hits the electron,
it gives the electron a kick.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.430
The electron now
has kinetic energy.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.130
Think of this in the lab.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.290
The electron was static,
the photon was coming.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.290
After a while, the
electron has moved,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.250
it's moving now
with some velocity.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.180
The photon must have
lost some energy.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.300
So photon loses energy.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:37.770
And therefore, the final
lambda must be bigger

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.300
than the initial lambda.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.010
Remember the shorter the
wavelength, the more energetic

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.710
the photon is.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.510
So what is the difference?

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.840
That's the result
of a calculation.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.860
It's a nice calculation,
all of you should do it.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.900
It's probably in some
book, in many books.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.570
And it's a nice exercise
also for recitation.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.375
Lambda final minus
lambda initial.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.910
Or I'll write it differently.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:17.270
Lambda final is equal to
lambda initial plus something

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.480
that depends on the angle
theta, in fact, has a one

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.270
minus cosine theta dependence.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:31.870
But here has to be something
with units of length

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.875
And the only party you
have here is the electron.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.170
And this electron
has some length,

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.840
which is the quantum
wavelength, which

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:51.060
is very natural for a Compton
scattering problem, of course.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.340
And it's here, h over mec.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:00.720
So the l Compton
of the electron.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.940
And that's the correct formula
for the loss of energy,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.610
or change in frequency.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:19.080
So the most you can get is if
you don't interact when theta

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.910
is equal to zero, the
photon keeps going,

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.620
doesn't even kick the electron.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.050
And then you get zero,
the initial lambda

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.180
is equal to the final lambda.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:37.140
But this can be as large as two,
for totally backwords photon

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.440
emitted.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.110
So theta equals pi, cosine
pi is minus 1, you get 2.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.590
At 90 degrees, you
get the Compton shift.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.710
So it's a very nice
thing, you even

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.730
know already what's
happening here.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:17:02.800
So let's describe the experiment
itself, of how it was done.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:26.579
So he used, Compton,
the experiment

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:39.550
have a source of
molybdenum x-rays

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:48.880
that have lambda equals
0.0709 nanometers.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:55.450
So smaller than nanometers,
it's 70 picometers.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.170
And that corresponds
to e photon--

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.265
that's pretty small, so
it must be high energy--

00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:06.700
and it's 17.49 kEV.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.510
That's very big energy.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.555
And there was a
carbon foil here.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:25.660
And you send the photons
in this direction.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.790
And they were observed
at several degrees,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.520
but in particular,
I'll show you a plot

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.245
of how it looked for theta
equal 90 degrees, so detector.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:48.440
So source comes in, carbon is
there, and what do you get?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.765
You get the following plot.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:57.220
Intensity-- so you plot the
intensity of the photons

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:04.090
that you detect, as a
function of the wavelength

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.240
of the photons that you
get, because there's

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.960
supposed to be a wavelength,
a shift of wavelength.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.950
So it's actually
quite revealing,

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.710
because you get
something like this.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.500
A bump and a bigger bump here.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.710
Something like that.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:28.330
Pretty surprising, I think,
to first approximation.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:33.000
And here is about--

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.890
the first bump happens to
have about the same wavelength

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:46.580
as the incoming
radiation, 0.0709.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.280
I should write it a
little more to the left.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:59.390
0.0709 nanometers over here.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:05.650
And then there is
another peak at lambda f,

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:18.650
about 0.0731 nanometers.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.300
And the question is, what
is the interpretation?

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:28.240
Why are there two peaks
and what's going on?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.800
Anybody has any idea?

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.130
Let me ask a simpler question.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.100
Which is the lambda
that corresponds

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:44.490
to the prediction of the
fact that the wavelength must

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.930
change, the smaller
one or the bigger one?

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.000
The bigger one.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.510
You certainly should loose
energy, so the lambda

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:59.640
f, the thing we were expecting
to see, presumably that thing,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.600
because we were expecting
to see that at 90 degrees,

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.670
the photons have this thing.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.090
So we seem to observe this one.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.690
And let's look at it in
a little more detail.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:21.540
You have this 0.0731 nanometers
and you have the original light

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:29.700
was at 0.0709 nanometers.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:43.000
So the difference is
0.0022 nanometers,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.870
which is 10 to the minus 9, but
it's exactly, or pretty close,

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:54.200
to this thing,
because a picometer is

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.810
10 to the minus 3 nanometers.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:02.280
So this is 0.0024 nanometers.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.310
So this is pretty nice.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:09.050
Look, at 90 degrees,
cosine theta is zero.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.640
So the difference between
initial and final wavelengths

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.280
should be equal to
the Compton wavelength

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.210
with about 0.0024 nanometers.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:24.550
And that's about
it pretty close.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.040
So this peak is all right.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.920
Should've been there.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.590
The other peak, why is it there?

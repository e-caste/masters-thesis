00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.550
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So today,
we'll start with a demo,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.430
so Pepe will be on stage.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.357
And then we'll continue with
the lectures on the gratings.

00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:36.940
Pepe, whenever you're
ready, you can--

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.140
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO: OK.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.320
Can we-- so today,
the goal today

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.520
is to show you a couple of
very interesting experiments.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.230
And again, the idea
of this is for you

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.600
to see all these derivations
that we've been doing actually

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.730
applied in a real experiment
and see the results

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.690
that you would expect.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.450
And for instance, these
last [? pieces, ?]

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.960
you were supposed to compute the
interference between a couple--

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.570
two plane waves propagating
at a different angle,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.730
so you were supposed
to also calculate

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.950
analytical solution of that.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.140
Now, we're going to see the
real evidence of that solution.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.980
So for that, we actually built,
in this case, a little more

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.490
elaborate setup than the ones
that we've been showing before.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.500
This actually a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.210
that Professor Sheppard
described last time,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.640
and I will explain
it very briefly.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.770
Can we zoom out, please?

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.270
Controls?

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.620
I guess maybe
that's the maximum.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.440
All right, so we start
here with a laser.

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:42.970
So the laser comes
from this side,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.970
and up to this section
here is where we just

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.960
collimate the
light, so basically,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.780
what I'm going to focus right
now is on this other section.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.020
So after this part here,
we have a nice plane wave.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.765
This component
here is a polarizer

00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:00.340
that, right now, just
take it as an element that

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.490
allows me to control
the intensity such

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.090
that the CCD doesn't
receive too much light.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.287
Now, these two pieces of glass
here are the beam splitters.

00:02:12.287 --> 00:02:14.620
So we've seen that these beam
splitters-- basically what

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.980
they do is that they will
split a section of the beam

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.740
to one side and a section of
the beam to the other side.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.370
In this case, it's
50/50 percent.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.170
Now, then, we have two mirrors.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.540
So as you can see,
there's one path here,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.180
and the other path here.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.240
The two paths that
now are going to be

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.490
combined by this second
beam splitter here.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.820
Sometimes, this is
called a beam combiner.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.470
And then they co-propagate here,
pass through this iris here,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.720
and then in this case,
they're reflecting-- again,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.620
these mirror are
going to the CCD.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.010
So essentially, what we have
here is these two plane waves

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.430
that first are splitted and
then are combined back again

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.640
together.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.660
And if the two plane waves
are exactly in line--

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.610
we see that we're not
supposed to see fringes

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.650
because they are
exactly in line,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.530
but we learned also that if we
introduce a little angle here,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.810
now the planar wavefronts of
each plane wave will interfere,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.700
and then we're going to see
some sinusoidal pattern.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.180
So this is exactly the same
as in the [? pieces. ?] One

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.670
of the problems that had what
would be the interference

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.800
pattern in an xy
plane in this case.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.440
In an xy plane,
[INAUDIBLE] two plane waves

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.420
propagating with a slightly
different k vectors.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.480
So now, let's look at
the interference pattern.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.450
Now, this is here in
my computer screen.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.930
So this is a video, real
time, of this interferometer.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.470
So as you can see, you
get very nice fringes

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.840
of very bright and
very dark, so we

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.850
know that the
peaks are the proof

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.150
of constructive interference,
the null destructive

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.560
interference.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.170
And you also see
some vibration here,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.300
because we said that
these type of instruments

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.290
are very, very, very sensitive
to environmental conditions,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.872
and I'm actually going
to tap the table.

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:10.330
Even if I just blow
some air, but I

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.820
want to get some moisture
in there, in the optics,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.700
but you can see
variations of the fringes.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.459
So then these type
of interferometers

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.410
are used for
different measurements

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.290
to calculate, for
instance, phases or measure

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.750
different profiles of
reflective optics, et cetera.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.450
So there are many
applications of

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.310
these Mach-Zehnder
interferometers,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.090
and the reason being
the sensitivity.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.420
Now, we also talked
about another thing--

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.200
the period of this sinusoidal
pattern that we see

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.500
is proportional to the
angle of the plane waves.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.080
So in this case, I'm going to
move one of the mirrors-- say,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.000
this mirror here--

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.010
to change one of the beam paths.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.140
The other one is
going to remain fixed.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.300
So let me tilt it a little bit
and see what happens first.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.750
So we see that the period of
the plane wave is changing.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.020
In this case, I'm moving
it in in the y direction.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.530
So now the period is larger.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.980
Does anyone want to tell me why
do you think it's happening?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.870
Are the plane waves
more close to be

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.360
parallel, or further away?

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.548
Yep?

00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:33.590
STUDENT: Appears inversely
proportional to theta,

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.440
so your period's smaller data.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.710
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO:
Yes, exactly.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.080
So essentially,
here, by doing this,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.132
I'm making the plane waves
to be as in line as I can.

00:05:44.132 --> 00:05:46.090
And of course, since I'm
increasing the period,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.960
also the oscillations
will start increasing,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.830
and now, we get these
artifacts due to the frame

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.350
rate of the camera that are
going to be very noticeable,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.080
I suppose, in Singapore.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.060
That's why I started
with a small fringe.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.530
I can also change the
tilting of the fringe

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.590
to do nice things like
this by basically changing

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.280
the orientation of the mirrors.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.320
All right, so now
what I'm going to do

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.780
is I'm going to block
one of these beam paths.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.265
So we have a nice
plane wave here,

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:23.030
and now, we are going
to repeat the aperture,

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.240
this lead experiment
that I showed last time.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.240
But today, we're going to
do it in different L regime.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.970
So basically, we're going
to try to mimic physically

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.090
the experiment that
Professor Barbastathis showed

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.270
in the video that he showed
in, I think, last lecture.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.070
All right, so we
have this slate here.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.600
Let me get it down a little bit.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:02.310
And I need to control
the intensity,

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.230
so I'm going to move
this closer to the CCD.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.420
This is as close as I can get.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.550
So as you can see, there
is a plane wave hitting--

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.050
let me just reduce the exposure.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.670
There is a plane wave
hitting this slate,

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.850
and you can see the
diffraction here happening

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.250
in the discontinuity
when basically it

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.620
hits the metal piece.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.890
And I can tune the size
here, and of course,

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.880
if I make this larger,
the diffraction effects

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.980
appear less noticeable.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.900
But for a smaller slate--

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.920
let's do that-- it's
actually pretty nice.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.420
We see the nice
diffraction, but I'm

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.600
going to increase
intensity, so you can see

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.750
the fringes that happen there.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.630
Now, let's see what
happens if I have it--

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.790
I fixed position, so
the size of this slate,

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:02.090
and now I'm going to move it
along the optical axis back.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.410
So I'm propagating back.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:15.490
Let me just reduce the intensity
here, so we are somewhere here.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.700
So now, I'm going
to go back, and you

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.310
can see how the diffraction
pattern changes.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.398
And this is
essentially the video.

00:08:27.398 --> 00:08:28.940
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Can you hear me?

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.190
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO: Yes.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.690
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Can you go back

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.010
where the fringe in
the center was dark?

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.820
Yeah, something like that.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.610
This is the equivalent of
the Poisson blinking spot

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.090
that we mentioned.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.742
Go a little bit
closer to the camera.

00:08:42.742 --> 00:08:44.700
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO:
Go a little bit what?

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.060
I'm sorry.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.352
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: A little
bit closer to the camera.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.130
Yeah.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.452
Try to have the center dark.

00:08:54.452 --> 00:08:56.910
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO: Oh,
I'm going to show the Poisson

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.702
spot with a circular
aperture a bit later--

00:08:58.702 --> 00:09:00.327
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
But I want to make

00:09:00.327 --> 00:09:01.420
a point about this case.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.190
In this case, you can see,
again, the Poisson spot,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.010
but it's actually an entire
dark line in the center.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.830
That's because the
scattering of the two edges

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.740
is actually out of phase,
so that the interference

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.872
destructively at the center,
and you see an entire dark band.

00:09:16.872 --> 00:09:19.330
And then of course, in this
case, with a circular aperture,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.732
you see the Poisson
spot as a spot.

00:09:21.732 --> 00:09:23.190
In this case, it
is a vertical bar.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.580
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO:
There you go.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.612
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:25.710
Perfect, yeah.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.043
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO: So
here, you see the blinking.

00:09:28.043 --> 00:09:30.030
So this is dark, and
this would be bright.

00:09:33.988 --> 00:09:35.780
This would be the
blinking line, I suppose.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:44.670
Now, let me change it to
the other video that we saw,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.681
that was the circular aperture.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.260
So this is a circular
aperture of a fixed size.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.220
In this case, you can see,
when it's close to the camera,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.340
again, as close as
I can get it to,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.975
you see refraction patterns.

00:10:05.975 --> 00:10:07.600
So now, this is very
nice, because what

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.017
we're supposed to
see here, again,

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:13.382
is going to be that famous
Poisson spot or blinking spot.

00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:15.570
And before we see the
results that we, again,

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.340
saw in the movie, there's a nice
historical story about these.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:27.270
In [INAUDIBLE],, Fresnel spent
a very nice paper to a contest

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.812
about the refraction of light.

00:10:28.812 --> 00:10:30.270
So at the time,
remember that there

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.680
was all this controversy of
is light a wave or a particle.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.610
So in the committee
judging these papers,

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.560
Poisson, a very
respected scientist,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.360
was actually in the committee.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.310
And he saw Fresnel's
paper, and he was

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.630
like, no, this has to be wrong.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.400
And he wanted to disprove it,
so he actually went and did

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.300
some calculations
and then proved

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.370
that, if Fresnel was
right, what this means

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.450
is that if you have, say, an
opening like this, somewhere

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.510
behind that opening, after
shining it with a plane wave,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.080
you're supposed to
see a dark spot.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.980
And that dark spot is
very counterintuitive

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.775
because, basically,
you're supposed to see,

00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:12.150
from the geometrical optics,
all the light going straight

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.650
through.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:17.850
So how could there be a very
dark spot in the center?

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.220
So then basically, he
said, no, this is the proof

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.670
that Fresnel's theory is wrong.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.540
But then another member in the
committee, Dominique Arago,

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.300
he actually went ahead
and did the experiment,

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.450
and he saw this Poisson
spot experimentally.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.070
And then thanks to
that, of course,

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.780
Fresnel won the contest.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.480
And now this, I guess, as
opposed to-- like as occurs

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.380
to Poisson--

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.100
it's called a Poisson spot.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.440
All right, let's see the
Poisson spot in action.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.400
So I'm going to go-- here,
you see it in bright, dark.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.790
I'm going to go
even further away.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.950
So I'm moving it back, and
you see the blinking spot.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:00.925
Trying to do it slowly.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.970
Going to go back.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.304
Can you see it in Singapore?

00:12:11.512 --> 00:12:12.470
I guess that was a yes.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.742
Cool.

00:12:18.742 --> 00:12:20.950
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: They're
very beautiful actually.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.992
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO:
Yes, they're very nice.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.100
So can we switch to the
front camera, please?

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.600
Control?

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.490
Can we switch to
the front camera?

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.220
So now, the next thing
that I'm going to show--

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.790
it's a diffraction grating.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.300
So diffraction gratings--
it's a very interesting

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.952
optical component.

00:12:47.952 --> 00:12:48.910
The front view, please.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.993
I'm going to show something
with a piece of paper.

00:12:53.777 --> 00:12:55.790
Or I guess if not, I'm
going to show it here.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:56.788
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:56.788 --> 00:12:58.288
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO:
I'm sorry?

00:12:58.288 --> 00:13:00.560
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
explained [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.768
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO: OK.

00:13:03.063 --> 00:13:04.730
So the next thing
that I'm going to show

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.820
is an optical component,
that is very used

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.000
in practicing different
optical setups, that

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.740
is called a grating.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.410
So grating-- you can think of
it as a material, in this case,

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.700
that--

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.130
the one that I'm going to show
is called a phase grating.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.520
Basically, the index or
refraction within the material

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.470
varies in a given way-- in
this case, sinusoidally.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.500
So it's a periodic variation
of the index of refraction,

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.790
and then when the light
hits this element, looks

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.220
like a flat piece of
glass, but in reality, it

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.070
has this index
varying, it basically

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.500
decomposes in multiple angles.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.060
And what I'm going to
show here, in this case,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.430
is a normal laser
pointer, but it actually

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:54.130
has two set of gratings
in this little end.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.900
So what we are going
to see, again, now,

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.478
is we're going to see some
beautiful array of patterns.

00:13:58.478 --> 00:13:59.020
You see them?

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.650
And actually, I'm going
to project them here.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.470
This, I'm not sure
if the Singapore

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.070
side is going to see it or not.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.075
So now, I have to
cross linear gratings.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.700
I actually can put
them in things,

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.800
so I can see very nice spots.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.890
I can open them, and you can do
all sorts of fun things here.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.650
So the optical
component actually

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.000
looks something like this.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.360
This is the second time
that I showed a grating.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.130
The first time was in
the very first demo,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.800
when I used the grating
to disperse light,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.970
similar to a prism.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.900
So if you remember, I
had a prism dispersing

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.580
in what is called a
normal dispersion,

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.840
and a grating with
what is called

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.882
the anomalous dispersion.

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:45.930
So this also, if you
shine it with white light,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.210
will form a very,
very nice rainbow.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.675
So in this case, it's a bit hard
to show this guy with a camera,

00:14:52.675 --> 00:14:55.050
but I'm going to try, if we
can put-- the overhead camear

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.710
I think is on.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.790
So what I'm going to do is
going to increase the intensity.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.470
And use the aperture,
and I'm going

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.880
to try to show it in
a piece of paper here.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.760
So you see here,
the three spots,

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.660
in this case, of
this element being,

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.530
in this case, more orders.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.820
So each of these spot we
call a diffraction order.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.430
The one that goes straight
through would be the 0 order.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.640
Then we go to plus/minus 1,
plus/minus 2, so on and so

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.160
forth, and I guess
after these, we're

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.320
going to do the
actual derivation,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.750
the mathematical
derivation of this.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.157
You want to add something else,
George, for the grating side?

00:15:40.157 --> 00:15:41.740
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
I think this only

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.990
had the plus/minus 1,
plus/minus 3, and a very weak 0?

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.675
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO:
Let's see.

00:15:48.675 --> 00:15:50.800
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Because
I only saw four spots,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.720
so it must have been--

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.050
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO:
There's more, I think.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.852
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Oh, OK.

00:15:55.852 --> 00:15:56.560
Not very visible.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.518
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:15:57.518 --> 00:15:58.320
There's more.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.700
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO: Yeah.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.325
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
0 is also present,

00:16:01.325 --> 00:16:03.835
but you can see that the
plus/minus 2, plus/minus 4

00:16:03.835 --> 00:16:04.560
are missing.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.360
We'll talk about
this in class later.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.810
The point to see here is that
you see the pattern is not

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:10.560
quite regular.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.900
It looks like there
is one missing

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.020
order between the last--

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.540
if you label the central
one 0, then it goes 1,

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.010
and then it keeps 2,
and then it goes to 3.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.038
So that's the point
I wanted to make.

00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:29.330
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO: Good.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.450
So I think we switch
back to you, George.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.040
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Thank you, Pepe.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.748
JOSE DOMINGUEZ-CABALLERO:
You're welcome.

00:16:42.057 --> 00:16:43.890
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I
feel jealous actually

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.280
because this is much better
to see it in real life

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.780
than it is to see it in math.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.250
But hopefully,
this will motivate

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.760
you to tolerate
the math, because

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.240
if the physical phenomena
are so pretty, maybe

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.660
it is worthwhile to go to the
effort of understanding them,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.240
I suppose.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.050
So today, I will talk--

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.460
I will basically pick
up where Pepe left,

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.000
and I will talk about
diffraction gratings.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.430
Oh, before I forget,
some of you asked if you

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.410
could have the movies from--

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.730
the animations that they
played in class the other day.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.720
So if you go to the website,
I have created a new section

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.310
called Animations.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.620
And I've put the
movies as AVI files,

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.290
so you can download
them from there.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.770
And also I have
revised the notes.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:14.180
Last time, if you recall, we
caught a couple of factors of 2

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.170
that were missing, and
so on and so forth.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.300
So I fixed those.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.790
If you find any more errors
in the notes, please let me

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.290
know so that I can
fix them as well.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.100
So today, we'll talk about--

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.890
so basically, I will
describe, mathematically,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.820
what Pepe showed in real life.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.340
So a grating basically,
as Pepe mentioned,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.260
is a periodic,
thin transparency.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.390
So we've talked about thin
transparencies before.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.360
We mentioned that they
modulate in general.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.840
Thin transparencies
modulate the amplitude

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.840
and the phase of the
optical field, so

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.690
in that particular case,
when the thin transparency's

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.950
a periodic function of space,
then we'll call it a grating.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.930
And I guess for clarity
of presentation,

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:13.970
it is customary to classify
gratings as amplitude or phase,

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.120
depending on whether
the grating acts

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.740
upon the magnitude of
the electromagnetic field

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.650
or the phase of the
electromagnetic field.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.750
Now, this can cause a
little bit of confusion

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.080
because we have
agreed to use the term

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.610
amplitude to denote the complex
amplitude of the optical field.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.270
Confusingly enough, when people
talk about amplitude gratings,

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:43.730
they should be calling
them magnitude gratings,

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.060
because as you can see
in the case on the left,

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.260
the transmission function
of an amplitude grating

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.893
is a positive real number.

00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:54.310
So therefore, this
kind of grating

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:59.990
acts directly onto the
magnitude of the optical field.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.530
Nevertheless, for
historical reasons,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.030
people call these are gratings--

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.690
I suppose they call
them magnitude--

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.880
I'm sorry, they call
them amplitude gratings.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.700
So hopefully, this will
not create confusion.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.250
But anyway, the simplest
possible modulation

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.890
is sinusoidal, and
you can see here

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.190
sort of juxtaposed in
a sinusoidal amplitude

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.760
grating and the
sinusoidal phase grating.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.940
So starting with the
amplitude grating,

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:34.290
the complex transmission
function of the grating

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.860
is actually not complex at all.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.210
It is a real positive
number, and what I've done

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.460
is, on top of it, I've
plot its magnitude,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.760
which is, of course,
itself since this

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.570
is a real positive
function, and its phase.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.900
And of course, the phase
is 0 because the phase

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.640
of a complex number,
which happens

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.260
to be real and positive, is 0.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.490
The quantities to mention here
are the period of the grating.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.470
We use the upper case
Greek symbol lambda, which

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.150
looks like a hat, I guess.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.710
That symbol is called lambda.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.420
So this is the period of the
grating, so in this case,

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.180
you can see the grating
seems to fulfill

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.360
one undulation
between approximately

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.660
minus 5 units and plus 5 units.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.460
Therefore, the period
here is 10 units.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.980
And actually, the unit I've
picked on the horizontal axis

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.640
is the wavelength of the
light, so this grating

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.700
has a period of 10 wavelengths.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.760
So if the light were a visible--

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.390
green light has a wavelength
of approximately half

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:53.760
a micrometer, so in real
units for the green light,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.530
the period here would have been
approximately 5 micrometers

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.210
or 10 wavelengths.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.450
Then m-- we saw
the symbol m also

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.670
when we talk about interference.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:14.520
We called m the contrast
between the brightest

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.510
and the darkest part of a fringe
in the case of an interference

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.440
pattern.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.420
In this case, we still
call it contrast,

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.580
but it is between the
most transmissive part

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.330
of the grating and the
darkest part of the grating.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.930
So this case, you can see that
it goes between approximately

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.990
0.9 and 0.1.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.180
The maximum
transmissivity is 0.9,

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.850
and the minimum
transmissivity is 0.1.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.570
So therefore, of the value of
m for the grating shown here

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.420
is approximately 0.8.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.620
If the grating was swinging
between maximum 100%

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:57.730
transmission, totally
bright and totally dark,

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.100
that would have been 0.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.810
Then the contrast
would've been 1.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:05.380
So this is the function
of this m parameter here.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.670
And finally, we allow a phase
shift, which basically says,

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.290
if the maximum--

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.560
since the grating is written
as a cosine function here,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.030
phi tells me if the maximum
transmission, the maximum value

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.930
of the cosine, is
centered with x equals 0

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.380
on the horizontal axis--

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.950
so you can see that, in this
case, it is indeed center.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.310
So therefore, the
phase phi would equal 0

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.440
in the grating
shown in this case.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.970
So that's what I had
to say about that.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.830
Under the grating, I should
go to the phase grating.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.660
It is actually kind
of the opposite.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.490
So the phase
grating is expressed

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.030
as a complex exponential
with a purely--

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:52.790
with a pure phase without
any amplitude modulation.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.090
So it's magnitude then is 1.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:59.090
So you see that the
magnitude is a flat function,

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:04.330
so this means that this grating
transmits all of the light.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.480
What it does do, though,
is it modulates the phase,

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.450
and you can see that
it modulates the phase

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:15.322
in a sinusoidal fashion.

00:24:15.322 --> 00:24:17.530
So this is what you see now
in the bottom plot, which

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.260
is that the phase, the angle--

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.390
by the way, the
phase, sometimes we

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:28.850
denote the phase as this angular
symbol of a complex number.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.680
So the phase is simply the
argument of the exponent here,

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.630
and is, itself, sinusoidal.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.320
And it also has a
period and a contrast.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.570
The contrast in this case
is called the phase contrast

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.762
because we're talking
about the phase,

00:24:43.762 --> 00:24:45.220
and you can see
that, in this case,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.270
it is swinging also
approximately between plus 0.4

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.590
and minus 0.4.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:54.280
So the contrast is
also 0.8 in this case,

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.830
but it could be anything,
really, between minus pi and pi

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:04.010
to get a complete
phase contrast.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.740
The other two
parameters are the same.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.740
The period is also
about 10 wavelengths,

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.370
and the phase shift is 0.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.230
We have to be a little
bit careful here not

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:19.250
to confuse the phase of the
grating with the phase shift.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.580
So again, the phase
shift is telling us

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:27.040
whether that transmission
is aligned or no

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.900
with the origin of
the coordinates.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.150
So this case,
since I have a sine

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.650
in the phase of the
grating, you see

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:36.190
that it assumes the
value 0 at x equals 0,

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.200
so again, there's
no phase shift.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.100
So this phase shift is not to
be confused with the phase delay

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.910
that the grating imposes
upon the complex amplitude

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.480
of the electromagnetic field.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.920
So that's another
important point,

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.080
and I would like
to point it out.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.980
So how do these
things behave now?

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.060
So what I will do is I
will play two movies, which

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.610
I guess are not as
convincing as the movies

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.750
that Pepe showed because
Pepe is doing an experiment.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.240
In this case, these are
simply Matlab calculations.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.050
But basically, the two movies
will show you two great things.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.680
One is an amplitude grating,
and one is a phase grating.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:21.310
And it will show you how the
field propagates after grating.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.990
And these movies are also
posted to the website

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.790
so you can play them
yourselves again later.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:32.660
Now, I should say, the grating
grooves are oriented horizontal

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.510
in this case, and you cannot
see them on the camera

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.693
or on the video because the
pixel size is not big enough

00:26:40.693 --> 00:26:42.360
to allow you to see
them, unfortunately.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.410
This is an artifact
of the calculation.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:50.640
So what you see here
is some variation

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.880
of the grating that is actually
not the grating itself.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.850
As I said it, is
called a moire pattern,

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.150
if you are familiar
with the term.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.500
But anyway, I don't want to
go into moire theory here,

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.900
but the reason you
can see this pattern

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.160
is because the pixel size
of the camera in the display

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.460
is not small enough to show
you the period of the grating.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.200
So the grating is actually
expressed by this function.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.610
X is the same in the
equation as in the axis,

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.680
and the period of the
grating is 2 wavelengths.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.250
So this grating has a
very, very small period.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.530
The contrast I picked
to be 1 in this case,

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.880
and there's no phase shift.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.030
So I will play the movie now,
and you will see what happens.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.350
So the field will
propagate along the z-axis,

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:44.970
and you can see that the light
that originally illuminated

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.660
the grating actually now
splits into three parts.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.290
These are, also Pepe mentioned,
called diffraction orders.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.780
One of them propagates
straight through.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.630
That is called the
0 diffraction order,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:03.120
and then you get a plus 1 above
and a minus 1 diffraction order

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.140
below.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.000
So this is the typical behavior
of a sinusoidal amplitude

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.350
grating.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.720
Now, if I play the same
thing for the first grating,

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.170
there's two things to notice.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.480
First of all, there's
no moire at all here.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.330
That's because the
phase grating does not

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.060
modulate the magnitude of
the electric field at all.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.600
So in other words,
at the entrance

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.210
toward the grating
itself, the grating

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.700
looks just like an
empty transparency.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.490
It has not changed the
magnitude of the field.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.890
What it has done, it
has changed the phase,

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.930
and because the
phase of the field

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.380
got modulated inside
this slit over here,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.780
what you will see when I
play the grating is, again,

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.280
that it splits.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.940
But now, it splits
into more than one.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.620
It splits into, in this case,
you can see very clearly

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.400
five diffraction orders.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.420
You can see very
clearly, there is

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.850
one in the center, then
another one and another one.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:03.330
So these are the plus 1, plus
2, and then at the bottom,

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:08.740
you have minus 1, minus
2 diffraction orders.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.810
So it is, in some ways,
similar to the amplitude case,

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:18.090
but in this case, we'll get
more diffraction orders.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.240
And so I guess what I
would like to do now

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.720
is I will try to explain
what is the difference,

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.740
and why the phase grating gives
us more diffraction order.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.010
I should say, by the way,
that the sinusoidal--

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.900
I want to emphasize the
sinusoidal amplitude

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.610
grating gives us only three--

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.005
the 0 order, the plus
1, and the minus 1.

00:29:40.005 --> 00:29:42.870
In general, other
types of gratings,

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.290
for example binary or
phase gratings and so on,

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.560
they give us more than
three diffraction orders.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.588
So first of all, let's look
at the physical picture.

00:29:56.588 --> 00:29:58.380
So I'll start with the
sinusoidal amplitude

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.287
because this is the
simplest possible grating,

00:30:01.287 --> 00:30:03.870
and let's look at the physical
picture of what's going on here

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.810
and why we get this
diffraction order.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.200
So if I have a plane
wave impinging-- oh,

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.020
so again, this symbol, being
Greek, I have an advantage,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.520
I guess.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.020
I can recognize it.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.060
It is the uppercase
lambda, so we'll

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.320
use the symbol lowercase--

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.410
control, may I have the paper?

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.180
Actually, I already
have the paper, do I?

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.310
Yeah.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:31.040
So this symbol that we
use for the wavelength

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.325
is the lowercase lambda.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.030
This symbol that we use
generally for a special period

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:42.870
is the uppercase.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.350
It may sound a
little bit ridiculous

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:53.870
that I emphasize it so much, but
believe me, in previous years,

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.960
all the generations of students
have been endlessly confused

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.185
by the lambda and the lambda.

00:30:59.185 --> 00:31:00.560
So I would like
to emphasize it--

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.190
these are two different symbols.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.500
We use the lower case
for the wavelength

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.370
and the upper case for
the spatial period.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.150
So that's it then.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.790
That's the period, and
the inverse of that--

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.700
the inverse of a period
generally is a frequency.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.140
So since now we have a spatial
period, the inverse [? u0, ?]

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.450
we'll call this
special frequency.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.700
And let's illuminate
this grating now

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.040
with an incident plane wave.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.190
So throughout this lecture, I
will be illuminating gratings

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.950
with plane waves on axis.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.740
In the homework that
I've posted today,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.290
and actually just became
visible a few minutes ago,

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.120
in the homework,
you will see what

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.510
happens if you illuminate the
grating with a tilted plane

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.010
wave or with a spherical wave.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.170
This is also possible.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.380
You can illuminate a
grate in any way you like.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.520
Now, we'll start with
the simplest case,

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.540
which is on axis plane wave.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.610
So we don't know yet
what's going to happen,

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:57.650
but we know one thing.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.240
We know Huygen's principal,
and Huygen's says

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.380
that, at each point where
the grating is transmissive,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.350
we'll get point sources.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:09.000
So of course, I do not
only get only these two,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.610
I get the point
source here, which

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.820
is very strong because this is
the location where the grating

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.560
has maximum transmission.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.930
Next to it, I will
get another point--

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.820
another Huygen's point source
that is slightly attenuated.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.190
Then next to it, another
one that is slightly more

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.620
attenuated, another
one, another one.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.170
There comes a point here where
the grating is totally black,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:36.070
that it is totally absorbing.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.730
Therefore, there's is a missing
Huygen's source over here,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.920
and then as I move on
along the optical axis,

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.250
I will get more Huygen's point
sources that are progressively

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.540
less attenuated.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.600
And then finally, I
get over here where

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.550
I have another strong,
as strong as possible,

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.590
Huygen's point source.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.800
So we derived an integral.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.300
Professor Sheppard last week
[INAUDIBLE] of an integral that

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.350
allows us to basically
sum the contributions

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.470
from all these
Huygen's point sources

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.530
and derive different
L diffracted field

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.910
after the grating.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.660
So of course, this integral,
we call the Fresnel integral,

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.540
and here is another linguistic
lesson-- this time in French,

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.230
not in Greek.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:27.310
This is pronounced "Freh-nell."

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.080
The S is silent.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.350
So if you go to a conference,
and you say "Fres-nell,"

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:35.560
people will conclude that
you don't know optics.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.030
So part of knowing
optics is part

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:41.670
of knowing the French and the
Greek language, I suppose.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.080
I'm joking, of course,
but it's still actually,

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.940
professionals are like
children, who are vicious.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.230
If we see someone make a
silly mistake like this,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.117
say "Fres-nell"
instead of "Freh-nell,"

00:33:52.117 --> 00:33:52.950
we make fun of them.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.590
And you don't want
to be made fun

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.820
of in a professional setting.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.420
So always remember, this
is pronounced "Freh-nell,"

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.400
not "Fres-nell."

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.590
So the Fresnel
integral, therefore,

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.830
allows us to compute the
field, the diffracted field,

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:09.300
after the grating.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.989
But we will not do it here
because the Fresnel integral,

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:14.670
in this case, is awful.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.920
It is very difficult to compute.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.870
However, I will show
you that, by using

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:22.290
very simple physical
arguments, we can nevertheless

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.020
derive the Fresnel
diffracted field anyway

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:31.214
without making use of this
nasty Fresnel integral.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:37.860
So let's go back to our
Huygen's picture here.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.830
I would just consider this two
point sources of Huygen's which

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.112
are the strongest.

00:34:43.112 --> 00:34:44.820
And this is, of course,
an approximation,

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.780
a simplification, but
it will still give us

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.489
the correct physical picture.

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:50.230
That's why I'm doing it.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.630
So basically, over
here, you can see

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.570
that these are point sources,
so they basically emit light

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.970
in all possible directions.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:02.650
So I will pick one
arbitrary direction,

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.320
and I will call it theta.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.560
So here is a ray, if you
wish, a ray emanating

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.760
from this Huygen's point
source at angle theta,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.210
and here's another ray emanating
from the next Huygen's point

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.970
source at the same angle theta.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.980
Now, these rays-- are they
the same or different?

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.950
Geometrical optics
says they're the same,

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.160
but now, we know better.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.900
We know that these
are not really bullets

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.650
that propagate like particles.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.490
These are actually waves.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.410
And if you compare
the wave emitted here

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.860
and the wave emitted
there, if you draw a line

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:46.420
perpendicular to these waves,
this would be the wavefront.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.950
So you can see, easily now,
that if you compare the wave

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:54.210
on the lower ray with a
wave with the upper ray,

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.950
you can see that the wave in the
lower ray is actually delayed.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.900
It has traveled the
longer distance.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.920
Therefore, it is delayed by
a certain amount with respect

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.950
to the ray that is below.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.300
And the way, of course,
to compute this delay

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.070
is to draw an orthogonal
triangle here.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:20.400
This side of the triangle
is actually the wavefront.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.900
This side of the triangle
is the phase delay,

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.420
and the hypotenuse of the
triangle is the period--

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.270
is the special
period of the grating

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.550
that we denoted as lambda.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.500
So by using the
Pythagoras theorem,

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.100
then, we can actually
compute the phase delay,

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.220
and we can compute--

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.210
there's, of course, a typo here.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:47.000
Let me fix it right away, and
I will post a fix in the notes.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:37:00.080
Anyway, I think it's better
if I don't fix it now,

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.980
but the correct equation over
there should say the optical

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.150
path length difference--
that's what OPLD means--

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:14.930
equals lambda, the grating
period, times sine theta.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:15.680
Sorry about that.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.810
These notes came from
another old [? convention ?]

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.630
where the period
was denoted as d.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.180
So with this little
fix, that OPLD

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:32.230
equals the period of the
grating times sine theta,

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:36.640
we can see now that, if
this quantity of OPLD

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:44.130
equals a wavelength, then the
two rays are actually in phase.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.060
And not only one
wavelength-- it might

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.720
equal two wavelengths,
three wavelengths,

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.070
any integral number
of wavelengths.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.770
Then these two
waves are in phase.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.130
Therefore, they
interfere constructively.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.520
And this is the key, now--

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.260
the constructive interference
of waves in these specific,

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.940
now, directions is what we
call diffraction orders,

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.250
that Pepe very beautifully
showed you earlier.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:15.880
And you also saw them in
my simulation in Matlab.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.500
And so q here, the
quantity q, is an integer.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.620
It is meant to
denote an integer,

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.660
and we can derive this now.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:33.200
So we can derive the sine
of the angle of the q,

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.010
over the qth, I guess,
diffraction order where

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:40.800
qth might be first,
second, third, and so on.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.040
So q runs 1, 2, 3, and so on.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.410
And of course,
because typically, we

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.630
operate in the
paraxial approximation,

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.600
we can also drop the
sign here and say simply

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.530
that the plus/minus
1 diffraction

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.760
order is propagating
at an angle that

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.890
is given by this
ratio over there,

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:02.420
the ratio of the
small Greek lambda

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:06.560
to the big Greek lambda, that
is the ratio of the wavelength

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.292
over the period.

00:39:08.292 --> 00:39:10.000
And you can see
immediately, for example,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.250
that if I make the
grating period smaller

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.530
than the wavelength,
I will get in trouble

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.770
because this sine over there
will attempt to become bigger

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:21.940
than 1.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.810
Anybody knows what
happens in this case

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:26.560
if I make the grating
period smaller than lambda,

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.127
than the wavelength?

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.450
Mr. [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.970
Yeah, actually, I can do--

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.520
I can make a period
smaller than a wavelength.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.160
What will happen
then is I will get

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.330
what is called an
evanescent wave,

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.530
so I will not get a
diffraction order anymore.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.860
I'll get an evanescent
wave from the grating,

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.540
and this is a term
that we've seen before.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.580
We haven't defined
yet, mathematically,

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:56.350
but I want to alert you that,
basically, an evanescent

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.500
wave is an exponential
decay of a diffracted field.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:04.120
So you do not quite get a
diffracted order anymore.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.350
For the purposes of the class,
in the next few lectures

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:12.400
at least, definitely for the
next three or four weeks,

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.260
we will assume that the
grating period is much larger

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.370
than the wavelength.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.130
So therefore, this quantity
is always less than 1,

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:24.490
and the sine is always
properly less than 1.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:28.900
And we can solve it, so we can
get the real and not evanescent

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:29.780
diffraction order.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:34.543
I think my computer--

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.705
so as I said
before, the plus 1--

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:42.830
this is actually arbitrary.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:46.240
I can call plus 1--

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.630
by convention, the plus
1 is the one that goes--

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:54.995
if we denote the light--

00:40:54.995 --> 00:40:56.860
as in geometrical
optics, the light

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.860
always goes from left to right.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:05.240
And the angle is
positive if it is acute

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.280
measured counterclockwise
from the optical axis.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.420
So that is why this is the
plus first diffraction order.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.240
It has a positive propagation
angle, and then the one

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.870
that has negative
propagation angle,

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:20.910
we'll call it minus
first diffraction order.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.920
The 0th diffraction
order is the one

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:29.710
that has theta equals 0
that is propagating on axis.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.470
That is also known as a DC term.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.120
Now, for those of you who
are electrical engineers,

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.660
the term DC already alerts
you to some kind of a Fourier

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.650
transform or some kind of
a frequency representation.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.940
We will see later that, indeed,
light propagating on axes

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.440
can be thought of as the
equivalent of a DC component

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.020
in Fourier series decomposition.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:00.930
For now, let's take it
as a term, as a sort of--

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.270
what do you call
this-- as a jargon,

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.830
and we'll see later why
we call this the DC term.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:13.750
This is a mathematical
derivation

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:16.420
that we can do in order
to actually become

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.020
a little bit more quantitative
and a little bit more correct.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.310
So the mathematical
definition is very simple.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.850
We start with the
expression for the grating.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.630
Then we decompose the
cosine into the two

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:34.690
complex exponentials that
we can [? write ?] it.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:41.410
And then what we do is we
simply make a substitution

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:44.380
according to the equation
that I saw before already.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:52.410
We say that 1 over lambda
equals sine theta upon lambda.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.550
This may seem arbitrary,
but I can always

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.940
do it because lambda--

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.010
I'm sorry [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.180
Uh-oh, we're out of focus.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:07.470
Anyway, you cannot
see the question,

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:10.290
but you can certainly see
this substitution here.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.310
And I cannot-- thank you.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:16.110
So we can always
do the substitution

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:20.440
by defining sine theta to be
the ratio of the wavelength

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.240
over the period,
and we can also make

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.150
a substitution of [? u0, ?]
the special frequency as I

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.740
defined it before.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.790
The point is not that.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.730
The point is that each
one of these terms

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.910
actually is recognizable
as a plane wave.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:40.735
And now, we'll really
need my transparency here.

00:43:40.735 --> 00:43:45.810
So if you recall, when
we derived plane waves--

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.330
we did this some time ago.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.500
Actually, I think
Professor Sheppard did it

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.450
in the context of
electromagnetics.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:54.570
The way we write a
plane wave is like this.

00:44:31.163 --> 00:44:33.580
These are what you will see
if you go back into your notes

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.620
by about two or three lectures.

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.380
If you have a plane
wave propagating

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.080
in the direction
of this arrow here,

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.790
then the expression
that I put above

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:48.460
is actually the phasor for
the electromagnetic field

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.470
describing that plane wave.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:56.750
And if, in addition, we say that
the grating is at z equals 0--

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.790
which I can always do.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:02.140
I can define my axis so that
the grating is located at

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.230
z equals 0--

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.540
then this term will
actually disappear.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.300
And you can recognize
now this expression

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:12.890
that is left for the plane
wave is the same that you have

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:17.120
already here with
the complex exponent,

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.030
provided you make the
substitution that we

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.400
had before, provided you
make the substitution--

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:23.900
this one.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.360
With a substitution,
the grating itself

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.370
becomes like the expression
for not just one, but actually

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:33.800
three plane waves.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.020
And what are the
three plane waves?

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:43.470
Well, here is one, which is the
plus first diffraction order.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:47.610
There's a plane wave
propagating at angle theta.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.850
Then the next one, the
constant is actually

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.950
the DC term that
propagates on axis,

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:58.500
because if you substitute
theta equals 0 here,

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.560
then this entire thing
disappears, so you just

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.610
have the constant.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:06.070
That is a plane wave
propagating on axis.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:09.143
And finally, this
term is propagating

00:46:09.143 --> 00:46:10.560
at the negative
angle, and this is

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.970
what you call the minus
1 diffraction order.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:17.760
So this may seem a little bit
like mathematical trickery,

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.400
but has a very nice
physical interpretation,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.600
if only you recall our
convention for the phasor

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.820
expression of plane waves.

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:32.980
The rest is relatively
straightforward.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.810
A sinusoidal phase
grating, as Pepe mentioned,

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.270
is basically a
grating which does not

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.250
modulate the amplitude, but
the phase of the optical field.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:43.930
And you can do it in two ways.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.420
One is what I saw here.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.520
That is known as a
surface relief grating,

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.740
which has been processed.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.510
Typically, this is
done by chemical--

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:55.530
by optical exposure and then
chemical development, that

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.860
causes the surface
of, typically,

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:04.200
a polymer or a properly prepared
colloidal, colloidal glass.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.700
It causes the surface to pick
up a sinusoidal modulation

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.610
like this.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:14.160
So because the material
has a refractive index n,

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.200
you can see that
light, depending

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.860
if you take a ray, depending
on where it hits this material,

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.920
it might suffer a
different phase delay.

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.010
Another way that
Pepe mentioned is you

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.650
might actually have a
flat piece of material

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:31.230
and modulate the index
of refraction inside.

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:33.390
Again, that would
have a similar effect.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:36.510
The complex transmission
function would be of this form.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:40.500
It would be an
exponential whose value

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.240
depends upon the optical
thickness of the material

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.680
that the light went through.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:52.150
You can see the period here,
and you can see the phase delay.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.750
So the phase delay,
of course, depends

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.880
on the difference between
the index of refraction

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.115
inside the material and
the index of refraction

00:47:59.115 --> 00:48:02.350
in the surrounding
middle that is air.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.270
So that's the
expression over there,

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.360
and this is, of course,
the phase contrast

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.410
that we mentioned before,
when we defined the grating.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.060
And in order, now,
to figure out what

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.310
happens after this
grating, I will

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:22.540
have to resort to mathematical,
again, trickery, I guess.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.880
If you go to books
of optical tables,

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.840
you can find very easily
that this expression can also

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.830
be written as a
sum, as a sum that

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:37.300
involves some kind of
nasty Bessel functions.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.930
We don't even have
to worry about this,

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.470
but what we will go
ahead and add in a second

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.870
is that each one of
these Bessel functions

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:49.000
corresponds to diffraction
order for this grating.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.600
And the way you can see this
is if you rewrite the grating

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.200
like this.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.670
So this is now simply using
a mathematical formula,

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:02.260
but now, if you actually do
the same trick I did here,

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.550
if you recognize that each one
of these complex exponentials

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.730
basically corresponds
to the plane wave,

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:13.570
then you can see that
what I've written there,

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.030
it came out of a book of
mathematical formulas,

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.450
but physically, it
contains an amplitude

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:21.760
that is given by the value
of a Bessel function.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.910
But then more importantly,
it contains a sequence

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.900
of plane waves that are
known as diffraction orders,

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:32.730
and the propagation angle of
the plane wave indexed by q

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.470
is given by this explanation
here, the same expression

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.740
that they had before.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.700
So these are then the
diffraction orders

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.060
for the sinusoidal
phase grating.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.180
Even more generally,
if you don't

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.670
have a sinusoidal
grating, but still

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:57.800
some kind of a periodic
grating with arbitrary shape,

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.800
and also possibly you
might even have absorption,

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:06.410
so this grating truly
implements a complex amplitude

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.230
transmission, which is
nevertheless periodic.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:12.350
You may recall from
your basic math

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.050
that you have an arbitrary
complex periodic function,

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.720
you can write it as
a Fourier series.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.460
And in this case,
the Fourier series

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.440
also has the same
physical meaning

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.220
as the one I did before,
the Fourier series

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.450
expansion coefficients.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:31.900
And actually, the amplitudes
and the harmonics-- these

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.760
are called harmonics,
if you recall.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.430
The harmonics of the
Fourier series themselves

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:39.610
now correspond to plane
waves that were previously

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.230
called diffraction orders.

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.300
So then you can see
that each Fourier series

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:47.140
coefficient actually corresponds
to a separate diffraction

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:47.640
order.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:55.640
And in addition, recall, again,
Professor Sheppard last week.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.870
He mentioned that if you
have an optical field,

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:02.770
and you take the magnitude
squared of its phasor,

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:06.400
then what you get is actually
the amount of energy that

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.970
propagates that is
carried by this field.

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:14.290
So therefore, the magnitude
squared of the Fourier series

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.530
coefficient actually
corresponds to the energy

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.920
that goes into each
separate diffraction order.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.960
So in this case,
so they're called

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.002
diffraction efficiencies.

00:51:24.002 --> 00:51:25.918
And I should have mentioned
earlier, actually,

00:51:25.918 --> 00:51:26.665
but I forgot--

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:47.770
so in the case of the
sinusoidal amplitude grating,

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:49.490
the diffraction
efficiencies are given

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.980
by the squares of
the coefficients that

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.410
go in front of each plane wave.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:59.050
So you can see that
approximately-- how much--

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:04.390
25% of the energy is
going into the 0 order.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:06.650
It is propagating on axis.

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:09.170
And let's assume that
the contrast is 1.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:13.420
In that case, approximately
12.5% of the energy

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.750
is going into each
diffraction order.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:19.180
That is 1/8.

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:21.690
If I sum them up, how
much do they transmit?

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:33.120
25% plus 12.5% plus
[INAUDIBLE] 12.5%--

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.480
50%, right?

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.730
What happens to the other 50%?

00:52:43.856 --> 00:52:45.442
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:45.442 --> 00:52:47.150
STUDENT: I think there
possibly maybe had

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:49.850
a plus/minus 3 order
or something, I mean,

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:50.845
other orders?

00:52:50.845 --> 00:52:53.220
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: That is
plausible, but in this case,

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.800
we derived only
three orders-- the 0,

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.833
the plus 1, and the minus 1,
so there's no higher order.

00:52:58.833 --> 00:53:00.500
What happened to the
rest of the energy?

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.273
STUDENT: Is it absorbed
depending on the grating?

00:53:06.273 --> 00:53:07.690
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:11.510
The rest of them got absorbed
or actually reflected

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:15.690
backwards by the opaque
parts of the grating.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:17.510
So remember, this is
an amplitude grating.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.280
It blocks part of the light.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.297
So in this case, it's
actually blocked about 50%

00:53:22.297 --> 00:53:22.880
of the energy.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:36.970
So as the last example--

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:41.650
which I will not derive here,
but I will let you go over

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.650
it yourselves at home--

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.420
I did the case of a binary now.

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:49.740
So this is a phase grating very
similar to the surface relief

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.000
that I showed before,
but in this case,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.090
the phase is a binary function.

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:55.270
So why is it binary?

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:58.035
Because this a grating
which is either--

00:54:00.935 --> 00:54:05.140
the light goes either through
a tall part or a short part.

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.800
The tall part, of course,
suffers more phase delay

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.890
because the light has to go
through glass for a little bit

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.080
longer than the short part.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.680
Therefore, if I plot the phase
of the complex transmission,

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.320
expect to see
something like this.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.540
The part of the grating that are
taller, they give me a longer

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.930
phase delay, and of course, the
phase delay can now be tried

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:29.020
normalized so that it is
0 at some reference value.

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:35.340
And then what is the phase
delay at the long part

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:39.635
actually depends on the
height of this groove.

00:54:39.635 --> 00:54:41.010
So even the height
of this groove

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:53.860
is such that s equals
2 pi n minus 1 over--

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.150
let me get this straight.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:12.430
So delta phi equals 2
pi upon lambda times

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:31.980
n times s minus 2 pi over lambda
times s2, where this is s1.

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.740
This is s2.

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:42.480
So if I say that s1 equals s2
plus s, then what I will get

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:48.600
is 2 pi over lambda
times n minus 1 times s.

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.250
So you can see from here that--

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.730
so if s is given by lambda
divided by twice the index

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.210
difference between the glass
and the surrounding medium,

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:18.870
then the phase delay implemented
by this grating is actually pi.

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:20.430
So if you have a
function like this,

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:25.570
then, phase delay pi means
that the complex amplitude

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:30.100
transmission is minus
1, and phase delay 0

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.670
means that it is plus 1.

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:34.510
So there's is another way
to write this function.

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:39.305
It is 1 at half of the period,
and minus 1 the other half

00:56:39.305 --> 00:56:40.360
of the period.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.620
So you can actually--

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.530
it's a little bit of a
[? grind. ?] Next time

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:46.600
I will show you a
faster way to derive it

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:52.000
that you can derive the
Fourier series for this kind

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.685
of a binary phase grating,
and you'll find actually

00:56:55.685 --> 00:56:56.810
something very interesting.

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:59.650
I don't know if you noticed
the animation when I showed it.

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:01.090
Let me play it once again.

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:07.870
You'll find that even orders
of this grating are actually 0,

00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:10.360
and next time, I will
actually say a little bit more

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.910
about this.

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:17.230
Anyway, you find the expression
for the diffracted orders

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:21.850
equals to something that looks
like sine of 5 times the order.

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:27.070
So of course, if the order is
integral, if the order is even,

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:29.750
then there's no diffraction.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:31.360
It turns out that
this grating has

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:35.080
a relatively strong diffraction
efficiency of about 40%

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.090
into the first order.

00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:38.950
STUDENT: I've got a question.

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:40.540
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes?

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.100
STUDENT: How does
the polarization

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.800
of the incident plane wave
change the diffraction

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.260
efficiencies?

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:48.260
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So
these guys were actually

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.660
in the scalar optics
approximation,

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:55.190
so we neglect the
effect of polarization.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.770
To include it is actually
rather complicated business

00:57:57.770 --> 00:58:02.150
that we may get to near
the end of this class,

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:07.580
but it requires something called
coupled wave theory, which

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:11.000
is relatively advanced.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.360
A rule is that if that
period is relatively long,

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.820
a rule of thumb
about 10 wavelengths

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:20.380
or longer, the effect of
the polarization is minor.

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.900
You have a grating whose
period is 2 wavelengths,

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.713
3 wavelengths,
something like that,

00:58:25.713 --> 00:58:27.380
then the effect is
actually significant,

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:29.420
and it cannot be neglected.

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.280
But in this class,
we will actually--

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.780
at least at the
beginning, we will

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.630
pretend that the
period is large enough

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:38.035
that we can neglect
polarization effects.

00:58:38.035 --> 00:58:39.050
Very good question.

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:41.128
Practice actually
makes a big difference.

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:45.880
Other questions?

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.850
STUDENT: Just now, we show
one grating, which modifies

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:57.550
the amplitude of the wave.

00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:00.513
So what's a physical
picture of such a grating?

00:59:00.513 --> 00:59:02.680
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So for
example, what you can do

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.030
is you can Just take
a piece of glass,

00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:09.040
and evaporate the aluminum or
some other metal into the areas

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.830
that you want to
block the light.

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:17.170
So that's one way
to make the grating,

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:23.530
So we take a piece
of glass, then

00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:29.560
you can evaporate
aluminum uniformly here.

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:36.490
Then on top of it, you can put
photoresist and patterning.

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:37.620
OK.

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:42.070
Then you can etch.

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:45.550
So why when you etch, you will
actually remove these parts.

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:59.590
What you will end up
is something like this.

00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:02.067
Then you also remove the
rest of the photoresist.

01:00:10.346 --> 01:00:12.810
So that would be, now,
a binary amplitude

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.510
grating because you
have aluminum blocking

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:18.100
the light here and
then not in here,

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:21.190
so the light goes through.

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:24.180
Yeah, as I said, this is called
a binary amplitude grating,

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.880
and you will deal with
it in the homework.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.730
To make a grayscale, like
the one that I showed

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:33.030
in my calculations here,
it's actually a little bit

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:37.500
difficult. To make this kind
of thing is rather hard.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:42.270
It can be done with sort of
proper evaporation tools,

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.930
but very hard.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:47.310
So this is a rather--

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.710
it's a simple construction
that they need in order

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.450
to describe the
physics, but it's not

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:52.950
very easy to implement
the practice.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.950
STUDENT: And I guess,
just to tie it to the demo

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:56.940
for the phase counterpart,
you can do this

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.000
by-- you saw the
interference pattern produced

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.730
by the Mach-Zehnder, right, that
there were sinusoidal fringes.

01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:06.470
So instead of the CCD, you
could imagine putting there,

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:08.310
for the sensitive
polymer, for example,

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:10.650
like photoresist,
that will expose

01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:14.280
that material with these
bright and dark fringes.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.560
That basically will cause
that refractive index

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.840
in a sinusoidal
pattern, and that

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.620
will produce the phase
version of this grating that

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.278
were shown before also.

01:01:25.278 --> 01:01:26.820
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
As it turns out,

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.930
if you do what Pepe
just described-- let

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:30.720
me see if I get to it here.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.762
If you do what Pepe just
described, you get two effects.

01:01:33.762 --> 01:01:35.220
One is that the
index of refraction

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:40.290
changes in the exposed areas,
but also, because there is--

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:42.240
you can understand
this is a fluid effect.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.670
The index of refraction
changing means

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.030
that the material becomes,
actually, slightly denser.

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:51.690
So this will result in
a surface undulation

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:55.890
in order to conserve its--

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:59.520
to conserve matter, the surface
will actually have to undulate.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.590
So you end up with a grating
that is non-surface relief.

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:05.880
So these exposure processes
are relatively complicated.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:12.750
So if we have time, I may go
into it later during the class.

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:17.800
But another way to do this, to
do the binary grating, which

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.860
is done very often
in practice, is using

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.266
the electron-beam lithography.

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:36.810
Where is my-- so
this kind of grating

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:39.400
is also done with
a similar process,

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.510
but using electron-beam
lithography.

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:43.180
So what you do is basically--

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:52.070
one way to do it is
you start with glass,

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:56.290
then you coat it with a
material that is called HSQ.

01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:59.900
And actually, you can pattern
it using an electron beam.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:07.100
You put an electron beam
resist on top, which is PMMA.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.830
Then, using the electron beam,
you remove parts of the PMMA.

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:15.870
And then you etch
away these parts.

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:20.490
Then you end up with a
pattern that looks like this.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.400
So HSQ is actually clear.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.020
It's very similar to glass.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:36.860
So this would be a physical
realization of the binary phase

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.960
grating.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.690
The light is all
transparent, but the light

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:43.240
propagates a longer
distance inside the material

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.470
here, whereas here, it
propagates in the air.

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.430
So that's why we'll
get this effect.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.055
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:54.055 --> 01:03:55.680
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
With a laser beam,

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.050
you can actually get
very small gratings.

01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:02.370
If it is completely
periodic, then people

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:07.460
can make something like 100
nanometers or less easily.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.120
So what I mean by 100 nanometers
is that this period over here

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.350
might be 100 nanometers,
even less, actually.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.080
So of course, for
visible light, that

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.240
would be a
subwavelength grating.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.710
It wouldn't do much.

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:24.150
But it could be useful, for
example, for ultraviolet light,

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:27.540
or for other applications where
you don't use it as a grating.

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.060
If it is nonperiodic,
very often--

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.590
we will see later in the class--

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:34.080
sometimes, we want to make
patterns that look like this.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.800
OK, so this is, again, a phase
grating, but it is nonperiodic.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.940
You can see that
the period changes.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.125
So if the period changes
in the quadratic fashion,

01:04:49.125 --> 01:04:50.500
this is a very
important element.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:55.180
It's called a "Fresnel" Here
is, again, the French term--

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.700
"Fresnel zone plate."

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.280
This I will describe
in class later.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.240
It's a very, very important
optical component.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.600
But it turns out because
of this kind of pattern

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.580
it is nonperiodic, it is
not so easy to make using

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.250
electron-beam lithography.

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.950
So in that case, you
have to go to great pains

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.670
to make small features.

01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:19.900
So in this case, it's
a little bit strange.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.510
But because of the
nonperiodicity,

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.520
the feature sizes
here are limited

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.290
to bigger values-- so for
example, 200 to 300 nanometers.

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:33.010
This has to do with the
way electron beams scatter

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:35.080
from the photoresist.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.600
Actually, some of
you are taking,

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.710
simultaneously, Professor
[? Bargrand's ?] class.

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:44.800
He goes into great detail
into this particular--

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.660
into why this is the case.

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.080
For visible light, it
is actually quite easy

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.380
to make reasonably sized
gratings with lambda

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.920
bigger than, say, five
or 10 wavelengths.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.350
It is actually easy to
make these kind of gratings

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:05.740
either with optical exposure,
like Pepe described,

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.850
or with electron-beam
lithography.

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:12.520
There's also other
techniques, for example,

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.995
interference lithography.

01:06:13.995 --> 01:06:15.370
There's a whole
set of techniques

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.078
that people use to
make this grating.

01:06:17.078 --> 01:06:17.620
I don't know.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:22.990
Pepe, do you know, the one that
you showed, how was it made?

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:25.210
STUDENT: Not really.

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:25.810
Not really.

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:27.250
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:28.833
STUDENT: It was the
one that you used.

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:31.115
Do you know?

01:06:31.115 --> 01:06:32.240
I don't know, to be honest.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.430
No.

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:36.688
I think it's a binary grating
and probably was done--

01:06:36.688 --> 01:06:38.230
I don't think it
was done with e-beam

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:39.380
because it's pretty large.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.380
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: No.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:40.540
No.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:40.670
No.

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:41.430
STUDENT: It has to do with--

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:43.870
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: [INAUDIBLE]
suspect that way also

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:47.190
of making these
gratings by molding.

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:48.190
That's another way.

01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:51.580
So you basically create a
very expensive negative,

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.720
like a mold.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.860
And then you stamp--

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:54.610
not quite glass.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:57.700
It has to be some kind
of a pliable material.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.450
That's one way.

01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:01.990
And then they can
also make them by--

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:04.960
basically, by scratching
by very accurate machines.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.260
So there are many, many
different ways to make--

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.452
STUDENT: The dip-pen lithography
or some kind of [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:11.452 --> 01:07:13.410
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: It's
reactive ion etching.

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:15.010
STUDENT: Dip-pen lithography?

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:16.385
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Oh, Dip-pen.

01:07:16.385 --> 01:07:17.648
STUDENT: Yeah.

01:07:17.648 --> 01:07:18.690
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:21.345
Except dip-pen lithography
can allow you to do only--

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.160
where is it?

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.880
I lost my amplitude grating.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.330
It can only make amplitude
gratings, not phase gratings.

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:34.070
Depends.

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:34.930
It's ink, right?

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:36.180
So good deposit ink.

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:38.390
And this way, you
can actually absorb.

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:40.460
You can get absorption bands.

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.700
But I don't know if you
can make phase gratings

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.970
with dip-pen lithography.

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:45.910
Have to look into it.

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:51.660
They're very popular nowadays.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:55.320
Again, professor [? Bagram ?]
goes into this in more detail.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:59.992
But a very popular
technique is-- it's called--

01:07:59.992 --> 01:08:00.700
help me out here.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.120
How do you call the
stamping technique?

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.745
STUDENT: Oh, we
call it nanoimprint.

01:08:05.745 --> 01:08:07.370
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Nanoimprint, yeah.

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:09.040
Nanoimprint lithography, yeah.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.340
That's a very popular technique
to make these kind of elements

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:16.210
with very small
periods, actually.

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:18.790
People make [? 15 ?]
nanometers or less,

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:20.791
actually, with nanoimprint.

01:08:25.604 --> 01:08:26.479
STUDENT: Sorry, Prof.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:28.879
Do we have time for
one more question?

01:08:28.879 --> 01:08:30.254
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
I have time,

01:08:30.254 --> 01:08:31.609
but some people have classes.

01:08:31.609 --> 01:08:33.080
But yeah, go ahead.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.330
STUDENT: OK, I'm just curious.

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:36.880
Let's say, just now, you
mentioned the sine theta cannot

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.200
be greater than 1.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.779
So what happens if we
shine the visible light

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:44.077
on to a grating with a period
[INAUDIBLE] 100 nanometer?

01:08:44.077 --> 01:08:45.160
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.430
So I actually said it before.

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:47.680
Let me repeat it again.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:54.300
So he's asking, what will happen
if you have a grating here,

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:59.590
like this, for example,
where the period lambda now

01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:02.662
is less than the wavelength?

01:09:02.662 --> 01:09:03.330
OK.

01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:09.649
So, if you recall, a
planewave is of this form--

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:17.050
e to the i kxx
plus kyy plus kzz--

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:20.710
and this, we saw when
we did electromagnetics.

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:25.189
And we also saw that because
of the electromagnetic wave

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:29.180
equation, the wave
vector components here--

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.819
they have to satisfy
this equation.

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:46.740
OK, so now, according to the
equation that we had before,

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:50.880
if this is the x direction--
and let's ignore y for now.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.000
So basically, I can
neglect this term for now.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:03.170
And what we have is that the
sine factor will equal lambda

01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:05.710
upon the period.

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:07.220
And it's bigger than 1.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:11.810
OK, mathematically, if
I have a complex angle,

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:13.430
the sine can be bigger than 1.

01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:15.560
But what does this
physically mean?

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.740
Physically, if you plug
into this equation here,

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:27.440
you will get that the kz
squared equals 2 pi upon lambda

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:37.430
squared minus 2 pi upon lambda
squared based on this equation.

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:47.270
When I said that kx equals
2 pi upon lambda sine theta

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:52.680
equals to pi upon lambda times
lambda over lambda equals 2 pi

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.690
upon lambda--

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.480
OK.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:01.490
So if I do that now, I will
get that the kz squared

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:02.465
equals 2 pi.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.850
And the quantity inside the
square root is less than 0,

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:20.670
so we'll get that the kz
now will equal plus minus.

01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:22.560
It will become imaginary.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.980
[INAUDIBLE] plus minus i
the square root of something

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.882
positive.

01:11:31.975 --> 01:11:33.100
So what does this mean now?

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:46.870
I have a wave whose amplitude
will be like e to the i kxx.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.820
Nothing changes here.

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:56.220
But then it will be plus minus
i times something positive.

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:04.432
Let's call this "alpha"
for gravity here.

01:12:04.432 --> 01:12:05.890
OK, this is what
the wave will look

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:09.010
like after the
subwavelength grating.

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:17.090
So now, clearly here,
if you multiply the two

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:20.100
imaginary units, we
will get a real number.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.180
So we get either exponential
decay or exponential explosion.

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.380
Physically, you cannot expect
the wave to grow exponentially.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.470
That would mean someone
is supplying power,

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:32.190
and there's nothing
like that here.

01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:33.590
So therefore, you
get a wave that

01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:38.440
will look like e to
the minus alpha z--

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.240
there's a z here
in [INAUDIBLE]----

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.180
times e to the minus
e to the plus ikxx.

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:45.495
So what is this now?

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:48.710
The e to the minus alpha
z's an exponential decay

01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:50.510
away from the grating.

01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:53.480
The e do the ikx is what
we call a "surface wave."

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.470
It propagates like this.

01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:57.580
So actually, what you
get after this grating

01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:02.150
is you get a wave that
propagates parallel

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:03.770
to the grating.

01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:06.170
I don't know if the camera
can show me on this one--

01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:06.730
probably not.

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:09.470
But anyway, as you get the
wave that propagates parallel

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:12.710
to the grating, it is
called the "surface wave,"

01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:14.240
but it doesn't live very long.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.060
It decays exponentially
away from the grating.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.130
That is actually called
an "evanescent wave."

01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:31.710
And it is not really
part of the class.

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:38.880
This is a very simplified
description of what happens.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.590
To properly do it,
I would have to take

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:42.620
into account polarization.

01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.490
I would basically have
to be more careful

01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:46.410
solving Maxwell's equations.

01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:49.770
And because this class
is simple, basic optics,

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:52.060
I generally stay away from
those kinds of gray things.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.030
That's why I don't
describe them in detail.

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:58.283
But since you asked, I gave you
a very simplified description.

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:06.012
We may talk about this
a bit near the end,

01:14:06.012 --> 01:14:08.220
depending on how much time
we have left near the end.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:12.175
But if we do, I will talk
about this in more detail.

01:14:12.175 --> 01:14:13.550
It's also related
to the question

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:16.820
that someone has asked
before about polarization.

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.520
If you have a
subwavelength grating,

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.090
then you definitely have to
take into account the incident

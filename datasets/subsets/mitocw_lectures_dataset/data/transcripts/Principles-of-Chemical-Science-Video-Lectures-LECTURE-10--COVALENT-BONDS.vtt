00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:22.550
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.240
It's 12:05, so why don't you
go ahead and take 10 more

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.540
seconds on the clicker
question today.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.070
This is about the periodic
trends that we

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.720
discussed on Wednesday.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.430
So specifically, what we're
asking here is as we go across

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.170
the periodic table, we want to
consider which has the smaller

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.440
ionization energy.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.540
All right.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.555
So, let's focus our attention
up here now, whether it's

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:52.890
between aluminum or whether
it's between phosphorous.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130
And I also wanted you to
identify why it's also

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.350
important to understand why we
have these trends, not just to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.010
memorize the trend itself.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.610
So, it turns out that the
majority of you got the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.150
correct answer, which is
that it's aluminum.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.850
The reason it's aluminum is
because aluminum has a lower z

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.920
effective, so it's not being
pulled in as tightly by the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.610
nucleus, and if it's not being
pulled in as tightly, you're

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.330
going to have to put in less
energy in order to ionize it,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.860
so that's why it's actually
going to have the smaller

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.260
ionization energy.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.300
So it looks like not too many
more than half of you got this

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.270
correct, so make sure you can
look at your periodic table

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.120
and figure out how to think
about ionization energy in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.760
terms of z effective, not just
in terms of memorizing what

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.240
that trend is.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.460
All right, so we can go to
today's notes, and in terms of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.550
the notes, what we're going
to start with is finishing

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.700
material that's going to be
relevant for exam 1, and I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.810
told you on Wednesday that
actually I'd give you some

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.030
information today in terms of
what you need to do to prepare

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.270
for exam 1.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.240
So you should have gotten two
handouts as you came in, and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.830
if you didn't, please raise your
hand and a TA will come

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.380
to you and get you that
second handout.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.340
But the second one says "exam
instructions and logistics."

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.510
So, if everyone can
pull that out.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.540
So this is going to tell you
pretty much everything you

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.270
need to know in terms of getting
ready for the exam,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.210
which is next Wednesday.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.310
So when you go home today or
some time this weekend, make

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.130
sure you read this
page in detail.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.100
I'm just going to go over a few
of the main points here.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.180
So, the first is that what we're
going over notes today

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.900
and also on Monday, the exam
material ends at the end

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.860
lecture notes from lecture 9.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.080
So that was Wednesday's class
-- not at the end of

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.350
Wednesday's class, but at the
end of the lecture notes.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.130
So we're going to finish
up with those today.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.850
I'll be really, really clear
when we get through them, and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.640
that's where you can stop in
terms of studying for this.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.680
Also, on everything that was on
problem-sets 1 through 3.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.220
So, you turned in p-set 3 today,
but we'll have the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.860
answers posted for you this
afternoon, so you can start

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.280
studying from p-set 3, even as
early as tonight, if you want

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.700
to, because those answers
will be there for you.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.920
So, in terms of what it is that
you need to prepare and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.670
bring with you for the exam, you
need to bring your MIT ID,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.380
especially if you haven't been
showing up regularly to your

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.070
recitations and you aren't 100%
sure if your TA knows

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.270
exactly who you are, you need to
make sure you have your MIT

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.500
ID with you.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.680
You can't take the exam unless
you're registered for the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.600
class, and we need to make
sure we can verify that.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.190
You also need to bring a
calculator, of course, because

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.020
we'll be solving problems that
involve calculations.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.440
You can bring any calculator
you want, we don't actually

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.440
have restrictions for calculator
types here, but

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.230
what you can't do, is you can't
program any relevant

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.110
chemical or information about
constants in there.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.970
It's OK to use certain
fundamental constants that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.860
come in a lot of calculators,
so there's nothing we can do

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.740
about that.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.760
That's OK.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.690
If you're wondering what's OK
or what's not OK, it's very

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.180
clearly written out in this
handout, so make sure you read

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.850
through it, because it is your
responsibility to make sure

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.420
that your calculator does
not have anything extra

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.480
programmed in it.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.115
And if you have your calculator
all set up as you

00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:08.120
love and you don't want to
change it, then maybe you

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.010
should just go and get an $8.00
scientific calculator

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.200
that doesn't have any of the
graphing functions, because

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.580
you don't actually need them, so
that's a better option for

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.330
you, you can do that as well.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.010
And I had mentioned several
times that you do not need to

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.800
memorize the majority of the
equations and you don't need

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.080
to memorize any physical
constants.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.950
So if you flip the info page
over on the back here, what

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.340
you'll see is the periodic
table, this is the same one

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.925
that I've handed out in the
last two lectures -- the

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:38.490
periodic table without any
electron configurations.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.740
This is exactly the sheet here,
it's exactly what you'll

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.000
get on exam day.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.870
You'll also see that they have
all the physical constants

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.660
that you're going to need, and
also a bunch of the actual

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.090
equations that we've been using
in the first couple

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.040
weeks here.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.300
So you don't need to memorize
any of this, you're actually

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.430
going to be handed this.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.060
There are a few equations that
you need to memorize -- those

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.960
are the very simple -- very,
very simple equations, such as

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.820
e equals h times nu -- hopefully
you don't have to

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.880
sit down and try to memorize
that, hopefully we all know

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.730
that already.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.280
But just to be really clear,
I've written out exactly which

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.190
equations you do have to
memorize on the front here, so

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.730
long as you know those, the
rest you can just look up.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.870
And in terms of using these
equations in solving problems

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.460
on the exam, and also using
these constants, make sure if

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.870
you think there might be any
chance you're going to get any

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.210
little part of a problem wrong
or do a calculation

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.280
inaccurately, you need to write
out every single step of

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.340
your thinking as you write out
these problems. We can't give

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.700
you any partial credit
whatsoever if we can't see

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.610
your thought process.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.460
So it's important to write out
the equation you use, you need

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.720
to write out the constants
that you use to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.800
fill in that equation.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.710
And that we need to see your
work to get full credit, and

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.400
then especially if you get
things wrong, we need to know

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.640
where it went wrong, because
we do try to give as much

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.910
partial credit as possible in
these exams, since there are a

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.250
lot of places where small
mistakes can result in the

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.220
wrong answer.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.620
So also, along those lines in
terms of test taking, make

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.780
sure you also box your answers
and that you keep track of

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.370
significant figures and that you
also remember to include

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.700
your units.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.380
These are just little things
that can add up, so you just

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.100
want to make sure you're
on top of those.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.580
And your TAs on Tuesday are
going to share a lot of other

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.140
types of sort of exam strategies
in thinking about

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.900
how you can approach an exam
when we're in a time situation

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.160
like we are, so they'll share
some of their experience with

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.290
you in terms of taking
these timed exams.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.980
So, in terms of practicing this
weekend, I mentioned that

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.180
instead of getting a problem-set
today, what I am

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.410
going to be posting is optional
extra problems. So

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.700
they're optional, but they're
very, very, very highly

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.150
encouraged that you do these,
because this is going to give

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.390
you practice for the types of
problems that are going to be

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.410
on the exam.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.170
We're also posting a practice
exam for you to take, so after

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.960
you're completely done your
studying, it's good to have

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.510
everything done before you take
the practice exam, and

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.410
then sit down just with this
sheet here and your

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.330
calculator, and ideally a timer,
and make sure you can

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.260
do the practice exam in the
allotted amount of time.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.960
So that way you can have an
idea if, oh, I do really

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.220
understand this but I'm a little
bit slow, maybe I need

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.930
to practice this one type of
problem a little bit longer so

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.860
I can get up to speed so I'm
going to be able to get

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.550
through all this in terms
of the exam time.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.830
All right.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.700
So let's move on to
today's topics.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.420
So, as I said, we're finishing
up with what we left off with

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.180
yesterday -- or excuse
me, on Wednesday.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.340
This includes atomic radius and
the idea of isoelectronic

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.450
atoms. So that's going to
be the end of the exam 1

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.710
material, and then we'll move
on to exam 2 material, which

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.600
is kind of exciting, because
we've been talking about just

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.080
individual atoms and ions up to
this point, and now we can

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.700
talk about molecules, so
we're going to start

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.100
talking about bonding.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.220
So for some you that are less
interested in maybe the

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.010
physical structure of an
individual atom, now some more

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.350
exciting material for you might
be coming up if you like

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.780
to think about how, instead,
molecules behave, either

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.660
within bonding, within
themselves, or with other

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.650
molecules, that's what we're
going to be heading to

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.780
in this next unit.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.920
So, we need to finish up
with periodic trends.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.050
And first, on your
lecture notes, I

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.920
start with atomic radius.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.430
I was so proud of myself getting
the lecture notes

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.750
finished early and handing them
in to CopyTech, and then

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.440
I realized we didn't do

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.370
electronegativity on Wednesday.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.880
So, if you can flip your lecture
notes over and just

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.690
write on the blank space,
we're going to cover

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.870
electronegativity first here,
and specifically, you can go

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.870
back and fill this in to your
lecture 9 notes, if you want

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.300
to stay organized, but I just
suggest just writing it on

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.880
lecture 10 notes now
and going back.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.160
You can still keep organized,
which hopefully most of you

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.770
like to do, and get it in the
right place in the notes.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:57.510
So, when we're talking about the
idea of electronegativity,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.540
essentially what we're talking
about is the ability for an

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.300
atom to attract electron density
from another atom.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.330
So it's just a measure of how
much does one given atom want

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.715
to pull away electron
density from, let's

00:09:10.715 --> 00:09:12.470
say, an adjacent atom.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.960
So it's actually very related
to what we're talking about

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.890
when we said electron affinity,
and it's also

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.020
related to ionization energy,
and we can call

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.930
electronegativity by symbol
here, and it turns out that

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.780
it's going to be proportional
to 1/2 of the electron

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.740
affinity of a given atom, plus
the ionization energy.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.340
So, in other words, we
can just think of

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.290
electronegativity as being the
average of that ionization

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.290
energy and the electron
affinity.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.550
This should make sense, because
if an atom has a very

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.360
high electron affinity, that
means it's really happy taking

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.440
an electron from another atom,
or taking a free electron --

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.970
that that's very favorable.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.720
If something has a high
ionization energy, it means

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.730
that it really, really,
really does not want

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.280
to give up an electron.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.830
So you can think about how these
2 things combined are

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.890
going to be electronegativity,
which is a measure of how much

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.430
an atom wants to pull electron
density away

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.300
from another atom.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.100
So, if we think about
electronegativity as a

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.450
periodic trend, we can just draw
our nice periodic table

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.650
here, and let's separate
it into quadrants.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.320
So if we think about the upper
right hand part of the

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.280
quadrant, well, this is where
we're going to have high

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.960
electron affinity and high
ionization energy, so we're

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.340
also going to see high
electronegativity here.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.980
And in contrast, in the lower
left hand part of the periodic

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.200
table, these 2 quantities are
low, so also what we're going

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.740
to see is low electronegativity.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.680
And if we talk about what's
going on in areas, or with

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.210
atoms that have high
electronegativity, and we

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.130
think about whether they're
electron donors or electron

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.500
acceptors, what would you expect
for an atom that has

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.690
high electronegativity?

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.280
Is it going to be an electron
donor or acceptor?

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:04.650
Great.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.030
Yup, it's going to be an
electron acceptor, it wants to

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.730
accept electrons, it wants to
accept electron density.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:14.310
So, in contrast, if it has a
low electronegativity, this

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:21.540
then is going to be
an electron donor.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.020
All right, so it's very
common to talk about

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.470
electronegativity of different
atoms, and you can look up

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.580
tables of these.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.760
Often what you'll see is not
a table based on this

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.330
definition, but something that's
called the Pauling

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.000
definition of electronegativity,
but it's

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.350
exactly the same idea and the
same trend as this more

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.320
numerical way to think about
what the meaning of

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.730
electronegativity is.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.620
All right, so now we can move
on to the start of today's

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.740
notes, which is atomic radius.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.870
So this, in fact, is going to
be our last principle that

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.690
we're going to talk about in
terms of periodic trends.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.500
So this is actually the most
straightforward, so sometimes

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.880
it's nice to end with the
easiest concept, and that's

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.110
what we're doing here.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.520
And if we're talking about
atomic radius, essentially

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.000
we're talking about
atomic size.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.930
And immediately it should
probably come into your head

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.070
that we don't actually have an
atomic radius that we can talk

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.530
about, right?

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.130
What I just spent many lectures
discussing is the

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.500
fact that we can not know how
far away an electron is from

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.350
the nucleus, so we can't
actually know the radius of a

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.520
certain atom.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.010
And that's true.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.030
An atom's not a defined
sphere, for example.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.320
We can't define it as an exact
radius in terms of the

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.840
definition we might think
of classically.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.470
So, keep that in mind when we're
talking about atomic

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.400
radius, I'm not suddenly
changing my story and saying,

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.270
yes, we do have a
distinct radius.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.890
Instead, what people have done
is come up with different ways

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.160
to think about how they
can define a radius.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.680
And one common way to think
about it, is to think about

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.780
the value of r, or the radius,
below which 90% of that

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.060
electron density is going
to be contained.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.060
So we're not saying it's
all the electron

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.830
density, it's just 90%.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.700
Because we know as we go to
infinity, even though the

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.890
density gets smaller and smaller
and smaller, we still

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.980
have electron density very far
away from the nucleus.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.130
So, what we're going to define
is just let's just capture 90%

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.950
of that electron density.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.280
So, that's one way to think
about it, and there's also

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.620
another way, and this
is the way that your

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.790
book presents it.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.510
If you, in fact, have two of
the same atom right next to

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.650
each other, let's say you have a
crystal, or let's say you're

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.350
talking about a metal, what you
can do is just look at the

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.010
distance between the two nuclei,
and split that in 1/2,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.410
and take the atomic
radius that way.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.760
So, these are two different
definitions of how to think

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.500
about atomic radius, but really
what you find when

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.500
these are measured is they
come up with almost the

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.570
identical values, so there are
tables you can look up of

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.430
atomic radii and see these
values, and you can trust them

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.670
that, yes, they work for both
this definition and for this

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.770
definition here,
in most cases.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.710
And what we've been talking
about with all of these

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.390
properties are, of course, how
can we figure out what that is

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.850
for a certain atom by looking
at the periodic table, so we

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.130
want to think about
the periodic

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.190
trend for atomic radius.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.460
And we know as we go across a
row in the periodic table,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.340
what's happening is that z
effective or the effective

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.920
pull on the nucleus
is increasing.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.100
So would you expect, therefore,
as we go across a

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:23.040
row for the atomic radius, to
increase or to decrease?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.350
Good.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.020
OK, yes.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.880
We are expecting to see that
it decreases because it's

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.430
feeling a stronger pull, all the
electrons are being pulled

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.860
in closer to the nucleus, so
that atomic size is going to

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.530
get smaller.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.530
This is in contrast to what's
happening as we go down a

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.800
periodic table.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.660
So as we go down we're now
adding electrons to further

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.240
and further away shells, so
what we're going to see is

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.580
that the atomic radius is going
to increase as we're

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.290
going down the periodic table.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.610
And we can look at
an example here.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.410
If we start in the upper left
hand corner of the periodic

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.470
table with lithium, you can
see that as we go down the

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.270
table, what you're seeing is
that that atomic radius is

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.860
actually increasing,
as we would expect.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.060
Whereas, if we go across a row,
what we see is that the

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.330
atomic radius is decreasing.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.210
So, again, this is one of the
more straightforward trends.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.960
You just need to remember
what's happening to z

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.450
effective, which really tells
us what's happening with all

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.170
the trends, and once you know
z effective, you can figure

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.140
out, for example, what direction
the atomic radius

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.130
should be going into.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.190
So, that's it for
periodic trends.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.950
We have talked about four
different ones.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.780
We talked about ionization
energy, electron affinity, we

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.530
talked about electronegativity,
which is

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.610
just kind of a combination of
the first two, and then ended

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.190
with atomic radius here.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.190
And what you might have noted
is although we described how

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.950
to make predictions about these
properties, I didn't

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.090
talk too much about what it
actually means, what the

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.680
ramifications of these different
properties are.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.830
And the reason we didn't do that
is because we're actually

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.940
going to spend much of the rest
of the course relating

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.360
these different properties to
the properties of molecules in

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.950
terms of bonding, and also in
terms of chemical reactions.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.890
So, for example, if we have a
very electronegative atom

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.820
within a certain molecule, what
you'll actually find is

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.740
that it does affect how the
molecule is going to take part

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.820
in different chemical or
biological reactions.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.420
And this will become more and
more clear as we actually talk

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.740
about these reactions and
talk about bonding.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.930
But you need to be able to
predict what kind of

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.690
properties a certain atom's
going to have within a

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.500
molecule, whether you're talking
about something, for

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.730
example, that's very
electronegative, or something

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.960
that is not electronegative at
all, it is going to make a

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.560
difference in terms of thinking
about how molecules

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.790
are structured and
also how they

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.310
interact with other molecules.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.780
However, I can give you at least
one example while we're

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.100
still on just talking about
atoms. So we haven't gotten to

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.150
molecules yet, we're just
talking about single atoms or

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.350
single ions, but what's nice
is just talking about this

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.130
very straightforward principle
of atomic radius.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.110
We can already use that in terms
of single ions to think

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.240
about a really complex
biological issue, which is to

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.030
talk about ion channels.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.310
So, that is just a quick example
for some of you, you

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.070
might be very familiar with ion
channels, others might not

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.870
know what these are, so I'll
just tell you quite briefly

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:15.570
that ion channels are
these very massive

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.540
transmembrane proteins.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.600
Essentially, what they are is
it's a protein that spans the

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.760
membrane of a cell.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.560
And what they do is they
regulate the influx of ions

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.920
across that cell.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.420
So the influx of ions from the
outside of the cell to the

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.440
inside of the cell,
for example.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.980
And you can think of ion
channels as being gated, by

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.340
gated it means the gate can be
closed and no ions are going

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.500
through, as in this case here.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.660
Or you can talk about the gate
being open, and in this case,

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.670
you can see that you will
have an influx of ions.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.060
So, ion channels are important
for maintaining a voltage

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.820
difference between the inside of
the cell and outside of the

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.560
cell, and they're found in all
sorts of cell types in your

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.520
body, but if you think about
where they're most prevalent,

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.380
it turns out that they're most
prevalent in muscle cells and

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.360
also in nerve cells,
so in your neurons.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.810
And essentially, what they do
in neurons is they underlie

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.250
those nerve impulses, or those,
essentially what we

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.450
call electrical signaling
between neurons -- you might

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.020
also call that the action
potential of the neurons.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.510
So essentially, they regulate
this action potential, and

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.160
they do so by helping to
establish and then control the

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.810
voltage gradient within the
cells. so, essentially,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.070
they're establishing or
controlling or changing the

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.640
difference between the charge
inside the cell and the charge

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.480
outside cell.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.320
And when we talk about any type
of ion channel, there are

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.590
just tons of different kinds of
ion channels, and you can

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.620
characterize them in a
few different ways.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.700
So, for example, you could
characterize them in terms of

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.370
how they're gated, and basically
how they open or

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.030
close -- that's one way to talk
about different types.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.420
Another way to talk about
different types is to think

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.920
about which ion they're
selected for.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.090
And all ion channels are
selective for a single type of

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:06.030
ion, and we can think about
how that selectivity takes

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.640
place, and that's where this
idea of atomic radius is going

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.280
to become very important.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.780
So, for example, if we look at
sodium channels, and sodium

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.340
channels are some of the
particularly prevalent ones

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.010
when we're talking about
neurons, if you think about

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.880
the cell membrane, and this
little green cartoon is me

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.090
trying to show a sodium channel
here, and in this

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.910
case, you can see that it's
closed, such that no ions are

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.080
getting through.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.240
However, when that gate is
opened, the sodium channel is

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.570
now going to be incredibly
selective and only let through

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.320
sodium ions and no other
type of ion.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.480
And this is really interesting
to think about because you can

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.300
imagine in our body we have
concentrations of all types of

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.780
ions, and specifically, some
seem very, very similar to

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:48.460
each other.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.520
So we could think about
comparing the potassium ion to

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.850
a sodium ion.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.740
They have the same charge
of plus one.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.130
The only thing that's different
is that they're one

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:02.000
down on the periodic table,
potassium is down one row, so

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.890
it's going to be a little
bigger, but when we're

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.900
thinking about size, it maybe
does not seem that significant

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.370
to talk about the size.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.500
But what we find out
is that it is.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.690
So, what happens, this is
another view of a sodium

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.930
channel, so this is actually
looking a little bit more at

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.330
the protein structure.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.980
What all of these channels
have is what's called a

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.100
selectivity filter, so this
filter filters out the type of

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.990
ion that's going to be
allowed through.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.560
And there's two parts
of the filter.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.310
First we need to select
for actual charge.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.780
So the way that it does this
is the filter is actually

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.490
lined with all of this negative
charge, and for those

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.330
of you that are more into
biology or biochemistry,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.020
that's because of negatively
charged amino acid residues,

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.680
but all you need to think about
is that it has negative

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.360
charge in the inside of this
pore, and what happens then is

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.650
that if something has a positive
charge, it's going to

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.000
be stabilized to enter this
pore, whereas any negative

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.470
ions are going to be repelled.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.510
So that's the first step in
being selective, but now how

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.920
do we differentiate between
these sodium

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920
and potassium ions.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.640
And the answer is just really
beautifully simple, and it's

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.340
just that the pore gets really,
really tiny, to the

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.000
point that it gets so small that
all that can fit through

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.880
this pore is one a single ion,
one single sodium ion,

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.760
solvated by one single
water molecule.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.360
And that's all that's big enough
to pass through or

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.120
small enough to pass through.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.820
And if we go up even just one
row on the periodic table to

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.200
potassium, what we actually see
is now that it's going to

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.070
be too large, and, in fact, a
potassium solvated with one

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.620
water molecule won't go
through our channel.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.480
So, this is just one example
of how these properties can

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.760
already, even our understanding
just talking

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.760
about single atoms, can already
make an impact in

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.600
these biological systems. And
actually, a question that

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.400
might come up, I just explained,
the sodium channel,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.260
you might say, well, how do
potassium channels work then,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.830
because I can understand how you
can filter something big

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.820
out, but how do you filter
out something small.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.590
And it turns out that size
exclusion is also the

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.420
principle that's in play with
potassium channels as well,

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.800
but in this case it's a little
more complex, because what

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.780
happens is these negative
residues the are in the pore

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.120
need to stabilize the potassium
as it goes through,

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.920
and the potassium is large
enough to make all the

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.930
contacts it needs, but the
sodium, which you can picture

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.410
being smaller, actually can't
reach all of the stabilizing

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.770
charges that it needs to to
get through the pore.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.380
So, again, it is based on size,
it's a little bit less

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.790
intuitive than the idea of just
straining out all of the

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.340
potassium ions.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.950
But again, many of these ion
channels have this size

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.700
exclusion pore, it's a very
important part of them.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.890
All right, so that was a quick
aside on thinking about how

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.960
these properties can,
in fact, relate to

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.800
something in our body.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.340
Let's move on to the last topic
in terms of this first

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.650
exam, which is thinking about
the idea of isoelectronic

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:56.000
atoms, or isoelectronic ions.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.950
And isoelectronic is very
straightforward, it just means

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.520
having the same electron
configuration.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.890
The easiest way to look at this
is just to do an example.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.220
So let's take the
example of neon.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.680
This has the electron
configuration of 1 s 2, 2

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.530
s 2, and 2 p 6.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:16.140
It looks like we're cut off the
screen a little bit here,

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.600
but you can see I've just
circled it there.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.150
So we can go ahead and think
about, well, are there any

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.130
other atoms that are going
to have the same electron

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:23.790
configuration?

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.110
The answer to that is definitely
no -- if they had

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.732
the same electron configuration,
they would, in

00:23:27.732 --> 00:23:29.200
fact, be neon.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.590
But we can think about different
ions that have this

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.070
electron configuration.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.510
So for example, if we think
about fluorine, that has an

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:41.570
electron configuration of 1 s
2, 2 s 2, 2 p 5, so all we

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:44.210
would need to do is add one more
electron to get the same

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.270
configuration as for neon.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.300
So if we want to write out what
that would be, it would

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:55.980
just be to say that f minus is
isoelectronic with neon.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.770
So, we can say that -- if we
have neon here and we want to

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.860
think about what's
isoelectronic, f minus would

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.170
be isoelectronic.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:10.230
We also have oxygen -- what
would the charge on oxygen be?

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.690
Um-hmm, right.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.240
2 minus.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.110
Then also, nitrogen, 3 minus --
these are all going to be

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.080
isoelectronic with neon.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.540
We can go in the other
direction, so let's go to

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.020
sodium, but we would need to
take away an electron to make

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.670
it isoelectronic.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.710
So we would say sodium plus,
or magnesium 2 plus, we can

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:36.960
just keep going -- aluminum 3
plus, silicone 4 plus, and we

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.080
can go on and on in either
direction all the way across

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.670
and down the periodic table.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.380
So, that's the idea of
isoelectronic ions.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.260
These are all isoelectronic,
they all have the same

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.980
electron configuration.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.110
And we can also think
about going back to

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.830
atomic size for a second.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.130
What the relationship is between
these ions and their

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:03.470
parent atoms. So, for example,
if we think of the fluorine

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:08.190
minus case, would you expect
fluorine minus to be larger or

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.940
smaller than neutral fluorine?

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:12.350
Okay.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.840
I heard mostly larger, but a
little bit of a mix in there,

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.780
and it turns out that
larger is correct.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.750
And we can think about why --
essentially we have fluorine

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.980
and now we're adding
another electron.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.260
So you can picture that fluorine
is going to get

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.060
larger in this case.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.330
And that would be true
for all of the

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.320
negatively charged ions.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.970
So, by the same logic, that
means that all of our

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.330
positively charged ions are, in
fact, going to be smaller

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.370
in terms of radius, compared
to their neutral parents.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.640
Not only are we taking away an
electron here, but we're also

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.810
going to decrease shielding,
so the electrons that are

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.220
already in there are going to
feel a higher z effective and

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.640
will be pulling and the atom
will be getting smaller.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.670
And this is just a picture
showing some of these sizes

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.500
with their parent.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.620
So, for example, a lithium here,
you can see how lithium

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.200
plus is smaller than the actual
lithium atom in its

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.190
neutral state.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:10.610
Whereas for fluorine, fluorine
is smaller than f minus is the

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.570
one that's the outer
shell shown here.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.960
So, let's do a clicker question
on isoelectronic

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:22.450
atoms. And now we're asking you
to look at krypton, so the

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.240
atomic mass is 36.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.760
You can actually just grab
that handout, the second

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.830
handout on the exam and look at
the periodic table there.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.200
So, which of the following ions
listed is isoelectronic

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:43.950
with krypton?

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:58.050
OK, let's take 10
seconds on that.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:58.520
OK, good.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.170
This might be our all-time
high, 89% got this right.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.170
This is great.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.980
So, selenium 2 minus is what's
going to be isoelectronic,

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.610
because if you add two electrons
to selenium, you'll

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.490
get the same electron
configuration that you have

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.470
for krypton here.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.070
OK, I think we can safely
go back to notes.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.345
So, I said I would announce
it, that's the

00:27:20.345 --> 00:27:22.000
end of exam 1 material.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.350
So, if you compartmentalize
things in your brain in

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.250
certain ways, put that off into
the end of the exam 1

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:29.470
part of your brain, and
now we're going to

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.010
move on to exam 2.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.220
Remember, for exam 2, you
still need to know and

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.290
understand everything you
learned in exam 1, but you can

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:41.400
put off learning it completely
until we get through, at

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.660
least, next Wednesday before we
start maybe spending time

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.580
on these concepts outside
of class.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.035
So, we're going to start with
talking about bonding, and any

00:27:51.035 --> 00:27:54.090
time we have a chemical bond,
basically what we're talking

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.860
about is having two atoms where
the arrangement of their

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.640
nuclei and they're electrons are
such that the bonded atoms

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.720
results in a lower energy than
for the separate atoms. So we

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.480
know we always want to have
our systems in as low an

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.450
energy as possible, so it makes
sense that a bond would

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.740
happen any time we got a lower
energy when we combine two

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:18.110
atoms, versus when we
keep them separate.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.290
So specifically, today
we're going to talk

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.020
about covalent bonds.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.560
A covalent bond is any time we
have a pair of electrons that

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.470
is shared between two different
atoms. And the key

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.900
word for covalent bonds is
the idea of being shared.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:37.130
The two electrons, for example,
we see in the h 2

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.830
molecule, they don't belong to
one or the other atom, they're

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.050
actually shared.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.040
And what we'll see later, is
that the sharing is not always

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.180
equal -- in the case
of h 2, it is

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.420
completely equal sharing.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.950
In some cases, because of things
like electronegativity,

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.970
one atom will take away more of
the electron density than

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.490
the other atom, but they're
still shared, even if they're

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.710
not always evenly shared.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.350
So, in talking about covalent
bonds, we should be able to

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.920
still apply a more general
definition of a chemical bond,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.270
which should tell us that the
h 2 molecule is going to be

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.990
lower in energy than if we
looked at 2 separate hydrogen

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.870
atom molecules.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.480
So, let's see if that's
actually the case.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.150
So if I tell you that the energy
for single hydrogen

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:22.540
atom is negative 13 12
kilojoules per mole.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.240
If we want to talk about two
hydrogen atoms, then we just

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.130
need to double that, so that's
going to be negative 2 6 2 4

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.230
kilojoules per mole that we're
talking about in terms of a

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.940
single hydrogen atom.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.310
So, let's compare this to the
energy of the h 2 molecule,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.630
and we find that that's
negative 3,048

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.380
kilojoules per mole.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.130
So, in fact, yes, we did confirm
that these covalent

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:48.610
bond, at least in the case of
hydrogen, we have confirmed by

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.510
the numbers that we are at a
lower energy state when we

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.660
talk about the bonded atom
versus the individual atom.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.460
And when we talk about covalent
bonds, there's 2

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.990
properties that we'll mostly
focus on, and that's going to

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.860
be thinking about the bond
strength or the energy by

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.450
which it stabilized
when it bonds.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.140
And we can also talk about the
bond length, so we might be

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.270
interested in what the bond
length is, what the distance

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.450
between these two nuclei are.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.910
And we can actually better
visualize this if we plot how

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.540
that energy changes
as a function of

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.180
internuclear distance.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.000
And when I say internuclear
distance, we actually call

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.670
this r here.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.020
It's kind of ironic that we put
this in the same lecture

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.320
as we talk about atomic radii,
which we also call r, but

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.260
they're two different r's,
so you need to keep them

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.760
separated in terms of what
you're talking about.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.400
When we're talking about r for
internuclear distance, we're

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.180
talking about the distance
between two different nuclei

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.900
in a bond, in a covalent bond.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.000
So, if we look at this graph
where what we're charting is

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.820
the internuclear distance, so
the distance between these two

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.700
hydrogen atoms, as a function
of energy, what we are going

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.810
to see is a curve that looks
like this -- this is the

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.430
general curve that you'll see
for any covalent bond, and

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.020
we'll explain where that
comes from in a minute.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.430
I want to point out that the
zero energy is defined as when

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:15.040
you have a naked proton where
the electron has popped out --

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.970
that's what we've defined as
zero energy up to this point

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.740
when we're talking about single
atoms. So, for starters

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.880
we'll keep that as our zero
energy, we're going to change

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.150
it soon to make something that
makes more sense in terms of

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.610
bonding, but we'll keep
that as zero for now.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:32.370
So, we see that the two h atoms
separate have a certain

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.650
energy that's lower than
when the electron's

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.040
not with the atom.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.650
And then even lower
down, we have our

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.120
bonded hydrogen molecule.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.940
So, we can think about the
different kinds of

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.620
interactions that are
taking place.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.820
I said what hold the bonds
together, what holds two atoms

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.510
together is the attractive force
we have between each

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.200
electron and the
other nucleus.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.840
That's the huge force that we're
talking about in terms

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.120
of making a bond stable, but
there are also repulsive

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.360
forces, so you can imagine
we're going to have

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.800
electron-electron repulsion
between the two electrons if

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.460
we're bringing them
closer together.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.370
And the real killer is if we get
too close we're even going

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.750
to have nuclear-nuclear
repulsion between the nuclei

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.320
of the two atoms.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.090
So, this makes this chart shown
in pink make a lot more

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.720
sense, because if we're way
out at very far distances,

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.310
essentially what we have here
is we're talking about two

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:28.270
separate atoms. They're not
interacting at all so that's

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.870
why the energy is the same as
that for two individual atoms,

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.430
that's what we're
dealing with.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.350
As we get closer together,
we start get lower

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.040
and lower in energy.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.550
The reason is because the
predominant force at this

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.400
point is going to be the
attraction that's being felt

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.930
between the nuclei and the
electrons in each of the

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:51.120
atoms. At some point you're
going to hit a well here,

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.140
which is the point where it's
most stabilized or at it's

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:56.520
lowest energy.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.790
So, when we think about a bond
length, this is going to be

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.470
the length of our bond here,
that makes sense because it's

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.320
going to want to be at
that distance that

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.140
minimizes the energy.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.010
But as we keep getting closer,
even though as we get closer,

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.390
the attraction is going to get
stronger between the two

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.990
nuclei and the electrons.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.610
We're also going to start to
have the repulsive forces

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.640
become more prominent here, and,
in fact, they take over

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.050
at some point, becoming the more
prevalent of the forces,

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.910
so as you get closer, the
electron-electron repulsions,

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:26.950
and eventually the
nucleus-nucleus repulsion is

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.070
going to mean that your energy
is just absolutely

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.550
skyrocketing, so it just keeps
going up and up as you get

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:36.300
closer to zero here.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.030
So, when we want to talk about
the information that we can

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.480
get out of looking at a chart
like this, well, the first

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.720
thing I did tell you was that
this is going to be the bond

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.890
length, so the distance r where
the energy is lowest,

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.720
but we can also talk about
something called dissociation

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.170
energy, that's going to be this
distance right here or

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.520
the energy that is this value.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.790
And the dissociation energy is
very intuitive in terms of

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.570
what it means, it means how much
energy you need to put

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.320
into the molecule in order to
disassociate it into its

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.650
individual atoms. And so we can
actually think about how

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.460
do we calculate what the
dissociation energy should be

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.270
for h 2, so let's go
ahead and do this.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.760
So, if we talk about
dissociating h 2, we're going

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:25.260
from the h 2 molecule, and
breaking this bond right in

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.540
half, so we now have
two individual

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.090
hydrogen atoms here.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:35.020
So we need to take the energy
for the two atoms, which we

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:39.070
know is -- so let's take our
dissociation energy is going

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:48.360
to be equal to negative 2 6 2 4
kilojoules per mole, and we

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:52.420
want to subtract the energy of
the hydrogen molecule itself,

00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:00.560
so that's going to be negative
3 0 4 8 kilojoules per mole.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.770
So, what we get for the
disassociation energy for a

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:11.880
hydrogen atom is 424 kilojoules
per mole.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.680
So what that means is that's how
much energy we would have

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.890
to put in to a hydrogen molecule
in order to get it to

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:25.110
split apart into
its two atoms.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:28.280
So, another way to talk about
dissociation energy is simply

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.150
to call it bond strength, it's
the same thing, they're equal

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.690
to each other.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:36.150
If we know that this is it the
dissociation energy for a

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.250
hydrogen atom, we can also say
the bond strength for hydrogen

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:43.090
molecule is 424.

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.520
So, there's actually another way
to graph it where we can

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.550
directly graph the dissociation
energy or the

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.620
bond strengths.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.000
So I said before when we were
talking about single atoms, we

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.770
always define the zero energy
as when an electron was

00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:00.120
actually ejected, but now, when
we talk about chemical

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.010
reactions taking place, it's
very, very rare that we're

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.940
actually going to be talking
about anything that gets to

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:06.660
this point here.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.990
It's much more relevant to set
our zero point energy as the

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:14.790
separation of a bond in terms of
talking about the reactions

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.850
that we'll usually be
dealing with here.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:20.300
So, let's change our graph where
we now have this zero

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.700
point set as the two individuals
hydrogen atoms,

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.780
and then we see that our h 2
molecule is at the negative of

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.640
the dissociation energy, or the
negative what that bond

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.600
strength is.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.630
So we know what that number
would be, it would be negative

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:37.710
424 kilojoules per mole
that we see here.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:41.380
So, what this let's us do now
is directly compare, for

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.420
example, the strength of a bond
in terms of a hydrogen

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.760
atom and hydrogen molecule,
compared to any kind of

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.350
molecule that we want to
graph on top of it.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.040
So, let's, for example,
look at nitrogen.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.020
So n 2, we can do the chart
here in green, so it's the

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.120
green dotted line, and what
we see is that we have now

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.000
defined this energy
as where the 2

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.870
nitrogen atoms are separated.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.710
So what we can actually directly
compare is the

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:12.230
dissociation energy or the
bond strength of nitrogen

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.350
versus hydrogen.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.960
So, if we think about this,
which would you say has a

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.930
stronger bond?

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.810
Is it going to be hydrogen
or nitrogen?

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.530
Yup, it's going to
be nitrogen.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.140
And the reason we can see that
by looking at this graph is

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.940
that we see that nitrogen when
it's bonded is in an even

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.200
lower well than we
saw for hydrogen.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.420
It's going to be a stronger
bond because it's more

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:38.130
stabilized when it when it comes
together as a molecule.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.020
We can also think about the
distance, the bond distance.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.350
So, which would you
say is going to be

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:44.350
shorter in this case?

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.980
Is a hydrogen bond shorter, or
is a nitrogen-nitrogen triple

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.310
bond going to be shorter?

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.790
Um-hmm, again, we can
get this information

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.370
directly from our graph.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:57.450
We see that the radius is
shorter, so that means that

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.460
the nitrogen-nitrogen bond
is going to be shorter.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.340
We can know this information
even if we just knew that the

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.880
bond was stronger, we wouldn't
need to look at a graph here,

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.890
because it turns out that if you
have a stronger bond, that

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.650
also means that you have a
shorter bond -- those ywo are

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:12.260
correlated.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.810
And something that we'll see
later on is that triple bonds,

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.880
for example, are going to be
stronger than a corresponding

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.130
double bond or a corresponding
single bond.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.720
So, if we talked about a
nitrogen-nitrogen single

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.550
versus double versus triple
bond, the triple bond will be

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.600
the shortest and it will
be the strongest.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.300
So, that's basically the idea
of how we are going to be

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.870
thinking about covalent bonds.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.420
It's also important, once we
start talking about molecules,

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.840
to have a way to represent them,
and also to be able to

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.410
look at a shorthand notation
for a certain molecule and

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.310
understand what the bond is.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.370
So, for example, down here I
wrote that it was n 2 and that

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.300
it was h 2, but when I re-wrote
the molecules up

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.490
here, you saw that it's an h
h single bond where it's a

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.630
nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:00.140
So any chemist should be able
to just look at n 2 and know

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.500
that it's a triple bond, but
that's not something that

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.950
we've learned how did to do
yet, so let's go ahead and

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.950
start a new topic that's going
to allow us to have some sort

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.150
of sense of what the valence
electron configuration, which

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.770
includes whether something's a
single or double or a triple

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:17.850
bond can be figured out for
any given molecule.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.320
So, to do this, what I'm going
to do is introduce the topic

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.510
of Lewis structures.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:24.290
We're going to really get into
this next class, but I just

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.250
want to introduce it to you to
give us a start, and many of

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.310
you have used Lewis structures
in high school, but we'll be

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.340
doing some much more challenging
Lewis structures,

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.140
I can assure you, in
this class here.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.160
So, a Lewis structure is
basically an organizing

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:46.740
property of bonding, of
molecules, which is the idea

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.890
that when we're thinking about
bonding, the key is to achieve

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:53.420
a full valence shell in each of
the individual atoms. So we

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.090
want to have in an h h bond, for
example, a full shell for

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.550
each of the hydrogen atoms.
And G.N. Lewis is the

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.050
scientist that is credited, and
who did, in fact, come up

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.690
with this idea for the way to
represent this, so the other

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.630
parts of this idea, another way
to phrase it is that the

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.300
electrons are going to be
distributed in such a way that

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.650
we have what are called full
octets for each of the atoms,

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:21.790
and basically that's the same
thing as saying we have a full

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.130
valence shell, and this is
something that Lewis was able

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.320
to recognize very, very early,
way before we had quantum

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.390
mechanics to describe what these
orbitals were, but it

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.630
makes sense a full valence shell
means for most atoms

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:38.820
that we have a full s orbital
plus a full p orbital, so

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.200
we're going to have a total of
four orbitals that are each

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.300
filled with eight electrons, so
that's why we see that we

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.570
need an octet here.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:52.320
And the idea is that when you do
these Lewis dot structures,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.180
we're representing electrons
with dots, which we'll see in

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.260
a minute, and each
dot is going to

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.600
represent a valence electron.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.080
So, hopefully, you remember
what we mean by valence

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.570
electrons versus
core electrons.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.340
Core electrons are all those
electrons held in really tight

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.640
with the nucleus in the inner
shells, whereas the valence

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.830
electrons are only those
electrons that are in the

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.720
outer-most shell, or at your
highest value of n of the

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.110
principal quantum number.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.740
So, Lewis structures are really
a model for a way to

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:26.220
think about what the valence
electron configuration is, and

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.130
as I said, it's not based on
quantum mechanics, it's

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:33.140
something that Lewis observed
far, far before quantum

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.860
mechanics were discovered.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.230
So he came up with the ideas
that led to the idea of Lewis

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.230
structures in the very
early 1900's.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.440
So you might ask well, why are
we using this model if it

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.000
clearly doesn't take into
account quantum mechanics?

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.420
And the reason that we use it
is that it is incredibly

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.580
accurate, and allows us to very,
very quickly predict and

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.810
to predict accurately, in most
cases, what the electron

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.760
configuration of molecules
are going to be.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.530
So this is really useful.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:02.730
We don't always want to go
and solve the Schrodinger

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:05.790
equation, and in fact, once we
start talking about molecules,

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.270
I can imagine none of you, as
much as you love math or

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.110
physics, want to be trying
to solve this Schrodinger

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.310
equation in that case either.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:15.260
So, what Lewis structures allow
us to do is over 90% of

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.180
the time be correct in terms
of figuring out what the

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.130
electron configuration is.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.150
And we won't just use
them in this class.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:25.760
If you actually go to any of the
chemistry labs at MIT, if

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.670
you go over to building 18 and
look in the organic labs where

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.670
they're synthesizing new
molecules or making up new

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.680
reactions, what you'll see if
you open anyone's notebook,

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.210
their lab notebook, assuming
they keep a nice lab notebook,

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.150
is that they will have Lewis
structures drawn in there that

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.280
explain the reactions that
they're going to be

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.680
doing for that day.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.900
And I mean this means way past
all the chemistry they've

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.160
taken, they're now graduate
students or they're now

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.900
professors, and they're still
writing out Lewis structures.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.420
Now they're writing a more
abbreviated form, which you'll

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.950
probably get to if you take
organic chemistry, but really

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.130
it's the exact same idea.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:05.220
And this goes all the
way back to 1902.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:09.240
In fact, Lewis was an American
scientist, so he was trained

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.340
in America, and he actually was
a professor here at MIT

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:18.660
from 1905 all the way to about
1911 or 1912, and these are

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:23.590
some notes from 1902, and you
can't see them very well, but

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.520
this was essentially an early
form of Lewis structures, and

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.640
this was called the
cubicle atom.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.030
So, basically what he's showing
in these cubes is that

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.510
there are eight spaces that
need to be filled up

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:35.960
to have a full cube.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.700
So in order to fill them, he
would have to have eight

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.350
electrons or an octet
around the cubes.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:45.460
So what we're seeing is this
is notes from 1902 -- he

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.750
actually didn't publish any of
this work or these ideas that

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:52.120
led to Lewis structures until
1916, but his early class

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.590
notes were used as evidence
about how long ago he actually

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.080
came up with the idea of it.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.690
So it's really neat to think
that your counterparts 100

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.230
years ago right here at MIT
could have been sitting in a

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.570
class where they had Lewis as
their lecturer, and he's

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.980
putting forth these ideas --
these are actually his lecture

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.160
notes, even though it wasn't
even published yet, and giving

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.680
this idea of Lewis structure,
which is exactly what we keep

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.720
using today in order to make
a lot of these predictions.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.910
So, let's see how some of this
works, and hopefully your

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.540
counterparts from 100 years
ago would also be able to

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.700
think about how this works, even
if they don't have the

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.410
quantum mechanics behind
the individual electron

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.500
configurations for atoms. So
I said that we want to be

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.280
talking about valence electrons
here, so that means

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.700
if we're talking about, for
example, the octet rule for an

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.350
f f molecule where we have two
fluorine atoms, we need to

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:45.610
write the valence electrons
as dots around them.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.220
So let's do a quick clicker
question, and you tell me how

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:52.100
many valence electrons
does fluorine have?

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.850
Remember, valence electrons
are different from core,

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.030
they're only the outer-most
electrons in

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:03.410
the outer-most shell.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:04.960
So, 10 seconds on this,
this should

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:17.510
be fast. OK, great.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.340
Good job on the clicker
questions today.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.840
So we have seven valence
electrons.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.570
So, let's go back to the notes,
and let's fill these

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.570
in, seven electrons.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.780
Another way you could have
known them was to look at

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.040
Lewis' notes here, where if look
at this box carefully you

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.510
see there are seven dots around
the cube, so there are

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:38.080
his seven valence electrons.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.660
So, we see is when we use the
octet rule to look at fluorine

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:45.000
molecule, we're combining two
fluorine atoms, and what we

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.380
end up with is an f f molecule
where they're sharing two

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.360
electrons, so making
that covalent bond.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.890
But that each individual
fluorine atom has eight

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.860
electrons, or full
octet around it.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.710
We can think about where those
electrons came from, so we got

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:03.610
seven from the blue electrons
here, seven as shown in green

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:07.470
here, but each individual
fluorine atom has eight, even

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.640
though two of those are being
shared between both of them.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.250
So, the octet rule is a general
rule that you'll for

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.700
all of the atoms. There are some
exceptions, which we'll

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.160
get to later, but the only a
big exception here is with

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.090
hydrogen, which has a special
stability that's associated

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:24.470
with two electrons.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:26.420
This should make a lot of sense,
because we know that a

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:32.940
hydrogen has 1 s as it's
outer-most or valence orbital,

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.690
so it can be filled up just
with two 1 s electrons.

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:40.320
And we give different names,
depending on what kind of

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.280
electrons we're dealing with,
so, for example, with h c l

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.760
here, we can talk about
having bonded

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.060
versus lone pair electrons.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.990
So, in terms of the c l atom,
we need to talk about each

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:52.470
atom individually.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:47:01.030
How many bonding electrons
does c l have?

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.540
All right.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:05.000
Let's see, we've got a mixed
response here, it turns out it

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.540
has two bonding electrons.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.290
I heard some people say one,
and that's a good guess,

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.300
remember they're actually
sharing.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.630
So these two electrons, they
belong to chlorine, they also

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.250
belong to hydrogen, but they
do, in fact, belong to

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:17.920
chlorine as well.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.750
There's no one person owning
them, so they both have two

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:22.480
electrons here that
are bonding.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:26.510
So how many lone pair electrons
do we have?

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.850
OK.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:29.810
I hear six and three, so both
are sort of right, we have 6

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.400
lone pair electrons,
which means that we

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:35.180
have three lone pairs.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.560
So, in terms of thinking about
how to draw a Lewis structure,

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.740
I won't go through this today
or any day in terms of just

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.230
reading through the rules, you
can read that yourself.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:47.760
But what we'll do is go through
each of these rules in

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.900
terms of an example.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.060
So, what will start with on
Monday is doing the most

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.670
simple example of methane
using these

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:56.130
Lewis structure rules.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.400
So, don't forget to study this
weekend and get those extra

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.840
practice problems from
the course website.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.270
Let's consider the
motion of an object that

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.460
is under the action of a force.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.150
So we have some force that's
acting on this object.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.550
And we have a little
displacement ds.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.640
So this is a small
displacement of the object.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.260
Then we know that
the small amount

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.360
of work done by the action
of this force is F.ds.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.080
And the rate of doing work,
so let's now introduce

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.380
the concept of power, which
is the rate of doing work.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.670
That is, F.ds over dt.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.660
And ds dt is just the
velocity of the object.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.580
So we see very
simply that when we

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.180
talk about power, and sometimes
people use the symbol p,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.200
although we can also talk
about pressure and momentum,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.530
so it's a little bit tricky.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.120
But here, the power
is F.v. And power

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.450
is a concept that will appear
in many different settings.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.350
ROBERT FIELD: So in
the previous lecture,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.430
I told you about
many electron atoms.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.870
And in order to describe
their structure,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.930
we have to build a
Slater determinant,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.410
because that builds
in the antisymmetry

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.910
between all pairs of orbitals.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.480
Now, Slater determinants
are expanded

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.980
into a very large number
of additive terms.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.340
And there are algebraic
methods, which

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.740
I describe in a
supplement, which

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.450
enable you to reduce these
algebraic terms, the sum

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.490
over an enormous
number of terms,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.720
to something almost identical
to what you would get

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.790
if you didn't antisymmetrize.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.160
They're just a few extra things.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.940
And so once you know the
mechanics, it's not a big deal.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.830
It's a little bit more
work than just calculating

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.840
the individual orbital
matrix elements,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.780
but it's nothing special.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.630
And Henry has produced
a beautiful thing,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.080
a beautiful handout on
Slater-Condon parameters,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.050
which is what you get when
you evaluate these Slater

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.090
determinal matrix elements.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.510
And they are the things
that you use to describe

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.340
electronic structure.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.570
So electronic structure
is a really complicated

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.470
many electron descriptive thing.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.300
But if you can reduce for
every atom to a small number

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.230
of parameters, most of which
you understand intuitively

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.460
how they depend on
properties of the atom,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.230
like the ionization energy
of the individual orbitals,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.220
you can say, yes, I understand
all of the periodic table.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.060
That's where it comes from.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.880
The rules enable you to
identify the lowest lying states

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.310
and to calculate
their properties

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.140
and to be able to
intuit their properties

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.644
and to be aware of when
something unexpected happens,

00:02:37.644 --> 00:02:39.060
which is what we're
always looking

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.590
for as physical chemists.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.510
We're always looking for
a simple minded picture

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.940
that breaks.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.460
Because then we can go
deeper into our understanding

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.600
of all the pieces.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.900
But we're always parameterizing.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.170
OK.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.630
So there's a lot of subtleties
that I didn't have time

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.950
to talk about in the evaluation
of these Slater determinal

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.900
matrix elements.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.240
And since whatever
problems I give

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.420
you connected with Slater
determinal matrix elements

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.690
or Slater determinants are
going to be really simple.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.660
They're probably going
to be 2 by 2 or 3 by 3.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.270
You don't really need
to know and understand

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.370
all the rules and
all the shortcuts.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.110
But you've got the
basic mechanism.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.190
So a Hamiltonian
doesn't depend on spins.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.880
But because of antisymmetry,
the spatial part

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.190
of the wave function does depend
on which spin state you've got.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.670
And so the Hamiltonian
knows about spins

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.020
in a peculiar, indirect
way, which is beautiful.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.260
You've got to admire how
clever this Hamiltonian is

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.450
to be able to capture
these spin effects.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.950
And of course, you have
to capture them too.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.740
All right.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.320
So today we're finally
getting to molecules.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:18.860
And the simplest molecule
is the homonuclear molecule.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.740
Two hydrogens with one electron.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.570
That's the simplest problem.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.280
And because it is
representative of all

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.650
of the qualitative
effects and most

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.040
of the quantitative
calculations you do,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.200
it's a really
great introduction,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.660
because it captures most
of the important stuff

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.740
that molecules or
small molecules

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.960
do, that the electronic
structure of small molecule.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.310
So the key to being able to
describe small molecules using

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.900
this LCAO, Linear Combination
of Atomic Orbitals method,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.180
is the variational method.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.280
And this variational
method says,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.070
we're going to throw a whole
bunch of basis functions

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.270
at the problem.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.150
A whole bunch of orbitals, which
we choose because we like them

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.870
or because the
computer likes them.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.100
And we find that the
linear combination

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.670
of coefficients
of these orbitals

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.120
that minimizes the energy.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.410
And you can do this in wave
mechanics or matrix mechanics.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.110
It's more elegant
in matrix mechanics,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.270
and you should be comfortable
going from one to the other.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.760
Now, I'm only going to be
talking about a 2 by 2 problem.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.820
So you can go easily
from one to the other

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.740
without even taking a breath.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.730
But anyway, OK.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.570
In approaching
this, you're going

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.160
to see what's called the
general eigenvalue problem where

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.610
instead of diagonalizing
a simple matrix,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.540
you have to deal with
the Hamiltonian matrix

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.750
and an overlap
matrix, which makes

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.650
the solution of the
secular equation,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.600
finding the eigenvalues and
eigenstates a little bit more

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.020
complicated.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.650
So you're going to see
it first appear here.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.100
And it can be solved
by a simple matrix

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.430
equation, which is in a
supplement to a later set

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.670
of lecture notes.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.480
But this is the thing that
consumes the vast majority

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.140
of computer time in
maybe in the world,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.330
but certainly among chemists.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.820
So the crucial thing, and
I wrote it all in caps,

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:56.830
in dealing with this
complicated many body problem,

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.050
we make a crucial assumption.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.760
And that's called the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.120
It's based on the fact that
electrons move really fast

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.930
and nuclei move really
slowly relative to electrons.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.620
And so what we do is
we solve the problem

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.640
with the nuclei clamped.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.430
Because that's a
good approximation.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.870
And then after we solve
the electronic problem,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.950
we have what we call a
potential energy surface, which

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.070
is the electronic energy as a
function of nuclear coordinate.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.260
And it's parametric.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.620
But then once we have the
potential energy surface,

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.530
we can calculate the
rotation and vibration.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.050
So basically, what
we're doing in making

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.120
the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation is

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.630
we're setting up to treat
vibration and rotation

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.220
by perturbation theory.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.950
Now, you never see it
mentioned in that way,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.410
but that is, in fact,
what we're doing.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.270
And the reason we
can get away with it

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.915
is the difference in velocity
of electrons versus nuclei.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.050
But it's a fundamental
philosophical point of view

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.690
that we take about
molecular structure

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.400
that we can clamp the nuclei,
get most of the insight,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.120
and then allow the nuclei
to move and the electrons

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.460
with them and calculate
everything else.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.110
So this is central to
chemistry, the Born-Oppenheimer

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.950
approximation.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.335
Without that, we would
have a bag of atoms.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.650
And that would be a
very bad starting point,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.409
because we believe in bonds.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.730
And a bag of atoms is
saying, well, yeah,

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.900
we could be statistical.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.710
We could say every atom is
capable of being anywhere

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.470
and they don't interact
in any rational way,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.040
and we would have no insight.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.210
So this is where most of
the ideas that you learn

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.880
to use as physical chemists and
probably any kind of chemist

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.670
comes from the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.005
And it's widely misunderstood
and misrepresented.

00:09:11.005 --> 00:09:13.250
But we won't go into that.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:21.040
OK, we're going to derive two
orbitals for hydrogen. H2 plus.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.570
The sigma bonding orbital
and the sigma star

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.030
anti-bonding orbital.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.770
This is enough to
basically understand

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.070
how you get bonding and
anti-bonding in any molecule.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.930
And I like to say
that we understand

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.840
bonding in a very simple way.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.850
If you have wave functions
for two adjacent atoms

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:57.040
and they overlap in the
region between the two nuclei,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.460
you get constructive
interference,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.810
you get twice as much
amplitude in the region

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:09.570
where the electrons interact
with both nuclei, which means

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.860
four times the probability.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.730
So a little bit of overlap
leads to a big energy

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.990
effect because of this
constructive interference.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.340
And that's really,
really important.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.190
And all sorts of
hand waving arguments

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.370
about what makes a chemical
bond have a lot of currency,

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.640
even here at MIT, but
that's what a bond is.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.416
It's constructive interference.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.580
All right, so let's get started.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.350
And the lecture notes are
extremely long and extremely

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.730
beautiful and clear.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.800
They're written by Troy.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.340
I have reduced them
to a minimal picture,

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:02.090
but I don't want to
detract from them.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.270
The insight is very rich.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.030
OK, so what we
have to do first is

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.430
to look at a coordinate system.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.880
So we have one hydrogen nucleus.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.180
Another one.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.900
There's a center of mass.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:30.590
And so we say we have RA, this
vector from the center mass

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:35.630
to this RB like that.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.350
And up here is the electron.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:47.520
And it's at position R.
This is at position RB.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.410
Position RA.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:12:00.310
Now, the center of mass
can be anywhere in space,

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.930
and we don't really care.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.290
So we tend to not talk about
where the center of mass is.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.200
But there is another set
of coordinates for it.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.800
OK.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.420
And now we have this,
which is called R sub A.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.490
And it's a vector.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:23.000
And this is R sub B. So
we have uppercase symbols

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.520
for nuclear positions and
lowercase for electrons,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.340
except they're between
electrons and nuclei.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.250
OK.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.580
And once we have
this picture, we

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.570
can write what the Hamiltonian
is, because we're basically

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.990
looking at the interactions
between these three particles.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.520
And so we have kinetic energy
and we have potential energy.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:54.350
And the Hamiltonian-- excuse me.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:13:04.810
--in atomic units
is this del squared,

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:10.140
which is the second derivatives
with respect to whatever we

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.270
have here, which is little r.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.590
And we have 1/2.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.940
It's 1/2 because of atomic
units and because the mass

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.980
of the electron
is treated as one.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:30.340
And then we have a similar sort
of term for del for nucleus A.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.500
And we have a two, because
1/2 in atomic units.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:39.067
But we have the mass of
A. Now, the minus signs,

00:13:39.067 --> 00:13:40.400
why do we have minus signs here?

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.450
You know this.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.520
AUDIENCE: This is
the Schrodinger.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.130
ROBERT FIELD: Yeah, right.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.920
Or we say it's p
squared over 2m.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.850
And p is-- right.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.640
OK, but what we're trying
to understand stuff,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640
this is negative.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.860
That means it sort of
leads to a stabilization.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:12.881
And many people talk about
bonding in terms of velocity

00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:16.100
or momentum, but I don't.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.860
And then we have
del squared B over 2

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.190
and B and then a repulsion term.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.240
A whole bunch of
terms that we have.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.860
So these are the
kinetic energy terms.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.960
And then we have the
potential energy terms.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:48.920
1 over RA vector minus little
r vector minus 1 over RB

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.800
minus little r.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:57.000
And then the repulsion
between RA minus RB.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.110
OK, that's it.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.330
Now, that's a lot of stuff.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.780
And we'd like to make
a lot of it go away.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.910
But again, we have potential.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.240
We have kinetic energy and
we have potential energy.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.200
So as I've written
it, the Hamiltonian,

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.200
which is our big
problem, is a function

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:33.920
of ra rb r big RA big RB.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.860
That's just ridiculous.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.770
We don't want to look
at a function of all

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.210
these variables.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.070
We would like to be
able to simplify it

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.900
so that we can draw pictures
on a two dimensional surface

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.060
or just to reduce it now.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:02.220
We like to think in terms
of orders of magnitude.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.320
And so it is a very
simple matter to say,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.690
well, let's simplify
this Hamiltonian

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.120
by clamping the nuclei.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.530
They don't move.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.950
If they don't move, then the
big Rs are no longer operators.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.060
They're just parameters.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:28.820
And the contributions
to the kinetic energy

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.360
of the heavy particles gone.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.240
So there's no rotation
and no vibration.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.360
Now, it doesn't go away.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.830
We have to come back with it.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.220
But we come back
with it when we have

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.330
a good representation of
the electronic structure

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.340
for the nuclei clamped.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.540
And if we can do it for one
internuclear separation,

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.550
we can do it for all
internuclear separations.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:59.150
And so if you have a
grid of say 1,000 points,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.250
you do the same calculation
1,000 times, except you don't.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.970
Because you know how
to extrapolate from one

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.200
point to another.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.510
But basically, you are
thinking about this

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.500
as the problem of finding
the electronic wave

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.220
function at a grid of points.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.849
And so that turns all of the
big R's into parameters, not

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:32.110
operators, and simplifies
the problem enormously.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:37.010
And so the reduced
Hamiltonian becomes--

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.270
we'll call it the
electronic Hamiltonian.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:44.280
R semicolon ra rb.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.860
So r is the variable, and
these are just parameters

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.680
that we sometimes include.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:58.560
And then the Hamiltonian is
just del squared little r over 2

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.480
plus V effective.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:10.230
And this would be as a
function of RA and RB.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.750
But it's because
of R approximation,

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.850
it's just a function
of R. So these we pick.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.130
And this is the thing
that we're worrying about.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:25.970
And then there's the
1 over RA minus RB,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.170
which is just a constant.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.420
This is the repulsion between
two charged particles.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.150
So this is a lot nicer.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.520
We can also sort of
forget about this.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.800
I mean, it's there, but
it's a trivial thing

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.000
that we can add in.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.940
So we have basically the
kind of problem we like.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.050
A kinetic energy problem and
a potential energy problem.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.964
So we're going to
take this approach

00:18:52.964 --> 00:18:54.630
and we're going to
learn how to apply it

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.340
to the simplest system.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.010
And the simplest
system is homonuclear.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.710
That's better than
heteronuclear,

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.370
because if we had
two different atoms,

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.500
we'd have to somehow represent
their difference in properties.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.050
But because it's homonuclear,
we just basically

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:22.150
have an atom, the
same atom, repeated,

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.820
and there's a lot of
symmetry that results.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.596
And the other is
only two electrons.

00:19:29.596 --> 00:19:30.970
I mean, sorry,
only one electron.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.620
Remember, we did hydrogen
first, and that was wonderful.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.100
We got everything that was--

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.970
basically everything is
related to anything else.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.120
Any property is related to any
other property of the hydrogen

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.280
atom through this
orbital approximation.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.920
And so one electron makes
us feel really comfortable,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.570
because we are going
to expect that there

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.590
is some structure, which
means not just a random number

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.950
or random collection of
descriptive observations

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.230
but some relationships.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.600
And we don't have to
even antisymmetrize.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.510
So it's really something
we can hit out of a park

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.340
without getting too stressed.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.030
But there is a
problem, and that is,

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:29.970
how do we find the
wave functions if we

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.710
take a simple basis set?

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:39.480
1s a plus 1s b.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.330
So these are hydrogenic
wave functions.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.570
We know them.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.057
Now, they may not be the
most convenient thing

00:20:48.057 --> 00:20:49.890
when you're doing a
large scale calculation.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.590
In fact, nobody uses
hydrogenic functions,

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.140
even though they
make a lot of sense,

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.790
because they're not
computationally as

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.440
easy as Gaussian functions.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:09.080
So if you need to describe
a problem with, say, 10

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:15.290
hydrogenic functions
and 1,000 Gaussians,

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.730
you're way ahead of the game
when you use 1,000 Gaussians,

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.660
because the integrals
are trivial.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.790
But in terms of
understanding, it's

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:27.050
really nice to take things
we know and do everything

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.880
in terms of them.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.140
OK.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.436
And so this is where
we get the variational.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.020
So what we do is
we say we're going

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.250
to express the wave function
as a linear combination

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.800
of atomic orbitals.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.280
And that means we can
adjust the coefficient

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.510
of each atomic orbital
to minimize the energy.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.370
And the variational principle
or the variational theorem

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:06.050
says, no matter what
you do, you can't

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.900
calculate an energy
lower than the lowest

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.290
energy of the system.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.290
Even if you don't
know what it is,

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.510
you know that
anything you calculate

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.110
is a little bit higher.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.690
And what you want
to do, then, is

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:25.460
to make the energy as small
as possible by doing a min max

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.010
problem on the coefficients.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.190
And so the variational
method is basically that.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.220
OK.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.545
So basis set.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.590
I'm probably not going to finish
my notes, even though these

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:54.386
are a massively reduced version
of what Troy had written,

00:22:54.386 --> 00:22:56.010
because I have some
other things to say

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.930
that aren't in the notes,
and they're really important.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.000
When we do perturbation
theory, we implicitly

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.170
are dealing with an infinite
basis set and an infinite set

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.820
of known matrix elements.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:21.440
But we can't ask a computer to
diagonalize an infinite matrix.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.220
So we have a tricky
way of doing this

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.850
so that we can use
perturbation theory

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:33.750
to get a good approximation
of almost anything you want.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.940
But if your basis set
is really terrible,

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.500
then the perturbation theory
is going to be terrible too.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.340
I mean, it's going to
give correct answers.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.810
You're just going to have
to do more calculations.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.590
The variational
method says, OK, let's

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.720
choose not an infinite basis
set but a physically appropriate

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.340
basis set or a computationally
minimal basis set.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:03.280
And so we are making
decisions about form and size.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.450
So we can use
hydrogenic orbitals,

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.770
because we know what they are.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.560
We know how to evaluate
lots of integrals with them

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.890
without too much trouble.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.700
And how many?

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.260
Well, we've got two atoms.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:27.000
And so you sort of need
one orbital on one atom

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.880
and one orbital on
another to even begin

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.430
to capture the molecularness
of the problem.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:38.550
So we've chosen the simplest
possible form but not

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.290
necessarily the most
convenient form.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.950
And the size is two.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.250
Now, we could use four.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.840
We could use 100.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.000
And you could use a million.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.330
Most quantum chemical
calculations,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.310
which you're going
to be doing soon,

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:01.720
involve not just
millions but often

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.240
billions of basis functions.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.710
And the computer
does all the work

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.720
and doesn't complain to you.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.260
It doesn't require a trip to
the beach or anything like that.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.230
It just says, OK, here is
what you wanted me to do.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.770
I don't know whether you--
it's a stupid question

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:23.770
or a smart question, but I'm
answering not what you thought

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.640
you asked but what you did ask.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.390
OK.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.990
But we're going to show how
it works with the simplest

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.420
possible basis set.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.350
So our electronic
wave function will

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:43.190
be a function of
electron position

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.650
and parametrically
nuclear position.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:56.290
C1, 1S A R R. I'm
going to stop including

00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:02.310
this parametrically dependent on
R. But eventually I'll do that.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.010
But for now.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.120
OK, so that's the wave function.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.820
The variational function.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.910
And we need to be able to
calculate the average energy,

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.710
because we know the average
energy is going to be larger

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.850
than the true energy.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.530
But if we do a good
calculation, the energy

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.530
difference between the
truth and what you get

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.970
is small as possible.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.660
And so you can say for a
particular basis that we have,

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.690
the best possible energies,
if you want to do better,

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.570
you have to use a bigger
or smarter basis set.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.180
And so how do we calculate
the average energy?

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.600
Well, we do the
usual thing where

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:59.280
you say psi H psi d tau
over psi star psi d tau.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.670
Now, I'm including
this because we need it

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.470
when we don't have
orthonormal basis functions.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:11.730
And for this basis set,
they're not orthonormal.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.930
They can't be.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:20.070
The wave functions for one atom
are all mutually orthogonal.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.080
But because you have
two atoms and there's

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.560
overlap between them,
they are not orthogonal,

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.200
and they're not normalized.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.270
And so we have to do this.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:43.240
And so the problem is
we want to minimize

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:55.960
the energy with respect to C1
or C2 or C1 star or C2 star.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.870
Now, this is a subtle point.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:08.840
The complex conjugate of C
is linearly independent of C.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.650
But they're related
to each other.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:18.240
And so you can say that
these derivatives are 0,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.640
and you can choose C1 and
C2 or C1 star and C2 star,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.880
and you get the same
result. And so it's

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.940
important to understand this.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.430
So this is all by
means of introduction.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.167
I'm going to start
repeating myself.

00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:37.375
But let's draw some pictures.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:50.270
So the complicated
thing is the potential.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.610
And so to illustrate
the R dependence,

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.900
I'm going to try to draw things.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.990
So we have r small and R large.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.390
This is the positions
of the nuclei.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.525
And the potential
will look like this.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.370
So the potential goes
to minus infinity

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.790
at the position of the
nucleus, because the electron

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.830
is attracted to the nucleus.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.420
And when the distance
is 0, we have an--

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.410
it's a forgivable
infinity because it--

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.730
anyway.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:44.600
So what I should really have
done is exaggerated here.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.210
So when the particles
are close together,

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:52.340
the potential in the
region between the nuclei

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.430
doesn't go as close to 0
as it does when we do this.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.820
And so that's an important fact.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:10.640
So as the particles
are brought together,

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.450
something happens in
this intermediate region.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.750
And when they're
completely separated,

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.520
it's as if they are
completely separated.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.936
They're not talking
to each other.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.360
And the wave functions
look like this.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.012
I missed.

00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:47.470
And this is what
I was telling you.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.326
This is a bond.

00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:49.450
This is why we have a bond.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.920
Because we have
constructive interference

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.890
in the spatial region
where the electron can

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.020
be attracted to both nuclei.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:05.240
Whereas here, there is no
amplitude in between them

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.060
or negligible
amplitude, and so there

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.030
isn't much of a contribution
from the attraction

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.780
to both nuclei.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.920
And so this is the separated
atom or approaching separated

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.920
atom limit.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.530
And this is the molecular limit.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.970
And now it's
possible that you can

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:24.610
squeeze the atoms
too close together

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.640
and bad things start to happen.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.710
Because then what
you're doing is you're

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.260
putting two electrons into
the same spin orbital.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.030
And we know that that's
overlap repulsion

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.490
or it violates the
exclusion principle

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.520
and there is an energy
penalty that you

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.190
pay in order to get too close.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.840
But basically, this is what
we're going to be explaining.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.220
And we're going to recover
this from a real calculation.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.370
OK.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:07.940
So again, we want to
minimize the average energy.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.810
And the average energy,
as I've written somewhere,

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:25.240
is given by psi star H psi
d tau psi star psi d tau.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.510
And if we are
writing these things

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:34.440
as C1 1S A times
C2 1S B, then we

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.600
end up getting stuff that we
know how to calculate now.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:33:03.320
1S A. This orbital is
not orthogonal to 1S B.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.100
It can't be.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.180
And so this is
something that we had

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.510
been able to avoid in all of
our one dimensional problems.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:17.250
We could always think about
a orthonormalized basis set.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.870
But the effect that we're
really interested in

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:25.320
is based on the fact that
these guys aren't orthogonal.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:31.650
You can't just say we're going
to write an orthonormal basis

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:32.490
set.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.170
It's not possible.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:38.250
If you want to construct
an orthonormal basis set,

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.010
there is a transformation
you can do.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.770
And it's a simple
transformation,

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.820
and it's done all the time.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.280
And you'll see
it, but not today.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.230
But you still do
the calculations

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:56.610
on the non-orthogonal
basis functions.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.850
And then you do a transformation
that takes into account

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:03.150
the lack of orthonormality.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.310
For now just accept it.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:10.380
And so we're going to have
to worry about an integral

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.864
like this one.

00:34:11.864 --> 00:34:15.310
SA 1 SB.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.340
And we call this the
overlap integral.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.280
And this is something that
we have to not ignore.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:40.010
So now we can approach this
problem using wave function

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.239
notation.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:45.170
And it's most familiar.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.580
But we can also use these
things saying, OK, this

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.320
is the complete set of the
variational coefficients.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.770
And this is a step towards
the matrix picture.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:07.410
Because it's basically a linear
array of mixing coefficients.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:11.240
And you could think
of that as a vector.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.210
And in fact, that's how
you do the vector picture,

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.880
but we'll use sort of a hybrid
notation for the time being.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:28.970
But we can also say,
OK, this means C1 C2 Cn.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:38.420
And this means C1 star Cn star.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.380
And here we are in
the matrix picture.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.100
OK, but I will use sort
of a hybrid picture

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.470
until you're ready to
take the complete jump.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:53.050
And so the average
energy expressed

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.900
as a function of this
set of coefficients

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.740
is going to be integral.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:26.180
Psi C star H psi C d tau
over integral psi C star psi.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.830
The reason I'm
being hesitant here

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.400
is because I work in
the matrix picture,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.720
and this hybrid picture is
away from both comfort zones.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.850
But it is leading you
towards what you need to see,

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.910
and so we're going to do it.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:47.520
OK.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.400
So in the wave function
picture, this thing

00:36:50.400 --> 00:37:02.635
becomes just C1
1S A plus C2 1S B,

00:37:02.635 --> 00:37:15.250
the whole thing conjugated,
H C1 1S A C2 psi 1S B d tau.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.780
And the same sort of thing down
here, except no Hamiltonian.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.140
And so we can now
slavishly write down

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.190
all of the terms
that result. And what

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:40.100
we get is from the
Hamiltonian matrix element.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:52.900
So for H, we get C1 star
C1 H11 plus C1 star C2

00:37:52.900 --> 00:38:09.130
H1 H12 plus C2 star C1
H21 plus C2 star C2 H22.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.470
OK, we think we know some stuff.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.590
We think this is going to be
the energy of the hydrogen atom.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.140
But it isn't.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:23.990
Because the orbital
one sees both nuclei.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.150
And so this is something
which we just call this guy.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.100
We're calling this epsilon.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.635
And that is a function
of internuclear distance.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.275
But this guy is the same,
because it's homonuclear.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.200
And this, well, we
can call it V12 or V.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.570
And these two guys
are the same thing.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:39:02.900
So we've reduced the problem
to a simple equation.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:07.260
But I'm not going to
go all the way there.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.330
But you know how to do this.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.390
You know how to do
the overlap integral.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.610
You're gonna have a
similar sort of thing.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:19.950
S11 is the overlap of the
orbital 1 with itself.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.330
And that one is 1.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.460
But S12 is S.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:37.240
So anyway, what we end up
doing is a lot of algebra.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:41.250
And what we end up getting
when we impose the condition

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:47.350
that the partial of everything
with respect to C1 star

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:50.230
is equal to 0, we
get an equation

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.820
for the average energy.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.170
And the average energy is--

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.530
oh, I'm sorry.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:58.590
C1.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.390
When we take the derivative
with respect to C1, what we get

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:04.040
is this equation.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:21.793
C1 star H11 plus C2 star H22
over C1 star S11 plus C2 star

00:40:21.793 --> 00:40:22.293
S21.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.380
And so we could also
do the same thing,

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:33.150
taking the partial
derivative with respect to C2

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.144
and setting that equal to 0.

00:40:35.144 --> 00:40:36.310
But we get another equation.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:52.350
And so that other equation
would be E average is equal to--

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.010
no, I'm not even
going to write it,

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.593
because I didn't
write it in my notes,

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:06.860
and I'm operating on batteries.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.390
You can write that.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:11.900
And so we have two equations
for the average energy.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.580
And well, that's kind of good,
because we have two unknowns.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.940
So we're going to be
able to solve for them.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.130
OK.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:31.480
Now, we could also approach this
problem using matrix methods.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.910
And since that's the
way computers think

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.600
about the problem and that's
the way most people think

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.900
about the problem, you really
want to understand the matrix

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.890
picture.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:45.040
And at risk of
repeating myself, we

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:53.750
know for this two level problem,
we have H11 H12 H21 H22.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:42:01.840
And we know that the S
matrix S11 S12 S21 S22.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:10.180
So we have an equation
C1 star C2 star

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:26.620
times the H matrix is equal to
E average times the C1 star C2

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:31.420
star times the S matrix.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.860
So this is the H matrix
and this is the S matrix.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.410
And you can write this down.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:43.650
And when you take the
derivatives with respect to C,

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:57.670
you get C dagger H is equal
to E average times C dagger S.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:01.780
Now, if instead of taking
derivatives with respect

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.780
to the Cs we took the
derivatives with respect

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:10.130
to the C stars, we'd get
a different equation.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:22.870
And that equation would be HC is
equal to E average times S then

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:26.970
C. This guy looks familiar.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.610
It looks like Hamiltonian
times something

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:38.444
is equal to the energy times--

00:43:38.444 --> 00:43:40.040
uh oh.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.730
We have something else here.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.042
It's not just the energy.

00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:46.250
We have the overlap integral.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:54.050
So these two things are examples
of the general eigenvalue

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.210
equation.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:01.060
And so in almost
all calculations,

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:07.480
the fact that S is present
leads to problems of algebra.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:18.810
But in this particular problem,
we know S12 is equal to S21.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:26.330
And this epsilon
parameter can be--

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:32.060
so we have H11 is equal to H22.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:35.490
They're both parametrically
dependent on internuclear

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:39.950
distance, and they're
equal to epsilon of R.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.760
So what we end up with
is an equation that

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.865
looks really familiar.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.450
We have a 2 by 2 matrix,
which we can diagonalize.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.060
We can find the energies.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.420
And so what you end up
getting when you do that.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:03.470
And I want to spare
you my attempting

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.226
to do a derivation in real time.

00:45:06.226 --> 00:45:07.600
You can look at
the notes and you

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.950
can see that the results
are what you care about

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.910
and what we're
going to interpret.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:14.870
So here we go.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.760
So what you find.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.740
The average energy for one
of the orbitals that we get.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.000
Remember, we got a 2 by 2.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.740
We're going to have two
eigenvalues and eigenstates.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:41.880
And so for one of those, we
get epsilon plus V12 1 plus S1.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.430
So these are symbols
that we've seen.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:53.430
And this tells us
now this, this,

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:56.350
and this are functions
of R. So we're

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.960
going to have an energy for
the sigma orbital, which

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.150
is a function of R.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:07.120
And we have another solution,
which we're calling sigma star.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:19.650
And that one is epsilon
minus V12 over 1 minus S12.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:24.840
So we'd like to be able
to know which of these is

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.210
the absolute-- one of these is--

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:38.850
so we have sigma and sigma star.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:46.100
Both as a function
of R. And so if we

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.430
draw a molecular orbital diagram
and we say, OK, well here we

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:59.770
have the energy of 1SA, which
is epsilon as a function of R.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:09.650
And this is epsilon energy 1SB,
which is equal to epsilon of R.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:13.310
Normally we choose R
as equal to infinity

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:15.770
for the separated atom.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.410
So these are actually
just the energies

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.810
of the individual orbitals.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.320
And what we end up getting is
a molecular orbital diagram

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:30.790
which, in an exaggerated
form, is like this.

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:33.130
We get bonding,
because it's more

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.140
stable than the separate
atoms, and anti-bonding,

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.630
which is less stable.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.600
And so one question
we'd like to ask is,

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.630
well, one question
is why is it bonding?

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:44.680
Why is this more stable?

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.710
And the answer is
constructive interference

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:51.070
in the important energy region.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.980
But another question
is, is this bigger?

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:59.480
Is this a larger destabilization
than this stabilization?

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.500
And it's kind of hard
to scope that out,

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:07.790
because here we have two
parameters, which are added,

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:09.820
and here we have a
difference of two parameters.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.620
And here we have a
denominator, which

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:19.210
is going to be larger
for the sigma orbital

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.580
than the sigma star.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:26.160
And so we don't know whether
the plus versus minus V

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.030
is dominant.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.310
But the energy
denominator is saying,

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.330
yeah, this one, the
anti-bonding orbital

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.300
is more anti-bonding
than the bonding one.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.520
Now, you can actually
do some algebra

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.700
to calculate what is
the difference in energy

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:49.380
between the sigma star
as a function of R.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:54.250
But evaluated at R sub
E, which is the minimum--

00:48:54.250 --> 00:49:00.000
the energy where the bonding
orbital has its minimum energy.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.830
Then if you evaluate at
that particular value of R

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:13.960
and you make that comparison
B 1S evaluated at R sub B,

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:25.360
and you get epsilon
times S12 minus--

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.300
so I'm doing sigma
star, so that's

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:44.120
this one minus B12 over
1 plus 1 minus S12.

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:48.590
And for the sigma orbital,
I have a similar equation,

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:59.830
but I get epsilon S12
minus B12 over 1 minus S12.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:03.520
So we have the same
numerator for these two cases

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.330
but a different denominator.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.990
And so this is saying this
simple variational calculation

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:13.110
says you're going to get a
pair of orbitals, one bonding,

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.650
one anti-bonding.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:17.460
And the anti-bonding
one is more destabilized

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.540
relative to the
separate atoms then

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.050
the bonding one is stabilized.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:25.930
And this is a kind of
general expectation

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.370
that the anti-bonding
orbitals are

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:31.090
more destabilized
than the bonding ones.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:33.970
But it's not a proof,
because its just a proof

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:36.490
for the simplest possible case.

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:38.570
So I'm done.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:43.000
And in the next
lecture, we're going

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.840
to use molecular orbital
diagrams like this

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.405
to describe a
series of examples.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:51:01.241
Homonuclear diatomic molecules,
heteronuclear AH, and AB.

00:51:01.241 --> 00:51:04.300
H is special, and
this is more general.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.120
And what we'd like
to be able to do

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.180
is without a great
deal of thought

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.590
construct the molecular
orbital diagram

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:14.995
for basically any diatomic
molecule using some insight.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:23.190
Now, this also transfers
to polyatomic molecules.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:25.020
And it's especially
beautiful the way

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.130
it transfers, because
electronic structure is usually

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.850
centered at a particular
part of the molecule.

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:35.670
And so, basically, you're
reducing polyatomic molecules

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:38.580
to a diatomic that you
understanding the bonding

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.050
and anti-bonding.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:44.910
OK, so I'll continue on Monday.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:48.660
And your problem set for
this week is due on Monday.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.490
And the following
set for the next week

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:54.410
will also be due on Monday.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:55.260
Not that Monday.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.135
The following Monday.

00:51:59.547 --> 00:52:01.380
And that's the next to
the last problem set.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:06.040
So you're inside
of the home base.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.430
OK, have a good weekend.

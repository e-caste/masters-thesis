00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.280
PROFESSOR: We're now
at storyboard 23.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.550
Let's look at panel
A. Our last metabolism

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.140
topic under the general umbrella
of catabolism is ketone bodies.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140
Ketone bodies are only covered
in two pages in the book,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.230
but they're medically
very important.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.500
The medical relevance
of ketone bodies

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.770
stems from their
role in starvation

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.870
and their role in diabetes.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.340
Let's look at panel A. This
panel shows various sources of

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.680
and uses of acetyl CoA.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.280
It shows that ketone bodies are
made from Acetyl coenzyme A.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.680
So let's start this
part of the lecture

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.280
with a discussion of where
acetyl CoA comes from,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.140
and what its various
states are including

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.330
the formation of ketone bodies.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.610
We just finished talking
about fatty acid catabolism.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.950
So let's start on the
right of this figure.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.085
We see that a fatty
acid can be broken down

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:14.130
to form acetyl CoA
by beta oxidation,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.040
usually with the objective
of generating energy.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.890
If we follow the acetyl
CoA from beta oxidation

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.380
down into the TCA
cycle, we see that it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.650
will be fully oxidized to carbon
dioxide with the generation

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.510
of a lot of energy
that can be used

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.840
for mechanical work,
biosynthesis, and other things.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.730
A second source
of Acetyl CoA can

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.620
be seen to the
left, where we see

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.050
glycogen breakdown
to glucose or glucose

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.480
can be directly
imported into a cell.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.330
In either case, the glucose
that we take in or liberate

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.100
from its storage
depot, glycogen,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.580
can be converted into
acetyl coenzyme A.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.070
Glycerol can be generated
from the backbone

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.950
of a metabolized
triacylglyceride.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.310
It enters glycolysis as
dihydroxyacetone phosphate

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.840
and then can progress to acetyl
CoA by way of glycolysis.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.050
Alanine can transiminate
into pyruvate,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.300
which is converted
subsequently to acetyl CoA

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.910
by pyruvate dehydrogenase.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.480
This diagram shows us that
many pathways converge

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.130
to generate acetyl coenzyme
A. Carbohydrates, amino acids,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.290
fatty acids, all
can act as a source

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.980
of this important
precursor to energy.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.890
Aside from being processed by
the TCA cycle, on the left,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.980
we see a broken line
pathway involving

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.050
fatty acid biosynthesis.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.060
This is going to be the
next topic we come to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.660
after this discussion of
ketone body formation.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.030
The pathway on the right
with the broken lines

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.490
is the pathway leading
to ketone bodies

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.740
which is called ketogenesis.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.770
In the box at the top of panel
A is a cartoon reminding me

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.980
to tell you that acetyl CoA
cannot escape from the cell.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.300
Moreover, it cannot even easily
escape from the mitochondrion.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.430
In order for acetyl
CoA to leave the cell

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.515
and be transported from
one organ to another,

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:00.990
it needs to be converted
into ketone bodies.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.850
Another way to look
at ketone bodies

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.160
is that these are
mobile or portable forms

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.700
of Acetyl CoA that can go from
a source organ, which is usually

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.000
the liver, to a target organ,
which may need them in order

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.030
to generate energy by
way of the TCA cycle.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.130
The target organ for
example could be brain

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.855
under conditions of
starvation, or it

00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:20.400
could be skeletal
muscle if you have

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.560
to run away from something.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.740
Let's look at panel B. There
are five key facts that we need

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.570
to know about ketone bodies.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.600
First, Ketogenesis mainly
occurs in the liver.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.670
The liver manufactures
ketone bodies

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.090
and then exports them
to other organs for use.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.810
These reactions typically happen
when the levels of oxaloacetate

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.210
become limiting in
their mitochondrion.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.740
And I'll give you
an example of why

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.470
this is the case when I talk
about starvation a little later

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.370
in this lecture.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.860
The second important
fact is that these

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.770
are the primary metabolic
fuels of the heart and skeletal

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.110
muscle under normal conditions.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.850
The third fact is
that ketone bodies

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.000
become the major metabolic
fuel of all cells

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.920
under conditions
of starvation, even

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.710
cells of the brain after
a few days of starvation

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.920
will convert from glucose being
the preferred metabolic fuel

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.370
to accepting ketone bodies as
their major source of energy.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.500
The fourth fact I want
to talk about with regard

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.910
to ketone bodies
is that they are

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.519
produced in excess in diabetes.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.320
I'll talk a little
bit more about that

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.910
later in the lecture.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.810
Finally, ketogenesis occurs in
the mitochondrion, primarily

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.520
the mitochondrion of the liver.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.550
So these are
mitochondrial reactions.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.240
Panel C shows the three
classical ketone bodies,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.990
acetoacetate, beta
hydroxybutyrate, and acetone.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.090
From the standpoint
of chemical accuracy,

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.670
it's obvious that
beta hydroxybutyrate

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.590
is an alcohol and not a ketone.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.500
Nevertheless, it's lumped
in with the ketone bodies

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.130
for historical reasons.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.640
Acetoacetate and
beta hydroxybutyrate

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.890
are what I'll call quote
unquote "useful" ketone

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.410
bodies from the standpoint
of serving as precursors

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.000
to metabolic energy.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.930
Acetone by contrast, is not
useful by this criterion.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.620
Acetone however, is
a useful biomarker,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.340
because sometimes its presence
can help diagnose diabetes.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.730
On a personal note, I come
from a long line of diabetics.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.760
I remember when I was a
little kid, my dad before he

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.530
was diagnosed, would
come home from work

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.090
at the end of the day.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.650
He had very poor circulation.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.510
So my two sisters
and I would try

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.030
to rub his legs to give
him a kind of massage

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.490
to make his circulation
a little bit better.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.940
I remember very clearly my
older sister saying, "gee,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.560
dad smells like mom's
nail polish remover,"

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.140
and that's because he
was a diabetic producing

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.540
acetone, which was used
at the time at least

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.280
as nail polish remover.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.130
We had no idea at the
time what was going on.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.730
A few months later, my dad was
diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.790
I now know that the fruity
odor we smelled on his breath

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.140
was acetone.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.640
As I said, acetone is a
biomarker of this disease.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.370
One last point with
regard to the story board.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.750
Note that the acetoacetate and
beta hydroxybutyrate molecules

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.010
are acids.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.200
In diabetics, these
acids can be produced

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.900
as we'll see later
in sufficiently

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.840
high concentrations to
lower the pH of the blood

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.940
quite substantially.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.070
Keep in mind that
lowering the pH

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.010
is the same thing as increasing
the concentration of protons

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.760
in the blood.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.050
These concentrated protons will
have physiological relevance

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.730
that I'll discuss later.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.730
When a diabetic enters the phase
where the pH of their blood

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.080
is dangerously low, that's
called diabetic acidosis.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.630
Let's now turn to
Panel D. At this point

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.780
I want to describe the detailed
biochemical reactions that

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.820
give rise to ketone bodies.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.320
To make a ketone
body we're going

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.816
to need three molecules
of acetyl coenzyme

00:06:45.816 --> 00:06:48.660
A. One of these molecules
is going to be catalytic.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.960
That is, it's going to be
restored at the overall end

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.270
of the process of ketogenesis.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.520
Let's start by
imagining a scenario

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.770
in the mitochondrion
of a liver cell

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.230
where oxaloacetate
becomes limiting.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.770
I'll talk about physiological
states under which oxaloacetate

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.410
becomes limiting or
sparse a little bit later.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.130
Acetyl CoA cannot
enter the TCA cycle,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.000
because citrate synthase lacks
oxaloacetate as a reaction

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.200
partner.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.080
The concentration of acetyl
CoA starts to accumulate.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.680
Then the beta
ketothiolase reaction

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.330
that is the last step in
fatty acid bio oxidation

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.515
reverses owing to the high
concentration of product acetyl

00:07:31.515 --> 00:07:32.730
CoA.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.790
So two acetyl CoAs
come together in order

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.330
to form acetoacetyl
coenzyme A. Note

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.610
that I put markers on
each of the carbons

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.980
of the acetoacetyl coenzyme A.
A third acetoacetyl coenzyme

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.720
A is then added to
the gamma carbon

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.680
of the acetoacetyl coenzyme
A. That's the carbon that

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.360
has the filled-in square.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.700
The enzyme that catalyzed
this last reaction

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.720
is HMG Coenzyme A
reductase, where HMG stands

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.120
for hydroxymethylglutaryl.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.249
HMG CoA is a six-carbon
branch chain molecule.

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:08.790
In the present
situation, we're going

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.180
to look at HMG CoA as the
source of ketone bodies

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.220
in the mitochondrion,
but I want you

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.470
to keep in mind that
if this reaction were

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.210
to occur not in
the mitochondrion

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.660
but in the cytoplasm, the
resulting HMG CoA could

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.310
be used for other pathways.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.070
For example, HMG
CoA in the cytosol

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.455
is the precursor to cholesterol.

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:30.330
With that in mind, let's
return our attention

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.789
to the mitochondrion
and ketogenesis.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.970
The mitochondrial
enzyme HMG CoA lyase

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.090
will split the HMG
CoA, knocking off

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.210
an acetyl CoA in liberating
as the final product

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.710
acetoacetate, which is our
first of three ketone bodies.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.560
Acetoacetate is a beta
keto acid and hence,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.250
prone to spontaneous
decarboxylation.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.440
Non enzymatically, this will
happen at some slow rate

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.130
in order to liberate CO2
and produce acetone, which

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.470
is our second ketone body.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.360
This acetone gives
the fruity smell

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.580
to the breath of a diabetic
whose disease is out

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.870
of control.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.810
Acetone is not going to be
biochemically useful to us,

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.790
for example it's not going to be
metabolized to generate energy.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.210
The second chemical
fate of the acetoacetate

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.770
is its reduction by NADH using
the enzyme beta hydroxybutyrate

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.180
dehydrogenase.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.880
This reduction forms our
third ketone body beta

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.780
hydroxybutyrate, which is a
biochemically useful molecule

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.770
in that it serves as
a good metabolic fuel.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.420
Acetoacetate and
beta hydroxybutyrate

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.210
do not need any kind
of special transporter

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.530
to get out of the
cell into the blood.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.620
They diffuse through the
mitochondrial membrane

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.810
and later through
the cell membrane.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.360
They are then transported
by the circulatory system

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.300
from the liver to organs
that need them for energy.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.190
As you mentioned
above, ketone bodies

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.920
are portable forms
of acetyl CoA.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.770
In a real sense, the liver
by making these ketone bodies

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.050
is acting as a
food caterer where

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.330
ketone bodies
represent food that's

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.780
delivered to other organs.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.800
At this point let's
look at storyboard 24

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.240
panel A. Now let's
take a look what

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.850
happens when the ketone
bodies travel by the blood

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.580
and are taken up by another
organ such as muscle.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.700
Acetoacetate, which I'll
refer to as ketone body

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.220
one is good to go
and is ready to enter

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.990
the main stream of metabolism.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.420
So I'm going to come
back to it in a minute.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.790
The beta hydroxybutyrate,
by contrast,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.830
has to be processed
in order for it

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.250
to be useful to the target organ
skeletal muscle in this case.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:37.370
In step two, the muscle
form of beta hydroxybutyrate

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.560
dehydrogenase will use
NAD plus to oxidize

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.220
the beta hydroxybutyrate
into acetoacetate, which

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.190
joins the pool of acetoacetate
that came in directly

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.150
from the blood.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.380
We now have to put a thioester
group on the acetoacetate,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.840
and that comes from
an unusual source.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.470
In step three you'll see
a succinyl coenzyme A

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.290
from the TCA cycle
giving its coenzyme

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.440
A residue to acetoacetate,
which results

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.100
in the formation of
acetoacetyl coenzyme A.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.340
This reaction happens in the
mitochondrion of the cell.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.790
At step four acetyl
coenzyme A is

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.690
converted by beta ketothiolase
into two molecules

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.180
of acetyl coenzyme
A. And again, we're

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.220
going to need another
coenzyme A group

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.730
to come in at this point as
part of the beta ketothiolase

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.140
reaction.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.240
Remember that beta
ketothiolase is

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.730
the last enzyme that's
operative in beta oxidation

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.230
of fatty acids.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.360
Here it's doing
the same chemistry

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.980
that it does in beta oxidation.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.780
It splits acetoacetyl CoA
into two acetyl CoA molecules.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.880
And in steps five and
six, those molecules

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.430
integrate into the TCA cycle.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.610
In the TCA cycle they're
oxidized to carbon dioxide

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.980
with the generation of energy.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.080
Let me review for a
minute before going

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.290
into a physiological scenario.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.540
Way over to the
left at step one,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.600
the liver has made acetyl
CoA and packaged it

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.560
into two ketone
bodies, acetoacetate

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.640
and beta hydroxybutyrate.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.830
They travel in the
blood to target tissues,

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.160
for example, the muscle,
or heart, or the brain.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.790
In these target tissues these
ketone bodies are internalized,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.380
converted to acetoacetate, and
then to acetoacetyl coenzyme A

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.450
and then ultimately to several
molecules of acetyl coenzyme A.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.360
The acetyl coenzyme A
that started in the liver,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.240
ends up in the target
tissue and then can

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.260
be used to generate energy.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.130
This is a particularly important
reaction under conditions

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.450
of starvation and diabetes.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.590
Let's now look at panel
b of storyboard 24.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.650
As you know, I like to look
at physiological scenarios

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.430
because at least to me, they
helped make biochemistry real.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.355
The scenario I want to look
at is that of diabetes.

00:12:55.355 --> 00:12:58.500
In Type 2 diabetes, which
is the type that I have,

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.390
my cells have become resistant
to taking up glucose.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.910
My cells are
insulin insensitive.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.880
After a meal I have very,
very high concentrations

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.150
of glucose in my blood,
because the cells of my tissues

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.670
are not capable of taking it in.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.000
Hence, if I do not take my
anti-diabetic medication

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.530
the sugar concentration
in my blood

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.190
stays high, which leads to some
of the medical complications

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.090
of diabetes.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.800
More on that later.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.410
Given that there's a lot
of glucose in my blood,

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.290
but it's not getting
into my cells,

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.010
my cells are actually in a
technical state of starvation.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.290
Take a look at the pathway
I've drawn in panel b.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.270
Glucose on the left is
not getting into the cell.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.020
I've used broken lines for
the pathway from glucose

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.590
to pyruvate and then from
pyruvate in the cytoplasm

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.600
into the mitochondrial matrix.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.870
These broken lines
are meant to indicate

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.960
that the pathways involved
are just not very active.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.120
The sparse activity
of these pathways

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.700
means that acetyl CoA
levels are becoming somewhat

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.520
limiting in the mitochondrion.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.930
Because pyruvate
is also limiting,

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.970
the enzyme pyruvate
carboxylase doesn't

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.160
have sufficient
pyruvate in order

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.710
to maintain the
oxaloacetate concentration

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.240
within the mitochondrial matrix.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.980
Once again, oxaloacetate is
the TCA cycle intermediate

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.860
that that's at the lowest, that
is micromolar concentration.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.220
I'm focusing here on
the liver, although I

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.320
should add at this point
that all tissues are

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.840
similarly limited in
the pathways indicated

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.460
by the broken lines.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.890
The liver's response to
sensing this limitation

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:36.030
in carbohydrate processing
is to either take in lipid

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.460
or to break it down
from internal stores,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.260
for example, triacylglycerides
in order to produce acetyl CoA.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.870
But because oxaloacetate
is limiting,

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.420
the step at beta
ketothiolase backs up,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.300
producing a large
amount of ketone bodies.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.910
The ketone bodies are
produced in excess,

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.580
so you can see them escaping
into the mitochondrion

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.300
and later out of the cell, and
they go off into the blood.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.700
Consequently, the
liver of diabetics

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.610
produces a lot of ketone
bodies, because it senses

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.710
that the body is starving,

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.400
To the right of panel B, I have
some blood chemistry values

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.890
that are of relevance
to diabetics.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.460
In a non-diabetic person,
blood sugar concentrations,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.320
that is blood
glucose is maintained

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.540
at about 100
milligrams of glucose

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.030
per 100 milliliters of blood.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.590
When I was diagnosed
with diabetes,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.690
my blood sugar was over 300
milligrams per 100 milliliters.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.210
As I recall the symptoms
were disorientation.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.730
I couldn't walk very
easily, I was thirsty,

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.890
and I urinated a lot.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.050
Normal ketone body
concentrations

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.540
are less than 0.2 nanomolar.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.470
In a severe diabetic situation,
your ketone body concentrations

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.850
could be 15 to 25 millimolar
and the pH of your blood

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.470
could drop from the mid 7
range down to about 6.8.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.710
The kidney responds to the
high concentration of glucose

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.780
and the high
concentration of protons,

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.700
that is the low pH, by
increasing urine volume output

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.020
in order to try to urinate
out the glucose and protons.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.560
The results are that the
diabetic becomes excessively

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.470
thirsty which again is
one of the biomarkers

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.540
or symptoms of the disease.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.080
The classic historical
treatment of diabetes

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.660
is to give insulin, which will
push more glucose into the cell

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.960
and thus offset the biochemical
defect that leads ultimately

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.810
to ketone bodies and to the
high concentration of glucose

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.890
in the blood.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.230
Aside from giving
insulin by injection

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.820
there are other
medications that will

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.370
result in a sort of
reactivation of the beta cells

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.640
in the pancreas in order to
produce more insulin naturally.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.040
Alternatively, there
are medications

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.200
that will block
gluconeogenesis and thus

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.350
stop the ability of the liver
and other gluconeogenic organs

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.390
from producing glucose.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.090
So by blocking
gluconeogenesis, one

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.910
can lower the glucose
concentration of the blood.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.930
As you see there are many, many
ways to treat this disease.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.650
Let me add that it can be a very
debilitating disease, leading

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.880
to blindness, amputation, and
cardiovascular difficulties.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.130
It's a good idea to
try to avoid the risk

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.230
factors for this disease.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.089
It's not fully
preventable at least

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.300
in people who come from families
in which nearly everybody gets

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.369
it, for example, my situation.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.490
But by avoiding risk factors you
can push off the date of onset

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.417
by many years.

DENNIS FREEMAN:
Hello and welcome.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.540
So as I said last time,
the important part

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.510
of doing this class
is doing the homework.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.820
We have a relatively
complicated new system

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.130
for how to do the homework,
so I apologize if there's

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.150
a couple of kinks in it.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.060
I appreciate the feedback
pointing out the kinks.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.140
We will try to fix them.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.970
And we won't hold anybody
responsible for our kinks,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.620
just so you know.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.340
So the kinks include
there's two parts.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.840
There's the tutor problems
that are automatically graded.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.500
And if you think the tutor
didn't give you a just answer,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.870
please just let us
know and we will

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.120
take care of it,
provided of course

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.090
that your answer is just.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.360
And for the problems that
will be graded by a human,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.660
we would like you to read the
solution so that you understand

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.620
what went wrong, if anything,
in your solution and perhaps

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.800
an alternative approach.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.680
Most of the engineering
design problems

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.760
will be solvable
in multiple ways.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.840
So, it's good for you
to see other approaches.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.340
To encourage you
to do that, we're

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.960
asking you to identify
any errors that were

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.140
in your original submission.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.390
So the importance of that
is that Homework One was due

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.040
yesterday at 5:00 PM.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.600
And if you want to recoup
points that you lost,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.760
you must submit marked up
version of the same thing

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.860
that you submitted yesterday by
Friday 5 PM, by tomorrow 5 PM.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.590
You are welcome to mark up
a photocopy of the paper

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.440
and give us a paper mark-up.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.010
If you do that, it's due in at
the beginning of recitation.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.950
If you want to scan it, you
can send us a scan anytime up

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.750
to 5:00 PM.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.270
Questions?

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.874
Yes.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:23.540
AUDIENCE: Can I just
email you the scan?

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.331
DENNIS FREEMAN: No.

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.610
Enter it into the web site.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.320
It's much easier for me.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.900
The graders will all be
able to see it that way.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.012
If you send the email
it's much harder.

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:34.970
It's easier if we have
everything in one place.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.469
If there's a problem
with the tutor,

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.340
then send it to me by
email and we'll fix it.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.570
Other comments or questions?

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.905
Yeah?

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:51.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Do you
ever get them [INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.580
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yes, eventually.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.550
Now, what hasn't been completely
worked out yet is whether what

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.120
you get back will be paper
or [? bits. ?] Because

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.271
we'll probably end up doing
all the grading via [? bits, ?]

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:07.270
because it's just easier
to communicate with all

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.300
the graders via [? bits. ?] So
that's not been resolved yet.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.508
We're still going to work
out with the graders what's

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:16.060
the easiest way to synchronize
grading the electronic

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.710
and dealing with it.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.050
So you will get feedback
but you won't necessarily

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.490
get paper feedback.

00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:24.740
Other comments?

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.170
OK.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.580
So last time, we
started to think

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.495
about how to think about
discrete time systems.

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:37.620
The thing you were supposed
to get out of last time

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.480
is that there's
different representations

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.710
for discrete time systems.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.740
We're interested in all of them.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.200
We're interested in all of
them because of the strengths

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.820
and weaknesses of each.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.770
We looked particularly
at difference equations,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.270
which are mathematically
precise and concise.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.180
That's very good.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.930
We looked at block
diagrams, that was good

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.100
because we could trace
the flow of information

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.270
through the network.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.670
And we looked at
operator representations

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.600
and they were nice.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.170
And we will see further
today how that's nice.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.670
They are nice
because they allow us

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.230
to think about a system in
terms of polynomial mathematics.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.390
So what I want to
do today primarily

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.945
is develop that latter theme.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.300
Keep in mind that one of the
important features of the block

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.470
diagram was the arrow notation.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.020
It told you what causes what.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.885
It let you make a hardware
realization of a system.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.290
An important point from last
time, which we just ended on

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.580
at the end of the hour,
an important point

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.270
was that when you're
thinking about the signals,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.190
there's a higher
level abstraction that

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.980
is also important.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.830
In addition to knowing which
is the input to the R operator

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.290
and which is the output
of the R operator,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.120
there are some kinds
of systems that

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.610
just behave categorically
different from other kinds

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.540
of systems.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.580
And they are indicated here.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.400
This system has
the property that

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.320
is easy to write a recipe
for how to compute y given x.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.670
How do you compute y given x?

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.700
Well, you take x,
copy it, invert it,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.470
shift it to the right.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.580
Add the copy to the
inverted shifted.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.560
Easy to make a
recipe to do that.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.780
It's not so easy to
make a recipe here.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.110
Right?

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.750
So there, so if
you think about how

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.770
you would try to write that in
an operator, you could say, y.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.640
What is y?

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.160
y is going to be x plus
a right-shift of y.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.920
So you could say, well that's 1
minus a right-shift of y equals

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.850
x.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.380
That's not a recipe
for computing y from x.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.330
That's a recipe for
computing x from y.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.487
But we don't know y.

00:06:05.487 --> 00:06:06.070
Everybody see?

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.420
That's completely different.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.090
And so it's that
difference that makes

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.130
this kind of a
network, this kind

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.770
of a system interesting
by comparison to that one.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.510
And the distinguishing feature
that makes that behavior occur

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.600
is feedback.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.230
When you have feedback,
feedback means,

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.600
for some signal
in the system, we

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.160
would say the
system has feedback

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.600
if there is some signal
somewhere whose output at time

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.780
n depends on it's same, the
output of that same signal

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.810
at a previous time.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.040
If that's true for some
signal in the system,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.240
then we say the
system has feedback.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.150
The implications of
feedback are profound.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.950
They mean, for example, that a
transient input can give rise

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.735
to a persisting output.

00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:07.610
And we took a look at
how to think about that

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.920
in terms of the block diagrams.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.190
You can see that if you had
even a signal that only lasts

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.430
for one sample, a signal--

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.250
a system that has this
property of feedback

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.050
could generate a response that
lasts for a very long time.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.000
In fact, the response at time 0,
the only way that could happen

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.770
is through the
straight through path.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.560
The only way you could get
an output at time 0, given

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.700
that the input is non-0 only
at 0 is through the straight

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.240
through path.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.550
But then you could get
an output at time 1

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.170
if you cycled around once.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.570
This is the idea that a
signal somewhere depends

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.160
on a prior value of itself.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.940
And you could get a
response at time 2

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.940
by going around the loop
twice, three, 3 times, 4,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.970
four times, et cetera.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.300
And in general, the response
could persist forever.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.220
That's such an
interesting behavior.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.950
It's such a fundamental
property of these systems

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.320
that we want to
characterize systems

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.550
by thinking about them that way.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.410
So in this particular
case, if we

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.570
think about sort of
the most simple form

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.060
that feedback
could take, this is

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.420
sort of the simplest
way you could imagine.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.950
This is kind of
the simplest system

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.658
that you could imagine
that has feedback.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.900
And you can see that the kinds
of responses that you can get

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.720
depend on this number p-naught.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.080
And that p-naught characterizes
the family of responses

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.919
that you could get.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.900
So for example, if p-naught
were a number less than 1,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.250
you could get a decaying
geometric sequence.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.060
If p-naught were 1 exactly,
you would get a response

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.870
that never decayed or grew.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.360
And if p-naught were a
number bigger than 1,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.557
then the response
could grow infinitely.

00:09:01.557 --> 00:09:03.390
So that's a very
fundamental characteristic.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.711
And we call that number
p-naught the pole.

00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:08.210
OK.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.376
Everybody's happy with that?

00:09:09.376 --> 00:09:11.170
That's very simple-minded.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.800
So we're going to
characterize-- so the point is,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.690
there's a higher level
of structure in systems

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.940
that we would like to capture.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.550
We're going to call that
higher level feedback.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.640
It means there's a cycle
in the block diagram.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.140
And it means that you can get
characteristically different

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.370
kinds of responses then result
when you don't have feedback.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.350
In particular,
simple systems will

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.660
have this behavior of
a geometric sequence

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.380
characterized by a pole.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.800
OK, just to make
sure that everybody

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.480
is with me, how many of the
following unit-sample responses

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.247
can be represented
by a single pole?

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.340
OK.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.340
Before you answer that
question, talk to your neighbor.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.590
Don't even bother trying to
think about the question.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.300
Look at your neighbor.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.710
Say hi.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.837
And then try to
answer this question.

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:05.825
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

00:11:26.409 --> 00:11:27.200
DENNIS FREEMAN: OK.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.950
What's the answer?

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.150
Everybody raise your hand.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.310
Raise some number of
fingers equal to the answer

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.244
for how many of those
responses could result from--

00:11:34.244 --> 00:11:35.660
how many of those
systems could be

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.100
represented by a single pole?

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.490
OK.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.870
A little variety.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.430
There's about 80% correct.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.184
Tell me a simple one.

00:11:50.184 --> 00:11:51.600
So tell me one
that can definitely

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.111
be represented by a pole.

00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:53.610
OK.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:54.757
Upper right.

00:11:54.757 --> 00:11:57.090
Because it looks just like
one that I showed you before.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.965
What's another simple
one that can definitely

00:11:58.965 --> 00:12:01.860
be represented by a pole?

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.385
Excuse me?

00:12:02.385 --> 00:12:03.510
AUDIENCE: Right underneath.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.170
DENNIS FREEMAN: Underneath.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.690
OK, so these are things that
were on the previous slide.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.910
That should be pretty easy.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.750
Any others?

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.485
Yes?

00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:11.700
AUDIENCE: Top left.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.180
DENNIS FREEMAN: Top left.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:12.680
Why?

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.216
There's none like that
on the other side?

00:12:15.216 --> 00:12:16.692
AUDIENCE: Because
it's oscillating.

00:12:16.692 --> 00:12:19.644
It's changing sides and
it's pole is negative

00:12:19.644 --> 00:12:22.596
but because it's converging
to 0, the pole, it's magnitude

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:24.090
is less than 1.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.400
DENNIS FREEMAN: So what would
be the pole for the upper left?

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.732
AUDIENCE: Some
p-naught-- so that

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:33.259
is like negative 1 p-naught
plus p-naught less than 0.

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:35.550
DENNIS FREEMAN: So can you
figure out what p-naught is?

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.101
Back in the back?

00:12:38.101 --> 00:12:38.600
Any?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.960
And so what's p-naught?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.139
For the upper left, what
is the value of p-naught?

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.460
AUDIENCE: 1/2.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.590
DENNIS FREEMAN: Minus 1/2.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.090
OK.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.590
Maybe.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.470
Not really.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.030
But yeah.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.190
So if it were, if
p-naught were minus 1/2,

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.741
let's think about p-naught is
minus 1/2, what would that do?

00:12:56.741 --> 00:12:57.240
OK.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.250
If the first answer were
1, then the second one

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.390
should be minus 1/2?

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.598
What should the third one be?

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.450
Plus 1/4.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.890
What should the next one be?

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.700
Minus 1/8.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.070
So it doesn't quite
look like a minus 1/2.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:16.020
It looks more like minus 3/4.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:16.680
Yep.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.320
Having made the
graph myself, I know

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.660
that the answer was minus 0.8.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.320
OK.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.900
You wouldn't necessarily
have any way of knowing that.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.140
OK so three of them
are, how about this one?

00:13:33.804 --> 00:13:36.001
Yes?

00:13:36.001 --> 00:13:36.500
No?

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.650
Completely uncommitted?

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.210
My neighbor didn't know?

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.390
My partner's an idiot?

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.780
So this is geometric, isn't it?

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.280
Right?

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.785
The only thing you see there
is like 1 and 1/2 and 1/4

00:13:55.785 --> 00:13:56.910
and stuff like that, right?

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.030
Blank stares.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.306
Yes?

00:14:03.306 --> 00:14:05.258
AUDIENCE: So it's
not [INAUDIBLE],

00:14:05.258 --> 00:14:10.989
so it's not diverting, so it
can't be [INAUDIBLE] unit step.

00:14:10.989 --> 00:14:13.280
DENNIS FREEMAN: If it were
responding to the unit step,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.850
that's absolutely true.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.640
So if I'm thinking about
the unit-sample response,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.920
then the unit-sample response
always looks like p-naught

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.740
to the n, n bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.290
And there's no way you
can choose a p-naught that

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.030
fits that lower left hand.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.270
How about this one?

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.090
Same problem.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.660
It's alternating with
the same problem.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.650
Right?

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.050
So the only response-- so
you can't do those two.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.790
The answer was three.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:54.210
The only kinds of responses you
can model with a single pole

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.180
can be shown here.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.710
That's not quite true.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.030
Let me retract that slightly.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.540
Here are some-- and I will
make this more complicated

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.780
and about two pages of notes.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:14.040
Here's all the real values of
p-naught and the associated

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.140
behaviors.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.500
In two pages, we'll get to the
complex values for p-naught.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.970
So here's all of
that the responses

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:28.840
that can be associated with
a single real valued pole.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.210
So you can get, as
somebody has already said,

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:36.880
you can get the idea of
diverging with alternation,

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.140
converging with alternation,
converging monotonically,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.600
diverging monotonically.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.431
Those are the behaviors you can
get with a single real value

00:15:45.431 --> 00:15:45.930
pole.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.110
OK.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.710
That's what can happen with
a single real valued pole

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.327
but systems, there are
more complicated systems.

00:15:56.327 --> 00:15:58.160
And when you have a
more complicated system,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.110
you can get a more
complicated response.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.940
And one example is shown here.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.930
So here a system.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.320
Here's the unit-sample response.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.910
Is this something that can be
represented by a single pole?

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.350
No, because it doesn't fall into
one of those canonical shapes.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.080
Right.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.940
In fact, this response
has the property

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.670
that it grows and then decays.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.070
But it only does the
grow and decay once,

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.950
so it's just not one
of the canonical forms.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.450
So now there's something
different going on here

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.380
and we'd like to
understand what that is.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.280
So we cannot represent
that by a single pole.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.890
However, this is where the
polynomial stuff becomes useful

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.200
because I can think
about tricks I

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.060
can do with the
polynomials, which you all

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.672
learned in high school so
you all know how to do that.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:50.461
That we can think about
the system in terms of,

00:16:50.461 --> 00:16:52.210
we can think about
this complicated system

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.140
in terms of simpler systems that
can be represented by one pole.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.200
So for example, one of
the more powerful things

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.180
you can do with a
polynomial is factor.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.599
If you factor this polynomial--

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.849
OK, so this is a simple
representation for that right?

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.520
I can just read
that straight off.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.619
So I can make this
representation just reading it

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.510
straight off the block diagram.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.240
I can turn that into an operator
type representation here.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.109
So I operate on y with
this mass to get x.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:26.450
It's backwards feedback,
that's what happens.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.560
But the second order
polynomial in R

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.850
can be factored into two
first order polynomials in R.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.800
And not surprisingly,
that then leads

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.430
to a representation of the
more complex system in terms

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.900
of two simpler systems.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.460
So in fact, I can write
the original system.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.550
If I factor it, there's an
equivalent representation.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:52.390
Equivalent means provided
that all the systems

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.830
start initial rest.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:59.320
Initial rest means provided all
the delays started out at 0.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.210
Putting in the
normal caveats, there

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.710
is an equivalent representation
to the complex system.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.680
In fact, there's two
equivalent systems shown here.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.500
Each corresponds to factoring.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.440
And it corresponds to
doing which factor first.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.030
So in the first
realization, it says

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.610
that generate an
intermediate signal

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.204
by thinking about the factor
that has a base of 0.7.

00:18:21.204 --> 00:18:25.650
Then cascade that with
another system that

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:31.210
has a base that looks just like
a canonical first order system,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.670
except that the base now is 0.9.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:37.060
And presumably, if you
cascade those two things,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.250
you will get an
equivalent response.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.235
And the order didn't
make any difference.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.550
So that's a way we can
think about the response

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.220
of a more complex system in
terms of first order responses.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.430
So that's nice.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.020
And that gives us then--

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.560
so we can then use the idea
of the Taylor series expansion

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.980
to think about the response
of each of those first order

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.600
systems, so we can replace the
response of the canonical first

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.030
order system with the infinite
feedforward realization--

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.110
remember from last time, the
first order feedback system can

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.120
be equivalently represented
by an infinite order

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.540
of feedforward system--

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.880
so that the unit-sample
response here.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.800
So this system, excuse me, this
first order feedback system

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.350
can be rewritten as that
infinite order feedforward

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.280
system.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.740
This one can be
written that way.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.210
And then again, we can
use polynomial math

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.210
to figure out the response of
that more complicated system.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.500
All we need to do is multiply
and then collect terms.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.510
You all know how to
multiply polynomials,

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.160
therefore you all know how to
solve second order systems.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.660
OK.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.630
That's the advantage of
converting one representation,

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.112
a system representation, into
a polynomial representation

00:20:07.112 --> 00:20:09.070
because you already know
all about polynomials.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.440
Since you already know how
to multiply polynomials,

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.420
you already know how
to cascade systems.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:22.450
The only difficulty
here is bookkeeping,

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.560
not missing a term.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.900
So there are graphic
aids to that.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.670
Think about the
block diagram that

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:32.200
would correspond to the
infinite feedforward realization

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.910
of the left part and
the infinite feedforward

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.540
realization of the right part.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.290
So I'm thinking about this
system and that system being

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.940
represented by this
infinite system

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.740
and that infinite system.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.430
And now just making a block
diagram realization of this

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.920
and a separate block
diagram realization of that

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.365
and cascading them to get this.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.740
And now the
bookkeeping is trivial.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.460
What's the only way you can
get a response if the input is

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.500
a unit-sample signal?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.440
What's the only way you can get
a response at time n equals 0?

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.740
What's the only signal path
that generates a response of n

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.250
equals 0?

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:23.846
Say it louder?

00:21:23.846 --> 00:21:25.370
AUDIENCE: The top right left.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.870
DENNIS FREEMAN: The
only signal path

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.600
is to go through here, because
if I go through here, I

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.470
introduce a delay.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.970
This introduces even more delay.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.639
This introduces even more delay.

00:21:33.639 --> 00:21:35.180
The only way I can
get from the input

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.260
to the output with no delay
is to go through the one

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.320
here and go through
the one here.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.769
So that that's where
that term comes from.

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:46.310
The only way I can
get from the input

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:51.000
to the output with no delay,
no R, is through that top path.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.200
If I want to get
one level of delay,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.250
the only way I can do that is
to pick it up here and then not

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.690
pick it up there or vice versa.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:05.050
There's more ways that
I could get two delays.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.670
I can pick up two
delays all at once

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.390
on the left with none on
the right or vice versa

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.310
or one in each.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.260
That's just bookkeeping, right?

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.760
It's just showing
you how you can

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.950
think about polynomial
multiplication

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.130
in different ways.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.589
Alternatively, you could
represent it in a table.

00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:27.380
So if you think about
multiplying these two

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.200
polynomials where I've
represented the first pole as a

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:35.460
in the second pole
as b, you can think

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.940
about polynomial multiplication
in a tabular form.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.610
So you have to think about
the distributive property,

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.630
the 1 distributes
over all of these,

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.570
then the a distributes
over all, the aR

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.000
distributes over all of these
and the a-squared R-squared

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.430
distributes over all of these.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.760
And you can represent each of
those distribution operations

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.320
by a row in the table.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.230
And then you can see
that the only entries

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:02.370
with no R, with R to the
0 is along that diagonal.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.790
And then the R terms are
here, the R-squared terms,

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.434
the R-cubed terms, et cetera.

00:23:07.434 --> 00:23:08.850
And you can see
how that would all

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.140
sum to give you something
that's not a geometric.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.470
OK, all those things,
just bookkeeping.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.040
Right?

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.600
All I'm trying to say
is that there is a way

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.940
that you can think about the
second order system which

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.170
does not generate a simple
geometric sequence by thinking

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.290
about the cascade of
two systems that each

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:34.540
do generate a unit-sample
response that is geometric.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.970
Nevertheless, all of
this is bookkeeping.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.254
It's still the case that
this is a complicated shape.

00:23:39.254 --> 00:23:41.170
And you still have to
do a fair amount of work

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.870
to figure out what that
complicated shape is.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.840
We can use polynomials
one more time

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.490
to make it conceptually simpler.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.100
We can do something that
we call partial fractions.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.050
You can take the
expression that we

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.450
found for this
complicated system,

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.520
factor it just
like we did before.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.880
But now, according to the
method of partial fractions,

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.780
you can represent the
reciprocal of a quadratic

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.260
as the sum of two terms,
each the reciprocal

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:20.220
of a linear function in R.
So you can always do that.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.750
That's a property of
polynomials, right?

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.750
So what that says is that
there's an equivalent

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:34.206
representation for this
complicated system that

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:37.670
looks like this.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:43.970
So backing up, so we showed
that by factoring, we

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.070
take this and turn it into this.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.460
By partial fractions we turn
it into a sum difference.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.600
What's the difference?

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.120
So now we think about
that difference here.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.980
This term can be generated
by multiplying 4.5 times

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.385
a canonic first order term.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.380
This can be generated
by multiplying minus 3.5

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.610
times a canonic
first order term.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.590
And the response adds.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.960
OK, well that's
completely new insight.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.170
We've taken what looks like
a very complicated response

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.360
from a system that is
not a canonical form.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.940
And we've turned
it into something

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.224
that does look like
several canonical forms,

00:25:33.224 --> 00:25:34.640
just like we did
with the cascade,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.940
but now we can see
that the answer is

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.100
the sum of two geometrics.

00:25:44.157 --> 00:25:44.990
Everybody's with it?

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:50.270
So it's even better than
being able to cascade,

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.340
wherein the cascade, we have to
do some complicated bookkeeping

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.470
in order to figure
out the responses.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.260
By thinking about it
with partial fractions,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.621
it's the simple sum
of two simple things.

00:26:02.621 --> 00:26:04.870
So then if you know properties
of each individual one,

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.120
life it rattles for
a long time or it

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.470
decays quickly, you can
instantly say something

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.670
about the combined response.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.150
Does that follow?

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.540
So then this response,
which I introduced

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.090
by saying it's complicated,
it's not really complicated.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.680
It's the sum of two geometrics.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.030
It goes up and then down simply
because the decay constants

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.570
for the two different geometrics
are different, that's all.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.660
The point is that this
is a very different kind

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.820
of representation.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.670
Many things-- so
you could do a lot

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.400
by just taking a
difference equation

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.340
and just factoring it and moving
terms around and figuring out

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:57.170
different ways to do the
sums and so forth to try

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.924
to simplify your life.

00:26:58.924 --> 00:27:00.590
You can do the same
with block diagrams.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.048
You could shuffle
around the blocks

00:27:02.048 --> 00:27:04.130
and try to make things simpler.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:09.720
This idea of turning
the top system into this

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.320
is trivial to see with
polynomial manipulations

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.650
and relatively and not at
all straightforward to do

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.230
by simple block
diagram manipulations.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.200
It follows directly from
the polynomial realization.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.750
That's what we mean by a
more powerful representation.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.150
It's very easy to see how we
got there if you represent

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.340
the system by a polynomial.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.006
It's much less easy to
see how we got there

00:27:32.006 --> 00:27:33.630
by thinking about it
as a block diagram

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.500
or as a difference equation.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.436
OK?

00:27:37.436 --> 00:27:37.935
Makes sense?

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.680
Because they're so important,
we would like shorthand ways

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.630
of finding poles.

00:27:49.092 --> 00:27:51.050
As soon as you know the
poles of a system, then

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.540
you know the geometric
sequences that characterize

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.610
unit-sample response.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.200
And for at least a
broad class of systems,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.490
we're going to be able to
think about the combined

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:06.200
unit-sample responses of the
system as some weighted sum

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.750
of individual contributions.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.310
So that makes the
idea of finding

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.374
the pose very important.

00:28:14.374 --> 00:28:15.790
There's a very
straightforward way

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.960
that we've sort of
already alluded to.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.360
If you had this
complicated thing

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.170
and you wanted to find the
poles, what you should do

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.930
is try to coerce it
into the canonical form.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:32.500
You remember the canonic
form for a single pole system

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.790
was this sort of representation.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.360
So you have x coming in.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.780
Coming out as y and
feeding around that way.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.880
That's the canonical
form for one pole system.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.610
And that had a system
function of the form y

00:28:53.610 --> 00:29:01.730
over x is 1 over 1
minus p-naught R.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:07.220
So if you can coerce all the
parts to look like 1 over 1

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.480
minus p-naught R then according
to that, here's a pole

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.210
and there's a pole
just by canonic forms

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.730
and matching up the terms
in a canonic form, right?

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.830
That requires some sort of
graphic memory or something

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:29.120
graphic ability to take one form
and turn it into another form.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.680
A simpler rule is to
say, look, just replace

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.970
all the Rs by 1 over
z, rewrite things,

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.420
and the z's turn out to be--

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.850
the values of z that are
the roots of the denominator

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.320
turn out to be the
values of the poles.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.230
That's very
straightforward to see just

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.360
by looking at the
canonical form.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.890
If I have the
canonical form where

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:58.540
I know that the pole is p-naught
and if I replaced the R by 1

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.080
over z and cleared
the fraction, I

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.940
would end up with z
over z minus p-naught.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.290
And now if I ask what's the
poles at the bottom, what's

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.670
the roots of the bottom?

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:14.170
For what values of z is
the denominator equal to 0?

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.650
The answer is clearly
z equals p-naught.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:23.840
It's just a trick to turn a
system function in terms of R

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.400
into a root-finding problem.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.510
So rather than having
some program that

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.940
knows how to write
canonical forms,

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:40.480
you can use any root finder to
find the values of the poles.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.880
OK so make sure
everybody is with me.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.260
Consider the following
system, blah, blah, blah.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.690
How many of the
following are true?

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.860
Answer looks like it ought to
be a number between 0 and 5

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.920
probably.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.050
So talk to your
neighbor and figure out

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.450
a number between 0 and 5.

00:33:23.635 --> 00:33:25.260
So how many of the
statements are true?

00:33:28.672 --> 00:33:29.172
Hands?

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.300
OK, participation
is a little small,

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:42.654
but it's like 95, 93,
something like that percent,

00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:44.820
except people keep changing
their number of fingers.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.230
That makes it confusing.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.149
OK.

00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:49.690
How do you think
about the first one?

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.940
The unit-sample response
converges to 0, yes or no?

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.023
How do you think about it?

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.980
Yes because they all do.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.960
True or false.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.460
Yes.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.310
Because there's something
special about this one.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.797
What is special about this
one that convinces you

00:34:07.797 --> 00:34:08.880
that that's true or false?

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.643
Yes.

00:34:09.643 --> 00:34:11.499
AUDIENCE: It has two
poles both of which

00:34:11.499 --> 00:34:12.681
are magnitude less than 1.

00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:14.639
DENNIS FREEMAN: It has
two poles, both of which

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:15.722
are magnitude less than 1.

00:34:15.722 --> 00:34:17.310
That's precisely right.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:21.409
So if we simply--

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:25.199
if we just do one
blackboard full of math.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.670
So we take this.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:30.150
Turn it into a polynomial form.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.790
Turn it into a functional form.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:33.645
Turn it into z's.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.880
Everyone's happy with that?

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.170
Now you may have made
slight algebra errors

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.690
in what you were doing, but the
procedure is very easy, right?

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.167
We see that we get two poles.

00:34:48.167 --> 00:34:49.000
Where are the poles?

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.060
Negative 1/2 and plus 1/4.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.950
They're at the roots
of the denominator.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:03.210
So is the unit-sample
response converge to 0?

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.000
It's the unit-sample response.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.870
Unit-sample responses
are going to be

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:11.940
the sum of two pieces from
the partial fraction argument.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.937
And so it will depend on
the positions of the poles.

00:35:15.937 --> 00:35:17.520
Both poles are inside
the unit circle.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.050
Both poles have
magnitude less than 1.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.000
Therefore, they converge,
therefore the first one

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.990
is right.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:30.310
Poles at a 1/2 and 1/4,
obviously wrong, right?

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.040
Obviously wrong, right?

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.450
There are two poles.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.200
None of the above.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:36.870
Obviously wrong.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:37.370
OK.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.300
So the answer is 2.

00:35:41.252 --> 00:35:43.220
OK?

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.200
OK.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.420
One more example problem.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.580
Favorite computer
science problems

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.160
is the Fibonacci problem.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.080
Fibonacci was thinking
about population growth

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.670
when he formulated the problem.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:36:00.470
The idea was what if you
have a pair of rabbits that

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:03.770
takes one cycle to grow up.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:08.780
And every cycle thereafter,
has a pair of baby rabbits.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.950
Then the next cycle, there
is a pair of baby rabbits.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.380
Then they grow up.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.620
But meanwhile mom and dad
had another pair of rabbits.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.890
But then those grow up.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.120
And now we have more.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.060
And then they grow up.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:22.976
And then they grow up.

00:36:22.976 --> 00:36:24.360
And then they grow up.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.050
And you get lots of rabbits.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:26.550
OK.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.633
So that's the idea, right?

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.549
Question?

00:36:33.549 --> 00:36:35.340
What are the poles of
the Fibonacci system?

00:37:49.542 --> 00:37:51.534
AUDIENCE: The poles,
why isn't that--

00:37:51.534 --> 00:37:54.522
[INAUDIBLE] to find
the poles [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:54.522 --> 00:38:00.327
to solve for a
denominator [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:00.327 --> 00:38:02.410
DENNIS FREEMAN: Why is a
hard philosophy question.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.130
I'm not sure I can answer
philosophy questions.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:09.060
I guess I have a
PhD, maybe I can.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.560
So it has to do with
partial fractions, right?

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.450
It's the bottom.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.050
The bottoms are special.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.550
And in fact, in
about a week, we'll

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.430
talk about what's the tops.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:23.330
Not surprisingly, the tops
are like an inverse bottom.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.280
What a deep insight.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.190
So if you were to run signals
through the system backwards,

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.310
the tops look like bottoms and
the bottoms look like tops.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.050
And there's some
really useful things

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.600
that you can derive from that.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.229
OK what's the answer
to the question?

00:38:38.229 --> 00:38:40.020
What are the poles in
the Fibonacci system?

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.990
Give me a number between 0 and--

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.644
1 and 5.

00:38:43.644 --> 00:38:44.310
Raise your hand.

00:38:48.787 --> 00:38:49.995
OK, how many are you guessed?

00:38:52.521 --> 00:38:53.020
OK.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.340
That's what I thought.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:59.146
OK so, are there poles
in a Fibonacci system?

00:39:03.784 --> 00:39:05.950
How would you convince
yourself there are or are not

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.020
poles in a Fibonacci system?

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.370
Yeah?

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:13.180
AUDIENCE: You can [INAUDIBLE]
as a difference equation,

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.636
so [INAUDIBLE] some
visual representation.

00:39:16.636 --> 00:39:18.510
DENNIS FREEMAN: So you
have to start somehow.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.450
Somehow you want to translate
that graphical problem

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:25.350
into a difference equation or
an R expression or something.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.720
So one way to think about
it is a difference equation

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.090
of this form.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:33.060
At time n, add some
number of rabbits

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.670
that somebody just plunked in.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.500
That's my input.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.780
In the example I showed by
magic, by spontaneous creation,

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.840
there was a pair of rabbits
at the beginning that

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:51.570
didn't obey the rules for that
were true for the rest of time.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.210
That was x.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:58.720
And y of n, also you have to
add in the two previous values.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.490
That's kind of a rule
for the Fibonacci system.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:06.640
And that has the form that
we've been talking about.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.490
It's something that has just
adder's and delays and stuff

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.510
like that in it.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.210
So we can write that
as a functional.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.950
And we get a second
order denominator

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.950
so we see that
there are two poles.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:22.170
And if you find the
roots by the z method,

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.690
you get these funny numbers.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.970
And they're indeed funny.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.490
You get the golden ratio
and you get the reciprocal

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.500
of the golden ratio,
the negative reciprocal

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.670
of the golden ratio.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.520
So that's really bizarre
because we end up

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.622
with this whole pole, 1.618.

00:40:40.622 --> 00:40:42.830
Tell me something about the
response of a system that

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:48.140
has a pole at 1.618.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:49.730
AUDIENCE: It [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:50.870
DENNIS FREEMAN: Diverges.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.749
What about this
one at minus 0.618?

00:40:54.749 --> 00:40:56.050
AUDIENCE: Oscillate.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.460
DENNIS FREEMAN: It oscillates.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.617
So you take diverging
plus oscillating

00:41:00.617 --> 00:41:01.450
and what do you get?

00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:05.900
You get a sequence of integers.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.000
OK.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.208
That's pretty bizarre, right?

00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:13.790
You take diverging
and oscillating

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.150
and you get 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.110
That's pretty weird.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.946
Also notice that
it doesn't behave

00:41:23.946 --> 00:41:25.320
the way we think
about it when we

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.370
think about computer science.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.270
There's no r-squared
growth of anything.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.190
How many operations
is required to compute

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.690
the output at time 119?

00:41:36.987 --> 00:41:39.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
operations.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.641
DENNIS FREEMAN: Depends on
what you mean by operations,

00:41:41.641 --> 00:41:42.540
that's a good point.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:47.801
So if you used a modern
laptop, how many steps

00:41:47.801 --> 00:41:49.050
would the laptop have to take?

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.680
You have to know something
about what's inside the laptop.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.065
These days, exponentiation
is pretty simple.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.930
So you can think about--

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.440
so all you need
to do is raise phi

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:11.080
to the n an add
minus phi the minus n

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.820
and scale them and add them.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.070
So it's a different way
of thinking about things.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.120
That's the point.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.690
So you can think about the
Fibonacci system as a recursion

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:21.460
problem like we
did in 601 or you

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.380
can think about
it as the response

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.380
to an LTI system, a linear
time invariant system

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.440
and you get this kind of a
way of thinking about things.

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.660
OK one more thing
to talk about today.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.200
And that is, what happens
when things are complex?

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.420
You can make a terribly
small change to the system

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.770
functional.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:45.240
Here all I've done is change one
sign from the Fibonacci system

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.330
and the result is complex roots.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:54.950
So what's it mean to have a
system that has complex poles?

00:42:54.950 --> 00:43:01.270
So complex poles, one of
the interesting things

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.390
about polynomial
math, complex numbers

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:06.990
work like any other number.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:10.500
Not surprisingly then, complex
poles in a linear system

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.410
work sort of like
any other pole.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:16.170
The fundamental mode
associated with any pole

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.320
is p-naught to the n.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.340
The fundamental modes
corresponding to a complex pole

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.960
have complex values.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.190
And that's shown here.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.810
We can write-- so we can think
about that system polynomial

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:32.310
that I showed in
the previous slide.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.080
This one.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.085
We can write that
in a factored form.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.345
But now, the roots
are complex numbers.

00:43:43.799 --> 00:43:44.840
This is a complex number.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.280
There's complex numbers
all over the place.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:46.780
Who cares?

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.740
Complex numbers,
they're just numbers.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.120
That's the nice
part about algebra.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.980
So we don't need to
worry about that.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.430
Other than the
modes are complex.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:59.240
So if you try to plot
the mode associated

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.550
with one of the roots
and the other root,

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.160
they have real and
imaginary parts.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.530
So here I'm showing
the real part in blue

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:12.150
and the imaginary part in red.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.960
So each of the fundamental modes
has a real and imaginary part.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.683
That's the only
complicated thing.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:26.240
It's sometimes easier
to visualize the modes

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.600
on a polar plot.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.370
And that's illustrated here.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:34.200
These plots look complicated.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.850
If you think about what they
look like in polar coordinates.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:39.950
If you think about
this p-naught to the n,

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.340
but now p-naught
is complex, just

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:48.260
plot the number p-naught to
the n on a complex plane,

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.610
it's pretty simple.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:55.175
So in this first case,
we have this pole at e

00:44:55.175 --> 00:44:57.590
to the j and pi over 3.

00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:00.380
Gets raised to the n-th power.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.970
And we use trig
and we can come up

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.040
with some expression for that.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:08.330
But forget trig, just remember
the Euler relationship.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:09.530
And that's equivalent.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.350
We can just use this form
to say well, if you had 0,

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:13.740
e to the 0 is 1.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.750
So I'm there.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:18.670
If n were 1, then it would
be e to the j pi over 3.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:19.850
Well, that's there.

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.540
You go up by 60 degrees.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.920
If n is 2, you're over here.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.770
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.510
So you can visualize how
the root is behaving,

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.320
the complex root, by
looking at a complex plane.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.310
That other root works
just the same way,

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.610
except it's negative so it
spins around the other way.

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.330
So it's convenient to watch
the behavior of complex roots

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:41.230
on a complex plane.

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:44.800
That's not too surprising.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.340
What's slightly more
surprising is the idea

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.880
of a real system that's made
out of adders and delays

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.680
and that kind of stuff
generating a complex response.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.700
That's a little weird.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.960
How would that happen?

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.270
Does that mean every
time I build a delay,

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.689
I need to have an output
that is imaginary?

00:46:03.689 --> 00:46:05.230
Or does it sort of
just squirt it out

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.510
into some orthogonal space?

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.260
Or how do you think about that?

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.690
So it's a little weird to
think about the response

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:15.510
of a real system
coming out complex.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:16.350
And they don't.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.650
Systems with real
value coefficients

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:24.930
of the type that could be
represented by a difference

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.270
equation, think about
a difference equation.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.602
If you require that the
coefficients are real valued,

00:46:30.602 --> 00:46:33.060
that puts a constraint on the
kinds of difference equations

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.920
that you can have.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.610
Even though the roots
may come out complex,

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.755
if you started
with a system that

00:46:41.755 --> 00:46:43.880
could be expressed with a
difference equation whose

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:48.590
coefficients were all
real, then algebra

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:57.060
will conspire to make the
sum of the modes be real.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.190
It sort of all
that could happen.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.060
Right?

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.315
So we're expecting that if it
were a physical system, if it

00:47:03.315 --> 00:47:05.190
could be represented by
a difference equation

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.940
with real value
coefficients, how on earth

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.260
could a real valued input
generate a complex valued

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:11.760
output?

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.410
That doesn't make any sense.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.010
And it doesn't happen.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.200
And that's because
things conspire.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.590
So this is just showing
long-winded math

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.710
for those of you who
like long-winded math.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:27.360
The idea is that these
coefficients conspire

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:33.340
as complex numbers so that
for every integer value of n,

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.490
the answer will be real valued.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.820
And what's showed in the bottom
is the unit-sample response

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.150
for that system.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:44.050
And you can see everything's
real valued now.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.050
So last question.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:51.010
Here is the response of
a system with poles, two

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.370
poles at those complex numbers.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:03.470
How do you think about
the values R and omega?

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:07.850
So assume that the poles are
at the polar form of the pole

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:13.340
location is magnitude R,
angle plus or minus j omega.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.400
How do you think
about R and omega?

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.580
So let's say that I
plotted the response here,

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:23.180
can you figure out by
looking at that, what is R?

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.750
Can you estimate R?

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:39.050
R is approximately 1/9
0.9, approximately 0.9.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.890
So if it were 0.9,
how's it go up?

00:48:44.866 --> 00:48:47.850
Hmm.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.630
So it's going around
in that circle right?

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:55.270
So as it's spinning around in a
circle, it's going up and down.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.160
As it's spinning
around the circle,

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.190
the R is also spiraling in.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.900
So the R, R to the n.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:03.400
Right?

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.430
If we think about pole to the n.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.070
The key is always pole to the n.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.480
If we think about pole to
the n, then it's R to the n,

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.280
e to the j omega n.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.940
The R part, R the n is
making it spiral in or spiral

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.850
out, one of those.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:23.390
And the omega part is making it
go up and down and up and down.

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:28.910
So the R here is actually
0.97, because I made the plot

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.250
so I know what it is.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.540
So R is 0.97.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:37.444
That has to do with sort of
a gentle decay across cycles.

00:49:37.444 --> 00:49:39.110
So you could figure
that out for example

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:41.234
by finding the ratio of
that height to that height.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.760
Sort of, how much did the
decay when it came around once?

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.540
So R is 0.97, what do
you think omega is?

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:56.120
Yeah?

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.250
DENNIS FREEMAN: Around 0.5.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:03.380
So what you need to think about
in omega is if you go n steps

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.590
and each advances
the angle by omega,

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.330
how long does it
take to get to 2pi?

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.340
Right?

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.300
It will go around the circle
once when the radiant angle,

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:20.080
when the angle goes
increments by 2 pi.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:24.870
Every time, every step, the
angle is incremented by omega.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:30.645
How many steps does it
take to get to 2 pi?

00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:36.810
That takes-- if I started
here and went to there,

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:42.290
I get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.570
Takes about 12.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:48.650
So 12 omega is 2 pi.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.682
And so omega is approximately,
well it's exactly,

00:50:51.682 --> 00:50:53.390
well, no it's
approximately-- this should

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:59.720
be approximately 2 pi over 12.

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:05.360
6 over 12 by
blackboard math is 1/2.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.120
OK.

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.890
OK there's one more slide.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:13.970
But that will turn out to be a
good question for you to review

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:16.810
as preparation for the exam.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.500
PROFESSOR: Determinism.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.920
And it all begins with photons.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.450
Einstein reluctantly
came up with the idea

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.990
that light was made of quanta--

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.760
quanta of light called photons.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.730
Now when you think of photons,
we think of a particle.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.950
So everybody knew
that light was a wave.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.430
Maxwell's equations
had been so successful.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.810
Nevertheless,
photoelectric effect--

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.550
Planck's work-- all were leading
to the idea that, in some ways,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.560
photons were also particles.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.520
So when you think of a
particle, however, there

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.220
is an important difference
between a particle

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.430
in the sense of Newton, which
is an object with zero size that

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.360
carries energy and
has a precise position

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.170
and velocity at any time, and
the quantum mechanical idea

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.060
of particle, which is just some
indivisible amount of energy

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.530
or momentum that propagates.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.420
So light was made of photons--

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.850
packets of energy.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.510
And a photon is a particle--
a quantum mechanical particle.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.770
Not in the sense that maybe
it has position and velocity

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.980
determined or it's
a point particle,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.560
but more like a packet
that is indivisible.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.920
You cannot decompose
it in further packets.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.140
So Einstein realized
that for a photon,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.960
the energy was given by h nu.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.890
Where nu is the
frequency of the light

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.750
that this photon is
helping build up.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.510
So if you have a
beam of light, you

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.720
should think it's
billions of photons.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.960
And according to the
frequency of that light

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.230
that is related to
the wavelength--

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.520
by the equation frequency
times wavelength

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.980
is velocity of light--

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.470
you typically know, for
light, the wavelength,

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.170
and you know the
frequency, and then

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.330
you know the energy of
each of the photons.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.530
The photons have very,
very little energy.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.010
We have very, very
little energy,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.130
but your eyes are very
good detectors of photons.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.790
If you're in a totally
dark room, your eye,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.090
probably, can take as
little as five photons

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.670
if they hit your retina.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.240
So it's a pretty good
detector of photons.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.170
Anyway, the thing that
I want to explain here

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.550
is what happens if a beam
of light hits a polarizer.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.350
So what is a polarizer?

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.470
It's a sheet of plastic
or some material.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.680
It has a preferential direction.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.440
Let me align that preferential
direction with the x-axis,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.080
and that's a polarizer.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.760
And if I send light
that is linearly

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.940
polarized along the x-axis,
it all goes through.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.770
If I send light linearly
polarized along the y-axis,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.240
nothing goes through.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.830
It all gets absorbed.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.540
That's what a polarizer
does for a living.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.720
In fact, if you send
light in this direction,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.200
the light that comes out
is identical to the light

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.970
that came in.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.590
The frequency doesn't change.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.140
The wavelength doesn't change.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.130
It's the same light,
the same energy.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.170
So far, so good.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.285
Now let's imagine that we send
in light linearly polarized

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:28.500
at some angle alpha.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.520
So we send an electric
field E alpha,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:44.505
which is E0 cosine alpha x
hat plus E0 sine alpha y hat.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.260
Well, you've studied
electromagnetism,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.430
and you know that this thing,
basically, will come around

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.260
and say, OK, you can go
through because you're

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.180
aligning the right
direction, but you

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.910
are orthogonal to my
preferential direction,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.280
or orthogonal I absorbed,
so this disappears.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:24.140
So after the polarizer, E is
just E0 cosine alpha x hat.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.340
That's all that is left
after the polarizer.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.210
Well here is something
interesting--

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.540
you know that the energy
on electromagnetic field

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.640
is proportional to the
magnitude of the electric field

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.900
square, that's what it is.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.390
So the magnitude of
this electric field--

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.860
if you can notice,
it's the square root

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.840
of the sum of the
squares will give you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.430
E0 as the magnitude of
this full electric field.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.660
But this electric field has
magnitude E0 cosine alpha.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.225
So the fraction of power--

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:25.355
fraction of energy through
is cosine alpha squared.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.100
The energy is always
proportional to the square.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.030
So the square of this is E0
squared cosine squared alpha.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.330
And for this one, the
magnitude of it is E0,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.720
so you divide by E0 and cosine
alpha is the right thing.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.790
This is the fraction
of the energy.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.220
If alpha is equal to 0,
you get cosine of 01.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.540
You get all the energy 1.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.450
If alpha is equal to
pi over 2, the light

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.820
is polarized along
the y direction,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.370
nothing goes through--

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.840
indeed, cosine of pi over 2 is
0, and nothing goes through.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.170
So the fraction of
energy that goes through

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:11.530
is cosine squared alpha.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:17.090
But now, think what
this means for photons.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.270
What it means for
photons is something

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.040
extraordinarily strange.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.360
And so strange that it's
almost unbelievable that we

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.520
get so easily in trouble.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.710
Here is this light
beam over here,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.130
and it's made up of photons.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.270
All identical photons,
maybe billions of photons,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.000
but all identical.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.490
And now, think of sending
this light beam over there--

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:01.080
a billion identical photons--
you send them one by one

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.510
into the state, and
see what happens.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.620
You know what has to happen,
because classical behavior is

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.200
about right.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.310
This fraction of the
photons must go through,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.310
and 1 minus that
must not go through.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.680
You see, it cannot be there
comes a photon and half of it

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.530
goes through, because there's
no such thing as half of it.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.820
If there would be
half of it, it would

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.750
be half the energy and,
therefore, different color.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.600
And we know that
after a polarizer,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.740
the color doesn't change.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.410
So here is the situation.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.320
You're sending a billion
photons and, say, one-third

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.780
has to get through.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.350
But now, the photos
are identical.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.220
How can that happen
in classical physics?

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.090
If you send identical photos,
whatever happens to a photon

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.350
will happen to all, but the
photon either gets absorbed

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.150
or goes through.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.390
And if it gets absorbed,
then all should get absorbed.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.490
And if it goes through,
all should go through

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.470
because they are all identical.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.760
And now you have
found a situation

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.290
which identical
set of experiments

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.580
with identically
prepared objects

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.560
sometimes gives you
different results.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.980
It's a debacle.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.470
It's a total disaster.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.120
What seems to have
happened here--

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.460
you suddenly have
identical photons,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.010
and sometimes they go
through, and sometimes they

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.960
don't go through.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.420
And therefore, you've
lost predictability.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.560
It's so simple to show
that if photons exist,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.160
you lose predictability.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.210
And that's what
drove Einstein crazy.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.120
He knew when he
entered these photons

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.070
that he was getting in trouble.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.560
He was going to get in trouble
with classical physics.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.970
So possible ways out--

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.200
people speculate about it--

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.890
people said, well, yes,
the photos are identical,

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.410
but the polarizer
has substructure.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.580
If it hits in this interatomic
part, it goes through,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.370
and in that interatomic
part, it doesn't go through.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.360
People did experiments
many times.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.290
It's not true.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.100
The polarizer is like that.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:29.470
And then came a more
outrageous proposition

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.270
by Einstein and others--

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.540
that there are hidden variables.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.950
You think the photons
are identical,

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.510
but a photon has a hidden
variable-- a property

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.470
you don't know about.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.040
If you knew that property
about the photon,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.539
you would be able to
tell if it goes through

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:53.580
or it doesn't go through.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.740
But you don't know it,
so that's why you're

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.630
stuck with probabilities.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.500
It's because the quantum
theory is not complete.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.360
There are hidden variables.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.490
And once you put the
hidden variables,

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.890
you'll discover the photon
has more something inside it,

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.670
and they are not the same,
even though they look the same.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.440
And that's a hidden
variable theory.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.820
And it sounds so philosophical
that you would think, well,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.760
if you don't know about
them, but they are there,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.790
these properties, how could
you ever know they are there?

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:33.580
And the great progress of John
Bell with the Bell inequalities

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.650
is that he demonstrated that
that would not fix the problem.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:44.350
Quantum mechanics cannot be
made deterministic with hidden

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.870
variables.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.200
It was an unbelievable result--

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.630
the result of John Bell.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.910
So that's something we will
advance towards in this course

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.130
but not quite get there.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.220
805 discusses this
subject in detail.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.620
So at the end of the day,
we've lost determinism.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.320
We can only predict
probabilities.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:24.200
So photons either
gets through or not,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:34.200
and can only predict
probabilities.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:45.390
Now we write, in classical
physics, a beam like that.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:50.650
But how do we write the
wave function of a photon?

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:55.230
Well, this is quite interesting.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:00.410
We think of states of a
particle as wave functions.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.320
And I will call them,
sometimes, states;

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.750
I will call them,
sometimes, wave functions;

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.990
and I sometimes will
call them vectors.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.980
Why vector?

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.380
Because the main thing
you do with vectors

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.510
is adding them or multiplying
them by numbers to scale them.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.910
And that's exactly what you
can do with a linear equation.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:26.540
So that's why people think
of states, or wave functions,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.800
as vectors.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.910
And Dirac invented
a notation in which

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.570
to describe a photon
polarized in the x direction,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.240
you would simply write
something like this.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:44.070
Photon colon x and this object--

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.390
you think of it as some
vector or wave function,

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.020
and it represents a
photon in the x direction.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.460
And we're not saying yet
what kind of vector this is,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.640
but it's some sort of vector.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.640
It's not just a symbol,
it represents a vector.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.410
And that's a possible state.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.280
This is a photon
polarized along x.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.770
And you can also
have, if you wish,

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:16.460
a photon polarized along y.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.210
And linearity means that
if those photos can exist,

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.850
the superposition can exist.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:32.460
So there can exist a state
called cos alpha photon x

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:40.920
plus sine alpha photon y,
in which I've superposed

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.830
one state with another--

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:51.420
created a sum-- and this I
call the photon state polarized

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.550
in the alpha direction.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.440
So this is how, in quantum
mechanics, you think of this--

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.840
photons-- we will elaborate that
and compare with this equation.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.450
It's kind of interesting.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.970
What you lose here is this ease.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.380
There's no ease there
because it's one photon.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.150
When you have a
big electric field,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.950
I don't know how many
photons there are.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.295
I would have to calculate
the energy of this beam

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:23.850
and find the frequency
that I didn't specify,

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.940
and see how many photons.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.550
But each photon in this
beam quantum mechanically

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.040
can be represented as
this superposition.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.980
And we'll talk more about
this superposition now

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.470
because our next subject
is superpositions

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.110
and how unusual they are.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.340
Well the hidden
variable explanation

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.760
failed because Bell
was very clever,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.850
and he noted that
you could design

00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:01.140
an experiment in which
the hidden variables would

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:07.800
imply that some measurements
would satisfy an inequality.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.680
If the existed hidden
variables and the world

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.820
was after all classical,
the results of experiments

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.630
would satisfy a Bell inequality.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.000
And then a few years
later, the technology

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.600
was good enough that
people could test the Bell

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.040
inequality with an experiment,
and they figured out

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.750
it didn't hold.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:35.670
So the hidden variables
lead to Bell inequalities

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.870
that are experimentally
shown not to hold.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.850
And we will touch
a little bit on it

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.710
when we get to untangle them.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:56.640
After the polarizer, the photon
is in the state photon x.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.850
It's always polarized
along the x direction,

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:05.069
so it's kind of similar that
this doesn't go through.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.040
This goes through, but
at the end of the day,

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.060
as we will explain very
soon, the cosine alpha

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.630
is not relevant here.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.480
When it goes through, the
whole photon goes through.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.520
So there's no need
for a cosine alpha.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.900
So that's what goes
out of the polarizer.

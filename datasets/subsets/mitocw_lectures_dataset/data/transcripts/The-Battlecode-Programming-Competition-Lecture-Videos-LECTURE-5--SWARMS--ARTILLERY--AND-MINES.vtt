00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.220
PROFESSOR: So I'll be sitting
down here and showing you

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.970
a whole lot of really
cool videos on YouTube,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.380
and battlecode players that
I have programmed especially

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.440
for tonight.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.730
So here we go.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.220
What's the point here?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.950
The point here is to talk
about the things that

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.350
have been done before in swarm,
and thinking about swarm.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.660
So let's go straight
to a YouTube video

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.600
and look at this animation.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.379
So you can see here, there
will be these birds that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.510
are following the green blob,
and they avoid the red blob.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.460
And what they're trying to do is
match one another's direction,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.920
try to get a certain distance
from the other birds,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.647
and try to avoid obstacles.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.230
And so you can see
how the combination

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.640
of a few simple rules can
create a behavior that's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.590
sort of complicated looking,
or a behavior that's

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.450
somewhat fluid.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.110
Whereas if you
had manually tried

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.060
to get them all to go
in the same direction,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.870
it might have looked
somewhat more rigid.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.870
And it might not have
been able to handle things

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.010
like obstacles.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.230
So let's look at another video
of how this is done in nature.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.880
Now, this is a massive
number of birds.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.110
I think in the video description
it says this is 300,000 birds.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.895
Wow.

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:58.450
And it's so pretty how it
undulates and smushes around.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.340
Here's another view
of the same thing.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.900
I think they'll all take
off in the distance.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.530
Look at how pretty that is.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.890
And the all sort of do it
once, but there's certainly

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.240
nobody in control.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.340
What a pretty-- ah, you've got
to love pictures of nature,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.980
in the evening,
in a lecture hall.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.120
We're about as far from
nature as people can get.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.786
My goodness.

00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:21.050
Ah, that's so pleasing.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.010
When are they going
to show the birds?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.240
I'm referring to the birds
that aren't in the water.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.110
The birds in the air, yeah.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.470
So what we want to
do today is just

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.940
talk about the things
that are recognized

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.720
as elements of swarm behavior.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.190
And then we'll
show how our robots

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.670
can do much better than the
enemy robots if we do it right.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.320
Look at this.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.480
It's almost like two separate
swarms in certain areas.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.980
And it's an interesting
problem to say, at what point

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.542
is it possible to
split into two swarms?

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:53.750
Because maybe one of them
got too far from the other,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.350
or maybe it's just
too gosh darn big.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.280
Or maybe one half of them
are Democrats, the other half

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.650
Republicans.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.550
There are a lot of
reasons that they

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.140
might want to split into parts.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.410
So we'll talk about that too.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.250
Next, we'll talk about crowds.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.550
I mean, this is a thing
that you deal with every day

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.680
when you go to eat
battlecode lecture dinner.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.990
You come up here, and there's
people trying to get to food.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.240
And I guess the food is there.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.060
No, this is a bad example,
because these guys are just

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.900
going to walk
through one another.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.370
And the goal is trying
to get them to anticipate

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.730
who isn't going to be in
the way, and to form lanes.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.520
That was the problem that these
guys were trying to address.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.640
And I guess nowadays
it's becoming

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.600
popular to post your
thesis material online

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.630
and to animate it in 3D.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.380
I don't see why this
is animated in 3D.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.796
You could just
show the same thing

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:47.470
with a two dimensional map.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.570
Now here you're going
to see ripples form.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.590
And that's the expectation path.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.110
And so a small perturbation
in the position of someone

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.780
is amplified into
like avoid this lane.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.050
And here he shows it
again with some lines.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.840
He does it with more people,
because every computer

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.030
scientist knows that more
is better, especially

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.710
when it comes to simulations.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.595
And so he shows a bunch of
them, and how these guys

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:16.519
are going up, those guys
are going down there.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.050
And they sort of
make this vortex.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.230
And I think-- oh, yeah.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:20.730
I remember.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.079
This is really silly.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.010
The end of this
video, you're not

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.450
going to see it coming at all.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.170
You're thinking, all right,
where can he go from here?

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.220
He can show-- so
there's their model,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.030
and there's some
alternative models

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.619
showing that their model is
a lot better because people

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:35.410
aren't bunching up.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.900
So there's these high ES low
and high distance models.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.420
Which basically, the guys are
just avoiding one another.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.070
But in their model, they're
sort of creating a density

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.770
field for an expected position.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.110
I think this is supposed
to be simulating armies.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.760
I guess they want a job
at Pixar or whatever.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.812
And so they just sort
of put this one in here,

00:04:54.812 --> 00:04:56.770
like oh, look at how
realistic your armies will

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.200
look if people at the back
move 10 times as fast.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.980
PROFESSOR: And then
another army is over here.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.960
Because just like I said,
these computer science people

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.560
like nothing more than
to have a lot of things.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.190
I once saw a simulation.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.250
Oh, this was crazy.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.130
It was a simulation
of neutronics.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.202
So this is like
a college campus.

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:20.660
I mean, you could really tell
where this guy's coming from.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.507
Movies, campus.

00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:23.590
And it's like people are
coming from certain doors

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.310
and going to others.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.934
And I think the next shot he'll
show the paths of these people,

00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:29.610
showing that they're not bumping
into each other that much,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.560
and that they're kind
of straightish paths.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.290
Which is supposed to
be very impressive.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.665
But back to my
other story, I was

00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:36.350
watching a neutronics
simulation.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.840
And it had like 2
billion particles in it

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.966
that were all in a lattice.

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:42.381
OK, I'm going to pause this
here when it gets to the city.

00:05:42.381 --> 00:05:43.270
I mean, my goodness.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.720
How more complete do you need?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.850
Once you've seen it,
you've kind of seen it.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.230
But anyway, this 2 billion
particle lattice, which took

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.690
like 10 hours on a
giant supercomputer

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.390
to do this simulation of
damage from radiation,

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.010
from like high energy
particle radiation.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:03.090
And the final result of this
massive simulation that I saw,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.810
it was to show that this
one incoming particle had

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.540
ricocheted in a couple of ways.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.794
And the diagram of
this final result

00:06:11.794 --> 00:06:13.210
from this giant
computation, which

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.990
was like the very end
of his presentation,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.950
because for some
reason people don't

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.610
like to show the graphics first.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.399
They like to tell you
all the words first.

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:20.940
In any case, he
showed me this thing.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.990
And it's like a little
hook or something.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.460
It was really stupid looking.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.740
Oh, my goodness.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.740
Can't believe it.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.180
But no, this guy's
final result is

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.650
going to be much more exciting.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.750
So he's got these
people, and he's

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.240
like, well, this
isn't realistic.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.630
In a real city, there are cars.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.470
So you've got to only
walk on the crosswalks.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.840
And you've got to
avoid certain things.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.550
Maybe you form lanes of traffic
on these crosswalks kind

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.400
of automatically.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.530
Oh, now he's getting more.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.220
He's like, OK, I've got
too much time on my hands.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.034
I better implement stop lights.

00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:53.450
But it's still not
that realistic,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.720
because what if people
get hit by cars?

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.910
There are no cars to
hit people, or to almost

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.430
hit them, or to
scare them and get

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.790
them to jump out of the way.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.730
So now we've got a 3D flyover,
because the only thing

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.940
cooler than having
a 3D environment

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.080
is a slow pan and zoom.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.980
So that's what he's
sort of doing here.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.310
And he puts the cars in.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.830
Obviously, he has
excellent taste.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.870
All the cars are from 1970.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.660
And I guess there's jaywalking.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.160
Oh, right.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.460
This is like a chemical
evacuation or something,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.210
so all these people are
covered in yellow stuff.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.600
And they're running away.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.900
And that's supposed to be really
useful for planning evacuations

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.580
and such.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.080
Yeah.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.290
And everybody else
is just like, OK,

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.320
I'm going to worry about
that three, two, one, now.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.810
And then the other people
start running away, too.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.650
They have really
bad reaction time.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.840
And then this is like, people
are walking in the street,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.950
and how it's messing up traffic.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.840
And it's like, wow,
this traffic is

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.640
almost as bad as New
York City traffic.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.010
Almost as bad.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.900
And then, I mean,
what else can this guy

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.950
do after he's done
this many things?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.055
Well, the last thing
that he has is aliens.

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:08.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.920
PROFESSOR: So there you go.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.300
Just to show that
everybody likes

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.040
to have a little bit of fun
with pathing and navigation.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.820
So let's talk a little
bit about the things

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.430
that we saw in those videos.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.720
and how they apply
to battlecode.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.160
So there's a whole
question of centralized

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.800
versus decentralized control.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.086
And in the ones that we saw,
they weren't centralized.

00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:32.460
So I'm going to
show you examples

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.980
in battlecode of both of those.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.299
Now, those can have
impacts on whether there's

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.620
a radio attack possible,
whether your strategy's going

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.990
to be vulnerable to that.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.880
Whether it's like a
map dependent strategy,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.030
because maybe on a
centralized controller,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.940
it works really well
if it's a tiny map.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.440
But maybe if it's
a huge map, you've

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.060
got to start having multiple
swarms that are independent.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.060
And talking about
distributing information

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.380
is another thing
to worry about it.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.110
So let's consider that
in the boyds model, which

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.520
is supposed to sound like birds
if you have a Brooklyn accent,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.460
they considered several aspects
for computing the next position

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.550
for each actor in the swarm.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.110
The separation of each
one to its neighbors.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.750
The pushing together of each
one, which they call cohesion,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.720
because the smarter
you sound, the more

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.430
Ph.D. Money and grant
money you can make.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.367
They talk about alignment
so that everybody's

00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:35.450
facing the same direction.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.180
Now, that's somewhat
different this year

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.780
than it has been in
past battlecode years.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.220
And then I guess they don't
talk too much about it,

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:49.090
but they considered the later
effects of group splitting

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.100
and lane creation,
which we saw today.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.930
So let's see here.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.420
I showed some examples
of these things.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.660
Alignment this year
is worth noting

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.450
that there used to be a method
where you could take the robot

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.210
info and do dot direction.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.650
You could get the direction
of any robot that you can see.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.140
Now, in this year's battlecode,
there's no direction.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.640
So what are you going to do?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.350
So let's see here.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.760
You can get the distances
for separation and cohesion.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.520
I mean, these are
just a fancy way

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.200
of just saying there's
like a spring between you

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.870
and the others.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.130
And this one is just saying that
you're headed the right way.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.446
There's really almost
nothing complicated to it.

00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:32.820
And we're going to end up
seeing some pretty neat looking

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.780
behavior from very simple rules.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.900
So yeah, let's talk
about how you're

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.570
going to know that you're
facing the right direction.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.690
I mean, you could check
all the neighbors.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.210
Let's see here, face
the right direction.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.690
You could check
all the neighbors

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.700
against all the other ones.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.120
So you'd be checking
to see if robot

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.150
ID number 97 was from this
position, and then that one.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.290
And then you would try
to find where he was,

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.210
and correlate that,
and get the direction.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.910
And then take an average for
all the robots that you can see.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.140
That would be really
computationally expensive.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.410
Another option is
to say, all right,

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.950
take average of
all allied robots.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.500
Or all within a range.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.700
And then see how
that average moves.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.280
So that's like an
implicit direction

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.520
for the group of allied robots.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.500
And then an individual
robot, by doing that,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.030
could see where all of them are.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.430
Another option is just
to radio broadcast

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.720
so that somebody somewhere is
deciding what direction to go.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.650
Or maybe all of them vote on the
direction that they want to go,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.608
because maybe some of
them are close to enemies

00:11:40.608 --> 00:11:42.260
and other ones are
standing on mines.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.600
And maybe they want
to put it up to a vote

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.180
so that they can
wait for 50 turns

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.750
before finding out
which direction they're

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.639
going to go, and end up going
in the wrong direction anyway.

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.430
Or they could have a
recount, and anything.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.800
It could be really fun.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.710
You could do like a whole
political simulation.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.970
So here are some
considerations when

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.140
you're talking about central
control versus the group mind.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.070
Where the central controller,
you'd need a leader.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.510
And so leaders have
to have elections,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:17.640
and they also can die, and
sometimes they get lost.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.400
So those are things to worry
about when you have a leader.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.670
That means that the
headquarters is a good choice.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.700
And so if you can do all of
your computations in one place,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.380
that's much more efficient.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.710
Imagine if you had
to-- every robot

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.170
has all the same information.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.519
But if all of them
make the decisions,

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:43.310
then they all have to
do a lot of thinking.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.900
And in this game, if you
use up 10,000 byte codes,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.500
each of those robots is going
to have twice the power upkeep.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.380
It's going to be
pretty significant.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.610
So you could have the leader
broadcast all kinds of things.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.371
And later on we're going to talk
about some more little details

00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:02.870
of what the leader can broadcast
besides just what direction

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.490
you're going in that can really
save you a lot of trouble.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.430
If you have a group mind,
it's a little different.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.510
You can have a
better site range,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.330
which is to say that
in previous years

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.465
you were limited to just
one robot site range.

00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:18.090
So having a group
mind sort of gave you

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.109
more access to the
edges of your cloud.

00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:23.150
And you could also make
it so that the front guys

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.990
are leading.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.600
Which would be really
useful so that you

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.360
could have them be the
first ones to note.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.760
This year it's not so important.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.821
But in like a real flock
of birds or something

00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:34.570
you might develop after
this, it would be.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.801
You can also broadcast of the
enemy locations in a group

00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:38.300
mind.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.596
There's no reason why a group
mind can't use broadcast.

00:13:40.596 --> 00:13:43.220
It's just a question of whether
you expect to receive something

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.860
from a single entity,
or whether you

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.020
expect to integrate
a bunch of broadcasts

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.210
from a lot of entities.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.540
Broadcasting is becoming
cheaper and cheaper

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.734
now that the read cost has
been decreased from the 0.01

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:58.559
to 0.003.

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:00.350
We've also increased
the number of channels

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.940
in the latest release so
that your broadcasts are

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.170
more secure against
radio attacks.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.240
At least those spanning attacks.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.800
It is worth mentioning
that you should

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.567
be moving your channel somehow.

00:14:12.567 --> 00:14:14.900
Come up with your own algorithm
for shifting the channel

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.880
that you're using.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.850
Something, for example, that
uses the clock round number

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.422
so that you could always be
looking in a different place,

00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:23.130
and the enemy won't
locate which channels

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.150
you're using on the radio.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.360
Which is to say,
which frequencies.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.510
So you might also want
some other features.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.280
So these boyds things with
their separation and such.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.260
What other features do you
want that aren't in boyds?

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.630
So you might want
some in and out motion

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.240
so that everybody takes a
uniform amount of damage.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.220
You might want some
cycling behavior.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.600
You might want to heal the weak
by going back to the med bays.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.310
You might want to apply
shields at shield generators.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.520
Those are encampments
that you could build.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.675
And you might want to make
sure that each robot knows

00:15:03.675 --> 00:15:04.550
the size of the pack.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.350
And if each one only has so
much information, especially

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.180
about the enemy, then they
need to be able to get around.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.180
I mean, this year it's not
so much of a problem again.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.240
So let's see here.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.980
There's sort of an
interesting trade

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.106
off here when you think
about the density of a group.

00:15:21.106 --> 00:15:23.480
But we're doing too much
talking and not enough watching.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.700
Let's watch an example.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.600
So I have some players here.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.200
And swarm one, I'm just going
to pick any old map here.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.970
Let's go to chunky.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.090
Chunky is a map I made which has
just these big chunks of mines.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.930
So here you can see, I've
got my swarm one player.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.360
It's very simple.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.306
It's quite close to the other
players that I showed you.

00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:47.430
It's not that exciting,
because the robots are just

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.930
sort of-- they rush
at one another.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.980
They come together
in the middle.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.660
They go toward one another.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.800
There's not that much
swarm-like behavior.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.300
And when they come
together, they're

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.490
not really doing anything
that intelligent.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.730
Like at this
moment, neither side

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.500
is really being that smart
about what to do with the other.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.440
Here I'm going to do it
slightly differently.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.790
I'm going to have the robots,
instead of just choosing

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.030
a rally point at random at the
very beginning of the game,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.220
and having each robot
compute it individually, here

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.080
in swarm one, I'm
going to show how

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.960
in swarm two,
which is this code,

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.680
we've included the ability
for the headquarters

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.450
to tell the robots where to go.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.820
So you could see--
let's see here,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.600
let's change the
font size so that you

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.510
can see what I'm saying and
follow along in the code.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.550
Font 16, OK.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.480
The headquarter code here is
what the headquarters is doing.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.440
So it does some
spawning soldiers.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.350
And I've got a nice
code documentation here.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.090
And it moves the
rally point from time

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.965
to time, which is to say that
at round greater than 500,

00:16:55.965 --> 00:17:00.180
it just sets the rally point to
the enemy headquarter location.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.410
And it messages allies
about where to go.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.609
So first it gets the
channel from my function

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:05.859
called getChannel.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:11.050
And when I do that, I
say that if I'm team b,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.569
I'm going to have
this multiplier.

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.910
If I'm team a, I'm going
to have this multiplier.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.280
So that when I
calculate the channel,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.630
I do the clock round number
times the multiplier,

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.589
modulo the game constants,
broadcast max channels.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.200
So that means that the channel
that I'm broadcasting on

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.650
is continually rotating,
but because it's just

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.339
based on my team and the
clock round number, that

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:35.630
means that every robot can
still read off that channel.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.650
Still knows where to
look for that channel.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.350
And rotating frequencies is
actually a common practice

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.590
in modern military
communications.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.980
After all, it might not
have occurred to you

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.440
that in the modern military,
they don't just flip open

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.400
their cell phones and then
say, hey General Saxony,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.350
do you want to sort
of attack tonight?

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.560
And the general
goes, yeah, maybe.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.590
I might.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.260
I'm not sure.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.374
Maybe I'll send you an email.

00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:05.790
They often use
radio, because it's

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.090
there's not internet
connection out there

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.110
in the middle of nowhere.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.094
And they have these
rotating radio frequencies.

00:18:12.094 --> 00:18:14.010
So yeah, that's a good
thing that you'll have.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.468
So once you've got the channel,
you need to have a message.

00:18:16.468 --> 00:18:19.220
So here I've written
the message builder

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.880
that converts a map
location to an integer.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.850
So you can see
that function here.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.650
All I do is I multiply
the x value by 1,000

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.120
and I add the y value.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.740
So then both x and y
values are included.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.550
Finally, on that
unpacking side, I

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.190
use this function to
turn the integer back

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.560
into a map location.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.850
It makes life easier.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.930
So then at the robot side,
you can see the result.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.270
So we're going to show
swarm one versus swarm two.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.990
Swarm two has two advantages.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.860
So here swarm two is in blue.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.590
And swarm two has two
advantages, the first of which

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:58.550
is that it receives the
messages from the headquarters.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.490
So it'll go attack at
round 500, rather than

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.430
the round that these guys are
attacking, which is round 200.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.304
So I guess it has sort
of an advantage there.

00:19:06.304 --> 00:19:09.850
And second advantage is, it
doesn't defuse mines in combat.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.940
Some of you may be
familiar with World

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.370
of Warcraft or those type games.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.660
Defusing mines in combat
is like looting in combat.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.840
It's definitely a no-no.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.970
You don't want to-- that's
not how to be a team player.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.440
You could see the result is
that just because you aren't

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.320
defusing mines in combat
where the other team was,

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.990
you end up with almost
your whole army remaining.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.190
What a huge difference.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.820
And then quickly
at round 500, you

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.360
can see that these guys are
successfully receiving a goal.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.450
And here in size
0.001 font, you can

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.810
see that it knows
its current location.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.620
And it has a goal
location which has

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.110
been broadcast from this guy.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.880
So there you can see
a little example,

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.310
but that's not as
exciting as it might be.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.320
Let's consider adding
some distance tolerance

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.210
in go to location.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.900
So let's do that so that
when they go to a location,

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.400
they don't just keep
bobbling around in there.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.540
So that they can actually
start to get work done.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.110
So here, they're
going to location.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.750
And then they just calm down.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.810
And they take their
spot, and they sit there.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.800
Really nice.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.264
And if they're on
a certain tile,

00:20:14.264 --> 00:20:15.430
I even have they lay a mine.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.360
So this is a neato
thing that I thought

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.000
of is if you lay mines not
in a fully dense pattern,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.270
then when the enemy attacks,
you have the opportunity

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.620
to sort of whittle them down.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.430
Because you might
have this situation.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.380
It's kind of hard
to see on this map.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.680
I might take a screenshot
and then work on it.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.970
So let's say that we've
got these mines here,

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.470
and that we intend to use
them in a really clever way.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.090
Yeah.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.410
So let's go here.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.310
Super leet.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.930
Super leet.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.585
So maybe the enemy
is coming this way.

00:20:57.585 --> 00:20:59.210
Now, if they come
here, they can either

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.130
start to defuse the
mines, and they'll

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:05.050
be just waiting on that corner,
or they can infiltrate inside.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.140
Because it doesn't really
present a giant obstacle

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:07.940
to them.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.810
And once they're
in here, I'm going

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.050
to have a big advantage
because I can confront them

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.000
with a lot more area.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.730
Because they're all
so sparsely laid out.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.880
So I think this will
work really well.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.380
And if they want
to retreat, there's

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.380
definitely no way that's
going to work for them.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.929
Because they can't do any real
cycling in this configuration.

00:21:26.929 --> 00:21:28.720
I think it's going to
totally mess them up.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.310
So here in this one, I've got
these guys who are cleverly

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:40.810
not-- they're not going
to defuse mines in combat.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.050
And they'll even sort of back
up and fight over the mines.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.570
So here they're backing
up to the mines.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.680
And they're trying to bring
the fight back to home.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.100
Let's show it with swarm
one versus swarm three,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.610
because then they won't
both have that part.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.180
Oh, wait.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.560
That was pretty one-sided.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.060
Right.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.480
So this is something
that happens.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.690
So here the enemy
is going to show up

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.170
and I'm going to retreat
off the minefield.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.115
So then they're sort of
busy, and I come back.

00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:14.910
And then I retreat
a little bit more.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.100
And they sort of start
defusing and they

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.250
think that's a good idea.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.580
And then I sort of go this
back and forth type motion.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.290
And that kind of thing
can help to string out

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:25.266
the enemies in a line.

00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:26.390
Give me a little advantage.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:32.030
But even still, it's not
looking that much like swarming.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.520
Now, I want to make the point
that a lot of these maps

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.420
are absolutely filled
with these neutral mines,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.710
especially to begin with.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.016
In this map.

00:22:42.016 --> 00:22:43.890
there's so many neutral
mines to get through.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.265
If you were really intelligent,
you could take this path.

00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:48.540
And I'll show an
example later of how

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.560
you could write a player
that really efficiently paths

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.570
through this space for
a whole mess of troops.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.320
So here I'm retreating
past my little minefield.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.830
And then I'm sort of
bopping on forward again.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.900
And he's sort of
poking the dragon here.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.470
He's making me irritated.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.081
And so then-- oh, I'm
just going to kill him.

00:23:07.081 --> 00:23:07.580
Hmm.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.954
But the killing him was less
effective than it might have

00:23:09.954 --> 00:23:12.670
been because a lot of my
guys got stuck back there.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.940
And they didn't know what
to do because I told them,

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.062
please don't defuse
mines in combat.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.520
And it was like
combat because they

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.760
were going to attack
the enemy headquarters.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.540
But nevertheless,
these guys got stuck.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.885
So what am I going to do?

00:23:23.885 --> 00:23:25.260
Well, here's an
alternative where

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.290
you could say each guy has a
certain amount of patience.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.280
And if he's stuck in
one spot, then he's

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.390
going to go ahead and defuse
those mines in combat.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.870
So here, once again, this
pulling back and going forward

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.230
strategy is very effective
against an equally sized enemy.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.590
These minefields are a
wonderful defensive advantage

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.930
that you should definitely use.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.310
So then here, when
these guys get annoyed,

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.874
they can start digging through.

00:23:50.874 --> 00:23:53.290
And eventually, they'll make
it through to the other side.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.840
Which will be pretty
useful in that case.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.730
Let's do another example
versus basic player.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.590
I think this example
demonstrates that tunneling

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.225
effect a little bit better.

00:24:06.225 --> 00:24:08.600
Now, basic player is building
all kinds of useful things,

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.480
like suppliers and generators.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.712
And that's going to make
him especially powerful.

00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:14.670
So it's going to be--
no, actually, I beat him.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.290
PROFESSOR: So that's
a really good example.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.370
Let's move on, and I'm going
to try to beat swarm four.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.550
So swarm four was
like-- well, maybe

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.345
I'll continue beating swarm one.

00:24:27.345 --> 00:24:28.720
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.120
to use guided swarm, which
is a new player that I made.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.340
So this guided
swarm's really neat.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.250
This is a lot more like birds.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:43.930
And the guided swarm's goal, his
goal is to be a little bit more

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.810
puffy.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.020
Yeah, that's him up there.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:47.519
Look at him.

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:48.850
He's like all cloud like.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.380
And he's keeping it real.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.960
What a guy.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.980
So you can see here that the
guided swarm's kind of OK,

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.590
but he's so spread out that
he doesn't do well in combat.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.240
What can we do to make
this guided swarm better?

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.950
What can we do-- I think one
thing that works really well

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.660
is to put him on a map
that's better for him.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.160
So I'm going to put
him on this one.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.200
Now he's a bit farther
away from the enemy.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.200
And my hope is that
he'll have time

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.850
to produce enough
units that he'll

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.610
start laying a big minefield.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.441
Yes, I think that will
help him out significantly.

00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:21.940
Oh, come on.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.710
Please lay that minefield.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.620
Please lay that minefield.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.544
Oh, he didn't have time
to lay the minefield.

00:25:28.544 --> 00:25:30.460
I think what I'll do is
I'll tell him to build

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.824
the minefield just a
little bit earlier.

00:25:32.824 --> 00:25:34.240
I'm going to make
this-- right now

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.960
I've got it-- ooh, don't let
me change the wrong code.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.147
It's so easy to do that.

00:25:38.147 --> 00:25:40.730
You think robot player got Java
is the code you're working on,

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.194
and it is, but you're wrong.

00:25:42.194 --> 00:25:45.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.580
So I was working on
guided swarm one,

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:54.010
and I want the headquarters code
to start building these robots.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:54.880
Oh, yeah.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.910
I want him to research pickaxe.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.560
And once he's
researched pickaxe,

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.850
I told him to tell the other
guys on channel plus 1.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.390
So here you can use your
get channel function

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.890
and then add one,
and now you've got

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.710
sort of a set of
channels you can use.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.490
So I want him to tell the others
to please start laying mines

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.190
as soon as I have
the pickaxe upgrade.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.180
All right.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.260
So that's going to happen.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.080
I'll just make it at this
point, and hopefully that

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.630
will give him enough
time to do it.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.710
Yeah.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.020
So now he's going to
build fewer allied units

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.790
before he starts researching.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.510
Gosh, this is a tiny map.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:38.460
If you can see this accurately,
you don't need glasses.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.941
Yes, that's probably true.

00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:40.440
Ah, right.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.648
So they started laying mines.

00:26:41.648 --> 00:26:43.030
And look at that pattern.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.580
Look at the pattern they used.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.640
Oh, my goodness.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.520
They must be somewhat skilled.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.630
Can't believe that.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.440
Ah, ooh.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.746
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:50.746 --> 00:26:52.120
PROFESSOR: But
you see the point.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.140
The point that I made was
that I found a really neat way

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.330
to make them lay mines
in the right pattern.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.120
Now, maybe you can't
really see that well.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.920
So I'm going to open up
good fashioned Mathematica.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.820
Not that.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.705
Good old fashioned-- not that.

00:27:05.705 --> 00:27:07.080
Good old fashioned--
there we go.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:07.780
Mathematica.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.230
So you can see that this
arrangement, this disposition

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.680
of mine positions, which is
like over one, up two-- I've

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.430
got to zoom in a little bit.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.630
Yeah, if you go over one,
up two, over one, up two,

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.330
this arrangement is going
to totally fill space.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.922
So this is where I've colored
all the adjacent ones in.

00:27:24.922 --> 00:27:26.880
And this is going to mean
that if you lay mines

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.590
at these centers, and you
have the pickaxe upgrade,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.100
then you will be
fully tiling space.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.300
Really useful.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.430
And here I'm going to
give away the trick.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:40.150
You'll be on the right spot
if mod of 2 plus your x val,

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.230
plus 1 times your
y val equals zero.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:48.480
If mod, this number 5-- see
if I change this to like a 7,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.780
then the whole pattern changes.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.400
And you can investigate
different patterns

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.314
by playing around with it.

00:27:55.314 --> 00:27:57.230
And these patterns may
have different effects,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.810
depending on your upgrades and
the positioning of your mines.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.110
And it made me get
kind of a neat idea.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.340
So this is fully dense.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.670
And you could do partly
dense, which is really simple.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.870
You could just do mod i plus j,
where i and j are your x and y

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:10.370
values.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.750
You just do mod 2.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.140
And if that mod 2 is
equal to 1, then that'll

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.182
get you every other tile.

00:28:16.182 --> 00:28:17.764
So no matter where
you are on the map,

00:28:17.764 --> 00:28:19.980
you don't have to start
comparing to your allied tile

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.830
locations.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.390
You don't have to start
doing a whole bunch of really

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:23.348
complicated operations.

00:28:23.348 --> 00:28:26.980
Just say, if my robot
is on this nice tile,

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.370
then go ahead and lay a mine.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.330
Really nice.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.680
And here's an
interesting alternative.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.011
So this one I slightly farther
spaced apart than the one

00:28:36.011 --> 00:28:36.510
above.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.220
This is sort of like knights in
chess, where they can move up

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.240
and up and up, or they can
move over and over and over.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.660
Well here, I've gone and done
it a little bit farther apart.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.650
And the result is this
neato looking structure.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.590
So it's like the
one we did before,

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.480
where we had only done
a checkerboard pattern.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.430
Only now, we have a
lot fewer mines to lay,

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.200
and we still get sort of
this interpenetrated mix.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.040
This can be really useful
for fooling the enemy team.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:09.080
The formula for this
system is 3x plus 1y.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.020
And as long as you
mod that with 8,

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.350
you'll get the answer
you're looking for.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.310
Now, this is sort of
an interesting system.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:18.810
If I change this to 1,
and I change this to 5,

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:23.040
I get the same result
but sort of mirror image.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.640
Just playing around with
this kind of problem

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.200
can be quite enlightening
if you're not

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.630
the kind of person who instantly
sees how these systems work.

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:37.577
So let's do some
summaries, and then

00:29:37.577 --> 00:29:39.160
at the end of the
summaries, I'm going

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.410
to show you a really
awesome player.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.120
A really amazing version
of this thing that

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.067
has the headquarters
telling it where to go.

00:29:47.067 --> 00:29:49.150
So this is going to be at
the very end of lecture,

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.066
I'm going to show you.

00:29:50.066 --> 00:29:51.450
It's the same as
this player that

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.130
just lost this match,
this one up here,

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.740
only instead of being dumb
when the enemy arrives,

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.970
it's going to be smart
about where it puts itself

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.110
with respect to the enemy.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.200
Which is to say that
it's going to avoid

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.620
the enemy unless the
number of nearby allies

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.360
is a really high number.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.890
And at the same time,
the central headquarters

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.930
is going to tell it
to capture encampments

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.630
and to build suppliers
and generators on them.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.610
So you're going to start
to have a player that,

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.670
just from few little pieces,
is starting to do everything

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.630
it needs to do to
start winning matches.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.360
So I'll show that
at the very end

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.605
after I summarize some
of things that I've done,

00:30:25.605 --> 00:30:27.980
and some of the things that
I think you ought to try out.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.780
Because I can put
this code together

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.370
in a certain amount
of time, but I

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.480
can't try every
possible combination.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.460
So let's go straight
on over to here,

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.130
and I want to just talk
about two categories.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.300
Let's talk about the shape
of your system, which

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.210
is to say the cloud.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.970
Let's talk about how
you achieve the shape.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:52.960
And you can achieve it
either using a headquarters,

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.710
and I'll talk about
all the amazing things

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.293
that you can have
the headquarter tell

00:30:56.293 --> 00:30:58.180
the group that you might
not have thought of.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:03.880
And you can achieve it
using this group mind.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.330
So let's do the
group mind first,

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.920
where you could
check the neighbors

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.080
and go to the area
with the fewest.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.490
I sent around some code.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.600
I don't know how
many of you used it.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.860
And it looked like this.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.520
Let me show you my lecture
three robot player release.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.410
It's not incredibly good code,
but you can see the point.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:32.640
So when these guys get
close to one another,

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.730
each one has this list.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.950
And this list shows the
number of adjacent enemy

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:37.780
and allied units.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.620
So that list is
absolutely gosh darn tiny.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.770
So I'm going to go ahead and
do a fancy way of zooming in.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.510
Oh, my goodness.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.970
That's even less legible.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:52.670
That says 22, 21, 2,
0, 0, 1, 12, 23, me 12.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.490
So me 12 means that I
have two allies adjacent

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.150
and one enemy adjacent.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.700
And adjacent this number, these
are eight different numbers

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:07.160
indicating north,
northeast, east, southeast,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.880
and so on, around
the clock directions.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.420
Although not with
12, but with eight.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.620
Yeah.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.040
And it has this many enemies
and this many allies.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.600
And so I've written the code
for you that will do this.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.370
And so the robot
can sort of start

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.820
to make decisions about
who is adjacent to it.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.200
All you've got to
do is start sorting

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.350
how good it is to be next
to allies or enemies.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.920
Like maybe it's
really good to be

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.980
next to a lot of allies
and very few enemies.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.880
Otherwise you want to
be close to few allies

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.838
so that you spread out.

00:32:35.838 --> 00:32:39.920
There are a lot of things
that you can build on that.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.564
So that's why I
included that code.

00:32:42.564 --> 00:32:45.230
So you could check neighbors and
go to the area with the fewest.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.800
You could compare to
neighbor repulsion.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.830
So the repulsion is accomplished
in the following way.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:57.320
So I've written this code
here in guided swarm.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.999
And here's where you are
repelling from the enemies.

00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:02.540
So it isn't just
one way of doing it.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.870
A lot of ways of doing it.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.090
But I've called this
function freeGo,

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:09.180
and it lets you
sort of freely float

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.047
among your various
alternatives of places to go.

00:33:13.047 --> 00:33:14.880
What it does is it says,
all right, here I'm

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.890
starting at my location.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.520
I'll get a direction
to the target location,

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.090
which is like the waypoint.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.370
And now I'm going to
apply a target weight,

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.980
because maybe I really want
to get there if I'm far away.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.530
But if I'm kind of close,
I don't really care.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.835
So now I have this function
called target weight, where

00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:34.230
if my distance squared
is greater than 100,

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.352
I'll call the weighting 5.

00:33:35.352 --> 00:33:37.060
If my distance squared
is greater than 9,

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.250
I'll call the weighting 2.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.520
And if I'm really close, then
I'll call the weighting 1.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.580
So that's sort of giving me
this spring-like behavior

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.240
to get to where I want to go.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.926
And it's going to give
me this gassy behavior.

00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:51.050
So what I'll do is I'll
make a goal location, which

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.060
is not the same as the target.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.822
So that goal location, I'm
going to just add to my location

00:33:56.822 --> 00:33:58.030
this direction to the target.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:02.570
So let's do it on Paint
to give an example.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.600
Because saying words is not
always incredibly clear.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.739
So here's me.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.379
Here's my waypoint.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.290
And maybe here is
the closest ally.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:20.739
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to repel from the ally,

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.480
and I'm going to
attract to the waypoint.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.938
Which means I'm going to end
up having a bunch of guys that

00:34:24.938 --> 00:34:27.260
are having competing
requirements.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.210
Competing requirements
is like everything

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.310
in these kinds of
dynamic systems.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.380
Because in the end,
you'll want to expect

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.989
them to find a balance between
these competing things.

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.962
Because frankly, they want to
do things that are inconsistent.

00:34:40.962 --> 00:34:42.670
They want to be at
the waypoint, but they

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.295
don't want to be next
to their friends.

00:34:44.295 --> 00:34:47.594
So that automatically means
that they can't be satisfied,

00:34:47.594 --> 00:34:48.760
like a lot of people I know.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.380
So you could see here
the repulsion term.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:59.436
So if there are allies, then
it will locate the closest ally

00:34:59.436 --> 00:35:00.810
using this function
that I wrote.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:01.800
Very simple.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.110
And then it will add to the
goal location negative 3

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.800
of the direction to
the closest ally.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.170
so what the heck does that mean?

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:10.375
That's just saying repel.

00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:14.330
So my goal location
started here.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:18.240
And then I moved it toward
the waypoint some amount.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.420
And it would be more
or less, depending

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.890
on where the waypoint
was with respect to me.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.310
And now I'm going to take
the ally direction, which

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.910
is this direction, and I'm going
to subtract that from this.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.610
So now I'm going
away from the ally

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.120
and toward the waypoint,
which gets me this x.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:39.510
So in the final analysis,
this is my new goal location,

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.380
which is the sum of a bunch
of weighted added directions.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.040
And now I'm going to
go that way, which

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.130
is going to get me both
toward the waypoint

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.610
and away from my ally.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:53.040
I mean, on a grid,
this direction

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.640
may have been quite
close to or the same as

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.020
the direction directly
to the waypoint.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.970
But when you keep
doing it over and over,

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.020
those little edge cases where
a small difference makes you

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.530
go one way or the other
start to become significant.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.810
And so you can do it just
simply like this, where you only

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:15.080
care about where the
ally that's closest is.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.710
And you only care
about the weighting

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.970
of where you're going.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.549
But wait just a second.

00:36:22.549 --> 00:36:24.340
There are so many things
you can add to it,

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.110
and that I did add when I
wrote my guided swarm two,

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.540
which is going to
end the lecture.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:36.030
So let's do all the things
that you can repel or attract.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.940
There's enemies.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.630
And you repel or attract to them
based on how many there are.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.060
There's mines .

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.649
And if they're
yours, do you want

00:36:42.649 --> 00:36:43.940
to be right next to your mines?

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.210
Do you want to be behind them?

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.202
Do you want to be sort
of in a clump of them?

00:36:47.202 --> 00:36:48.660
Do want to keep
laying mi-- I mean,

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.580
if you're in a
laying mines mode,

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.660
then you don't really
want to stand on a mine,

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.870
because then you can't lay one.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.390
You're on one already.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:59.999
So [INAUDIBLE] on
your current goals.

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:01.790
So you could imagine
making the following--

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:02.990
this would be so cool.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:04.750
Somebody in this room
needs to do this.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.835
I was going to do it for
today but ran out of time.

00:37:07.835 --> 00:37:08.710
You do the following.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.290
So here's what always
happens when I write players,

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:13.710
is I've got a center,
and people start

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.720
laying mines around the center.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.120
I think you saw
this today, where

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.860
they were laying these mines.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.750
And the mines reached
a certain amount,

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:25.110
and the robots were
only out to here.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.940
And so that was it.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.380
I didn't get any more mines.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.910
But here's what you could do.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.500
You could say, have
the headquarters,

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.150
which might be, say, down here.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.130
Have it say, if-- let's do this.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:38.880
Oh, my goodness.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.010
Watch this.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.879
Oh, uh, uh.

00:37:40.879 --> 00:37:41.670
It's going to work.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.290
It's going to work.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.770
Headquarters.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:52.000
If there are a lot of mines
near the rally point-- and it

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.600
can do this very easily.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.000
You know how to do it?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.220
There's a really,
really handy function.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.730
Don't do the following.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.140
Here's years what you
were probably thinking.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.510
What you might have done is
sense all the allied mines,

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.464
or whatever the function
name is, and then

00:38:07.464 --> 00:38:09.380
parse through that list
and find the ones that

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.260
are close the waypoint.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.380
You don't have to do that.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.950
You don't have to
do that at all.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.930
You can see here in the
documentation under Robot

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:19.830
Controller, there's a
method that really helps.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.410
There's
senseMineLocations and it

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:28.050
will let you specify a
center, a radius, and a team.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.860
So let's put that on here.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.940
So you definitely
want to be using this

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.050
so that all you've got to
do is have the headquarters.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.940
And why would you
use the headquarters?

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.273
Just so that it doesn't have
to be done again and again.

00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:42.930
So the headquarters is going
say, how many mines are there

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:49.170
when this x is the center, and
I'm looking within some radius?

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.650
And you could just expand
the radius turn by turn

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:55.210
to see how many mines there
are until it starts to drop Off

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.760
or you could just like
set it at a given radius,

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.640
or the previous radius.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.226
So yeah.

00:39:00.226 --> 00:39:01.100
Let's do it that way.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.040
And you would say, how many of
my mines are in this circle?

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.649
And so you'd say, if there
are full mines in the circle--

00:39:08.649 --> 00:39:10.940
and you can do that pretty
easily because the circle is

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.290
defined by a radius
squared, right?

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:18.300
So expected mines is
like pi r squared, right?

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.420
That's a number of tiles.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.770
But r squared we already
have, and pi as an integer

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.580
is equal to 3.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.800
And so we can just say the
number of expected mines

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.040
equals 3 times the
radius squared.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.990
And so that's also nice, because
it's a little bit less than pi.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.360
And so if you're like mostly
filled of mines in that circle,

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:43.110
then-- so if the
detected mines is

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:47.830
greater than or equal to
expected mines in a full area,

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.665
then expand the mine radius.

00:39:50.665 --> 00:39:51.920
And you might say, well, wait.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.730
How am I expanding
the mine radius?

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:54.480
Well, here you go.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.410
Here you go.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.770
Right now, the function
looks like this

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.710
for the repulsion
and attraction.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.330
It looks like the following.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:04.660
Oh, I'm going to use this.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.390
Yeah.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:06.220
Like that.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.340
So if this is the
distance x from center,

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.600
and this is the
repulsive force--

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.890
or I think we were attracting.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.620
Yeah, we were attracting
to the center.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.560
The attractive force
was greater the farther

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.860
you got from the center.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.720
But you could imagine--
So that's going

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.500
to push everybody
toward the middle.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.160
But you don't have to do that.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.210
You could just as easily
have the headquarters--

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:33.450
the headquarters could
be telling everybody

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:36.140
by message systems
what this looks like.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.390
And they could
very well tell them

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:40.240
to make it a little
bit more like this.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.670
So let's say that you already
put mines out to this range.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.510
So you've already put
mines here and you've

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.060
detected them using
the headquarters.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.420
So now you want everybody
to show up here.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.020
Well, you could
very simply do that.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.770
All you've got to do is make
the forces look like this.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:57.709
Oh, is that right?

00:40:57.709 --> 00:40:59.000
No, we would want-- Yeah, yeah.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.040
Well, that's the energy.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.520
And the force is this.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.110
The attractive force is this.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.130
So this is exactly a spring.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.070
That's a spring from physics.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:10.000
And that will make them go
toward it if they are inside,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.480
because they will go opposite
the direction of this vector

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.460
from the origin.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.940
And they'll make
it go away if they

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.082
are in the other direction,
and you get the idea.

00:41:20.082 --> 00:41:21.790
So that's a pretty
neat idea, because you

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.000
could have them
spread out in a circle

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.450
and maintain that sort
of positional authority,

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:28.890
as it were.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.650
Very, very cool.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.220
We are also going to talk
about some other awesome things

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.070
the headquarter
can tell them, even

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.120
though our mouths are watering.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.100
Check the neighbors, OK.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.220
We can avoid this.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.180
We can avoid mines.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.400
We can avoid the enemy.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.200
We can do those things.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.350
There's no more direction.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.590
We've talked about that.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:52.740
So now let's go
back a little bit

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.370
and talk about how
the headquarters can

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.670
help you achieve a given shape.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:03.660
The headquarters can signal
when the enemy has artillery.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.040
Now, how's the
headquarters going to know?

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.730
Well, it could
receive the message

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.540
from somebody else
that notices his hit

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.550
points have dropped by 20 or 40.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.240
Or it could just
locate an artillery.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.472
Like if you actually
physically walk past one,

00:42:17.472 --> 00:42:19.430
then you could say there
is an artillery there.

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.737
I should start repelling
my other units.

00:42:21.737 --> 00:42:24.070
They should start spreading
out, because if they are all

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.600
clumped together, they're going
to take a lot more damage.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.220
They're going to take, instead
of 40 damage for just one hit,

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.532
they're going to take eight
splash damage as well.

00:42:31.532 --> 00:42:32.990
And so that's going
to end up being

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.270
an additional five times worse.

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.420
Yeah.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.950
Well, it's going to
be four times worse.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.897
Five times as bad, as it were.

00:42:42.897 --> 00:42:43.980
That's definitely no good.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.330
So yeah, I mean,
that's how you're

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:51.384
changing the shape of your
cloud using the communication

00:42:51.384 --> 00:42:53.050
that you're giving
from the headquarters

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.100
or from somewhere else.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.340
So you could do that.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.370
You can say, when
the group-- and you

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:04.070
could say like average
position-- has arrived

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:07.540
at a waypoint, like at a
waypoint that the headquarters

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.580
has specified, then
go to the next one.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.010
And right there you can start
to fill the whole map that way.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.690
Now, this is a
really crazy trick

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.730
that I think is the bee's knees.

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:21.750
And it's just going to make the
difference between amazing code

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:22.740
and non-amazing code.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.760
So everybody is going to
have had this situation.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.930
And I've had this
situation for a long time,

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.910
but I very rarely--
in fact, I've

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:32.369
never come up with a
solution until just recently.

00:43:32.369 --> 00:43:33.410
And it was the following.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.910
OK, so here's me.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.350
Here's me and here's the goal.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.200
OK I, want to go from
one to the other.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.720
And a lot of times
what happens is

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.450
I've got a large
group of people,

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.810
and they end up splatting.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.880
They just splat, and
then they trickle.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.380
Like this is a little thin
line of trickled units.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.400
And everybody else is
just splatting there,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.525
and they're really unhappy.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.870
Yeah, it's no good.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.325
I think this guy here
has gone to sleep.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.940
I mean, this guy
started to tunnel.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.800
And so he's like
mining in there.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.480
And then when these guys
arrived, he's like, I'm tired,

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.340
I'm going on a workers strike.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.710
So I mean, it's just terrible.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:17.410
So here's an
alternative to that that

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.869
may make the difference
between winning and losing.

00:44:19.869 --> 00:44:21.660
This may just become
the dominant strategy.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.200
I couldn't be more
infatuated with my idea.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.886
And it works like this.

00:44:25.886 --> 00:44:28.660
It works like this,
where I'd say, OK.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.930
I'm headquarters.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.720
I'm headquarters back here.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.780
And I'm telling them what to do.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.694
All I've got it do
is look here, here,

00:44:36.694 --> 00:44:38.610
and here, and I can use
the senseNeutralMines.

00:44:41.204 --> 00:44:42.870
I'll use the
senseNeutralMines, and I'll

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.430
put these as the centers.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:47.710
One, two, three, four.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:48.950
OK, five.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:51.590
And these are the directions
that the whole swarm

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:52.250
could move.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.920
And I'll say, OK, this has
seven mines and this has two.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.980
No, this isn't realistic.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.870
They all have zero.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.140
OK, they all have zero.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.640
Right?

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.857
But then once I move down a
little bit-- come on Paint,

00:45:02.857 --> 00:45:03.440
come on Paint.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.240
Help me out here.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:04.420
OK.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.210
Now I moved down a
little bit, and now

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.020
some directions really look bad.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.020
So what I can do is
tell the whole swarm

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.500
to follow a waypoint set that
looks like a giant robot.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.670
Not like a gundam, no.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.600
Like one unit of robot.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.040
So the whole swarm
becomes one big thing

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.040
that can all path
around the object,

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.390
because I've down
sampled the terrain.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:26.610
This down sampling
idea can extend

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:30.330
to full search and
pathing algorithms.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.920
So you'd split it up like this
or so, something like this.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.670
They can be overlapping
or non-overlapping

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.000
down sample boxes.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.170
You can use blur
or other features

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.180
as standard concepts
in computer science.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.780
So that you can
start to do pathing

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.440
on a much simpler matrix.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.211
And this can get you to
your enemy like leagues

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:48.710
faster than you
would otherwise get.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.544
And if you use a heuristic,
then it doesn't even matter.

00:45:51.544 --> 00:45:53.210
Let's say there's
like a few mines here.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.770
Well, maybe you'll just
barrel right on through.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.630
If you can just compare
to the amount of mines

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.350
that you're going to
find here versus here,

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.330
what better way to
make that comparison

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:06.130
than to count mines in
a giant area like this?

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.090
And these giant areas are going
to be so computationally simple

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:11.700
for you to compute, because
it's just one function call.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.610
And I believe that function
call only costs you like $100.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:17.140
And by dollars, I
mean byte codes.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.490
So this has been a summary
of a bunch of types of swarm,

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.630
but it hasn't been a
complete summary yet, has it?

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:25.970
Because I told you I was going
to show you that amazing code

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:26.580
that I wrote.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:30.180
And this time I may or may
not be being facetious.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:34.540
And that amazing code where
I've made this guided swarm two,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.390
and I'm going to play it
against a basic player on maybe

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.720
a couple of maps.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.790
Basic player is not
horrible, I guess.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.490
I don't really know
how good or bad

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.510
we are expecting to
claim that it is.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:48.890
But let's go ahead
and show this match.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.860
So here I've got
guided swarm in red.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.270
And he's starting
out by building

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.234
a checkerboard pattern of mines.

00:46:57.234 --> 00:46:59.650
And what he's going to do is
when he encounters the enemy,

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.219
he's sometimes going to just
rush straight at the enemy.

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.510
Other times he's going to
sort of back up and then only

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.560
fight at the right time.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.311
In this example, it looks
like he was destroy-- oh.

00:47:10.311 --> 00:47:12.560
Well, the enemy built artillery
right next to my base.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.268
It doesn't count.

00:47:13.268 --> 00:47:15.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.500
PROFESSOR: OK, OK.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.920
This one, here I am
down in the bottom left.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.850
I'm going to get ready
to research pickaxe.

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.456
I'm going to do it.

00:47:22.456 --> 00:47:23.830
And then when I
research pickaxe,

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.497
their mining pattern
is going to change.

00:47:25.497 --> 00:47:27.038
They're going to
spread out, I think.

00:47:27.038 --> 00:47:28.870
Or maybe-- I might not
have implemented it.

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.400
Well in any case, it's there.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.150
It sort of exists in my mind
that I'll do that sometime.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:37.190
So what I'll do is
when they arrive here,

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:38.560
I'll totally mess them up.

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.620
They're going to show up.

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:41.300
I'll back them up
just a little bit.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.040
And then they're going
to be on my mines

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.123
and they're going to have
nothing to say about it.

00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:48.960
They're going to just-- they're
going to-- oh, so there I go.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.460
There I go.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.080
I'm starting up to move out.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.210
I'm starting to
continue to build mines.

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:55.872
And I'm going forward.

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:58.455
I don't know that-- I think he
doesn't have really any robots.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:02.200
Yeah.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.690
Yeah, super effective.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:04.850
Oh my goodness.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:06.120
That was fantastic.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.260
I'm actually going
to do-- I wonder

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.460
if it is working
as I was expecting.

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.115
So in this one,
I'm going across.

00:48:12.115 --> 00:48:15.960
And when the enemy shows,
what I'm hoping is-- oop.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.830
It already ended.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:17.360
Yes.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.840
I'm hoping to sort of
back up just a little bit,

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.420
and then take them on.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.282
No, it looks like I
just run straight in.

00:48:24.282 --> 00:48:25.637
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:25.637 --> 00:48:27.720
PROFESSOR: Well in any
case, I sort of spread out.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.240
I made this neat little pattern.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.210
I'm starting to take
these encampments.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:32.250
It's getting done.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:33.100
I'm doing it up.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.520
Making it happen.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.620
I take the other side.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.289
I take more encampments.

00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:39.330
And then I just sort of--
because these are like,

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:42.250
now I've got better
production than he has.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:44.511
I'm going to cast
these games this well

00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:45.510
when we have the finals.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:46.562
It's going to be great.

00:48:49.264 --> 00:48:50.180
I'm making more units.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.030
Oh, look at this.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.490
Do you see this like micro?

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:55.802
I'm backing up a little
bit, letting them do it.

00:48:55.802 --> 00:48:57.260
I'm do some micro
here, making sure

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.599
that I outnumber the
enemy before I go in.

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:01.640
I'm not keeping it so
spread out as I was before.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.556
Some guys are doing some
important philosophy.

00:49:03.556 --> 00:49:05.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.100
PROFESSOR: And those
philosophical results

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.930
just very well may
make the difference

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:12.350
between our salvation
as a species and not.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.540
Thank you very much for
attending this swarm lecture.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.040
Next lecture will
be about strategy.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.890
And I hope you enjoy
the Indian food.
